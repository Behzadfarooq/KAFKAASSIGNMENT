<p>'<b><i>ALAM LOHAR'</i>: <i>The True Legend Of Punjabi Folk Singing.</i></b></p>
<p><i>HISTORY</i></p>
<p>Alam Lohar was born in 1927 in a small village of Aach Goach, Punjab. Born to a traditional Moghul caste black smith (Lohar) family that follows a historical link to the Moghul Empire. From the early age of six Alam Lohar use to listen to small gatherings in his village where old traditional Punjabi folk stories and Punjabi poetry such as Heer, Mirza Sahiba, Sohni Mahival, Saif ul Malooq, Sassi Punoo, Waris Shah, Baba Bulleh Shah just to name a few were read and sung by local villagers. In relation to this Alam Lohar started to develop an interest in listening and acquiring knowledge about these Sufi Saints and Folk tales. From the early age of 9 Alam Lohar sang infront of some elders in his village, and it was from this historical point that the first great international Punjabi folk singer started his career which spanned from the mid 1930's up till his unfortunate death in 1979 from a car accident near Sargodha by Lahore.</p>
<p><i>RECORDINGS OF ALAM LOHAR</i></p>
<p>His first recording was with EMI-HMV Pakistan at the tender age of 11 and from this point on wards he became one of Pakistans most recorded singers with over thousands of songs released on LP format. To his credit he received 15 Gold LP disc awards for ever green songs such as Saif ul Mulooq (1956): Mirza Sahiba (1960): Heer (1962): Jugni (1965) just to name a few. He was the first person to introduce folk tales such as Heer or literature such as Saif ul Mulooq in the format of a song. In relation the word JUGNI was introduced by Alam Lohar to the Punjabi language in 1965, the word means 'jaagneewaleh cheeze' and stands for a persons understanding of the world, needs or aims, for example Alam Lohar sings: Awwal naa Allah da leyheye, te fher darood nabi nuh kaheyee, hur dham aajeezee wich raheyee, pher mera akh jugni kehndee yeh jehra naa Allah da lehndeyeh, pher mera akh jugni. This word and song of Alam Lohar has been sung and used by many singers throughout the world.</p>
<p>In addition to his success he use to travel far and wide throughout Punjab and the world, being the first Pakistani singer to travel out of Pakistan. Singing at melas, mandis, sufi shrines, cultural days, Vaisakhi and Eid festivals is well accomplished by this singer.</p>
<p>Throughout Punjab Alam Lohar has sung from dusk till dawn and without limited sound systems, in some situations were access to sound systems was limited he use to sing with no mikes or P.A systems just by the use of his powerful voice. In addition to his unique style of singing and performing Alam Lohar has many qualities that are lacking in many singers, one of those is that he was a great poet and this is illustrated in many of his songs.</p>
<p><i>CHIMTA</i></p>
<p>Further to this Alam Lohar was a great and established musician that introduced the world to the instrument of the CHIMTA (tongs): He use to sing and play this unique instrument at the same time, this tradition is inherited by his son ARIF LOHAR, who is also an established and famous folk singer today.</p>
<p><i>SINGING STYLE AND MEDIA</i></p>
<p>His singing variations were very strong, he had a powerful voice where he could reach high pitched notes without any difficulty: In essence if you listen to Alam Lohar's singing style of Mirza Sahiba he sings at a very high note that is very difficult to reach. Alam Lohar also introduced singing with the instrument referred to as the 'jhori' or also known as the algoza. This instrument of the algoza or jhori was also used in Alam Lohar's famous creation JUGNI in 1965.</p>
<p>Due to the advent of state television in Pakistan (PTV) Alam Lohar became one of the most visible artists of his generation, in addition to this he also featured on United Kingdoms BBC programs on many occasions in the 1960s and 1970's. He has also featured on many Lollywood films and achored his own television program on PTV called 'IK LOHAR DEE' which was a great success and was also the platform for introducing many singers. In addition in the 1970s Alam Lohar was the most listened to singer on Pakistan Radio.</p>
<p><i>ACHIEVEMENTS</i></p>
<p>He has performed in all parts of the globe and has a large international following, even to this day 30 years after his passing away. He has achieved many awards in his life time such as the INDO-PAK award for lifetime achievement in Punjabi folk singing, received a medal for his performance at the silver jubilee for Queen Elizabeth II event in Birmingham in the 1970s, in addition he was given the title of SHER-E-PUNJAB by the government of Pakistan in 1974, also he has received the Pride of Performance Award in 1979 for his achievement in folk singing, this is the highest award for a civilian in Pakistan in the field of arts.</p>
<p>He had a great friendship with the Former President of Pakistan General Zia Ul Haq: who was also a great fan of him, Bollywood film star Dharmender was also a big fan: He had a great understanding with Indian folk singer Ustad Lal Chand Yamla Jatt and with Madame Noor Jehan, Alam Lohar met Mohammed Rafi Sahib (who is originally from Lahore before the partition) in Saudi Arabia on the religious event of Hajj: in Medina they both sang a naath in remembrance of prophet Mohammed (PBUH) which was greatly appreciated by many people at the time. Mehndi Hassan sahib also use to listen to Alam Lohar sahib and has travelled to many of Alam Lohar's performances in melas.</p>
<p><i>LEGEND</i></p>
<p>Alam Lohar was a pioneer in the field of folk presentation and Punjabi singing and had a unique style that has and is influencing many singers throughout the world. He is remembered as a tradional Punjabi folk singer that will never die and his millions of fans can bear witness to this today. His legacy will live until the end of time.</p>
<p>May God have mercy upon his soul. Rest in Peace.</p>
