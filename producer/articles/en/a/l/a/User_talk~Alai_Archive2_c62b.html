<p>I do not want to get into an edit war on this page, but am getting frustrated with the POV on things people have no business refuting, when there is research in some areas and not in others. Theories are theories - things are complex enough. Suggestions on how to handle better? -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 05:35, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One solution might be admitting that there are other valid points of view than your own, and that these points of view must and will be represented on that page. - BeeHonest 05:45, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nice to know you are tracking my edits, regardless of your username - and I completely agree with your statement - I realize that there are more points of view than my own - but that particular page has been pretty heated the past few days, and when you add in information without documentation, it can quickly become an issue. Having had to mediate on a few heated discussions on other pages, I'm fully aware, of what is happening and I think a non-LDS point of view from a trusted editor such as Alai and Tom can be helpful in my situation. I've added in your link from the talk page to the article - it should be there. I am also aware of the available research in the field. My only point is to show that there is little formal scholarly conclusions on the matter - and support for both sides of the argument. The studies we both referenced are valid.</dd>

<dd>Alai - if you can comment when yuo get a mintue, it would be much appreciated. In the mean time, I think i'm going to wikiholiday soon. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 06:17, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If your inference/implication is that I've edited that article under more than one username, it's a mistaken one. Reverting additions is not an appropriate first response to information that displeases you. The studies you cited are certainly a variegated lot, some from academic journals and others of no academic import whatsoever. I look forward to your clarification of which of them you think supports the idea that mtDNA patterns have demonstrated Israel's colonization of the New World. Probably on the appropriate discussion page. - BeeHonest 06:24, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No calling of re-inforcements - just requesting advice on how to cool down after a heated wiki day and think some mediation of recent edits is needed by an outsider. Alai is the most nuetral person I know on these sort of matters. However, since you seem very familiar with wikipedia you probably recognized this. I am going to wikiholiday this article for now, as I realize I'm too involved in the debate to make any constructive edits - I don't want to be an iconoclast.

<p>Thanks for letting me know - I will watch the comments - I think that using the Church for the theological concept as described is no different than the theological concept that the Catholic Church is the Church because it has priesthood authority - both are based on a theological concept pushing a POV - but since I have a horse in the race - I believe that CJC has priesthood authority and is "The Church" I am going to wait on commenting - however, as I stated before - I think on Wikipedia all should be referenced as "the church" since the important thing is to identify the antecedent noun using shorthand and "the church" works for that purpose just as well as "the Church". Likewise for the body of christ - the church - it should be clear from the context that the church refers to the body of christ or the sentence needs to be rewritten.

<p>Hi, Wesley (Cc:Alai and Sam Spade). We have a new user <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegasbright_dbd5.html" title="User:Vegasbright">User:Vegasbright</a> at the <a href="../../../l/d/s/WP%7ELDS_7c0c.html" title="WP:LDS">WP:LDS</a> project who is absolutely sure all of us True Believing Mormons at the project are out to squelch him. We'd really like to groom him as an important POV addition to the project (like you, Alai, John Hamer, and now Sam Spade), and I would personally hate to lose him. But he seems impatient and pessimistic about the whole thing, and he is having a hard time understanding that this is not a blog site, that we have to use our best writing. I suggested he should rub shoulders more with you and the other non-LDS project participants, but I guess it hasn't happened. Anyway, if you drop by at his user page and his personal blog you will get an idea of where he is coming from and perhaps you will think of somehow you can put an arm around him and help him scheme against all of us closed-minded True Believing Mormons. Thanks beforehand. Cc:Alai and Sam Spade. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Tom Haws</a> 05:14, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey there. Not sure if Tom was being sarcastic but he's pretty accurate in believing that I see the TBM's as not being objective. Keep in mind that I respect their opinions but I do not honor declarations of truth where they are not warranted. If you feel otherwise please inform me how you feel. --<a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegasbright_dbd5.html" title="User:Vegasbright">Vegasbright</a> 07:07, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Radiant has a fair point that I should either vote for all open RfAs or none - and I have corrected that for now. I'll try to remember that in the future too.</p>
<p>I explain on <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_admin_criterion_1c70.html" title="User:Jguk/admin criterion">User:Jguk/admin criterion</a> why I see it as being relevant: it demonstrates good writing skills, knowledge of WP practice and collaboration (to some degree). All these are good skills for an admin to have. You can argue there are other skills, some of which you may see as more important than those, but remember I am but one vote. And surely my criterion has benefits over the mere edit-counters? Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:28, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

As to the edit summaries: I simply wanted to quote the text of the ruling so that all those who reverted my edits on sight and wanted to start a revert war know, that they can't win such a war. Fortunately, this policy apparently works since people started to discuss the matter rather than blind-reverting. I'm sorry if you consider it to be a spam, but for me it was the simplest way to avoid revert wars. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 19:29, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The spelling2 project (to work on secondary namespaces) was opened and finished. Progress charts will be available soon.</p>
<p>Version <i>six-three</i> tracks who made the edits, and rankings are available. Much of the work was done while I was asleep, explaining my <a href="http://humanbot.joeyday.net/enwiki/stats.php" class="external text" title="http://humanbot.joeyday.net/enwiki/stats.php" rel="nofollow">low place</a>&#160;;).</p>
<p>The next project, which may even be released today, will probably fix incorrectly capitalised headings, particularly "See Also" and "External Links".</p>
<p>The mailing list has grown to 24 people and while that is very nice for my ego, it is rather difficult to send out updates. This is why I did not send out a notice that the spelling2 project had opened.

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Thanks for the discussion on how to clean up my post. I am sorry I have not had time to chech it since first I asked.</p>
<p>I am actually in a litigation where I was treated unequally by a Native supervisor and was retaliated against for my complaints. The hostile work environment I was in prevented me from doing my job and resulted in a a suspension of an international fishing agreement.</p>
<p>My persuit of remedy has not been of ill will but I have had to endure every sort of ill willed retaliation imaginable including abuse of process and threat of gang like violence.</p>
<p>I am from Oklahoma and grew up with many Native American Friends. In Alaska I have had a glass ceiling established by a supervisor who has a chip on his shoulder. He also has a history of attacking women, creeping into girls cabins while they sleep. He coerced me to transfer shortly after an investigator flew in to our remote workplace to ask him about a rape and murder where he went to school. Yikes!</p>

<p>Thanks for the message about the stub, I've replied at the stub Discoveries page. Without the heads-up, I would probably never have seen that anybody was concerned about the stub (except until it was deleted or something). I've already fleshed out the category a bit, it now has approx 25 stubs. More will hopefully follow soon, as time allows. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 16:49, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alai - I see you jumped early and created Wiltshire-geo-stub.

<dd>Don't mind at all! That was <i>quick</i>! Keeping a spreadsheet of the "grouped" geo-stubs is very useful when moving things to a separate category. As for moving from UK-geo to England-geo, yes, I've been picking off 25 or so a day, and I know several other people are doing the same (<a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaga_City_3d30.html" title="User:Saga City">user:Saga City</a> moved a huge batch of them a few days back).

<p>Absurdistic follows from my last comments to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28disambiguation%29_cd84.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)">Victoria of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)</a>. There's no real "page history" to protect, and Arrigo knows that.

<p><br />
The problems with Arrigo are of a completely different nature, see, for instance, <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancis_Schonken_Arrigo_disruption_8c4a.html" title="User talk:Francis Schonken/Arrigo disruption">User talk:Francis Schonken/Arrigo disruption</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html#Hi_Scimitar.2C" title="User talk:Scimitar">User_talk:Scimitar#Hi_Scimitar.2C</a>.</p>

<p>Hi Alai, I saw that you have written the following, regarding this issue, on the usertalkpage of <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">User:Francis Schonken</a>: "Can you tell me why swapping the "Victoria" disambig pages is an "absurdistic" suggestion? It strikes me that you and Arrigo are in dispute about two things: which title the disambig page should be at; and which page history that page should have. I've already stated my general agreement with you on the first point. The second, while I feel it's largely immaterial, would be taken care of by the move/swap. (In the hopes that Arrigo's objections might be partly mollified thereby.) What's the problem? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:59, 20 September 2005 (UTC)".<br />
In my judgment, your request is the best thing to do in this situation in order to have the result you desire, and by filing it, you acted very correctly. I understand that Francis has not received any permission from you to remove that request. Also I support the process of your request and I do not consent to its removal. There are some policies against disrupting a request poll and I think Francis is working now squarely against the spirit of those principles. I encourage you to continue with your quite proper move request. We should not be intimidated by users who (despite own denial) may be gaming the system by all sorts of disrupting edits. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 11:33, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alai, if you want to have a vote at all cost and <i>against all wikipedia policy recommendations in that regard</i>, then probably yes, you should probably be able to have that vote, against all odds. The "swap" vote proposed by you would however not solve a thing, while that is even in the remotest sense not the issue at hand. It's not about which page history should be attached to which page. It's about whether the "Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom" page should be a redirect to "Victoria of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)" or the other way around. So if the pages (and their histories) would be swapped, that would still leave *exactly* the same issue: should "Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom" be a redirect to "Victoria of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)" or the other way around.</p>
<p>There is no issue <i>in the remotest sense</i> of page histories needing to be preserved. Arrigo was blocked 24h as a result of the page history of "Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom". He could as well have been blocked as a result of the page history of "Victoria of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)". That block is finished, it's not as if he could be blocked a second time for any of these two page histories. So I don't see any of these pages in the remotest sense still being relevant for whomever. Certainly not to me. As I said several times: the only issue is which one should be a redirect to the other. There even was never a copy of content from the one page to the other. They were filled with near-to-identical content almost simultaneously a few days ago, the ones working on the one page not knowing that the others were filling the other page. So, accidently, redundant double content (existing in *four* disambig topics) came into being. In that case pages should be <i>merged</i> (which is "fictional" in this case, while they're just disambiguation for the four identical royals, + a less important note on one of the two), and one of the two pages should be a redirect to the other. Swapping their histories is not part of the solution of that problem. First it should be established which should be a redirect to the other. Than it should be assesed what <i>method</i> should be used: as all the merging of histories and the rest is just fictional problems, just make one a redirect to the other, problem solved.</p>
<p>The rest is Arrigo making people lose their time, and is as I conclude, also your time. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 16:45, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Again, if your proposed solution were only part of a solution, even if that solution were no more than an "appeasement" of Arrigo, I'd gladly agree with whatever you propose.</p>
<p>Again, <i>what you propose is not even in the remotest sense contributing to such solution</i>: what you propose is a useless swap. Even if that useless swap would be performed the problem would be *exactly* the same. Because the page with the <i>content</i> would be turned into the redirect, and the swapped <i>redirect</i> page would be filled with the content. And then the game can start anew, while that would require to <i>reswap</i>: again a vote, again switching content of content page and redirect page by copy-paste, again a vote, again switching content of content page and redirect page, etc..., etc...</p>
<p>One of the two pages has been a redirect page 99% of it's life, moving that page somewhere else and then filling it with content is utterly nonsense.</p>
<p>The guideline on moves disadvises performing these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>copy-paste content from one page to another</li>
<li>make the old page a redirect to the new page</li>
</ol>
<p>What you propose:</p>
<ol>
<li>make a page a redirect to another page</li>
<li>then fill the new page with the content that was formerly on the first page</li>
</ol>
<p>Which is exactly the same, and not solving a thing.</p>
