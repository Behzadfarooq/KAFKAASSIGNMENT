<p>Alai, when possible (I know we are short on time), I think it would be kind and wise to be nice to anons by avoiding wholesale reversions of large-scale edits if there is anything salvageable in them.

<p>Alai, I appreciate your contributions to the Latter Day Saint Movement project - I hope you join the project to give a nice non-LDS view to the project members' contributions (I'm only guessing you are not LDS, but if you are, please correct me).

<p>It was probably an objectively good delete, but I was a bit puzzled at the sudden disappearance of 'Slann (Warhammer 40,000)'. I only noticed it when doing a watchlist-list (as it were), then spent ages trying to find out where it went. Wouldn't it have been more policy-compliant and more "least surprising result" to have listed it for on votes for deletion? (Might have helped straighten out which of the two is the correct spelling, which I'm still lost on...) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:28, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not clear to what threshold of edit-explaining you're suggesting operating, here.

<p>Certainly, though I am far from an expert (actually, I'm highly ignorant when it comes to surrealist and otherwise art – except for music, that is).

<p>Appreciated your greet and offer of help... Regardless of how all this works out...on my word,I promise that these people are 1)internationally distributed;2)are honest and of good repute;3)are familar with Keith Wigdor's art;4)many at varying levels are commercial artists-this ranges from lowend to highend;and by lowend I primarily refer to some who are parttime commercial artists....Alai,in my honest opinion these are the very people who could provide you with critical estimations of his work... Further-I have never met Keith Wigdor in person my life...but I am actively in circles that know of his work... So honestly I'm quite confounded...It is only natural that I should be framing opinions based on my first experiences here...Is Wikipedia interested in preventing new intelligent artists from 1)joining;2)expressing their opinions?..are you some established enclave that rather than pursuing the objective development of this lexicon...is going to rather prefer staunching any influx of opinions to which they have not previously been exposed?...It is apparent that you guys opt only for your small circle...that is a shame...because the declaration of purpose seems noble...in practice you are doing the opposite...No new voters allowed?How do you propose to learn the first thing regarding what you are condemning?This is a writing site per se...Not a network of artisans...why not allow a network of artisans represent opinions regarding him?If you're not openminded to this then the issue ended before it began...how sadly stale for this site if it is a crossection of narrow cliques.. These people,and their numbers are more than you might guess...are exactly the opinions you professed wanting to sound out on his work...why the charade of this hearing...just announce that your group has become a closedminded olligarchy,impenetrable to all but a small enclave...and in that sense your internet work will by exopansion become relevant to no one... If you want to learn about the body of his work,allow people in who will have relevant things to say about it...If not,then just become a small community of silly ostriches with their heads buried in the sand... I hope you honestly meant that you wanted some objective inputs Alai.</p>

<p>Dear Alai, would you please be so kind as to give me advice on how to start a Vote for Deletion for an article. First, I want to thank you for all your feedback, I am sorry for the past rude remarks towards you, (that was unnecessary of me) and I know that your main concern is maintaining the quality of Wikipedia and in the long run, that is a Win=Win for everyone. I do acknowledge that you are really sincere in your research and again I do thank you for even providing discussion where it is needed. Your concerns over notability are of a valid concern, since it is Wikipedia policy. That fact cannot be avoided. Alai, what do I do about starting a Vote for Deletion on articles that do fall under the category for Vote for Deletion. I would like to move on as well and avoid any problems in the future as well, but there are articles here on Wikipedia that really do not belong on here and I need your advice about starting a Vote for Deletion. Thank you.24.168.67.238 14:39, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No,your first assumption was right...my first long comment to you however led me to note people on your sheet having congratulated you,etc...to which I obviously had an averse reaction...Your long thought out comments to my talk sheet were read only after that...and they impress me...They impress me w/sincerity-which I very much appreciate it...and they offer insights that I believe genuinely give me some rounded insights of what is going on at this site...And I here offer you my thanks and appreciation for them...and I assert that in comments from henceforth I will bear them in mind...because I am certain they are far beyond(or rather completely beyond) anything you are required to do,and I appreciate them as such...I apologize if anything I have said in the heat of the edit arguments has given you any offense...I am just heading to edit sheet now,where I anticipate I'll find you pounding me with some laissez aux faire mortar shots..lol!Thanks again for your explications...gmonkai.</p>
<p>Is lining out a prior comment preferred technique(so that the evolution can be seen)?...How is this done,if I may ask?</p>

<p>Reading all the Wikipedian advice,policies on RfC for usernames it was suggested to afford the individual an opportunity to change their username by adding this to their discussion page,so I have done so...noted that Gamaliel has also placed a warning for "Keith-Wigdor" to respond to allegations that he is an impostor.

A question Alai,can users see what one's individual edits have been if left unsigned?..as for example my adding to the "Melchizedek" classical listing(and not the as used in the Mormon Church)..."the contraction of the Hebraic words "Malachi"("Lord king")and "Tzadiq";with annunciations varying according to Akthanishtha and Sephardic variations"?I ask out of curiosity,as my motivation naturally was only in improving the body of the piece...Just trying to learn about how much we can see of one anothers additions here.gmonkai.</p>

<p>Hello Alai,</p>
<p>I will read those pages you sent me, I would like to become a good contributing member of wikipedia. Is it alright to have discussions on the talk page like that or are the talk pages strictly for making the article better?</p>
<p>Perhaps I got carried away on the Ward Churchill talk page, but the prospect of a new Mcarthyism arising and purging American Universities has really been bothering/scaring me lately.</p>
<p>The reason I had put those comments under the talk about art plagiarism is because the only reason the art plagiarism is an issue, and the only reason you and I have heard about it is because of the 9/11 essay. I guess theres old enemies of Ward, but Fox news is the one framing the issue and trying to get him removed.</p>
<p>Look, if Ward was being removed from his position for plagiarism he allegedly committed 20 years ago that would be one thing but that is not what is happening. Ward Churchill is being put through the wringer for thought crime, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>I only agree with Ward´s essay about 20%, but I will defend him against the thought police with all my might. I believe his tone and position is a real loser for the left and can never catch on. I believe the left needs a better story on terrorism and democracy.</p>
<p>Ward really needs a better PR person, if it were possible to get his side of the story out there. Someone to explain that the infamous essay was written on september 12th, which was a very emotional and scary time for everyone and people react to that differently. I see his thoughts misconstrued on Fox News regularly, and I do not believe its fair. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilbertoki_6310.html" title="User:Wilbertoki">Wilbertoki</a> 14:34, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read my comment back and you are right that it was a general complaint about WC´s treatment.</p>
<p>You mentioned Sky broadcasting carries fox where you live, I assumed you were an American, I guess here in America we tend to assume everyone is American. Anyway I happened across this <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/giants/news.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/giants/news.html" rel="nofollow">page</a> that says Sky broadcasting is owned by Rupert Murdoch´s news corp that owns Fox News. Its good to know who owns what in todays world of media consolidation. It´s interesting that they can´t even find advertising sponsors and have to play it on their own network. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilbertoki_6310.html" title="User:Wilbertoki">Wilbertoki</a> 16:37, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks - I wouldn't have even noticed the problem until tomorrow. I also wanted to say thanks for all the edits and review you do on the LDS pages.

<p>I know that some feel that "The Church of..." has NPOV issues - however, I think that especially because of the similar names of the small groups that broke off it is very useful so that people know that it is the largest branch. I tried to get the article moved to "The Church ..." but it failed, and although split pretty evenly (58% in favor of the change) I figured why waste my time on that - I'll just propose that the linke be that way - of course you ended up doing more of them than I did - I still run across one every few weeks - which is weird since I checked every single google hit. Anyway - I think the compromise to name the article without the "The" and have the links be with the "The" is a good one. Let me know if you tackle "the Church" cross denomination naming convention and I will support the change to "the church". <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 04:10, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Alai, thanks for your note.</p>
<p>Yes, the MoS itself does say it's not policy. "Writers are not required to follow all or any of these rules: the joy of wiki editing is that perfection is not required."</p>
<p>It continues, though, in the next sentence: "Copy-editing wikipedians will refer to this manual, and pages will either gradually be made to conform with this guide or this guide will itself be changed."</p>
<p>It looks like you and I are doing that gradual conforming work. (Keep doing that good work.)</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best. -- Jonathan</p>

<p>Hello, Alai. Regarding the protection of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> page, I would like to say the following. Jiang can keep the page protected for as long as he wants - I shall stick to my version anyway. Despite being "a bit long", I believe that it's a very good article. I've put a lot of work into that page, and I don't see why it should be dumped for a new version which, to say the least, is not in any way better than the older one.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that a number of users do prefer my version; all those anonymous numbers who kept reverting the page are not in any way related to me, and you can check the IP addresses if you want. So it's futile to speak of a consensus; besides, a consensus can always change. That said, I would be ready to revert the page only once a day, if you and the others agree to let pass at least 3 hours before reverting the page back. If you don't respect the 3 hour limit, I'll revert once more. In this way, we would also be able to see which version is actually the more popular one. Sorry, but this is the only compromise that I can offer. -<a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimdal_7e14.html" title="User:Heimdal">Heimdal</a> 17:17, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Cardinal</i> is included in the titles of cardinals for two practical reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many mediaeval cardinals have had their first names long forgotten in history and so they can only be entered as <i>Cardinal X</i> while people try to find the original first name.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Many mediaeval cardinals used different cardinalate names than their original birth names. Not including the word cardinal produces a name that never existed. But their own personal names are either universally not recognised or long forgotten.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of <i>cardinal</i> is not meant to give cardinals any particular special treatment. It is simply the <i>only way</i> many historic cardinals can be entered on wikipedia. It was discussed and agreed that in the case of cardinals, the word's inclusion was a practical necessity. Ancient office-holders, where their personal name may not be as widely known and they are only known by title and surname, cause particular problems that don't arise with holders of more modern offices. Mediaeval cardinals will invariably be searched through google through 'cardinal x', just as popes will be searched for using 'pope x'. Other clergymen in other lower offices are either not remembered in history or are usually known by full name. But the higher one got in the Roman Catholic Church, the greater the likelihood that one's personal names were replaced by a clerical name, and it is just the latter that people remember.</p>
<p>This page belongs with all the other hundreds of cardinal articles under the format agreed and used all over wikipedia. Either the naming conventions are changed (which will mean we cannot put on some mediaval cardinals and will have inaccurate names for others) or this article needs to be moved to follow the agreed format. Abandoning that format would necessitate the renaming of hundreds of pages of articles and at this stage tens of thousands of links in articles. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="green"><b>Fear</b><font color="orange"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a> 23:43, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
