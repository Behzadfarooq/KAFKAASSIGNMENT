He was selected for the RAF boxing team to tour <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, but flight training took priority and he was posted to 6 Flight Training School on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">22 January</a>.

<p>Until May 1940 the squadron remained in England tasked with home defence, converting to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> Mk 1s at the beginning of 1940. Deere was enraptured of the Spitfire, like most pilots, describing it as "the most beautiful and easy aircraft to fly." He was later given a chance to fly a captured Bf 109, and found the Spitfire superior:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In my written report on the combat I stated that in my opinion the Spitfire was superior overall to the Me 109, except in the initial climb and dive; however this was an opinion contrary to the belief of the so-called experts. Their judgement was of course based on intelligence assessments and the performance of the 109 in combat with the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hurricane</a> in France. In fact, the Hurricane, though vastly more manoeuvrable than either the Spitfire or the Me 109, was so sadly lacking in speed and rate of climb, that its too-short combat experience against the 109 was not a valid yardstick for comparison. The Spitfire, however, possessed these two attributes to such a degree that, coupled with a better rate of turn than the Me 109, it had the edge overall in combat. There may have been scepticism by some about my claim for the Spitfire, but I had no doubts on the score; nor did my fellow pilots in 54 Squadron",(the Bf109 was called Me 109 by contemporary Allied pilots).</dd>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a> 1940, during the closing phases of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Battle of France">Battle of France</a>, Deere and <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_Officer_be76.html" title="Pilot Officer">Pilot Officer</a> J.

In sight of Leathart and White, Deere claimed his first combat victories, shooting down two <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messerschmitt_Bf_109_aa3a.html" title="Messerschmitt Bf 109">Messerschmitt Bf 109s</a>. Later the same day he shot down a third Bf 109.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_24.html" title="May 24">24 May</a> he added a <a href="../../../b/f/_/Bf_110.html" title="Bf 110">Bf 110</a> over <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk.html" title="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> and on the 26th claimed two more in the same area.</p>

He was knocked unconscious when making a forced landing on a Belgian beach. Rescued by a soldier, Deere made his way on foot to Oost-Dunkerke where his head injuries were dressed. He hitched a ride on a British Army lorry to Dunkirk, and (after receiving some criticism from soldiers about the effectiveness of the RAF’s fighter cover), boarded a boat to <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover.html" title="Dover">Dover</a> from where he took a train back to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, 19 hours after taking off from Hornchurch with his squadron.</p>
<p>Together with Leathart and Allen, Deere was awarded the DFC on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>.

The Citation read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"During May, 1940, this officer has, in company with his squadron, taken part in numerous offensive patrols over Northern France, and has been engaged in seven combats often against superior numbers of the enemy. In the course of these engagements he has personally shot down five enemy aircraft and assisted in the destruction of others. On one occasion, in company with a second aircraft, he escorted a trainer aircraft to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a> Marck aerodrome, for the purpose of rescuing a squadron commander who had been shot down there. The trainer aircraft was attacked by twelve Messerschmitt 109s whilst taking off at Calais, but Pilot Officer Deere, with the other pilot, immediately attacked, with the result that three enemy aircraft were shot down, and a further three severely damaged. Throughout these engagements this officer has displayed courage and determination in his attacks on the enemy."

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Christopher_Deere_7d38.html" title="Edit section: Battle of Britain">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle of Britain</span></h3>
<p>No 54 Squadron took part in the defence of channel shipping against <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> attacks designed to draw out and destroy <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_Command_00a8.html" title="Fighter Command">Fighter Command</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">9 July</a> Deere shot down a Bf 109 over the channel, but then collided head on with a Bf 109 of 4 Staffel <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jagdgeschwader_51.html" title="Jagdgeschwader 51">Jagdgeschwader 51</a> flown by <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberfeldwebel.html" title="Oberfeldwebel">Oberfeldwebel</a> Johann Illner. The propeller blades of Deere's spitfire "Kiwi" were bent backwards, the engine disabled, and much of the fin and rudder lost. Nevertheless, he managed to glide back to the coast near <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manston.html" title="Manston">Manston</a> where his forced landing in a paddock ended against a stone wall.</p>
<p>The colour scheme of this aircraft (N3183, KL-B, named, like all Deere's aircraft, "Kiwi"), was accurately recorded and in consequence it has been a favourite with modellers and manufacturers. The remains of this aircraft have recently been excavated and are to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>After Adler Tag on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">11 August</a> he shot down a Bf 109, two more plus a Bf 110 the next day, and on the 15th added another Bf 109 over the Channel. However he was then trapped in an unequal dogfight with Bf 109s which attempted to block his return to England. Deere made the coast but was forced to bail out at low altitude, and was admitted to Victoria Hospital with minor injuries. He discharged himself the following day. Deere was shot down again on the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">28 August</a> - this time by a Spitfire - but parachuted to safety. A frustrating combat on the 30th saw him claim a probable Do 17.</p>
<p>The following day the Luftwaffe raided <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornchurch.html" title="Hornchurch">Hornchurch</a>. Deere led a section of three Spitfires which attempted to take off during the raid. A bomb destroyed all three aircraft. Deere's Spitfire was blown on its back, trapping him. Pilot Officer Eric Edsall, though badly injured when his own Spitfire had been destroyed, crawled to Deere’s aircraft and freed him. Seeing Edsall’s injuries, Deere then carried his rescuer to the sick bay.</p>
<p>Deere was critical of the lack of training given to new pilots:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"We were desperately short of pilots.[...] We were getting pilots who had not been on Spitfires because there were no conversion units at that time. They came straight to a squadron from their training establishments. Some of them did have a few hours on the Hurricanes, a monoplane experience, but not on the Spitfire. For example, we got two young New Zealanders into my flight. Chatting to them I found they'd been six weeks at sea coming over. They were trained on some very outdated aircraft, I can't remember, out in NZ. One of the pilots had taken them up to see the handling and brief them on the Spitfire. Then they'd go off for one solo flight and circuit, then they were into battle. The answer of course is that they didn't last. Those two lasted two trips and they both finished up in Dover hospital. One was pulled out of the Channel. One landed by parachute."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Such was the toll on men of 54 Squadron that on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">3 September</a>, before the peak of the battle, the squadron was withdrawn from <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._11_Group_RAF_b178.html" title="No. 11 Group RAF">11 group</a> and moved to the northern airfield at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catterick.html" title="Catterick">Catterick</a> to rest and recover.</p>
<p>A Bar to his DFC was awarded on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. The Citation read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Since the outbreak of war this officer has personally destroyed eleven, and probably one other, enemy aircraft, and assisted in the destruction of two more. In addition to the skill and gallantry he has shown in leading his flight, and in many instances his squadron, Flight Lieutenant Deere has displayed conspicuous bravery and determination in pressing home his attacks against superior numbers of enemy aircraft, often pursuing them across the Channel in order to shoot them down. As a leader he shows outstanding dash and determination." London Gazette – <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">6 September</a> 1940.</dd>

<p>While training new replacement pilots in January 1941, Deere collided with one of them, losing most of his tail to the Sergeant pilot's propellor. On baling out, Deere was trapped against part of his aircraft, and his damaged parachute failed to fully open. Deere landed in an area of open sewerage which broke much of his fall. As a result of this incident he was rested from active flying, but promoted to <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_Leader_315c.html" title="Squadron Leader">Acting Squadron Leader</a> and tasked as Operations Room Controller at Catterick. An unusual honour was having his portrait painted by official war artist Cuthbert Orde that February.</p>

On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a> he suffered engine failure over the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> and glided back to another forced landing on the coast, crawling out the small side door after the Spitfire flipped on to its back, destroying the canopy and temporarily trapping him. At the end of July he took over as Squadron commander of 602 Squadron, and on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a> it moved back to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenley.html" title="Kenley">Kenley</a>. On the same day he shot down another Bf 109. On the 10th he was scrambled to investigate a single enemy aircraft flying westwards but could not locate the machine and abandoned the search after being told the aircraft had crashed near <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, so missing the chance to shoot down <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Hess_1cc1.html" title="Rudolf Hess">Rudolf Hess</a>' Bf 110. (See: <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Hess_1cc1.html#Hess.27_landing" title="Rudolf Hess">Rudolf Hess landing</a> for further details.)</p>
<p>In January <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> he was sent on a lecturing and public relations trip to America teaching American pilots fighter tactics learnt in the Battle of Britain.</p>

<p>Deere returned to action on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a>, taking command of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian.html" title="Canadian">Canadian</a> manned No. 403 Squadron RAF at <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Weald_83ad.html" title="North Weald">North Weald</a>. In August he went on a course at RAF Staff College and was subsequently posted to Headquarters <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._13_Group_RAF_ce00.html" title="No. 13 Group RAF">13 Group</a> on staff duties.</p>
<p>He engineered a return to operations, somewhat unofficially, as a supernumerary with No. 611 Squadron RAF at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Biggin_Hill_313b.html" title="Biggin Hill">Biggin Hill</a>. He shot down an <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focke_Wulf_Fw-190_d478.html" title="Focke Wulf Fw-190">Fw 190</a> soon after, but wrote of his great respect for the type and its pilots.</p>
<p>He was given command of the Kenley fighter wing, but this was changed at the last minute to keep him as Wing Leader at Biggin Hill. While there, Deere was awarded the DSO, the citation reading: "This officer has displayed exceptional qualities of skill, which have played a large part in the successes of formations he has led. His fearlessness, tenacity and unswerving devotion to duty have inspired all with whom he has flown. Wing Commander Deere has destroyed 18 enemy aircraft."
