<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaga%C3%ABsia.html" title="Edit section: Humans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Humans</span></h3>
<p>Humans seem to populate most of the known world of Alagaësía, though they came from across the sea relatively recently. A group of twenty humans came to Alagaësía, and came three hundred more years after the formation of the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Riders_321b.html" title="Dragon Riders">Dragon Riders</a>. They landed in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surda.html" title="Surda">Surda</a> from lands far south of Alagaёsía. The humans began adapting to this new place they had found, and lived in peace. Here they first learned of the existence of <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf.html" title="Dwarf">Dwarves</a>, with whom they frequently traded with for a few years before they left for isolation. The warriors went northwest and began to settle in a nice area of isolated land for two thousand years. After two thousand years or so, King Palancar, current king of the humans from whence the warriors came, arrived in Alagaësia. First the humans arrived in Surda, and then found Palancar Valley, which was where the original humans had settled. Palancar Valley was named after the king and it still retains that name in Eragon's time. Palancar then began to construct a mighty state. Palancar learned from the humans that this land was populated by short, hairy beasts that stole their children. These beasts were, of course, the Dwarves, and they did not actually steal human children, but the true nature of the Dwarves were forgotten over time and remembered as such. Palancar wanted to expand his boundaries and fought against the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves.html" title="Elves">Elves</a> three times, and lost all three.</p>
<p>A group of lords brought a treaty before the Elves requesting peace without Palancar's knowledge. Palancar was usurped and banished, but he, his family, and vassals refused to leave the Valley. To prevent Palancar from attacking anyone or rising to power, the Riders constructed Ristvak'baen on Utgard Mountain, to watch over Palancar and his empire. Eventually, a greedy son who couldn't wait until Palancar died naturally killed Palancar so that the son could become King. That led to assassination, betrayal and other such things in Palancar's house, reducing Palancar's once mighty state into a mere shadow of its old self. The predecessor of Vrael - ruler of the Riders - Anurin, wanted Human Riders to come into existence to prevent things like that from happening. They would then be allowed to watch and protect human governments, a choice that was very unpopular and led to a huge argument between him and the Elvish Queen Dellanir. Anurin separated the Riders from the Elfish government and moved to Vroengard. They could not watch and protect the governments, so their purpose waned, until Queen <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dellanir.html" title="Dellanir">Dellanir</a> saw wisdom in letting the Riders free of any government, and allowed them back into <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Weldenvarden_6bc6.html" title="Du Weldenvarden">Du Weldenvarden</a>. However, this choice did not please her, as now the Riders' power was greater than her own, and therefore no one could watch the watchers, as the Elves used to do, which led to the eventual downfall of the Riders (also called the Fall) at the hands of now-king <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a>. For details, see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fall_%28Inheritance%29_0b67.html" title="The Fall (Inheritance)">The Fall</a>.</p>
<p>Humans make up for most the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varden.html" title="Varden">Varden</a>, an alliance of men and dwarves who resist Galbatorix's rule, started by Brom. Surda is a human kingdom that aids the Varden but is threatened by Galbatorix's empire.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaga%C3%ABsia.html" title="Edit section: Elves">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elves</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves.html" title="Elves">Elven</a> race dates back to ancient times, when they existed with other creatures that were bound to the land. Their appearance is that of a fair, smooth faced human with pointed ears, pale skin, slanted eyes, thin brows and refined facial features. The Elves are usually thin, but they have muscular bodies. Unlike the other races introduced so far, Elves do not have any <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_hair.html" title="Body hair">body hair</a>, assuming Oromis's lack of it is standard for the race. The Elves love song and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelry.html" title="Revelry">revelry</a>.</p>
<p>They came on silver ships from a land they called Alalëa and settled in Alagaësía. It is rumored that Teirm is where they first landed in Alagaësía. Nowadays, they have withdrawn to the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest.html" title="Forest">forests</a> in hopes of distancing themselves from <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a>. The Elves are led by Queen <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islanzad%C3%AD.html" title="Islanzadí">Islanzadí</a> Dröttning, who was married to King <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evandar.html" title="Evandar">Evandar</a> and succeeded Queen <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dellanir.html" title="Dellanir">Dellanir</a>. Islanzadí became Queen after her mate, Evandar, was killed in the Elves' last stand against Galbatorix in Ilirea. She inherited the title through marriage, not birth. Should Islanzadí die, her daughter Arya will become queen.</p>
<p>The elves' natural abilities are said to be immense, to the point that even the weakest, untrained elf could defeat a well-trained human in a battle of swordsmanship. At one point in their history, the Elves once had a horrible misunderstanding with the dragons which led to a massive war. They eventually were able to settle their disputes with the help of an Elf called Eragon, who had raised a white dragon hatchling and, in doing so, became the first <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a>. To ensure that there would be no more wars between them, the Elves and Dragons gathered at Ilirea to magically join their races together. The Elves provided the structure, the Dragons the power necessary, and the souls of Elves and Dragons melded together. The Dragons received the trappings of language and other things of civilization and became less ferocious. The Elves obtained great strength and grace, as well as greater ability to work magic. This also resulted in the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Riders_321b.html" title="Dragon Riders">Dragon Riders</a>, who were originally diplomats, but gained authority as their power was realized. The Elfish lifespan increased until they were nearly immortal. Their skill as magicians took the form of song, wherein their voices became a tool of shaping. As a result, all their tools, including their houses, were soon sung out of the source material.</p>
<p>Before <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fall_%28Inheritance%29_0b67.html" title="The Fall (Inheritance)">The Fall</a> of the Riders, the Elves had many great cities not only located in Du Weldenvarden, but all over the continent; places taken over by Galbatorix during the Fall.</p>
<p>It is said they loved the seas more than anything and probably had many cities among the coast. Ellesméra is the Elfish capital city after The Fall, and is located in the heart of Du Weldenvarden. It is protected by arcane barriers that make it impossible to send any item or thought to Du Weldenvarden by magical means - it is unknown if these barriers prevent anything else. To enter Ellesméra, you must pass the Gatekeeper, Gilderean the Wise, or it is impossible to enter. He has existed since the Dragon War with the Elves, and is the wielder of the white flames of Vandil and is Prince of the House Miolandra. It is known that the typical Elfish greeting is touching your middle and index finger to your lips and saying a certain response in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Language_%28Inheritance%29_46a3.html" title="Ancient Language (Inheritance)">Ancient Language</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional greeting is:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Atra esterní ono thelduin</i></li>
<li><i>Mor'ranr lífa unin hjarta onr</i></li>
<li><i>Un du evarínya ono varda</i>.</li>
</ul>
which translates as
<ul>
<li><i>May good fortune rule over you</i></li>
<li><i>And peace live in your heart</i>.</li>
<li><i>May the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">stars</a> watch over you</i></li>
</ul>
This is used to ensure that conversation will not be altered by lies.</blockquote>
<p>Because they speak in this language, the Elves are unable to <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie.html" title="Lie">lie</a>, though they can conceal the truth or imply something while meaning something else. In conversation, the person of lesser status speaks first, the one of higher status second. If one is unsure which person's status is higher, one waits for the other to speak, and if he/she doesn't, one may speak.</p>
<p>The Elves are known as the "Fair Folk"; their greatest weakness is their vanity. They often use magic to change their appearance to better suit who they really are. The Elves have used their exceptionally powerful magical abilities to create their homes in the forests of <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Weldenvarden_6bc6.html" title="Du Weldenvarden">Du Weldenvarden</a> by melding the trees and plants in various ways to create a living area. All Elves are vegetarians, because they value life very highly, and they sing their weapons and tools from the trees and plants - using magic to send energy into them and give them certain attributes. For instance, <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_%28Inheritance%29_3e7f.html" title="Arya (Inheritance)">Arya</a> told <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a> that elven bows are "sung from trees that do not grow". This technique is used by Rhunon, forger of the Riders' swords and the most accomplished forger in Alagaësia; she charms the Riders' swords so they will be eternally sharp, will never break, and can not get blood stained. This technique also led to the creation of the Menoa Tree, where the Elves celebrate the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood-Oath_Celebration_760c.html" title="Blood-Oath Celebration">Blood-Oath Celebration</a>. The Menoa Tree was originally a Singer, called Linnea, who was disappointed in love. After killing her insincere fiancé, Linnea sang herself into a pine tree.</p>

<p><b>The Dashelgr Invocation</b> The <i><b>Dagshelgr Invocation</b></i> is the name of chapter 25 of <i><a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldest.html" title="Eldest">Eldest</a></i>, the second book of the <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance_Trilogy_6657.html" title="Inheritance Trilogy"><i>Inheritance</i></a> trilogy by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Paolini_3e22.html" title="Christopher Paolini">Christopher Paolini</a>, describing an event of the same name. This event occurs in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellesm%C3%A9ra.html" title="Ellesméra">Ellesméra</a>, the Elven city in <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Weldenvarden_6bc6.html" title="Du Weldenvarden">Du Weldenvarden</a>, the forest where the Elves live in the fictional land of Alagaësia where the trilogy is based.</p>
<p>Eragon and his friends leave <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tronjheim.html" title="Tronjheim">Tronjheim</a> to travel for Ellesméra to complete his magical training as a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a>. When they enter the forest, they hear a single woman's voice drifting through the woods. As more voices joined into the invocation, <i>"the air itself seemed to shimmer with the fabric of the tempestuous music"</i>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Eragon and a Dwarf who is accompanying him: <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orik.html" title="Orik">Orik</a>, come under the influence of the song, and wish to dash away and find the source of the music, and it is only with the help of their Elvish companions that they are restrained.</p>
<p>Later, it is explained to them that the celebrations are perilous for mortals, as opposed to the demi-mortal Elves, who <i>"sing in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_language.html" title="Ancient language">ancient language</a>, and the lyrics weave spells of passion and longing that are hard to resist, even for <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf_%28Inheritance%29_284b.html" title="Elf (Inheritance)">the elves</a>"</i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Considering the way it's described, it's probably a rite of spring, much like in Shakespeare's <i>A Midsummer's Nights Dream.</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaga%C3%ABsia.html" title="Edit section: Reasons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reasons</span></h2>
<p>The Elves participate in the Dagshelgr festival every spring <i>"to keep the forest healthy and fertile"</i>. There song is for the trees, the plants and animals, and helps all these to prosper and thrive. Without the Elves the forest would be <i>"half its size"</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> After hearing the song, all the humans, dwarves, animals and elves are fueled with a passionate desire, the animals to find a mate and reproduce. While elves can resist the call, the songs can be deadly to dwarves and humans. Even <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">Dragons</a> are affected, though neither they nor the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves.html" title="Elves">Elves</a> are too intelligent to be considered animals in the sense that it is most often used in this series.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaga%C3%ABsia.html" title="Edit section: Dwarves">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dwarves</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf.html" title="Dwarf">Dwarvesfirs</a> lived in the hadrdack deser, when it as a plain. when it tranfored into a desert, they migrated to the <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beor_Mountains_b5e4.html" title="Beor Mountains">Beor Mountains</a> , reputedly eight millennia ago. They are short and stocky humanoids with long, dense hair, and have seven toes on each foot. The Dwarves have long lives, but are not immortal like Elves and Dragons. They believe that the god Helzvog created them. They are <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheism.html" title="Polytheism">polytheistic</a> and devout.</p>
<p>According to the Dwarvish religion, Guntera, King of the Gods, is a warrior and a scholar, but he is moody, so they offer sacrifices to please him. They worship him because he used the bones of a <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant.html" title="Giant">giant</a> to create the land. It is said he was born to a she-<a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf.html" title="Wolf">wolf</a> at the dawn of the stars, and battled giants and monsters for a place for his kin in Alagaësia. He took Kilf, the goddess of <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">rivers</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea.html" title="Sea">seas</a>, as his mate.</p>
<p>Urur is the master of the Heavens and the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air.html" title="Air">air</a>, and his brother is the god of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>, Morgothal. The brothers loved each other so much that they could not separate - hence the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">sun</a> and the stars, and the dependence of fire on <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>.</p>
<p>In the Dwarves' religion, Sindri is the mother of the earth, and Helzvog is the favorite of the Dwarves' gods. After the giants were eradicated, Helzvog believed that Alagaësia should be populated, and though the other gods disagreed, he secretly created the first Dwarf from the roots of the mountains. Learning of this, the gods created various other things: Sindri created Humans from the soil, and Urur and Morgothal created Dragons. Guntera created the Elves, and thus the races entered the world.</p>
<p>The Dwarves' burial rituals say that all Dwarves must be buried in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone.html" title="Stone">stone</a>; otherwise, so they believe, their spirits will never join Helzvog in his stone halls. If one does not complete the ritual by joining the dead dwarf with stone, they will be banished from their clan and never spoken of until their death. The more scientific Elves do not share the Dwarves' religious values. <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_%28Inheritance%29_3e7f.html" title="Arya (Inheritance)">Arya</a> believes the religions to be foolish.</p>
<p>Dwarves and dragons did not coexist easily. Before the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Riders_321b.html" title="Dragon Riders">Dragon Riders</a> were established, Dragons made a habit of stealing gold from the Dwarves and eating their livestock, causing tension between the two races. These happenings caused that the dwarves refused to be included in the pact between the elves and the dragons; thus, there were never Dwarven Dragon Riders.</p>
<p>The Dwarves are split into thirteen <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">clans</a>. As well as a King who rules over all the Dwarves, there are thirteen Clan Chiefs who decide the new king when the old one dies. These Clan Chiefs wield enormous power, and many are against Eragon, resenting the new Rider.</p>
<p>In the course of 8,000 years, there have been 42 Kings, the first being <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korgan.html" title="Korgan">Korgan</a>, the forty-second being <a href="../../../h/r/o/Hrothgar.html" title="Hrothgar">Hrothgar</a>, a prominent Dwarf in Inheritance; assuming the monarchy was never interrupted, this apparently means dwarves live around 200 years at least. Volund, the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammer.html" title="Hammer">hammer</a> of Korgan, first of the Dwarf Kings, is wielded by the current Dwarf King. In <i>Inheritance</i>, they were led by King Hrothgar before he was killed by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murtagh.html" title="Murtagh">Murtagh</a>, as were four other Dwarven magicians who were drained of their life in an attempt to save their King. <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orik.html" title="Orik">Orik</a>, a friend of <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a>'s, is the heir of Hrothgar; though, as the king is elected by the thirteen clans, this may or may not mean he will succeed him to the throne.</p>
<p>The Dwarves are possibly the finest smiths, rivaled only by the Elves. In <i>Inheritance</i>, it is said that Orthiad, one of the Dwarves' abandoned cities, used to be the capital Dwarven city, before <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tronjheim.html" title="Tronjheim">Tronjheim</a> was created in Farthen Dûr. Tronjheim is so large it can house the entire Dwarf nation if facing emergencies, which has happened three times. They have created many marvels, including iron fists, <i>ascudgamln</i>, for which they embed metal studs into one's knuckles and attach spikes to them. The Dwarves provided Eragon with his armor and created Dragons' armor for previous Riders. The Dwarves have a form of magic that can be fused with their creations. They gave Eragon a necklace that prevents him from being able to be scryed, although it drains the wearer’s energy. This is due to it being made from metal, which cannot hold energy. Not surprisingly, their craftsmanship is also only rivaled by the Elves.</p>
<p>Humans use the form of rune writing which the Dwarves invented, because when Humans first arrived in Alagaësia, they were illiterate, and so the Dwarves taught them. The Dwarves ally and secretly house the Varden, giving them much aid. They, along with the Elves, have pledged their support to the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varden.html" title="Varden">Varden</a>, and have sworn that when needed, they will march against <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a>.</p>

<p>Urgals are a race that serve an antagonistic role in <i>Eragon</i>, but become Eragon's allies in <i>Eldest</i>. Like the elves, Urgals are not native to the land of Alagaësia. The Urgals followed the elves from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alalea.html" title="Alalea">Alalea</a>. Urgals resemble humans with bowed legs and thick brutish arms made for crushing, and very large ramlike <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horn.html" title="Horn">horns</a>. They have yellow, <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">piggish</a> eyes, and have grayish skin. The Urgals are usually split into small clans which fight with each other over food, land, and power. The <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kull_%28Inheritance%29_c774.html" title="Kull (Inheritance)">Kull</a> are a particularly strong subspecies of Urgals. They are strong enough to match any non-magical being of Alagaësia. The average height for a Kull is eight feet.</p>
<p>The Urgal's rank in society is determined through combat skills, whether male or female. The more an Urgal kills, the more authority he or she given. The Urgals were magically forced to fight together against their will by <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durza.html" title="Durza">Durza</a>, a lieutenant of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a>. In <i>Eragon</i>, Durza led this Urgal army when they attacked Farthen Dûr, but when Durza was slain, the enslaving magic was lifted, and the clans turned on each other. This allowed the Varden and the dwarves to defeat the diminishing army.</p>
<p>Later, the decimated Bolvek Tribe approached the Varden, seeking revenge on Galbatorix for his shameless deeds. The Varden formed an alliance with the tribe, desperate for help.</p>

<p>Dragons have lived in Alagaësía since ancient times. The skin of a Dragon is nearly impenetrable, though the thin membrane of their wings can be easily pierced. Their scales glitter like gems. They have eye color identical to that of their scales, and their teeth and neck spikes are usually white. The Dragons start to breathe flame when they are five to six months old. The flames are the color of the dragon's scales; some can impressively hold the flame for hours. They never stop growing until their death.</p>
<p>Since the Dragons are psychically bound to the land, they possess magical properties. They cannot voluntarily use their magic, except for their fire. After the creation of their bond with Elves (and later humans), they gained such things as articulate language and a more calm way of thought.</p>

<p>In early history, an Elf, not knowing the intelligence of the creature, killed a Dragon in the manner he would kill a deer. The mistake caused a large-scale war between the Elven and Dragon races until one day a teenage elf named Eragon found an abandoned egg and raised the Dragon. They formed a strong friendship and became ambassadors between the two races. Finally, peace was brought to the land and so the first Dragon Rider's task was simply to keep the peace between the groups. Later, the Riders were given the power to watch over all the land and to keep peace, becoming more powerful than the other governments. Because there was no one to keep the riders in check, they grew arrogant and this led to the Fall.</p>
<p>Riders' Dragons will only hatch for the Human or Elf they believe best suited for them. Humans that are Riders undergo physical changes over time, such as their ears growing more pointed like those of the Elves. Dragon Riders become stronger of body, keener of mind, and truer of sight, whether Elf or Human. When a Dragon hatches, his Rider forms a bond with him/her by touching the Dragon. This touch leaves a mark, the gedwëy ignasia, on the Dragon Rider’s hand.Gedwëy Ignasia, which means <i>Silver Hand</i>, is actually a silver mark on Eragon's hand in the film, while Brom's and Galbatorix's are both black.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a> led a rebellion that crushed the Dragon Riders and their leader <a href="../../../v/r/a/Vrael.html" title="Vrael">Vrael</a> and brought an end to this peaceful rule.

<p>Also known as Wyrdfell, the Forsworn were the group of Dragon Riders whom Galbatorix used to overthrow the <i>other</i> Dragon Riders. They all used to be Riders, but they and their Dragons were forced to take special oaths of loyalty to serve Galbatorix. Morzan was the only one of the thirteen who was known to have a child (there could be others), <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murtagh.html" title="Murtagh">Murtagh</a>, who accompanies Eragon on his journey for quite a while. <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon_%28character%29.html" title="Eragon (character)">Eragon</a> may also be the son of Morzan. Brom, a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a>, was the one to slay Morzan and personally killed two others, and was responsible for the deaths of five more of them.

<p><a href="../../../w/e/r/Werecat.html" title="Werecat">Werecats</a> are beings with the ability to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifting.html" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshift</a> from feline to human-like forms. They are described as large, fierce-looking cats with lean bodies, powerful shoulders, and oversized paws. They also have shaggy manes, which surround their angular faces. The werecats' origins and natures are very hard to understand because of the cryptic way in which they communicate, never fully explaining themselves and often speaking in nothing but <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riddle.html" title="Riddle">riddles</a>. They tend to keep to themselves and only appear to help in random times of need. It is said that during the heyday of the Riders, they were as renowned as Dragons. In the Riders' time, they were the favorite pet of Kings and Elves, although Werecats decided when they would stay and leave. Their race has begun to deplete over the years, although why that is so is not explained so far.</p>
<p>A notable Werecat in <i><a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a></i> would be <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solembum.html" title="Solembum">Solembum</a>, who gives Eragon advice and guides him a few times. In Eldest, another werecat is seen, Maud, but little information is revealed about her, other than the fact she stays with the Elves in Ellesméra and is probably the pet of Queen Islanzadí. Besides that, little information has been revealed about her, although there are hints of a possible connection between the two, as they both show some sign of knowing each other.</p>

<p>Shades are humans possessed by spirits. They are similar to sorcerers in that they use the strengths of spirits in order to accomplish magical tasks, but a sorcerer controls the spirits he uses, whereas a Shade controls neither the spirits nor his actions. Shades are immensely powerful, and only three beings have ever succeeded in destroying one and remaining sane; Laetri the Elf, Irnstad the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a>, and Eragon. The only way a Shade can be killed is to pierce the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a>; otherwise they'll merely reappear elsewhere and return stronger than before. The only notable Shade in <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a> is <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durza.html" title="Durza">Durza</a>. This Shade nearly killed Eragon in a city called Gil'ead and later in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_under_Farthen_D%C3%BBr_a1e1.html" title="Battle under Farthen Dûr">Battle under Farthen Dûr</a>, but Eragon survived with help of his dragon Saphira, his friend Murtagh, and the warrior Arya. It is unknown whether there are any other Shades in Alagaësia at the time of the book, though Paolini did say that it was possible that another Shade might turn up. No new Shades were seen in Eldest, though Durza was often discussed.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaga%C3%ABsia.html" title="Edit section: Ra'zac">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ra'zac</span></h3>

<p>The Ra'zac are extremely powerful beings who have no grasp of magic.</p>
<p>The Ra'zac lifecycle goes as follows: when the Ra'zac are born, they are known to their parents as pupae, and they develop a roughly human exoskeleton that allows them approach their ultimate prey, humans. As described in <i>Eldest</i>, they have shining black skin, a humped back where future wings may be hidden, a sharp beak, a barbed purple tongue, and huge, lidless eyes. Their eyes have no pupils or irises. At twenty years of age or Ra'zac, shed their exoskeletons and emerge as fully grown Lethrblaka.</p>
<p>The Lethrblaka have great wings, tight gray skin with huge corded muscles, a sharp killing beak, a crested head and hind legs strong enough to crush a boulder. When mature, they can reproduce by laying eggs. The pupae/Ra'zac have many terrifying abilities, including the ability to see on a cloudy night, track scents keenly, jump higher and move quicker than any Human. Their last, most terrible weapon is their evil breath, which fogs the mind of Humans and incapacitates others, though to a slightly lesser extent. The only two Ra'zac who still survive have been so far unnamed. They were discovered by Galbatorix and enlisted in his service. They work for Galbatorix as his personal Dragon Hunters and are housed at Helgrind.</p>
<p>When the Riders learned of the Ra'zac, they did all they could to destroy them. Unfortunately for the Riders, two Lethrblaka and their pupae – the ones mentioned above– escaped.</p>
<p>The Ra'zac are quite similar to the Nazgûl of Lord of the Rings in appearance and the fact they often ride around, hunting down enemies of those they serve. Another possible similarity is that they might ride around on flying mounts, which is strongly hinted in <i>Eragon</i>, and is confirmed in <i>Eldest</i>. These flying mounts are really their parents.</p>

<p>The Grey Folk were a powerful race that created <i>Gramarye</i>, the art of using the ancient language for magic. They did not completely create the language, but rather augmented it so it would be impossible to lie, and to give it more control over magic. In fact it was said by in the book, Eldest that they wrought the greatest enchantment that perhaps ever was or perhaps ever will be, by tying the ancient language to magic.

<p>It should be noted that magic leaves its user fatigued. If you use magic, it will take the same amount of energy required to perform the task physically. Attributes such as the distance from the target and the severity of about by the Grey Folk. They were an ancient race, here even before the Elves. The Grey Folk, realizing what , however, gain powerful magic through forging a bond with their Dragon and through the Dragon, a bond with the primal forces of the land.</p>
<p>Some of the basic magical techniques taught to spell weavers are these: The ability to extend one's consciousness beyond oneself and meld one's consciousness with other living thing's consciousnesses. One learns how to attack a person's mind and gain control over that person, and one is taught to close one's mind to the ones assaulting one by thinking of one thing only. One is taught how to place wards around oneself to help defend against both magical and physical assaults. These wards only survive as long as the warder canlonger battles.</p>
<p>In battles between armies, a spell weaver will only have an army to make sure they are protected for only the wisest and most experienced Dragon Riders, are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>An ability that only experienced Riders learn is twelve death words that can kill people instantly by cutting off certain nerves or arteries and only using as much energy as one would to lift a finger.</li>
<li>They are taught the spell that can instantaneously transport an item.</li>
<li>Finally, one of the most potentially dangerous techniques: the ability to draw energy from your surroundings, including the earth and living things of all kind.</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Language_%28Inheritance%29_46a3.html" title="Ancient Language (Inheritance)">Ancient Language</a> is the language of the Elves and is used in magic. It is not commonly used for communication in <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a>, but it is used a lot in <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldest.html" title="Eldest">Eldest</a>, although mostly represented by English translations. The name of anything in this language is its true name, which is what makes it the language of magic. If one knows something's name in the Ancient Language, one has the ability to control it. This includes people: If one knows a person's true name, one can control them. If one knows the true name of the Ancient Language, one has the ability to control anybody that uses it. It is said that one cannot lie or break their word in the Ancient Language.</p>
<p>The Ancient Language is based on <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_cc89.html" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a>.<a href="http://www.teenreads.com/authors/au-paolini-christopher.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.teenreads.com/authors/au-paolini-christopher.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Dwarf language is rough-accented. Unlike the Ancient Language it was not based directly on a real language, but was mostly made up by Paolini. Not much is known of its grammar, though <i>-n</i> seems to denote plural.</p>

<p>The Urgal language is a very rough language consisting of grunts and other noises. Some Urgals also speak the common language. When greeting war chiefs, Urgal raise their head and bellow. The proper response is usually to butt heads. Baring their throat is seen to be a sign of respect whereas lowering your head means that you are about to butt the person and, thus, is taken as a sign of great disrespect.</p>
