<p>While playing for the Tigers' farm team in Montgomery of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_League_%28baseball%29_6cc1.html" title="Southern League (baseball)">Southern League</a>, Alan Trammell played his first game with teammate Lou Whitaker before the two infielders were promoted, making their major league debut at <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenway_Park_891e.html" title="Fenway Park">Fenway Park</a> together, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, the first of nineteen seasons together.</p>
<p>After growing and maturing during his first four major league seasons, Trammell <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batted</a> .300 in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_baseball.html" title="1980 in baseball">1980</a> as he made the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> team for first time. <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_in_sports.html" title="1983 in sports">1983</a> was a true break-out season for Trammell, as he hit .314 with 14 <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a>, 66 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_batted_in.html" title="Runs batted in">runs batted in</a> and 30 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a>.

<p>Trammell, along with his Tiger teammates, enjoyed a dream season in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_in_baseball.html" title="1984 in baseball">1984</a>. Despite a season-long battle with <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tendonitis.html" title="Tendonitis">tendonitis</a> in his shoulder, which caused him to miss 43 regular season games, he finished fifth in AL batting race with .314 and ranked eighth in <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_base_percentage.html" title="On base percentage">on base percentage</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_in_baseball.html" title="1985 in baseball">1985</a>, after two consecutive years not lower than .314, Trammell was hampered by injuries, and posted only a .258 batting average. He underwent postseason surgery on left knee and right shoulder. The following season, he returned with new energy. He became only second player in Detroit history to hit 20 homers and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">steal</a> 20 bases in a season, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Gibson_be06.html" title="Kirk Gibson">Kirk Gibson</a> being the other. Trammell also set a career-high with 75 RBI.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_in_baseball.html" title="1987 in baseball">1987</a>, asked by manager <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparky_Anderson_a394.html" title="Sparky Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> to bat <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugger.html" title="Slugger">cleanup</a>, Trammell responded with the best season of his career. In September, he batted .416 with six homers and 17 RBI, putting together an 18-game hitting streak in which he hit a .457, helping his team to win the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">AL East</a> division by two games on the last day of the season. He became the first Tiger to collect 200 <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Hit (baseball statistics)">hits</a> and 100 RBI in the same season since <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Kaline_05ff.html" title="Al Kaline">Al Kaline</a> did it in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955_in_baseball.html" title="1955 in baseball">1955</a>. Beside this, he appeared amongst the league leaders in most AL offensive categories: third in batting average (.343), tenth in RBI (105), third in hits (205), tied for fifth in <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Run (baseball statistics)">runs</a> (109), fourth in <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_bases.html" title="Total bases">total bases</a> (329), fifth in on base percentage (.402), eighth in <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_average.html" title="Slugging average">slugging average</a> (.551), and tied for fifth in game-winning RBI (16).

<p>The following years, Trammell suffered a long string of injuries that slowed his production both at bat and on the field. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_baseball.html" title="1991 in baseball">1991</a>, he was limited to 101 games because of knee and ankle injuries. It was even worse in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_in_baseball.html" title="1992 in baseball">1992</a>. He got into only 29 games before breaking his right ankle, losing the rest of the season. His days as a regular shortstop for Detroit were close to being over. After two sub-par seasons, he retired in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_baseball.html" title="1996 in baseball">1996</a>.</p>
<p>In his twenty year career, Trammell batted .285, with 185 home runs, 1003 RBI, 1231 runs, 2365 hits, 412 <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_%28baseball%29.html" title="Double (baseball)">doubles</a>, 55 <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_%28baseball%29.html" title="Triple (baseball)">triples</a>, and 236 stolen bases in 2293 games.

<p>Alan Trammell was named the manager of a long-struggling Tigers team on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">October 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. The team lost a AL-record 119 games in his first season in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_baseball.html" title="2003 in baseball">2003</a>, before improving to 72-90 in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a>, the biggest turnaround in the AL since <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore</a>'s 33-game improvement from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_in_baseball.html" title="1988 in baseball">1988</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_baseball.html" title="1989 in baseball">1989</a>. In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005</a> season, however, the team regressed slightly, posting a record of 71-91. The Tigers compiled a record of 186-300 in three seasons under Trammell.</p>
<p>During the abysmal 2003 season, Detroit, fielding a woefully undermanned squad, nearly matched the MLB record of 120 losses, set by the expansion <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mets_19ff.html" title="New York Mets">New York Mets</a> (42-120) in 1962.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> released Trammell after three seasons in which the organization failed to post a winning record. Trammell was replaced by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Leyland_4daa.html" title="Jim Leyland">Jim Leyland</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. Leyland led Detroit to a 24-game improvement in the regular season, an AL pennant and a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> appearance in 2006. While some critics believe that Trammell's stint as Tiger's manager tainted his baseball legacy, others contend that he was a rookie manager put in charge of a team that was severely lacking in talent, and believe his managerial stint played an integral role in re-instilling professionalism and pride throughout the Detroit organization. Many attribute a degree of the success that the Tigers saw in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_baseball.html" title="2006 in baseball">2006</a> postseason to Trammell's efforts in the three years prior.</p>
<p>In October, 2006, Trammell returned to Comerica Park for the first time since his firing to participate, along with Sparky Anderson, in pregame festivities prior to Game 2 of the World Series. Trammell was showered with a lengthy standing ovation from Detroit baseball fans upon taking the field.</p>
<p>After being replaced by Leyland, Trammell turned down an offer to stay with the Tigers as a special assistant, instead opting to sit out 2006. In <a href="../../../o/c/t/October.html" title="October">October</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he agreed to join the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> as a bench coach for the 2007 season, a possible precursor to an eventual return to managing a major league club.</p>
