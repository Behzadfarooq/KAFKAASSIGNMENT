<p>Alastair Campbell is the son of <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterinarian.html" title="Veterinarian">veterinarian</a> Donald Campbell and his wife Elizabeth, a couple of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> origin who moved to <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keighley.html" title="Keighley">Keighley</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Yorkshire_4693.html" title="West Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a> when the elder Campbell became a partner in a veterinary practice there. Alastair has two elder brothers, Donald and Graham, and a younger sister, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Alastair attended City of Leicester School and <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonville_and_Caius_College%2C_Cambridge_e86b.html" title="Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge">Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge</a>, where he studied modern languages (<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>, for which Campbell received a 2:1, or Upper Second) and claimed that he wrote essays based solely on criticism and did not always read the works themselves (a kind of proto-<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_%28public_relations%29.html" title="Spin (public relations)">spin doctoring</a>). Campbell spent a year in the South of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> as part of his <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_degree.html" title="Academic degree">degree</a>.</p>
<p>Campbell also became interested in <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a>. His first published work was "Inter-City Ditties", his winning entry to a readers' competition run by <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornographic.html" title="Pornographic">pornographic</a> magazine <i>Forum</i>. This led to a lengthy stint working for <i>Forum</i>, writing articles such as "The Riviera Gigolo" and "Busking with Bagpipes" which Campbell purported to be based on autobiographical events.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was appointed as a sports reporter on the <i>Tavistock Times</i> where he took over the back page and gave himself a personal column. He was promoted to the news pages where his first major story was the loss of the Penlee lifeboat with all its crew. It was as a trainee on the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mirror_c617.html" title="Daily Mirror">Daily Mirror</a></i> in <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth.html" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> that he met his partner <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fiona_Millar_7f04.html" title="Fiona Millar">Fiona Millar</a>.</p>

<p>Campbell later moved to the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> office of the <i>Mirror</i> where he became a political correspondent. However, his rapid rise and stressful job led to <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and a <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervous_breakdown.html" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. Campbell recovered and has become teetotal<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He rebuilt his career and became Political Editor of the <i>Daily Mirror</i>; as the largest circulation left-wing paper, he was a close advisor of <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Kinnock_6f58.html" title="Neil Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a> and worked closely with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Maxwell_5003.html" title="Robert Maxwell">Robert Maxwell</a>.</p>
<p>After leaving the Mirror, Campbell became Political Editor of <i>Today</i>, a full colour tabloid newspaper launched in the 1980s that was then trying to turn leftward. Campbell was working there when <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_%28UK_politician%29_2b76.html" title="John Smith (UK politician)">John Smith</a> died in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. He was a well-known face and helped to interview the three candidates for the new <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> leader; it was later revealed that he had already formed links with <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Campbell_dc6b.html" title="Edit section: Work for Tony Blair">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Work for Tony Blair</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after Blair won and became leader of the opposition, Campbell left the newspaper to become his spokesman. He played an important role in the run-up to the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> general election, working with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Mandelson_73b4.html" title="Peter Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a> to co-ordinate Labour's campaign. Campbell intervened personally to complain whenever media outlets ran stories he felt were unhelpful to the campaign, and was not afraid to attack journalists personally when they displeased him. When Blair became Prime Minister in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Campbell became his Director of Communications and in charge of the government's press machine.</p>
<p>As the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Labour_d0a0.html" title="New Labour">New Labour</a> government found its feet, Blair relied for his political advice on a close circle of his own staff. Campbell was seen as particularly influential, and was sometimes referred to as the "real Deputy Prime Minister". His influence was certainly greater than his job title suggested: he was given the authority to direct Civil Servants, who previously had taken instructions only from ministers. Campbell's control of the traditional Lobby System under which a select group of accredited journalists were given privileged access to the Prime Minister's spokesman (and the journalistic kudos that this access could bring) meant that he wielded a good deal of power over the media, as previous Press Secretaries had found. Unlike his predecessors, he had been a political appointment and had not come through the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Service_bff8.html" title="Civil Service">Civil Service</a>.</p>

<p>When Blair won a second term on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Campbell took a step back from the job of briefing journalists and was appointed as the "Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy". This gave him a strategic role in overseeing government communications. He was sometimes regarded with suspicion (if not outright hostility) by elements of the Labour Party and Blair's political opponents who felt he minimised the role of members of the government and members of Parliament. However, those who worked closely with him describe an aggressive but funny and loyal colleague, who inspired loyalty in others. Even his most severe critics regarded him as adept in the techniques of <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_management.html" title="News management">news management</a>. He was memorably sponsored by the US President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> to complete a marathon in aid of a cancer charity, which he had supported since a journalist colleague died early of the disease.</p>

<p>In February <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> he was a central figure in the "<a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodgy_Dossier_283b.html" title="Dodgy Dossier">dodgy dossier</a>" controversy. A dossier on Iraqi concealment of Weapons of mass destruction and human rights abuses under <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was published on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a>. The dossier purported to be based on intelligence but a large section had been taken (unacknowledged) from a PhD thesis available on the internet.</p>
<p>A few months later he became embroiled in further controversy after the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> reporter <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Andrew Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> broadcast claims that the government had included evidence it knew to be false (famously described as "sexed up" by another BBC journalist) an earlier dossier (about Iraqi <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_Mass_Destruction_d4cd.html" title="Weapons of Mass Destruction">Weapons of Mass Destruction</a>). In a later newspaper article Gilligan said that his source had specifically identified Campbell himself as responsible for the alleged exaggerations. Campbell demanded a retraction and apology from the BBC, but none was forthcoming.</p>
<p>The BBC's source <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kelly_57b7.html" title="David Kelly">David Kelly</a> identified himself to his employers at the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Defence_%28United_Kingdom%29_f84c.html" title="Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Defence</a>. The government released this news and under questioning from newspapers desperate to identify the source gave sufficient hints for his identity to become public. Kelly committed suicide shortly afterward and the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_inquiry.html" title="Hutton inquiry">Hutton inquiry</a> into the circumstances of his death pushed Campbell further into the limelight. The Inquiry showed that Campbell had been working closely with the Intelligence Services, and made suggestions about the wording of the dossier. He had also been keen that Kelly's identity be made public writing in his diary "It would fuck Gilligan if that were his source". However, Lord Hutton cleared Campbell of acting improperly, as the Joint Intelligence Committee had taken all editorial decisions. Hutton also found that Kelly's name would have had to be made public to avoid allegations of a cover-up. The Hutton report was widely criticised in the media, however, and Campbell's "Presidential"-style press conference afterwards was perceived by some to be misjudged, with Campbell attacked for appearing to gloat over the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s misfortune.</p>

<p>Campbell's unhappiness and wish to resign had already been common knowledge but the fallout from the Hutton Inquiry meant he had to stand down earlier than intended. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> he announced his resignation from <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Downing_Street_fec5.html" title="10 Downing Street">10 Downing Street</a>. Throughout his time in <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downing_Street_d755.html" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a>, he kept a diary which eventually totalled two million words. Selected extracts will be published by the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_House_0f9b.html" title="Random House">Random House Group</a> in a volume titled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blair_Years_5fbb.html" title="The Blair Years">The Blair Years</a></i>, which Campbell says will not be released until after Tony Blair leaves office<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.

<p>Campbell worked once again for the Labour Party in the run up to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">May 2005 General Election</a> <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=608231" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=608231" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p><a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Clive_Woodward_34e8.html" title="Sir Clive Woodward">Sir Clive Woodward</a> recruited Campbell to manage relations with the press for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_Lions_91ee.html" title="British and Irish Lions">British and Irish Lions</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_British_and_Irish_Lions_tour_to_New_Zealand_09d5.html" title="2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand">tour to New Zealand</a> in 2005. The appointment proved to be controversial with Campbell being roundly criticised by many in the media for his predilection for <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_%28public_relations%29.html" title="Spin (public relations)">spin</a> and for his lack of rugby knowledge and experience. They also resented the fact that Campbell wrote an exclusive column for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> during the tour which they saw as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>. However on the Lions return to the British Isles after their unsuccessful tour Woodward praised Campbell for having done a "fantastic job".</p>

<p>Campbell is generally regarded as believing in a more traditional form of Labour politics than Tony Blair. His partner Fiona Millar has openly opposed Labour policy on education. Since his retirement from Downing Street, Campbell has been highly critical of political reporting in general and the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a> group of newspapers in particular. Like Tony Blair, Campbell attempted (without complete success) to shield his children from the press attention which their father's job attracted. When briefing the press, he was known for a no-nonsense approach, but did on occasion alleviate it with humour: after a series of notably poor predictions about a Government reshuffle he distributed <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_Disc_08eb.html" title="Compact Disc">CDs</a> by the band <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garbage_%28band%29.html" title="Garbage (band)">Garbage</a> to those reporters who had made the most errors.
