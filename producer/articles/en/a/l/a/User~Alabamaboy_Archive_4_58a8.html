<h2><span class="mw-headline">Chemically Imbalanced Comedy</span></h2>
<p>I am not that computer savy and was really trying to work on my page for the past few days. I don't understand why my theater commpanies accomplishments don't meet your needs to be worthy of this site? Your online example says if someone won an award it makes them notable. We have won many awards (if you consider being accepted into comedy festivals all around the US and Canada awards) and we have been written and reviewd in every major paper in Chicago (including the Tribune, Suntimes, Reader, TimeOut). Our Theater has a major influnce on Chicago Talent as well as helping foster talent across the country with our annual comedy festival.</p>
<p>I am just not sure what more we can do to become worthy of your site. Please contact if you have a moment and let me know. I was trying to follow your rules and update with more and more info but I have a young 2 year old daughter who takes my attention from the computer often.</p>
<p>Thanks for you time on this matter. Angela McMahon cicomedy@hotmail.com</p>

<p>Why did you delete the informative Robin Robinson article that included true facts and relevant information about this noteworthy African American journalist?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I'm quite familiar with Robin Robinson, having once heard her speak. However, the article you created was a thinly veiled attack article which included unfounded rumours about her. As such it was deleted as an attack page. Perhaps someone an editor will write a real article about her instead of an attack page.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 14:31, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You just deleted a post regarding the Stylehive, which we posted. Wondering what we did wrong? We wrote it to be as factual and informative as possible, tried to follow all the conventions. You mentioned some sort of copyright violation which is not correct, and then reference a blog post about us that has nothing to do with that. What is the deal?

<p>Honestly, I just didn't realize the level of vitriol that had occurred on the page. I certainly would've backed you up against that sort of behavior. I just saw the ping-ponging on this link, looked at the link itself, wasn't sure whether I agreed with its inclusion or not, and figured I'd pop in to ask about it. At any rate, it's as much my fault for not realizing the backdrop against which this had occurred. No hard feelings on my end, really, and hope you feel the same. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 01:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WikiProject Elizabethan Theatre</span></h2>
<p>Greetings! Since you are one of the three people who post frequently on the William Shakespeare talk page, I thought I would include you in this.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed, I've been trying to push WikiProject Theatre a bit. Someone on the talk page noted that the project is really very large and I agree. So in order to break up some of the work and concentrate it, I have decided to break up WikiProject Theatre into a series of smaller theatre projects. The first of these is WikiProject Elizbethan theatre. This project, spanning the 84 years between the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign to 1642 when the Puritans closed the theatres, covers such names as Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson. It aims to expand Wikipedia's coverage of the Elizabethan theatre as well as bringing the articles up to a high level of quality (close to or attaining FA status).</p>
<p>This project has not actually been launched as an official project yet, but the 2 main pages have been created on subpages of WikiProject Theatre and can be viewed here. I would like to get some feedback and suggestions before I officially launch the project. Please feel free to become a member of the project if you'd like. Please leave any messages regarding this here and I will watch your page. Thanks! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 20:36, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - thanks for taking on this project documenting wikipedians that have passed on.</p>
<p>Hume was an old friend. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:VEwiYlzsBhQJ:www.herald.ns.ca/stories/2005/07/23/fObituariesobit620.raw.html+%22Hume+Cottnam+Llewellyn+Smith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:VEwiYlzsBhQJ:www.herald.ns.ca/stories/2005/07/23/fObituariesobit620.raw.html+%22Hume+Cottnam+Llewellyn+Smith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a link to google's cache of his obit.</p>
<p>Hume was struck by a massive heart attack when he was within hours of completing a restoration project on his church's carillon, which he had worked on for over a decade.</p>
<p>He was one of the most fascinating and unusual people I've ever met, and a singularly gifted programmer, pipe organist, mathematician, electrician, plumber, carpenter, historian and genealogist. He had no use for material posessions and never really figured out how to deal with the world outside his home.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help containing this vandal. It seems that today he was back with a furious vengenance as he is starting to realize that this site is sick of him and measures are in effect to track and block on site. By my count, 4 new sockpuppets today, a rash of recreating previously deleted articles, along with sockpuppetvandalism of user pages and the main Roitr vandal page. Anyway, could you please take a look at <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDuduvak_a5da.html" title="User:Duduvak">User:Duduvak</a>. He is <b>SWEARING</b> that is in no way connected to Roitr.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Semiprotection</span></h2>
<p>To deal with the Shakespeare article first: there was support on the talk page for permanent (!) semiprotection because of some moderate-to-high vandalism. There was also talk of leaving it protected for protracted periods, e.g. until June. This tends to happen with articles that editors are fond of, but part of allowing this project to function is a trust in the 'wikiprocess' and any level of protection is a breach of that trust. If people don't want to handle the vandalism, they should probably be writing on paper instead. It had been several days of semiprotection followed quickly by several more days of semiprotection and so I decided that we should give the article time to breathe, and prove that the sky does not fall if the article is unprotected. I came across it as part of my regular clean-outs of <a href="../../../s/e/m/CAT%7ESEMI_df89.html" title="CAT:SEMI">CAT:SEMI</a>; I seem to be the only admin who <i>ever</i> does this, and the number of protected articles rises endlessly because few admins bother to release their protections. I have decided some time ago to work on the principle that a protection older than, say, 24 hours is forgotten absent evidence to the contrary. Most vandals get bored in 24 hours. They're only bored geeks (like the rest of us) and they don't usually have an attention span of days and weeks. If they do, they generally get banned insted. So when I find an article protected for more than a few days, I lift the protection without consultation. I figure if admins don't want me to do it, they'd remember to do it themselves.</p>
<p>I've only very recently started dropping messages to certain admins. I've left notes with admins who have forgotten about very lengthy semiprotections and they are only to tell that I <i>already have</i> lifted it, rather than to discuss the matter with them. I've left the occasional one with a new admin, just to give them a poke while they're still 'fresh'. So you're among the vast bulk of admins whose protections I have lifted without discussion. I don't think there is much to discuss over whether a vandal has gone or not: the only way to find out is to unprotect and keep unprotecting. But I'm sorry if you felt I was being rude: that was not my intention at all. It's just that, with (as this evening) 60+ articles (or 100+ last week) in <a href="../../../s/e/m/CAT%7ESEMI_df89.html" title="CAT:SEMI">CAT:SEMI</a> and absolutely zero response when I post on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> (which I have done, twice) I figure I should just go ahead and not spend additional time dropping 100+ talk page messages.</p>
<p>KKK is an editorial dispute: full protection avoids discrimination among users and is also a form of "editorial deprivation" that usually applies pressure to the warriors because they <i>want</i> to edit and know they can't until they cool off or it demonstrates that there is no true desire to discuss and that the page protection is pointless anyway.

<dd>PS. I'm not particularly 'passionate' about protection issues, but I am firmly of the opinion that we shouldn't allow this wiki to become locked up by accidental creep. The project would never have gotten out of the starting blocks if that had ever been allowed. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:00, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds good to me. With regards to Shakespeare, I wouldn't have allowed the protection to last that long (even if that was what some editors wanted). If the article follows the previous pattern, the anonymous vandalism will pick up over the next few days. If it gets unmanagable, I'll semi-protect for a day or two then take the protection off. However, I'd prefer to leave it off and will just tell the other article editors that we have to get really swamped with vandals before I semi-protect it again. As for the KKK article, the protection has put pressure on the editors involved in the edit dispute and I believe we'll be done with the issue within a few days. Anyway, apologies if I came across as irritated or anything. You're doing good work and I'm glad there's an admin keeping an eye out on the protected pages.

<dd>Not at all. I can fully understand why admins may feel I am just disregarding them at times, but really I'm not as I do read the logs, history and article talk page (usually) before I unprotect, unless it's a <i>really</i> old protection. They made a choice in good judgement, and I've reversed it. I can see how that might irk someone; especially when it happens twice in an hour! (Actually, I don't reverse it. I just consider it to have expired, but to have been right at the time.) By all means re-semi Shakespeare if things get bad, and then lift it soon afterwards. And good luck with KKK — that must be very hard work to mediate. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:33, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linkspam</span></h2>
<p>Dear Alabamaboy, It was not my intention to create linkspam, a word with which I was unfamiliar until now. Many of the links you noticed do go to the same general website but they all provide either soundbites or information which can be found nowhere else on the web, to the best of my knowledge. The soundbites are not for sale but merely give listeners an idea of how the music in question sounds which I would think serves an educational purpose. It is true that the works described are available for sale in printed format, but no one is under any obligation and can listen all they desire. As mentioned, the soundbites are not for sale and the website does not sell CDs. So someone who likes the music they her in the soundbite would have to first find out if there was a recording (In many case there are none. Some soundbites were from live performances) and then go and obtain it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, I am sorry if I have violated a Wikipedia police, it was not my intention. I would not have included these links if the soundbites had been available anywhere else. Yours sincerely, Santo Neuenwelt</p>
<p><a name="Copyright_Issues" id="Copyright_Issues"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Copyright Issues</span></h2>
<p>Dear Alabamaboy, I guess I should have read the copyright section first before submitting my own material which does appear on the website I help with. While I did copy, verbatim, what I wrote, the submissions I made are not under copyright. I would imagine there is some way to alert you that one is submitting one's own material and that it has appeared on the website. I don't have the time to write all over or paraphrase my own work, but maybe it's not necessary...</p>
<p>Mostly, this was for articles on subjects which did not exist or existed in a one sentence form. It was done in the spirit to help. Sorry I did not follow the necessary guidelines. Yours sincerely, Santo Neuenwelt.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Have Taken Your Advice</span></h2>
<p>Dear Alabamaboy, Persuant to your suggestion, I sent an e-mail to Wikipedia with the sample release GDFL license release you suggested allowing the use of material which appears on my website. I copied a list of all the articles I either created or added to along with the release and hope that they can be restored because it will be a long time before I will have the time to do it all over again. I also mentioned that you said I could reinsert the links because it was of soundbites not available anywhere else and not for sale etc. I do not know whether my contributions and these links can be restored automatically, but I hope so. If in the future, I have time to contribute and the material is mine and comes from my website, will I have to ask for permission to quote from it verbatim or will my release be enough to cover any future submissions. Also, how long, approximately, would it be until I hear whether my permission to quote and release have been approved? (I am in no rush, because like I said, I doubt I will have time to do it all over again for quite a while, but I was curious. I could probably add the links again.) Anyway, thanks. Yours sincerely, Santo Neuenwelt.</p>

<dd>I understand what you are saying. However, in cased of AfDs if there is no consensus to delete then the article is kept. Since the votes were in favor of keeping, and the article was being linked to very prominently by a major media figure and was only one day short of the end of the deletion process, I decided to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and end the AfD. I think this is the best thing for Wikipedia because in the end there did not appear to be consensus for deletion and having the article up for deletion while being linked to by such a prominent blogger would have created bad press for Wikipedia. I understand that my actions will irritate some people and I accept any repercussions that might come my way.

<p>Dear Alabamaboy, Thank you for resstoring some of my articles (and for your guidance with regard to copyright and GNU). Your restoration has saved me a lot of time which at the moment I do not really have.</p>
<p>I have 2 questions for you.</p>
<p>1. Several of my revisions and or links I made were not restored. I am assuming that this is unintentional or just that you have not got to it yet. In many cases, the stub entry had little or no info and my revision provided 2-3 paragraphs of biography. In other cases the links were not restored. Here is a listing of those revisions not restored:</p>
<p><b>Woldemar Bargiel</b>-info missing / <b>Karel Bendl</b>-some info missing / <b>Arthur Foote</b>--info and link missing / <b>Friedrich Gernsheim</b>-some info and link / <b>Alexander Gretchaninov</b> (this is the preferred spelling by the way, not Gretchaninoff the older less used one)--bio and link missing / <b>Heinrich von Herzogenberg</b>--link missing / <b>Johann Nepomuk Hummel</b>--link missing, possibly info, I can't remember <b>Heinrich Marschner</b>--bio and link missing / <b>George Onslow</b> (The entry which lists him as Georges is incorrect--I am an Onslow specialist having written a book on his string quartets and although he was part French, his name is George not Georges. How can I, or can you correct this. / <b>Joseph Rheinberger</b>--link missing / <b>Wilhelm Stenhammar</b>--some info and 2 links missing / <b>Arthur Sullivan</b>--link missing and maybe info / <b>Ambroise Thomas</b>--link missing / <b>Robert Volkmann</b>--link missing /</p>
<p>2. I added biographical information to the page on Friedrich Kuhlau which was verbatim from my website. I am assuming this is okay now that I gave the release, nonetheless, I created a References section and stated that the info was from my website by a GNU release had been given. Is this the okay way to proceed?</p>

  1. Whether a "rough consensus" has been achieved (see below)
  2. Use common sense and respect the judgment and feelings of Wikipedia participants.
  3. As a general rule, don't delete pages you nominate for deletion. Let someone else do it.
  4. When in doubt, don't delete.

<p>This piece that I have contributed to wikipedia is the one closest to my heart and widely considered to be my best by the community. Until recently I have recieved no complaints about it and it is still viewed as a model by others who want to work an article up to featured status. Staxringold has nominated it for removal from FAC, frankly I'm so disillusioned with Wikipedia it's tempting just to leave for good, but I digress. I want you to review the article and the FARC. The article is old and largely intact, so the need for update to current FAC standards is actionable. However some of the complaints are not, sources are limited because the subject is limited and some of the assertions made in the complaints are simply inaccurate and opinionate accusing the lead of being odd and not incuding the infromation in the article (for example that the city is known for its Civil War, Civil Rights, and Railroad histroy) when their is an History section that includes details about all of those events. Please get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 01:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since the issue of removing its FA status has been broached, I want to do more than bring the article up to minimum standards. The article has been view as one of the best city articles even as a model on how to make a city FA, for some time and it is that status which I want to restore. I've added thirteen inline references, more than many city FAs, I intend to add more when I obtain more source material. I'm not opposed to adding more either. I am considering breaking off some of the famous people and sites lists, to a separate list page. However, since most other FA city articles have something similar, I believe that the sentiment expressed by Straxringold is a personal preference and therefore I do not want to remove all of them. I want to reduce them to the most important ones, perhaps aligning the lists with pics in the section and providing a link to a more extensive list. I'm also planning on rearranging the pictures and adding a few new ones. I'd also like to review the main text to see where it can be improved—your opinion solicited—and I am going to try to create a map of central Marshall similar to the map in <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Dallas_d759.html" title="Downtown Dallas">Downtown Dallas</a> that can appear either this article or a separate article on Central Marshall, which is a better idea than creating a separate article for every significant building—I'm waxing mergeist in my old age. I am interested in how you think that the lead could be improved.

<dd>When I looked at the articles they were blatent copyright violations of info on other websites. They were also link spam and advertising and vanity pages but the copyright violation was why I deleted them. For what its worth, when you find link spam on Wikipedia the odds are really high that the people who put that up also copied the text of the article, or major parts of it, from somewhere else on the web.

<dd>Yes, I would like you to restore it. While we only have 75 customers, we are on the forefront of a new way to define software applications. The traditional way has been to use a combination of Word, Powerpoint, Visio, and other tools to write the software definition and specifications in text. Our unique and paradigm-shifting approach lets business users quickly create rapid prototypes or simulations of any software application - before doing any coding or programming. Essentially, we are doing for the software industry what CAD software did for the manufacturing industry -- and we are poised for the same kind of growth that arose in that industry when it was first introduced. -- <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumbarger_5b32.html" title="User:Thumbarger">User:thumbarger</a> 14:50 17 April 2006</dd>

<p>I urge you to change your vote on this. The article is original research at its very core-- the reason it has gone months without verification is because its <i>unverifiable</i>-- its a well written opinion. Could you explain to me how anything could verify that "Cool is feminine energy"?

<dd>Your thoughts with respect to the capacious discussion that has taken place at both the AfD page and the AfD talk page well encapsulate my thinking on the matter; I have been altogether amazed that at the wide-ranging and strident debate that has taken place, parts of it altogether irrelevant to an AfD determination. I feel altogether sorry for the admin who closes the debate; it surely is easy to dismiss such a long page as necessarily reflecting no consensus, but that determination should not be made exclusively in view of a lengthy debate's having taken place--nevertheless, I expect the article will be closed as no consensus.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Delete of Integra Realty Resources</span></h2>
<p>Being deleted by Alabamaboy is a major kudo in my book, and I am honored at the time you spend to educate a "newbie wikipedian", not even sure if the two words are mutually exclusive, perhaps you are newbie or wikipedian, but not both?. I believe the Integra piece was a "stub", not a vanity piece since the company is a peer with CBRE and Cushman Wakefield in the arena of real estate valuation(both in Wikipedia with same substance problem); and Integra is 3 times larger than both- although privately held. The Chairman of Integra sits on the Federal Reserve Board of the US currently, and other notable (and historical) reasons for inclusion (not all were mentioned- hence stub). I have a personal interest in all things related to economic valuation of real estate, and like your speciality in African American writers- I intended on authoring and linking all of the relevant "value" concepts in Wiki. There are notable missing resources (Appraisal Institute, formed 1922 USA) although FRICS is mentioned. Some value theory information is contained, but there is a TON more missing. Integra probably relates to all of this tangentially, but perhaps work on other resources might convince you that this is not a local accounting company meeting the vanity criterion; thanks for the delete though - I'll take it in stride. <a href="../../../a/m/g/User%7EAmgraziano_794e.html" title="User:Amgraziano">Amgraziano</a> 21:24, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing out that the CBRE and Cushman Wakefield articles have issues. I'll check them out and see if they also should be deleted. Your article made no mention of the significance of the organization and read like many pieces of linkspam which people place in Wikipedia. As I said on your talk page, if you can indicate why the subject is really notable, you are free to re-create the article, making sure to cite any verifiable sources.

<dd>That author created an entire series of articles based on copy ripped from academic university websites.

<p>Hey Alabama,</p>
<p>Why did you block me after I edited the article on the Montgomery Academy?</p>
<p>I am a great source of information on that school. The material which currently shows is very biased and mostly opinion. My changes did not remove much from the original article. They just pointed out where there was opinion and distinguished those opinions from fact.</p>
<p>I really resent your treatment of me, by the way. That was rude; blocking me, accusing me of vandalism, and the arrogant tone of your message. This is a community site. And you are blocking both me and my contributions for no good reason.</p>
<p>What is your beef against the Academy? Do you have the minutes from the founding meetings? Are you even from Montgomery? How can you say it was founded as a "seg school?" Did you not read the biography linked at the bottom? Do you think that man was racist?</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Mediation</span></h3>
<p>First, off a caveat—I am in poor health and have some problems concentrating so please take that into account as you consider my advice. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a member of the mediation committee, and am a former advocate. I consider this to be a consultative response, and as such you may wish to mention that you sought my advice in the mediation process.</p>
<p>Mediation is justified, but if the user refuses to amend her behavior it will likely fail and move on to arbitration. At this point the user will either escalate her criticism of you or give up and move on. Her <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on you, especially her violation of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">No legal threats</a>, (one of the earliest reasons a prominient user was banned, and by Jimbo himself nonetheless). Her refusal to provide sources and your repeated attempts and willingness to meet her conditions should work to your advantage in the arbitration process. If she can find a source, or an amicable agreement can be reached from mediation you both will benefit. In the meantime just continue behaving as you have, if the mediation process is to fail let her be the cause. You have have policy on your side and you have met this challenge to your work with <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>.</p>
<p>In my opinion so long as you can keep your understandable frustration under control you have nothing to fear but a few baseless personal attacks. Rememeber everything is permanent and public her, don't post anything that you may regret latter, even the most seasoned admins, myself included, can and have fallen into that trap. Let me know if this is helpful or if there is anyhing else that I can do.

<p>No problem. First of all, you have been much more amenable than the other editor, and all of your actions have been within policies and guidelines, so I have no complaints. You do appear to want to stick to your guns though, which is understandable. The next step really depends on what you and the Anonymous want to do. I'm happy to continue mediating, although I don't think for the moment it will get anywhere. If the situation doesn't improve for a few days I would recommend taking it to an RfC, or alternatively to the Mediation committee, who have a more formal structure. Although there is only so far mediation can go without willing on the other side.</p>
<p>I will refrain from making any changes until the mediation is definately over if that is ok with you, in certain cases it can help for someone to take unilateral action, but I think in this case it would probably cement her against me, wrecking any (possible) future deal. I appreciate your cool headedness and if you want me to comment on an RfC I would be more than willing, thanks :) - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancisTyers_daab.html" title="User talk:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 13:41, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is changing fairly quickly, to be honest, I've been happy with pretty much every version. If she is convinced that we're back to square one then I think we have to look at our options. My initial suggestion would be to ask for an RfC on the article, get both sides to present their opinions and then ask for outside opinions. I can ask a few people to comment on it, and in a formal structure such as an RfC it might have more weight. I'm going to try going through one more iteration of this, but if there are continued baseless complaints then I think something more formal might be in order. On the bright side, the article on <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segregation_academies.html" title="Segregation academies">segregation academies</a> has been improved :) Let me know if you want me to set up the RfC or if you are happy doing it yourself... - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancisTyers_daab.html" title="User talk:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 15:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If it keeps going an RfC will help in two ways. At the moment the Anon believes that it is between you and her pretty much, an RfC will bring more people to comment. It will then be between several random Wikipedians and her, which will be much harder to get her own way by the current methods. The RfC is also largely a one pass thing. She'll have a chance to put her side and then we'll see other opinions. Personally I think the article is better without the Griffin reference, but her characterisation of the Guardian as a "tabloid" is pretty hilarious, I refrained from commenting on that — and you should have to remove sourced information. I seriously think that if we can't crack it in a day then an RfC will bring a closure to the problem.

<p>Ultimately one anonymous editor spent a great deal of time questioning your sources without much success. The process, as I see it, eventually worked out in Wikipedia's favor as the conflict resulted in more specific sources supporting the obvious historical context as well as the additional material you provided about the current status of the academy. The worst thing that happened was a great deal of harsh words, verbiose argument, and external review that really accomplished nothing. This is an unfortunate characteristic of Wikipedia, but I'm not sure I see a way around it. I'll do what I can to limit the lengths to which I go to express myself, but as you can see already, my self control is thin. Anyone can call a source into question. That is true always and everywhere. Wikipedia is helping the world to realize the need for critical thinking about reference sources. It seems to me that the Montgomery Academy conflict is an example where verifiability eventually wins out over bluster, even if the bluster leaves a sour taste. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:54, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that a reasonable consensus has developed on the proper treatment of MA's history. At this point I think it would be safe to no longer respond to the anonymous editor's whining on the talk page and to revert edits that clearly deviate from consensus and thereby violate our understanding of the requirements of an NPOV. If this course turns into an edit conflict I think we could look for more outside opinions. I agree that continuing to argue on the talk page is useless. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 02:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">reinsertions</span></h3>
<p>I am quite aware of the agony that brought us here. I think it's time to look at the article itself in the context of an encyclopedia, not in the context of a dispute which I think has been satisfactorily resolved. I believe, as do you, that Montgomery Academy was brought into being and operated as a classic example of a segregation academy. I think that this is laid out pretty clearly even in my slimmed-down version from last night. I don't see the need for the article to belabor the point by piling up tertiary sources to support what should be an obvious conclusion. The improvements to the <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segregation_academies.html" title="Segregation academies">segregation academies</a> article provide an opportunity for general references to be used elsewhere. Those that specifically mention MA were left in. The 1983 court case really truly doesn't have much to do with MA except that the plaintiffs listed it as a discriminatory institution benefitting unfairly from IRS policy. That much is relevant - the details of the decision are not. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 13:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
