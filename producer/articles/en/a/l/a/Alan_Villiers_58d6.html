<p>Alan John Villiers was the second son of Australian poet and union leader Leon Joseph Villiers. The young Villiers grew up on the docks watching the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merchant_ship.html" title="Merchant ship">merchant ships</a> come in and out of the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_of_Melbourne_f899.html" title="Port of Melbourne">Port of Melbourne</a> and longed for the day in which he too could sail out to sea.</p>
<p>Leaving home at the age of 15, he joined the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barque.html" title="Barque">barque</a> <i>Rothesay Bay</i> as an apprentice. The <i>Rothesay Bay</i> operated in the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasman_Sea_e068.html" title="Tasman Sea">Tasman Sea</a> trading between Australia and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Villiers was a natural seaman. He learned quickly and gained the respect of his shipmates.</p>
<p>An accident on board the barque <i>Lawhill</i> beached Villiers in 1922, by then a seasoned [[Able Seaman (occupation)|Able Seaman]], and he sought employment at the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mercury_a84f.html" title="The Mercury">Hobart Mercury</a> newspaper in <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> as a <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a> as he recovered from his wounds.</p>

<p>The call of the sea was strong, and soon Villiers was back at sea when the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whaling.html" title="Whaling">whaling</a> factory ship <i>Sir James Clark Ross</i> with five whale chasers in tow came calling in late 1923. His accounts of the trip would eventually be published as <i>Whaling in the Frozen South</i>. Named for the discoverer of the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Sea_6846.html" title="Ross Sea">Ross Sea</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Clark_Ross_1d8d.html" title="James Clark Ross">James Clark Ross</a>, the <i>Ross</i> was the largest whale factory ship in the world, weighing in at 12,000 tons and heading for the Ross Sea, the last whale stronghold left. Villiers writes: <i>"We had caught 228, most of them blues, the biggest over 100 feet long. These yielded 17,000 barrels of oil; we had hoped for at least 40,000, with luck 60,000."</i></p>
<p>Villiers' passage on board the <a href="http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/12.html" class="external text" title="http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/12.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Herzogin Cecile</i></a> in 1927 would result in <i>Falmouth for Orders</i> and introduce him to the de Cloux family, who later became his partners in the barque <i>Parma</i>. <i>By Way of Cape Horn</i> came as a result of his harrowing experiences on board the <i>Grace Harwar</i> in 1929.</p>
<p>The three-masted barque <i>Grace Harwar</i> was a beautiful ship as the <i>"wind in her rigging called imperiously as she lay at the pier at Wallaroo"</i>. Yet as Villiers stood on the dock, a wharf laborer warned <i>"Don't ship out in her! She's a killer."</i> The warning would prove true, as Villiers' friend Ronald Walker would be lost by the time <i>Grace Harwar</i> made <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. More than 40 years old at the time, she had <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnacles.html" title="Barnacles">barnacles</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algae.html" title="Algae">algae</a> growing along her waterline. "Dirty bottoms make slow ships, and slow ships make hard passages." But Villiers here showed an early desire that would continue throughout his life to document the great sailing ships before it was too late, and <i>Grace</i> was one of the last working full-riggers. With a small ill-paid crew and no need for <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a>, such vessels undercut <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_ships.html" title="Steam ships">steam ships</a>, and maybe 20 ships were still involved in the trade. The ill-fated voyage took 138 days, the <i>Grace</i> the last of the fleet for the year, but the experiences netted some 6,000 feet of film and many of the great images we have of the period.</p>

<p>Villiers reunited with the de Cloux family in 1931, becoming a partner with them in the four-masted barque <i>Parma</i>. Continuing in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grain_%28fruit%29.html" title="Grain (fruit)">grain</a> trade, he would prove to be an able shiphandler, winning the unofficial "grain race" between the ships of the trade, arriving in 103 days despite broaching in a gale in 1932. In 1933, she made it in 83 days.</p>
<p>Selling his shares back to the de Cloux family, Villiers then went on to purchase the <i>Georg Stage</i> in 1934. A <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_rigged_ship.html" title="Full rigged ship">fully rigged sailing ship</a> of 400 tons, originally built in 1882 by Burmeister &amp; Wain in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, she was employed as a sailing <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_ship.html" title="School ship">school ship</a> by Stiftelsen Georg Stages Minde.</p>
<p>Saving her from the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrapyard.html" title="Scrapyard">scrapyard</a>, Villiers renamed her the <i><a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Conrad_%28ship%29_9204.html" title="Joseph Conrad (ship)">Joseph Conrad</a></i> after the accomplished seaman and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Conrad_a506.html" title="Joseph Conrad">author</a> of such nautical favorites as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nigger_of_the_%27Narcissus%27_462d.html" title="The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'">The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</a></i>, <i>Typhoon</i>, and <i>The Shadow-Line</i></p>

<p>Returning almost two years later, Villiers sold the <i>Joseph Conrad</i> to George Huntington Hartford, and published two books of their adventures, <i>Cruise of the "Conrad"</i> and <i>Stormalong</i>.
