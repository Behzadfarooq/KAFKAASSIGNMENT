Any direct e-mail or fax # to Alan Greenspan? I have a confidential letter to be mailed to him. Is he in London now? Or in NY city?</p>
<ul>
<li>is that some kind of a joke ^? you have a confidential letter to Alan Greenspan but don't know how to contact him, so you decide to go on Wikipedia to learn about him and see if his fax, cell phone, etc is on his page?? You would think if someone had a confidential letter for Alan Greenspan you would know his contact information if you couldn't contact him personally or otherwise know him enough to get it without resorting to Wikipedia... That is the most retarded thing I've ever heard. -Anon</li>

Yes, it is totally absurd to think that the lower classes should have any contact with their betters, the nerve. He may know that we don't need a higher minimum wage, but to imagine that he would mix with the natives is ridiculous.</p>

<p>As the article states, Greenspan was born to a Jewish family, Grynszpan. Whether or not he currently considers himself a Jew is up to him, I would think - see <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a></p>
<p>His father-in-law (as of 1997) was the president of a synagogue from 1952 to 1992, but Greenspan and Andrea Mitchell were married in what seems to have been a secular ceremony (Ruth Bader Ginsburg officiated at the Inn at Little Washington)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Their descision to have a non-religious, public ceremony may have been for many complex reasons, and may have nothing to do with their beliefs and relgious practices. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamatva_b5ee.html" title="User:Samatva">Samatva</a> 14:54, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm re-adding the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag because I have yet to find proof that his middle name is "C." I've been searching for the past week, and nothing indicates what his full name is. Some websites list him as "Alan J.

=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>OK, I've seen the "J" as well, but I also note the few sources from them I've checked don't have a citation.&#160;;-) Considering the citations are coming off of the web, and "the web" has both "J" and "C", what kind of citation will it take? I'm not trying to get defensive about my citation... just noting the difficulty of using web citations when there is conflicting information on the web. Hopefully it will be in his book. (And, I've yet to find his middle name on the web either.)</p>
<p>=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>I'm looking for at least two reliable sources that list his middle name. At least one news source is necessary. Also, it's pretty uncommon for a person to only have a single letter for their middle name, so beyond figuring out whether it's a J or a C, what the letter stands for is also important. It seems very odd to me that his middle name is so difficult to come by. Thanks for any help. --<a href="../../../m/z/m/User%7EMZMcBride_b1f6.html" title="User:MZMcBride">MZMcBride</a> 19:43, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>None of the Greenspan biographies, none of the official pages, none of the NY Times articles include any middle name OR initial. That "C" on the HTML page at the Senate isn't even confirmed by the full PDF it links to. One of the <b>top</b> Google results for "alan c greenspan" is <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_archive_Miscellaneous_2006_August_13_a38e.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk archive/Miscellaneous/2006 August 13">this Wikipedia reference desk question</a> from a couple of weeks ago. I'm leaning toward the opinion he may not have a middle name. Here's a source I'd possibly accept: <a href="http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/annualdinner/pasthonorees.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/annualdinner/pasthonorees.cfm" rel="nofollow">Columbia U</a>. In any case, unless we can confirm a middle name, I don't think we should confirm a middle initial when there seems to be confusion. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The housing market has yet to really "bubble," that is, increase exponentially over a short period of time and then burst. Even while many economists predicted a burst of the housing market in 2003, 2004, and 2005, it's decline has been far more gradual than many expected. I'm just questioning whether we should call it a bubble, when we also call The South Sea Company and the 2001 Dot Com markets 'bubble' markets. Those grew exponentially over a short period of time and then burst... housing hasn't exactly done that. The very definition of a 'bubble' is that you cannot tell it was a bubble until a good deal of time after the burst. Arguably, the real estate market has yet to crash and many economists have simply been wrong, even when talking about inflated markets like those of the coasts. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_brazell_1c06.html" title="User:Michael brazell">Mike Murray</a> 20:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I deleted it at one time because I wasn't clear that it was generally accepted, but then another editor came back and restored it and sourced it pretty well. Since then I've seen many, many more references in the news to the real estate bubble and Greenspan's role in it. I never heard that the very definition of a bubble is you can't tell until a good deal of time after the burst. Investopedia defines bubble as "1. An economic cycle characterized by rapid expansion followed by a contraction" and speculative bubble as "a temporary market condition created through excessive buying, and an unfounded run-up in prices occurs." I think what we've seen in the case of housing prices is indeed a rapid expansion. To me the section seems okay. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 23:02, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's something we should leave up for now as fears of an imminent collapse in the housing market persist. However, regardless of the first of three definitions offered by investopedia, bubbles end by popping, not slowly deflating. If we see a gradual easing of home prices that ends with prices settling lower than they were at their peak, but significantly higher than when the increase began, I have trouble characterizing the housing market as it existed in the early part of the decade as a "bubble."

<dd>Please revise the 'Housing bubble' blame on Greenspan. No one that has actually looked at the data could pin this on Fed Policy <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2005/840/ifdp840.pdf" class="external text" title="https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2005/840/ifdp840.pdf" rel="nofollow">see: "International Capital Flows and U.S. Interest Rates"</a>. The real culprit is consumer spending on imported goods, the profits of which end up in foreign banks that in turn invest in US T-bills, reducing these rates by as much as 150 pts, or about 40% of their ~2.5% rate. As yeilds for 10 year T-bills drop, investment spill over to the slightly riskier and thus higher interest mortgages, increasing their demand; this competition drives their rates lower. There is no correlation between the Fed and mortgages over the past 4 years, as even a cursory review of the data shows:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lower Fed rates influence lower credit card, construction loans, and other short term borrowing, which induces consumer spending. This section might as well read "...Greenspan conspired with Bush to pump up the housing 'bubble', by sending money through ten or more arms length transaction across multiple continents...etc."</dd>

The reason I'm not getting too involved, however, is because I'm not convinced the housing market will crash. I think they'll be a downward adjustment, but I don't think there'll be a crash. If we don't see a housing market crash in the next couple years, I think the label of bubble will go away and that entire section will be pulled down anyway.

<p>Greenspan's legacy is stability in spite of high government spending (both Democracts and Republicans), Wall Street Sirens and their mesmerized investors, and the foreign money markets proping up our houseing markets.</p>
<p>The Fed is not an 'Economy Tzar'. All the fed can do is state their reseach to congress on monetary policy, and change the Discount Rate <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>This does not translate into mortgage rates, and can not directly create a 'housing bubble' which we all fear but is not definable yet as is exemplifed in the reference to a 2004 Business Week Article (it is August 2006 as I write and still no burst).</p>
<p>My advice is to drop the politics, and talk economics. Dnakos 01:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you source your edit that Greenspan supported Clinton's deficit reduction plan? That really is not how I remember it.

<dd>My source was chapters six and seven of Bob Woodward's book <i>Maestro</i>. I didn't cite it specificlaly at that point since the entire book was listed as a reference for the Wikipedia article as a whole. If you need something more specific, page 110 in the hardback edition states, "The only real Republican support [for the deficit reduction plan] had come from Greenspan." Woodward also cited Greenspan's July 20 testimony before the House Banking Committee. Also, I don't think Clinton basing his plan on Greenspan's advice and Greenspan supporting the plan are mutually exclusive. If anyhting, I'd expect Greenspan to support a plan he so heavily influenced.Jim Campbell 19:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alan Greenspan's greatest achievements have nothing to do with economics or with the US Ecnomy or with US markets...</p>
<p>they are / were his masterful manipulation of the US esp media to take credit for what he had almost nothing to do with ... -- that is, the handling of the market crisis in 1991 when Salmon Bros almost collapsed ...(SEE THIS PARAGRAPH)</p>
<p>AND the bull market of the 1990's ....</p>
<p>See next paragraph</p>

<p>In 1991, in the US gov'/t bond scanDal involving Salomon Brothers, Greenspan was silent and led by the nose to get in line in approving the US Govt wrist slap of Salomon Brothers as Soly was the sole financier for the whole US Gov't; so the US Govt could not indict Soly or face no financing for its then $1.5 trillion in annual borrowing</p>
<p>as no other Wall Street firm could handle this 30-50 billion/ week (and no bank or group of US or all global banks could either)</p>
<p>(so if no financing for US Govt, there would have been a US default AND SO besides collapse of Soly, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN a global market meltdown)</p>
<p>Greenspan had nothing to do with knowing any of that or with leading the US Govt to leave Soly alone (this writer did all that)</p>
<p>and similarly, in the bull market of the 1990's before that bull run started Greenspan was doing what all his predecesors did - that is, jawbone the markets to remain down or have no more than a 5-7 % market advance a year.... as it was considered any more of an advance would be inflationary</p>
<p>this writer savaged Greenspan to the Congressional committees (House Banking &amp; Senate Finance) to shut him up as there was never any real data to show that markets going up caused inflation and IT DID NOT during the bull market of the 1990s when the DJIA went from 2,000 to 12,000 with inflation remaining LOW, and stable...</p>
<p>(and Greenspans predecessor Volker has wrecked the US economy sending an estimated 50 million jobs permanently to Asia with his Don Quiote, crazy gyrations of interest rates-including keeping interest rates at levels 2-4 times higher (12-22 % for prime) than the normal 3-6 % (for the prime)</p>
<p>now almost every reader credits Greennspan with all that esp with the Bull market run of the 1990s when in fact he WOULD HAVE FOR CERTAIN prevented it with jawboniing IF NOT SHUT UP by this writer ....</p>
<p>SO Greenspans's greatest feat was his taking credit for these two major things he had nothing to do with ...</p>
<p>and for which he received a Medal of Freedom and also received in UK a KCBE medal-Knighting as Knight Commander of British Empire ... all for mainly these things he had nothing to do with ...</p>

<p>Do you all think that there would be enough information to create an article on Alan Greenspan's 'notorious' Greenspeak, that being his cryptic, complex, and circuitous way of speaking about economics and economic policy? It is common parlance in academic, economic, and financial circles, and quite a bit of information can be found on the web about it (much of it humorous, but not all of it). --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 05:09, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was recently added by <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrothy_82e9.html" title="User:Frothy">User:Frothy</a>. "Furthermore, in a speech on February 23, 2004, Greenspan encouraged homebuyers to take out nontraditional adjustable-rate mortgages.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>". I am not going to get into an edit war over this, but can someone show me where the reference says anything about him encouraging homeowners to take out nontraditional ARMs? He does say that over the previous decade (one in which the rate lowered from 1994 to 2004), a regular ARM holder would have paid less than a fixed rate holder. However, that does not imply anything about nontraditional (hybrid, I/O, subprime, etc) loans, and does not suggest taking out ARMs. Unless someone else here sees it, I am figuring this comment and ref should be removed. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 12:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was about to say that text is totally unfounded and should go, but look at the reference, Remarks by Alan Greenspan, Feb. 23, 2004: "Indeed, recent research within the Federal Reserve suggests that many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate mortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade, though this would not have been the case, of course, had interest rates trended sharply upward... American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed-rate mortgage..." There appears to be some basis for the statement in the article. You appear to differentiate between a "regular ARM" and a "non-traditional ARM" but the gist of his comments seems to me to be that he is speaking in favor of subprime lending tactics (codespeak: "mortgage product alternatives") that have since contributed to placing the economy in danger today, according to current press reports. I think the text could be clarified and should be expanded on. I certainly am against removing the reference. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 10:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I figure it is reading between the lines that he "engineered" (implies negative intent) the housing bubble. The foreclosures occurring to people that overbought with subprime ARMs is not the fault of Greenspan. That would be the fault of the borrower and the lender in each case that allowed for a 90+% LVT purchase, with their current income barely able to afford the payments. When the rate was 1.25%, it was reasonable to expect the rate was more likely to go up than down, yet people and companies gambled and speculated. The subprime lenders are going out of business, but blaming the Fed in general (or Greenspan in particular) seems a stretch to me. I figure though that others with more experience and the call of history can decide the final location for blame. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 23:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
