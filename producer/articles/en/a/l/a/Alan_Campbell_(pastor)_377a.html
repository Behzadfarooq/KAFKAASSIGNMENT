<p>Campbell was born in Belfast on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> into a staunchly <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> home, in a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> area. His grandmother was a very firm adherent of the doctrine of British Israelism, and thus he was exposed to this teaching from a very early age. Despite his upbringing, however, he didn't experience a true <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">conversion</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, when he repented in the Ravenhill <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Ulster_31fe.html" title="Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster">Free Presbyterian Church</a> after listening to <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">Ian Paisley</a> preach on <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Matthew</a> 8:12 ("But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth").</p>
<p>Campbell states that, shortly after being "saved" (a common term among <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Christians, used to denote their conversion): "I began to attend Bible Studies on the subject of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecy.html" title="Prophecy">Prophecy</a> at the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revival_meeting.html" title="Revival meeting">Revival</a> Hall on the East side of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>. My only problem was that these people were <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostalism.html" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostals</a> who <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">spoke in tongues</a>, which ran contrary to everything I was taught at my own church where speaking in tongues was forbidden. However after some time I reached the conclusion that if the folks at the Revival Hall were correct about the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> message then they must also be right about the Pentecostal experience and so I began to seek for the <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>." After several nights of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayer</a>, Campbell finally spoke in tongues, and has subsequently written a tract not only chronicling this experience but defending Pentecostal phenomenon, entitled "What the Bible Teaches About the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and Speaking in Tongues". Because of his "Kingdom Identity" views (which hold that Israel, not the church, is the bride of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Christ</a>, in contradiction to the teachings of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith_a7dc.html" title="Westminster Confession of Faith">Westminster Confession of Faith</a>) and his conversion to Pentecostalism, Campbell left the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Ulster_31fe.html" title="Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster">Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster</a> and, while he continues to promote <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">Ian Paisley</a> and his literature (as well as to adhere to the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> doctrine of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>), many of the clergy that Paisley moderates have attacked Campbell, such as Reverend <a href="../../../t/2E/a/T.A._Dunlop_3ff8.html" title="T.A. Dunlop">T.A. Dunlop</a>, to whom Campbell responded in his tract "<a href="http://www.orange-street-church.org/text/british-israel%20fact%20or%20fiction.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.orange-street-church.org/text/british-israel%20fact%20or%20fiction.htm" rel="nofollow">British-Israel, Fact or Fiction?</a>".</p>
<p>Campbell began preaching in May 1974, and preached his first <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon.html" title="Sermon">sermon</a> on <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_prophecy.html" title="Bible prophecy">Bible prophecy</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">September 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> (he expounded on <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> 38, interpreting it as a prediction of a future invasion of Ireland by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>), and was <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptised</a> by full immersion in 1979 (although he had already been baptised by sprinkling as an infant). He was officially ordained to the ministry by Dr Francis Thomas on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. He graduated from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_London_fd08.html" title="University of London">University of London</a> with a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">Bachelor's degree</a> in History, and from the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_University_of_Belfast_7054.html" title="Queen's University of Belfast">Queen's University of Belfast</a> with a Certificate in <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Studies_306e.html" title="Biblical Studies">Biblical Studies</a>. He recently retired from the post of head of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_studies.html" title="Religious studies">religious studies</a> at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtownabbey.html" title="Newtownabbey">Newtownabbey</a> Community High School near Belfast. He is author of a number of Bible study books, and has lectured on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecy.html" title="Prophecy">Prophetic</a> platforms throughout the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. However, his ministry is decidedly centred in <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>, and many of his messages and website updates deal with the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troubles.html" title="Troubles">political situation</a> there.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Campbell_%28pastor%29_377a.html" title="Edit section: Views and opinions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Views and opinions</span></h3>
<p>So controversial are his views on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_cef2.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a>, whom he describes as "the Roman Catholic <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorists</a> of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">IRA</a>" that he was sent a death threat on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, in the form of some mailed <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a> and a warning to leave the country in seventy-two hours. This prompted "an urgent call to prayer" in the Open-Bible <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_ministry.html" title="Religious ministry">Ministries</a>' "Kingdom Tidings" webpage. The threat was disregarded by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary_fcdf.html" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">police</a>.</p>
<p>Campbell preaches obedience to "God's Laws" to the point of condemning <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscegenation.html" title="Miscegenation">miscegenation</a>, sometimes using rather unorthodox interpretations of certain verses to justify his objections to race-mixing. In the second part of his series "<a href="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=40888&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" class="external text" title="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=40888&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" rel="nofollow">Jeremiah: From Jerusalem to the Emerald Isle</a>", he quotes <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jeremiah_74cb.html" title="Book of Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> 2:22 ("for though thou wash thee with <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitre.html" title="Nitre">nitre</a>, and take thee much <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap.html" title="Soap">soap</a>, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD") before asking his audience: "What <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a> could the people of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> have committed that <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap.html" title="Soap">soap</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> wouldn't wash away?" He answers his own query with "<a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscegenation.html" title="Miscegenation">miscegenation</a>", which he opposes vociferously. Campbell believes that "they had mingled the holy <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seed.html" title="Seed">seed</a> with the other races and peoples and nationalities", and, as he does in his sermon "<a href="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=15767&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" class="external text" title="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=15767&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" rel="nofollow">The Unholy Land — (2)</a>", he teaches that <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 3:8-9 refers to the "alien" facial features adopted by the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrews.html" title="Hebrews">Hebrews</a> through intermarrying with other peoples. He is a firm believer in the observance of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Sabbath</a>; however, he believes that it does not need to be kept on the seventh day of the week, but simply on whichever day the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> wishes to rest. Indeed, he himself conducts Bible studies in Cregagh S.C. Hall, not on Saturday, but on Wednesday and Sunday nights. (In his sermon on "<a href="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=24470&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" class="external text" title="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=24470&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" rel="nofollow">The Real Saint Patrick</a>", he says, in an apparently approving tone: "The <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Christianity_3a66.html" title="Celtic Christianity">Celtic Church</a> taught obedience to God's Laws and they didn't keep the same <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festival.html" title="Festival">festivals</a> as the organized Roman Church, and, although I'm not getting into this tonight, I have read some accounts by various authors who actually state that the ancient <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celt.html" title="Celt">Celtic</a> Church, for a period of time (not their whole history, but for a period of time) were Saturday worshippers." This suggests some sympathy towards seventh-day keepers such as the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church_a1ea.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-Day Adventists</a>, who share many beliefs with him.) He does not eat <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pork.html" title="Pork">pork</a> (although some of his disciples do), and he defends the observance of the <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">food laws</a> in his pamphlet "<a href="http://www.1335.com/foodlaws.html" class="external text" title="http://www.1335.com/foodlaws.html" rel="nofollow">Did Christ and His Apostles Keep the Food Laws?</a>".</p>
<p>He also refutes what he sees as the 'unbiblical' doctrine of the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html" title="Immortality">immortality</a> of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>, even preaching a four-part series entitled "<a href="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=23087&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" class="external text" title="http://resources.christianity.com/1335/talkInfo.jhtml?id=23087&amp;JServSessionIdroot=synbqsbkv1" rel="nofollow">Dead or Alive?</a>", teaching instead the heterodox view of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilationism.html" title="Annihilationism">annihilationism</a>. It is unclear what Campbell's views on the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> are; however, he has referred to Pastor Gordon Magee, a <a href="../../../o/n/e/Oneness_Pentecostal_3d95.html" title="Oneness Pentecostal">Oneness Pentecostal</a> preacher and debater most renowned for writing a booklet called "Is Jesus in the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhead_%28Christianity%29_defb.html" title="Godhead (Christianity)">Godhead</a> or is the Godhead in Jesus?" promoting the pre-Nicene heresy of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchianism.html" title="Monarchianism">Monarchianism</a>. Although the only translation used at his Bible study meetings is the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Bible</a>, nevertheless unlike the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King-James-Only_Movement_983b.html" title="King-James-Only Movement">Ruckmanites</a>, however, Campbell also uses an <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amplified_Bible_0fe2.html" title="Amplified Bible">Amplified Bible</a>, a <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrar_Fenton_Bible_d344.html" title="Ferrar Fenton Bible">Ferrar Fenton Bible</a>, and a <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamsa_Bible_8c21.html" title="Lamsa Bible">Lamsa Bible</a> in his personal research, but he insists: "I'm only looking at them in the same sense as I would look at a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concordance.html" title="Concordance">concordance</a> or a <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicon.html" title="Lexicon">lexicon</a>, and I'm not looking at them in the same way as I view the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">Authorized Version</a> of the Scripture, from which I preach".</p>

Dowsett of <a href="http://www.cvministry.com" class="external text" title="http://www.cvministry.com" rel="nofollow">The Covenant Vision Ministry</a> describes his experience as a guest speaker at Cregagh in his <a href="http://homepage.idx.com.au/fdowsett/TourReport2002.html" class="external text" title="http://homepage.idx.com.au/fdowsett/TourReport2002.html" rel="nofollow">2002 U.K. tour report</a>.</li>
<li>Although Alan has openly denied that British-Israel is a racist doctrine (he told Pastor Peter Salemi that "we're preaching, not that Israel is a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_race.html" title="Master race">master race</a>, but that we are a servant people chosen by God to bless <i>all</i> of humanity and to lead them into obedience to the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Lord Jesus</a>"), the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">white supremacist</a> congregation <a href="http://www.churchofthesonsofyhvh.org" class="external text" title="http://www.churchofthesonsofyhvh.org" rel="nofollow">The Church of the Sons of YHVH</a> provides the <a href="http://churchofthesonsofyhvh.org/links.htm" class="external text" title="http://churchofthesonsofyhvh.org/links.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a> to his website.

The Church of the Sons of <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetragrammaton.html" title="Tetragrammaton">YHVH</a> does not necessarily agree with all of the information contained in the links provided."

Consequently, the general opinion of Pastor Campbell among the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> community is that he is something of "<a href="http://freeyourmindproductions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4041" class="external text" title="http://freeyourmindproductions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4041" rel="nofollow">a softy</a>".

This article claims that Alan "recently ran scared from a debate challenge by a distinguished Professor". However, when asked about this proposed debate, Prasch has given a muddled and contradictory answer. In point of fact, when Jacob Prasch visited Belfast in September of 1997 and denounced <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Israelism_2bd2.html" title="British Israelism">British-Israelism</a> at the Agape Christian Fellowship, Pastor Campbell preached a sermon the following week refuting Mr. Prasch's criticisms entitled "Identity Truth Defended 1997 (An Answer to J. Prasch)". Alan also made a point-by-point rebuttal to Mr. Prasch's anti-KJV article in June of 2002 entitled "Jakob [sic] Prasch vs. the King James Bible". Recordings of both sermons can be purchased from <a href="http://www.1335.com/catalogue.html" class="external text" title="http://www.1335.com/catalogue.html" rel="nofollow">Open-Bible Ministries' website</a>, although the former is referred to as "REPLY TO JACOB PRASCH" in the <a href="http://www.1335.com/catalogue.html" class="external text" title="http://www.1335.com/catalogue.html" rel="nofollow">catalogue</a> and as "Jacob Prasch versus our Authorised King James Bible" <a href="http://www.1335.com/Archive/kt0702.html" class="external text" title="http://www.1335.com/Archive/kt0702.html" rel="nofollow">elsewhere on the site</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The laughable doctrine of British Israelism is clearly refuted as being totally unbiblical and hopelessly false by Jacob Prasch on a recorded message titled “British Israelism – Debunking the Myth”. Any sincere seeker after biblical truth should be able to obtain this message from Moriel Ministries.</p>
