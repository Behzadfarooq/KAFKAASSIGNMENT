<p><i><b>Alan Ford - Il Gruppo TNT</b></i> (Alan Ford and Group TNT), commonly known as <i><b>Alan Ford</b></i>, is an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_comics.html" title="Italian comics">Italian comic book</a> created by <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Bunker_bf2e.html" title="Max Bunker">Max Bunker</a> (Luciano Secchi) and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Raviola_85a7.html" title="Roberto Raviola">Magnus</a> (Roberto Raviola), published since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>.<small><sup id="_ref-lambiek-magnus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lambiek-magnus" title="">[1]</a></sup></small> The comic book is a satirical take on classic secret agents laden with surreal and black humour, sardonic references to aspects of the contemporary Italian and Western society. Although it became widely popular in Italy shortly after its introduction, Alan Ford remained relatively unknown outside Italy. The <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> edition soon failed but the only other foreign edition, in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_42d4.html" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, was a huge success, becoming and remaining one of the most popular comic books in the former country and its successors.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although the initial plot in the first few episodes develops around an agent called Alan Ford, he is later just one of the central group of characters: Group TNT is an assembly of misfit secret agents, who operate from a flower shop in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, which they use as a front for their secret headquarters. They are incompetent and lazy, but intelligent and cunning, especially when it suits their own personal interests. Their outlandish biographies are dwarfed by that of their iron-fisted and shrewd leader, the wheelchair-ridden Number One, a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methusalem.html" title="Methusalem">Methusalem</a> character who embezzles the millions paid to the group by American government or City Fathers for secret missions, while paying a pittance to his agents.</p>
<p>The comic book ridicules aspects of American society, including <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>. There were also direct references to local Italian reality, whose social ills were often satirized by Magnus &amp; Bunker, as well as terms in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milanese_dialect.html" title="Milanese dialect">Milanese dialect</a>.</p>
<p>Alan Ford is published monthly by Max Bunker Press in Italy. There are also editions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. Macedonian edition was also available for a while, and the Serbian editions are now imported into Macedonia, still remaining hugely popular. The comic book has been adapted to animated film and theater plays, as well as used as a source of inspiration in books and movies.</p>

</div>
<p>Three years before the comic book was published in May <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Max Bunker, along with illustrator Magnus, had the idea to create a satire of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> (they had previously created a serious spy character, Dennis Cobb). The initial script was written in August <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> and the dialog revised in April <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. The script included six main characters (Alan Ford, Bob Rock, Sir Oliver, The Boss, Jeremiah and Grunf), but the creators decided to omit Sir Oliver in the ultimate revision (July 1968), for fear of overwhelming readers with characters in the first issue. Raviola decided to base the drawing of Alan Ford on <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> actor <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_O%27Toole_925f.html" title="Peter O'Toole">Peter O'Toole</a>.</p>
<p>According to Max Bunker, he wanted to create a comic book which did not fall into either of the then predefined categories of adventures and dark comics, like <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanik_%28Italian_comic_book%29_f28a.html" title="Satanik (Italian comic book)">Satanik</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriminal.html" title="Kriminal">Kriminal</a></i> (both by Bunker and Raviola), or traditionally funny comics, like Mickey Mouse.<small><sup id="_ref-belgrade_AF_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-belgrade_AF" title="">[2]</a></sup></small></p>
<p>The first issue of the comic book, entitled "Group TNT", was received mildly by its audience. The second issue, entitled "The Rotten Tooth" appeared in June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, introduced the Sir Oliver character, and was overshadowed by the first issue's lack of success. The reputation of <i>Alan Ford</i> grew with subsequent issues.</p>
<p>The character of Number One was introduced later into the series, in the 11th issue named "The Number One". Cirano first appeared in the 18th issue ("Dog For Million Dollars"), when he was adopted by Bob Rock, albeit unwillingly.</p>
<p>Raviola drew the first 75 issues, after which he was replaced by Paolo Piffarerio in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, when the comic book moved to another publisher, Max Bunker Press, Raffaele della Monica and Giuliano Piccinnino replaced Piffarerio. Many readers think that the first issues, those drawn by Raviola, are the best.</p>
<p>Currently the comic book is drawn by Dario Perucca (who also draws covers) with inks by Omar Pistolato. In its entire story the drawing style has remained the same set by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Raviola_85a7.html" title="Roberto Raviola">Magnus</a>.</p>

<p><i>Alan Ford</i> reached great success in former <a href="../../../s/f/r/SFRY_8090.html" title="SFRY">Yugoslavia</a> and quickly became the best selling comic book, reaching a cult status, and is <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">still</a> popular and well known. Socks with Alan Ford merchandise can be still bought in Croatian supermarkets (as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>The comic book was first published by <a href="../../../v/j/e/Vjesnik.html" title="Vjesnik">Vjesnik</a> from <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. Much of the comic book's success in Yugoslavia is due to Nenad Brixy's distinctive translation, rich in baroque-sounding <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_linguistic_purism.html" title="Croatian linguistic purism">Croatisms</a>, which were almost forgotten in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_language.html" title="Croatian language">Croatian</a>-speaking area including Croatia itself. This edition is still a popular collectors' item.</p>
<p>Some of Vjesnik's editions were occasionally censored by the Yugoslavian government. For example, in issue number 16, "Don't vote for Notax", a line making fun of American racism, reading "Firstly, I promise that we will get rid of the Blacks. ... This is a country of the white race, and who doesn't think that way will get punished..." was changed to "Firstly, I promise that we will get rid of <i>our enemy</i>. This is <i>our</i> country and who doesn't think that way will..." Certain pictures from the book were removed or repainted in some editions, while in some other editions those very same pictures appeared in original version.</p>
<p>After the break up of Yugoslavia, Borgis continued publishing for the Croatian market. <i>Maverick</i> from <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraljevo.html" title="Kraljevo">Kraljevo</a> initially started publishing for Serbian market, and was later picked up by <i>Svet</i>.</p>
<p>In the mid <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, a theater play <i>Alan Ford</i> was performed in Teatar T in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. The play was an original story with most of the characters from the comic book, mostly based on the episode #29 <i>"The Bearded Gang"</i>, but with numerous references to other episodes and characters. The play was performed in Croatian dialect, as used by Brixy.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The Number One</b> (<b>Il Numero Uno</b>), a very old (he has memories from <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> and maintains to have met characters such as <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robespierre.html" title="Robespierre">Robespierre</a>), disabled man, is the supreme leader of group TNT. He treats the other agents severely. He has lots of connections, including a pocket-sized "black book" containing the indiscretions of everyone in the world. The <a href="../../../n/y/p/NYPD_fb97.html" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> often turns to him for help. He lives in a secret shelter away from the flower shop.</li>
<li><b>Alan Ford</b> is a naive, shy and modest young man. He appears to be the only person in the group to display anything resembling moral values. He's in love with an attractive spy, Margot, he had met in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> as one of the group's enemies.</li>
<li><b>Minuette Macon</b>, a beautiful French girl who since 2005 lives with Alan.</li>
<li><b>Bob Rock</b>, a short-tempered but very clever agent, is frustrated about his looks (he is very short, with a very large nose, graphically inspired by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Raviola_85a7.html" title="Roberto Raviola">Magnus</a>).</li>
<li><b>Sir Oliver</b> (<b>Il Conte Oliver</b>), is a financially strapped <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> nobleman who left his homeland in disgrace after being sought by the police for various large scale theft offences. A very skilled and stylish orator, he takes full advantage of his perceived high-society stature to rob his unsuspecting victims.</li>
<li><b>The Boss</b> (<b>Cariatide</b>), theorically Number One's right hand, is in practice a very lazy agent who strives to avoid work at all costs and sleeps all day in the flower shop.</li>
<li><b>Jeremiah</b> (<b>Geremia</b>) is a hypochondriac, decrepit old man, whose duty is usually to guard the flower shop.</li>
<li><b>Grunf</b>, a naturalized German-born inventor, changed his name from Grunt to Grunf on leaving his native country. His inventions are usually half-baked. His real name is Otto Von Grunt.</li>
<li><b>Cirano</b>, Bob Rock's dog, often participates in the group's missions. He is a smart dog, though easily bribed with food.</li>
<li><b>Clodoveo</b> (Clovis), a rather intelligent talking parrot, lives with Number One and helps brainstorm the group's missions, even though normally he quarrels with his master.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the members of TNT Group have disappeared from most recent numbers, and the group currently consists of Alan, Minuette and Clodoveo, under the name "Investigation agency T.N.T at low cost".</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Superciuk</b> (pronounced "Superchook", meaning-wise communicating something like "Superdrunk") is the most prominent villain of the series, sometimes being the main subject of the plot. His testes, when rubbed on bread, are supposed to cure <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindness.html" title="Blindness">blindness</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprosy.html" title="Leprosy">leprosy</a>. He steals from poor people and gives to rich, like an anti-Robin Hood of sorts. His main weapon is a deadly breath, alimented with awful quality <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbera.html" title="Barbera">Barbera</a> and onion tomatoes: in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a> «chook» sounds like «ciucco», i.e. "very drunk". In his normal life Superciuk is a street-sweeper who is costantly vexed by his companion, Beppa Giosef.</li>
<li><b>Gommaflex</b> was created for the television adaptation of the comic book. This character has a rubber face which can assume the lineaments of everybody, using this capability for criminal intents. His name is based on his powers, because "Gomma" means "<a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubber.html" title="Rubber">Rubber</a>" in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a> and "Flex" is intended as short for "flexibility". He is, in a way, similar to the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">villain</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chameleon_%28comics%29.html" title="Chameleon (comics)">Chameleon</a>.</li>
<li><b>Anten Man</b> is perhaps inspired by <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvio_Berlusconi_f762.html" title="Silvio Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a> when he was simply a TV and publishing industry man. He tries to achieve a monopoly in broadcasting by obscurating the transmissions of other companies. "Anten" refers to "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antenna_%28radio%29.html" title="Antenna (radio)">antenna</a>".</li>
</ul>
<p>Other enemies, whose names are normally puns in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian language</a>, are Katodik, the two killers Frit and Frut, Mr. Tromb, Wurdalak the vampire (coming from the pages of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanik_%28Italian_comic_book%29_f28a.html" title="Satanik (Italian comic book)"><i>Satanik</i></a>), the scientist Aseptik, the quick-change <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenic.html" title="Arsenic">Arsenico</a> Lupon (pun of <a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin_e693.html" title="Arsène Lupin">Arsène Lupin</a>) and the ghost gangster Baby Kate.</p>

<p>Alan Ford was also transposed in 1988 into a low-budget, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight-to-video.html" title="Straight-to-video">straight-to-video</a> 30 minutes <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_short.html" title="Animated short">animated short</a> called "Alan Ford ed il Gruppo TNT contro SuperCiuk" ("Alan Ford and the TNT Group vs. SuperCiuk"). It was produced by Max Bunker Press and was based on the SuperCiuk story already published in the comic series.</p>
<p>The animation was fairly good, despite the large use of tricks (ie. repeating backgrounds), some limited animation and sporadic defects.</p>

<li>In <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emir_Kusturica_5132.html" title="Emir Kusturica">Emir Kusturica</a>'s film <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Cat%2C_White_Cat_dbcd.html" title="Black Cat, White Cat">Black Cat, White Cat</a></i>, one of the characters reads <i>Alan Ford</i> throughout the film. Also most of the transport contraptions used by another character in the movie are directly inspired by Grunf's inventions.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhiks.html" title="Superhiks">Superhiks</a>, a Macedonian band named after one of the villains in <i>Alan Ford</i>, Superciuk.</li>
<li>In a Croatian punk rock band's, <a href="../../../k/u/d/KUD_Idijoti_055b.html" title="KUD Idijoti">KUD Idijoti</a>, song <i>Za tebe</i>, one of the verses is <i>Kad srce radi bi-bam ba-bam</i> (When heart is going bi-bam ba-bam), a title of the 32nd issue of Alan Ford, translated into Croatian and Serbian. And one other song of the same band is called <i>Daj, daj, daj</i>, a title of 5th issue of Alan Ford, translated into Croatian and Serbian.</li>
<li>Numerous lines and catchphrases from Alan Ford entered Serbo-Croatian slang. Number One (Broj Jedan in Serbo-Croatian), the name of an ageless terrible leader of TNT group (see below), is sometimes used when jokingly referring to any old and crotchey person. Similary, the name of main villain Superchuck (Superhik in Serbo-Croatian) who has a notorious alcohol problem, is sometimes used when joking about any drunkard. Sir Oliver's entering line, which he used in almost every episode when he would call his pawnbroker Bing to sell him some stolen goods, "Hello, Bing, how's the brother?", also became a sort of a catchphrase amongst numerous Alan Ford fans in Croatia. In former SFRY Sir Oliver's line "cijena, prava sitnica" (Price? A bargain!)is now commonplace for "it's too expensive".</li>
<li>One of the weapons in the game <i><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Sam_II_8af0.html" title="Serious Sam II">Serious Sam II</a></i>, created by the Croatian software house <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croteam.html" title="Croteam">Croteam</a>, is a bomb-carrying parrot named "Clawdovic" or "Klodovik". Klodovik was also the name of the parrot Clodoveo (see below) in the Croatian editions of the comic book.</li>
