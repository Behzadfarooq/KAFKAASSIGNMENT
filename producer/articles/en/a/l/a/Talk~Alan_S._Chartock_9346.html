<p>This is a new version of an article deleted approximately three days ago. I have deleted sentences in the opening biographical section that were alleged to be copyrighted material extracted from Mr. Chartock's personal and professional Web sites. The bio section has now been rewritten with attention paid to protecting copyrighted material. Mr. Chartock's personal and professional Web sites are listed as external links. The section labeled Controversy has been left relatively intact as there have been no allegations made concerning use of copyrighted material in that section.Fungible 11:56, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Susie CreamCheese has added nothing to the article but merely edited out items unfavorable to Chartock including legitimate links to external resources and articles. -- Fungible 08:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should be noted that "Fungible" is Glenn Heller, who is cited extensively in these entries. Mr. Heller is using this page to carry out a personal vendetta against Alan Chartock. Susie Creamcheese</p>
<p>Damn, Creamcheese! You let the cat out of the bag!!! And I thought no one was aware of my secret identity. (Now I am beginning to wonder just who is that other Glenn M Heller fellow whose UserName I keep seeing floating about deleting my material?)</p>
<p>As far as your boss Chartock, there is zero evidence for such a silly pronouncement, Creamcheese! Maybe I just don't like seeing Liberal demagogues running public radio stations? And a tax cheat, at that!!! A Liberal Tax Cheat! (I love the irony in that.)</p>
<p>Tell me honestly, Creamcheese, how can your boss commute 30,000+ miles per year in a new, all-expenses-paid company car, and then consider that NOT to be a taxable fringe benefit? I mean, come on! What alternate reality has your boss been living in these past 25 years?</p>
<p>Well anyway, turnabout is fair play, Creamcheese! Ms. Creamcheese is appearing on the Wiki stage as the <i>nom de plume</i> of Ms. <a href="http://www.talkingstick.net/five25ers/selma.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkingstick.net/five25ers/selma.html" rel="nofollow">Selma Kaplan</a>. Kaplan is vice president for administration and development at WAMC. I believe it safe to assume that here on this Wiki talk page that this indeed is Selma Kaplan because according to a highly reliable WAMC'er, "Selma has referred to herself with that name (Susie Creamcheese) in past (WAMC) fund drives."</p>
<p>I'd tell you her salary, but you can look it up for yourself on WAMC's own Form 990, <a href="http://www.wamc.net/WAMC990-2005.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.wamc.net/WAMC990-2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">Schedule 'A'</a>.(pdf pg.7)</p>
<p>So what we seem to have here is a senior employee at WAMC, a Chartock acolyte if ever there was one, trying to censor critical Wiki entries concerning her boss -- What a shock!! -- Fungible 02:10, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"The station's most recent fund drive (as of March 2007) raised over $700,000 in just over four days." This is what happens when you make a fund drive relentlessly annoying- people will pay money to make it stop.<a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxophobia_7014.html" title="User:Saxophobia">Saxophobia</a> 23:41, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we're all aware of who he is and were his views are. That being said, the whole controversy section doesn't need to be deleted, just cleaned up (maybe a lot). Everybody should be proactive in there edits, and not have revert wars. --<a href="../../../z/r/2/User%7EZr2d2_06d9.html" title="User:Zr2d2">Zach</a> 00:35, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So am I to infer from CreamCheese and her Licious friend that only people who are friends of a Wiki entry should be posting material about that entry? Why do Susie Creamcheese and Mal Licious have difficulty with facts? If SUNY has an anti-moonlighting policy that Chartock violated, shouldn't that information be posted here? Why this desire to cover-up public and private behavior of a public figure? Fungible 05:15, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mr. Heller, can you back up any of your claims with primary sources not hosted on your website? This would add validity to your accusations. --<a href="../../../z/r/2/User%7EZr2d2_06d9.html" title="User:Zr2d2">Zr2d2</a> 21:06, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good point. Heller is basing his claims about Alan Chartock on one source and one source only: his web site. At the very least, his allegations pertaining to private matters involving WAMC employees -matters that he can not verify- have no place on Wikipedia. Until Heller can cite one reliable, independent source, the final paragraph should be stricken. --Anonymous</p>
<p>I would be happy to back up these sexual harassment claims. The question is how best to do that. How does the New York Times in its articles, for instance, back up allegations of sexual harassment when the accuser speaking to the reporter requests to remain anonymous? I can give the lady's name, but I was specifically requested by her to keep that out of any article that I wrote. Fungible 22:27, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>At the New York Times, reporters are accountable to their editors. A reporter couldn't print something like that without disclosing the identity of the person to those running the paper. Who are you accountable to, Heller? From the rabid tone of your web site, how are we supposed to take anything you say seriously? You rave about Alan Chartock like a man possessed. Show us this claim of yours printed somewhere by a legitimate (established) publication and we'll get off your back. Mal Licious</p>
<p>Funny, but when I post links here to documents that back-up the facts I bring forward, i.e., The Burke Memorandum showing SUNY's anti-moonlighting policy, Chartock's defenders then delete them! I can back-up the allegations but you still did not answer my question. How does the New York Times back-up sexual harassment allegations? Chartock is free to sue for libel or defamation, but he has not, and I made the charge long ago on the Web site. What does that tell you? (Maybe that's what should be added to the article here?) Fungible 23:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>69.168.108.84 continues to post copyrighted material from one of Mr. Chartock's copyrighted Web sites. Better not reproduce it here in this article or risk getting blocked for copyvio. Fungible 23:21, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I worked for WAMC in the mid-1990s. Glen Heller may not be the most diplomatic person, but he's also correct about Alan Chartock. People will likely lose their jobs if the sources are revealed and no one should lose their job, particularly over someone else's indiscretion. Puts Alan's unqualified support of noted local attempted teen sex-abuser Scott Ritter in a different light though. --Jango Davis</p>
<p>I reverted the material posted by 69.168.108.84 because copyrighted material from Chartock's own web sites was used. Plus posted Jango Davis' name to above comment. Fungible 08:48, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Fungible! --Jango Davis</p>
<p>Claims of sexual harassment reported in the New York Times are generally supported by some documented proof, such as a court filing. Short of that, a copy of a document establishing the veracity of this story would suffice. You are basing all your claims on some emails you recieved. How reliable. Produce a copy of the settlement between this woman and WAMC, even with the woman's name omitted, and that is proof. Anything less constitutes a bunch of rumors. Mal Licious</p>
<p>That may apply to Glen Heller (please sign the above post Mal Licious - as you see above I forgot too!), but then how do you account for those of us who worked at or do work at the station and know the people involved? Killing the messenger will not kill the message. For me this is less about what Alan did and more about whether public donations to WAMC were used for the settlement. If so, that makes it public business, not a private matter. -- Jango Davis</p>
<p>Wrong, Mal Licious! I am basing the woman's claim not only upon an initial extended telephone interview that I had with the woman, and a series of follow-up telephone calls with her, but also upon the corroborating statements made by not less than three separate and independent WAMC-FM sources. According to the woman, she was sworn to secrecy as part of the $20,000 settlement agreement. If I were to publish a copy of that agreement, how else would I have obtained it unless she had allowed me access to it and thus violated her agreement to keep it secret? Regarding the woman's claims, The New York Times uses the same methods as I have used in getting multiple corroboration. Therefore, your argument that the claim "constitutes a bunch of rumors" is hogwash. The woman's claim therefore deserves to stay in this Wikipedia article about Mr. Chartock. Fungible 17:50, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nothing I say will change what you think, so I'm finished. You obviously have some sort of obsessive hatred for Alan Chartock. My theory is that to you he represents the thing you dislike most about The Berkshires: The "New York" influence. Take that any way you want.Mal Licious</p>
<p>How can I independantly verify them? I think that should be the threshold for inclusion in this article. --<a href="../../../z/r/2/User%7EZr2d2_06d9.html" title="User:Zr2d2">Zr2d2</a> 18:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>More 'Shoot the Messenger' syndrome from Mal Licious (whose anonymous comment once again I have edited to include his name). Mal Licious, why don't you simply address the issues raised -- all the issues -- rather than continue to complain about what you 'think' are my motives. As to Zr2d2's reasonable request, I would be happy to discuss this entire matter with you, especially if you are a credentialed media person. (I need to check under what conditions New York Times reporters reveal confidential sources, even to other journalists?) Please feel free to e-mail me at editor@wamc.net, and we can then proceed to exchange telephone numbers. Make sure you put your Wiki UserName in the subject line. Thanks. Fungible 19:50, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you sugesting that you are or once were a reporter at the New York Times? --<a href="../../../z/r/2/User%7EZr2d2_06d9.html" title="User:Zr2d2">Zr2d2</a> 18:56, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, he's just comparing what he does to what the New York Times does. If that's not evidence that he's delusional. I don't know what is.Mal Licious</p>
<p>Zr2d2, the answer to your question is definitely not, I am not suggesting I ever worked for The Times or The Washington Post, but if I keep my reporting standards as regards reporting of facts the same as those used by The Times or The Post, then I don't see why Mal Licious has a problem with that. Not only do I sign my WAMC Pirate articles, Mr. 'Anonymous' Mal Licious, but also, by keeping my reportorial standards high, if anything, I know if I ever do get sued, I'll win. Truth is the best defense against accusations of slander or libel. By the way, Mal, just cause you don't like the way I report something, or the headlines I use, doesn't mean I don't keep my standards high for maintaining the facts. Was it you, Mal Licious, who deleted links to documentation about SUNY's anti-moonlighting policy? By the way, Mal, I still have not heard you respond concerning the material about Chartock's violating those anti-moonlighting policies! What say ye about that? I mean we are only talking about twenty-three years of teaching salary (and now, pension) obtained in violation of SUNY's rules and thus under false pretenses with the money ultimately coming from New York State's taxpayers and out of student tuition fees! (But maybe that kind of white collar crime doesn't much matter to you, Mal.) Fungible 20:55, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fungible...isn't it so nice when we have the truth on our side? The slings and arrows of the unbelievers just fall away. Eventually the truth will come out and we can all have a big laugh at Alan's expense. Well, at least you and I can. And as you say, all Alan has to do is sue WAMC Pirates, funny how he never has hmmmm? Hey Mal, maybe you should contact Alan and convince him to sue over this, or are you afraid of the truth really getting out? Glen Heller and I certainly aren't. -- Jango Davis</p>

<p>Mr. Chartock is editer of the Legislative Gazette. Although public in nature, I would label WAMC msm (main stream media). He also writes a syndicated column, as well as one for the Berkshire Eagle. <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/32238" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nysun.com/article/32238" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=479005&amp;category=REGIONOTHER&amp;BCCode=&amp;newsdate=5/7/2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=479005&amp;category=REGIONOTHER&amp;BCCode=&amp;newsdate=5/7/2006" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.iberkshires.com/story.php?story_id=19765" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iberkshires.com/story.php?story_id=19765" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>WAMC's financial success as a public radio station indicates the general intellectual decline of Capital District radio audiences. Once the home (year-round) of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's live radio broadcasts, and serious intellectual discussion ("From the Midway"; NPR's "Options"), the station has become a locus for endless ramble by Dr. Chartock and similarly intellectually lightweight friends in Albany-Pittsfield regional news media.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dr. Chartock's contributions to national political discourse have been few and far between. Other than the publication of transcripts of his radio interviews with former NYS Governor Cuomo (by a small, vanity press), Dr. Chartock has almost never been published in major national political science and public affairs journals, as one can verify by checking Political Science Abstracts over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>And while, to his credit, Chartock has opposed the current Gulf War, he vigorously supported Gulf War I in 1991. He also successfully dodged the Vietnam War draft without ever establishing any anti-war or liberal political tendencies for many years, and picked up for WAMC a well-known liberal discussion program, "Alternative Radio" almost ten years after it was first carried by another Albany FM station, WRPI.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; The prior author seemed to put quotation marks where irrelevant; I have taken the liberty to correct them. Because Chartock has a bona fide doctorate, he is to be referred to as Dr., not "Dr." When you have somewhat cogent commentary, doing juvenile things like putting a person's salutation in quotes really makes you look stupid.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate in the Chartock article, under External Links, to post a link to an article I just posted on the WAMC Pirates Web site? <a href="http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html" class="external free" title="http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html</a> Fungible 02:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, the well-spoken supporters of Alan...see the insults they cast? They know we're right, but have so much invested in supporting Alan to deny him would be to realize how much they invested in a man unworthy of their adulation. We must be right if they resort to race-baiting. Folks, you can hide the truth, you can deny it, but in the end the truth exists, the truth persists. I would not involve myself in such a petty exercise of hubris and egos if I didn't work at WAMC and didn't know the people involved. Unfortunately for both you and Alan I have and I do. And it is true, what was once the home of great classical music and jazz has since become a forum for Alan's morning drivetime personality parade. Susan Arbetter USED to be a good newsperson, but Alan has reduced her to being a morning "personality" interviewing bird-watchers and dog-lovers. What a shameful waste of talent. -- Jango Davis</p>

<p>So, hi, everybody. I just wonder if it's against wikipedia policy for someone to make very damning arguments about someone without providing any evidence -- except for links to his own personal website -- where there is no actual evidence of said allegation. Yeah, there's been a lot of erasing ("vandalism") and reposting, but -- ignoring our views of Chartock, liberalism, or whatever -- isn't it wrong to slander someone without any actual evidence from a third-party website? What if someone made shocking allegations about Heller and then, to "reference" said allegations, just linked to his own personal website where I didn't provide any tangible evidence? I respectfully ask your opinion, Fungible. -- 71.245.137.181</p>
<p>My response is the same as earlier in that just HOW does a reporter 'prove' to his editor an allegation of sexual harassment when the accuser makes a bona fide request to the reporter to remain anonymous? The standard in most libel cases nowadays is that if the reporter or the newspaper gets at least three corroborating witnesses, then that is sufficient in most jurisdictions to establish good faith as well as to establish the veracity of the information. Hope this answers your question. BTW, do you think it would be worth defending such a corrosive matter if there were not actually something to it? I interviewed the girl at length. I got corroborative witnesses to verify. How would YOU go about 'proving' such allegations? Or perhaps, Wiki articles should not deal at all with allegations of sexual harassment because of the nature of the subject. Might there be a better way to word those few paragraphs so as to satisfy your concerns? Fungible 02:39, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, it's me, 71.245.et.al. again. I had deleted my own comment but since you re-posted it and responded, I'll do so in kind. When a reporter makes a claim, the merit of said claim, when there is nothing but a source who wishes to remain anonymous, rests in the news organization who sponsors the reporter. Thus, if a reporter claims that a person has embezzled funds based upon an anonymous source, the report is more credible if it came from a respected daily like the Miami Herald or the Sacramento Bee, rather than the National Enquirer or the Star. (The typical person will believe the article when it comes from the Herald, not from the Enquirer). You have *no* credible organization sponsoring you (just your own website), so it's nothing more than your word against his. In your own website, say what you want. But in a public arena like this, my guess is that such claims are better not stated. The same, to be honest, goes for most of the rest of your allegations. Really -- Wikipedia shouldn't be your sounding board. If you feel the need to link to your site, I think that makes sense. If Chartock wants to refute those claims, he can do so. But bringing your allegations into this site tarnishes what Wikipedia is all about (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a>). Mr. Heller, this really isn't the appropriate outlet for your attacks on Chartock, no matter how much merit they have. Just one person's opinion. -- 71.245.et.al</p>
<p>Note to all: The masquerader using the UserName: Glenn M. Heller, is indeed NOT, and is merely trying to confuse people. Masquerader deleted the entire controversy section and ALL of what I consider some fairly good edits that I posted today to try to accommodate the concerns of all sides in re the issues that folks have been raising. Fungible 13:13, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a former WAMC employee I fully support Glen Heller bringing to light Chartock's questionable personal and business ethics. Having a "neutral point of view" does not mean that we must eliminate discussion about a public personality's unethical and sexually abusive behavior. The discussion page is an entirely appropriate place for such a "discussion" of a public personality's questionable public behavior. -- Jango Davis</p>
<p>SusieCreamcheese? Selma, is that you? -- Jango Davis</p>
<p>Jango, You're right on the money! Ms. Creamcheese is indeed Selma K., according to a highly reliable former WAMC'er who says, "Selma has referred to herself with that name (Susie creamcheese) in past (WAMC) fund drives." Go figure. Maybe her trust fund will chip-in to the upcoming WAMC Benefit Concert (at the Linda Norris Auditorium) to help tax evaders get out of debt -- I understand Willie Nelson is going to be the lead act.

<p>71.245.137.181, I have to strongly disagree with you. What you are saying is that individually run Web sites and Web blogs, no matter how well-researched and well-documented, cannot have the credibility that would attach to say The New York Times or The Washington Post because the sites and blogs are not affiliated with major media outlets. I submit that's hogwash. Some of the best journalism today is coming out of independent Web sites and Blogs. If it was a choice between trusting something Matt Drudge comes out with and something published in the New York Times, my money is on Drudge. Further, whether you choose to believe it or not, The National Enquirer gets confirmation from no less than three independent sources before publishing any allegations. This is as a result of The Enquirer's sustaining huge libel/defamation judgments against it in the 1970/80's. Nowadays, though you might not like the concept, if you read it in The Enquirer, you can take it to the bank. No Joke! .Fungible 13:27, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, a valid response to the National Enquirer example (thanks for the interesting tidbit). But my main point remains -- Wikipedia is not designeed to be a sounding board. This is not the appropriate outlet for using your own research to criticize someone... otherwise, you'd have every left-wing wacko trashing GWB's page and every right-wing wacko trashing Hillary Clinton's page. You clearly have done a great deal of work in alleging misdeeds and unwise expenditures on behalf of WAMC/Chartock. But in my opinion, this really isn't the place to air those grievances. Respectfully signing off for good, 71.245.137.181</p>
<p>Zr2d2, minor point but it was I who put a time stamp on Jango's entry to begin with - he doesn't use wiki format yet - and the time that I first posted was not the actual time he had made his orig comment so I checked then went back and corrected.Fungible 14:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Geni, I added a new Controversy section but this time without any of the original source material. I included WAMC's own IRS Form 990 tax filings signed by Mr. Chartock along with links to IRS and other third party Web sites. Along with links, I inserted the sentence: "Chartock's notoriety and public pronouncements have inspired at least one critical Web site and two critical Blogs:<a href="http://www.wamc.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wamc.net/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://forum.chartocksucks.com/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.chartocksucks.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://www.wamcnet.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wamcnet.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>."

<p>Geni, Wiki's WP:NOR states: "However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."</p>
<p>So Geni, please explain why IRS documents and links to IRS own Web site and links to third-party Web sites dealing with tax fraud and the definitions of taxable fringe benefits and the consequences of failing to report same, are not considered by you to be 'source-based research'?

<p>I may be missing something, but why isn't it acceptable to provide links to Chartock's own published writings that are posted on his firm's own Web site?

<p>I rv'ed AlbanyNewYorker's weak edit. AlbanyNewYorker is willing to say in comments that he thinks Alan Chartock is a Liberal so why won't he just say it in the article. Rather he puts forward the mediocre phrase "Like many media figures". Why not just say what he means if he really believes that Chartock is a Lib? Why can't Libs at least be honest about being Liberal? (If I were to write that Chartock is a Big Breast-Beating Liberal and uses his public radio soapbox to promote Liberalism, the Wiki gods would delete on grounds claiming that my <a href="http://www.wamc.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.wamc.net/" rel="nofollow">WAMC Pirates</a> Web site has a bias against the guy.) I think if one of Chartock's supporters simply acknowledges in the article that the guy is a Big Lib or that he champions generally left-wing, so-called 'progressive' causes, then that would be one step towards honesty in this article.

<p>Keep it up Glen, many people do in fact support you. I will also add that this very situation exposes the weaknesses of Wikipedia. All these admnistrators are trying to do is to plug the leaks in a poorly concieved structure. What's the difference if the truth is told on the main article page or in the discussion area? It is out there, people will read it and they will question Chartock's perversity and tax fraud. And well they should. I worked there, I know Alan, I know his tax fraud first hand as well as his sexual harassment of a former employee. Whoever Wiki has to admin this page has not a clue of what they are editing. You would think an editor should have some familiarity with the subject of their editing before they decide what is "one-sided" or not. They will fail and the truth will prevail and there will be plenty of words for everyone to eat. -- Jango Davis 20:13 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Geni and Moeron: In pursuit of an answer as to the legitimacy of quoting a controversial individual who is the subject of an article, I posed the question to <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>, an admin who is about as far removed from the subject material as one could get (the British Isles - I think). Here is the original question that I posed to Connolley: <i>"Hi Mr. Connolley, Fungible here again with a question. This concerns article: <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_S._Chartock_f721.html" title="Alan S. Chartock">Alan S. Chartock</a>. I edited the article to include links to various newspaper columns written by Mr. Chartock himself. As a lead-in to the links, I state: "In his published newspaper columns and in on-air interviews at WAMC with politicians and public figures, Mr. Chartock represents a decidely political point of view. This point of view can readily be observed in a sampling from his published works posted on his blog at WAMC." Then I posted a series of 6 links to Mr. Chartock's own newspaper columns posted on his blog site. So anyway, I am getting rv'ed by user, Zotdragon, who claims that this edit represents 'original research' and a 'POV' violation. I responded that all that was stated is that Mr. Chartock's writings are 'decidedly political' (which indeed they are), and further that I don't specifically state WHAT political bent they represent -- merely that they ARE political. I don't feel such an edit represents either a violation of NPOV nor Original Research because my edit and the links provided at no time represent MY point of view, but rather the point of view of the subject of the actual article, since the links are to his own writings off his own Web log. Can you give some direction on this matter? Also, let me know if there is any reason why a man's own published work's cannot be linked to in his own Wiki article? Many thanks.</i> Fungible 19:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)" So Mr. Connolley responds and gives me what seemed to me a reasonable response (SEE 22:35 05/17 above on this talk page). With Connolley's advice in mind, I post a representative sampling of quotations from Mr. Chartock along with the phrase <i>"Mr. Chartock represents a decidely one-sided political point of view"</i> Next, Geni has a problem with that phrase and deletes the whole section including all the quotes, rather than just the offending phrase. So I responded by rv'ing the quotes but without the offending phrase. Now, I am getting a response from Geni and Moeron indicating that Wiki is not an indiscriminate collection of information! I think <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>'s view is the more reasonable one here. I think a few representative quotes are not unreasonable in an article about a man who makes his living by the use of words, both spoken and written. My question to Geni and Moeron is: "How much better could you get to learn about a man's views but to post a few of his own quotations and the links to the larger work from which those quotes stem? Wouldn't you put famous quotes of Wm. Shakespeare in an article about him, and then link to the work from which they came? Perhaps this controversy is such that it needs escalation to a larger forum within Wiki because obviously different admins are giving different advice. Fungible 19:53, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beatlehippie, WAMC's legal name is WAMC, Inc., at least that's how it was originally registered with FCC and with New York State. Also, that's what it tells Uncle Sam on its <a href="http://www.wamc.net/WAMC990-2005.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.wamc.net/WAMC990-2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">IRS Form 990 Returns</a>. Sometimes on filings they just use 'WAMC', or 'WAMC Public Radio'. On-air, and on its Web site, the organization refers to itself as 'WAMC/Northeast Public Radio' or 'WAMC/Northeast Public Radio Network', but none of these is the organization's legal name.

Wiki is open to everyone. If you want to control the flow of information then don't open it up for everyone to add relevant information. The Wiki-format is a flawed hippie wet-dream.

<p>Antonrojo, I rv'ed the word '<i><b>invective'</b></i>. It is quite appropriate in the context in which it is used. Chartock, when going into one of his regular rants, uses all kinds of accusations, insults and abusive language when referring to President George W. Bush, VP Dick Cheney, White House operative Karl Rove, the Administration's foreign and domestic policies, or Conservative Republicans. Chartock uses this invective as a device to cadge ever greater sums from his left-leaning Lib listener base during WAMC's thrice-annual bega-thon drives. The word 'invective' deserves to remain. Just listen to the station over the Web and you can hear Chartock's snide invective for yourself whenever he discusses politics. Fungible 19:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whoa, I didn't know what a spitstorm I was stepping into, as I edited the article before checking out the vitriol evident on this Talk page!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I checked a few sources and did the following edits:</p>
<p>1. I deleted the text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example, Jonathan Kern, the NPR official who leads NPR's anti-bias workshops, expressed concern with what he views as political bias in WAMC's non-syndicated news stating that "Our code of ethics says, if youâre in the news division, you do not express opinions on the air, and I think thatâs a good measure for any station."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Reading the <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=10286" class="external text" title="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=10286" rel="nofollow">cited source</a>, it's pretty clear that Kern was talking about WYPR in Baltimore. If the criticism applied to Chartock and WAMC, it wasn't evident from the article.</p>
<p>2. The opening sentence of the "Criticism" section said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>official news policy states that its affiliate stations should be 'fair, unbiased, accurate, honest, and respectful of the people that are covered', principles that some senior NPR officials think are not always followed with Chartock's reporting at WAMC.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Giving <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/ethics/#principles" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/about/ethics/#principles" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> as the source. That's the NPR Code of Ethics page, which says <i>nothing</i> directly about the opinions of senior NPR officials. I moved the reference to an earlier part of the sentence, in order not to mislead the reader.</p>
<p>3. I also found a page in Chartock's blog, which supported the article's description of his view of corporate media. Blogs aren't typically acceptable citations, but in this case, I think we're safeâit clearly sets out his views on the topic.--<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughGRex_b789.html" title="User:HughGRex">HughGRex</a> 01:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It appears that, almost immediately, Fungible reverted many of my editsâwithout explanation. He reverted Item 1 above. As I posted above, Kern was not talking about WAMC or Chartock, so the sentence (which I have deleted again) is not in accord with the facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He also reverted the edit, in which I removed "and exposÃ©s" from the description of wamc.net. I believe that "<a href="../../../e/x/p/Expos%C3%A9_%28journalism%29.html" title="ExposÃ© (journalism)">exposÃ©s</a>" are items that legitimate news outlets publishâeven the Natl Enquirer. A cybersquatting blog, with questionable sourcing, which has not convinced any mainstream news organizations to pick up on its criticisms, cannot reasonably be said to be publishing "exposÃ©s". The POV term gives exaggerated cred to wamc.net, and I don't believe it should be used in that context.--<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughGRex_b789.html" title="User:HughGRex">HughGRex</a> 16:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, HughGRex: Spitstorm -- now that's as apt a description as any <i>in re</i> the Chartock Wiki entries! Regarding the Jonathan Kern citation, you are correct when you state that the quote refers specifically to the Baltimore station and not to WAMC. Yet, Kern is also referring to the concept of using an NPR station as a soapbox by station management to editorialize and/or to preach to listeners, something that NPR's guidelines plainly frown upon. Thus the reporter included the quote in her article on the subject. Therefore, a citation -- corrected --- merits inclusion in the Chartock Wiki entry because the Kern quote is reflective of how the real pros at NPR view what Chartock does, and has been doing, at 'his' station for more than twenty years. Also, with regard to use of the word 'expose' in describing the WAMC Pirate Web site, before dismissing the site as having questionable sourcing, you might want to read a few of the articles. I recommend 'Tax Cheat' <a href="http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. You will not find anything alleged that is not backed up either with eyewitness accounts or with links to actual source documentation. If any of the sourcing were indeed 'questionable', it would be easily refuted or refutable -- but NONE of the allegations have ever been specifically refuted or denied by Mr. Chartock. Rather, the guy ducks answering specific questions on issues raised by the WAMC Pirate Web site. Therefore, using the term 'expose' is valid and quite appropriate. --Fungible 10:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Re. Kern: I'm sure there's a way to cite his statements while remaining factual and avoiding OR. Re. the "Pirate" website: yes, I've read some of the articles, including the one you reference. I must say that it's a very difficult site to slog through, both because of its breathless style and because of its <a href="http://www.websitesthatsuck.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.websitesthatsuck.com/" rel="nofollow">awkward use of graphics</a>. (For instance: one image in the article is about 3200Ã2200 pixels, weighing in at 1.3 MBâslowing down the page loading. Its content only shows that Chartock signed WAMC's tax return. What an inefficient use of bandwidth!) When and if its accusations are picked up by the mainstream media or the IRS, I believe it will be appropriate to label its content as "exposÃ©s." At this point, such terminology is premature.--<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughGRex_b789.html" title="User:HughGRex">HughGRex</a> 11:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can't argue with the customer. Just so you know: The document to which you refer, at least the one I think you mean, weighs in at 1.3 megs <a href="http://www.wamc.net/WAMC990-Sign.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wamc.net/WAMC990-Sign.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and was not legible enough at lower resolutions to read easily its fine print (which, in the case of this particular IRS document, is of special significance because this fine print contains the formal oath under which Chartock affirms his signature, thus legally binding him to the veracity -- or lack thereof -- of the financial data provided IRS.) In an exposÃ© about a failure by a public broadcaster to report corporate perks paid its top exec, I thought it important to make sure this significant document was plainly legible.--Fungible 19:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think that pretty much everyone knows what a signature on an IRS form means, without having to read the fine print on this particular submission.</dd>
<dd>Web designers frequently defend their gi-normous graphic files with "I used high resolution because I didn't want to lose the essential details." But as you imply, it's important to take your customers' needs into account. To do so, you might have to get a bit creative. You could load the doc at smaller res, say 800Ã500, and include an inset of the signature and fine print in higher res. Better still: this is precisely why God created thumbnails! You could use a small version of the document on the main page, with a link to the full-sized scan (warning the intrepid surfer that it's a 1.3-MB file) for those who are interested in getting into the gory details. <a href="../../../r/a/s/RAS_syndrome_be1a.html" title="RAS syndrome">In IMHO</a>, that would improve the page significantly.--<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughGRex_b789.html" title="User:HughGRex">HughGRex</a> 11:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fungible did a bunch of edits. I think expressing skepticism about WAMC's claim of 400,000 listeners borders on POV. In addition, there's no reason to call some unnamed NPR producer a "senior NPR official." Fungible's renaming of headings from "criticismâ¦" to "accusationsâ¦" is clearly unnecessary, and looks like a violation of NPoV. I've reverted some of the edits. I'll work on some of the others.</p>
<p>Additionally, it seems like a <i>lot</i> of the article relies on one article in the press (the <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=10286" class="external text" title="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=10286" rel="nofollow">Dechter piece</a>, mainly using it for anti-Chartock quotations.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, Fungible here. First off, I figured it would be appropriate to use the same headings in the Chartock Wiki article in context as have been displayed for months on the Wiki article about <a href="../../../w/a/m/WAMC_053d.html" title="WAMC">WAMC</a>. That article refers to Accusations of Bias and refers to Mr. Chartock's use of the NPR station as a platform to promote HIS personal political points of view.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Next, I don't think the edit that refers to 'a senior NPR official' is mine since it was already part of the Wiki article when I began my most recent set of edits. I see no problem with changing the language to reflect more precisely the context of the Baltimore article from which it comes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding WAMC's claim of 400,000 listeners, why should WAMC's claim automatically be accepted as fact without some form of industry-standardized certification? Isn't that why the industry has 'arm's-length,' independent audience rating services? (Otherwise what is to prevent every radio station from claiming a large audience?) If such a certification is not forthcoming, then why not just note that the audience figures have not been verified or certified as accurate?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Next, while admittedly much of the quoted material in the Chartock 'Accusations of Bias' section stems from a single source -- the Baltimore City <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=10286" class="external text" title="http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=10286" rel="nofollow">'Dechter'</a>article -- the reason is because that article happens to be a well-written piece. Indeed, it is rare in comparison to anything coming out of the main stream media in Albany in that Dechter from Baltimore portrays accurately the matter of bias at NPR stations including WAMC. The article has balance and fairly represents both sides. Compare that to local Albany main stream media puff pieces about Chartock and WAMC that lack any journalistic credibility or balance whatsoever because the authors do not pose critical questions. Nor does it seem that Albany 'journalists' have the guts to do any of the investigative footwork to uncover how Chartock and WAMC spend listeners' money. (If they did, they wouldn't have to scratch too far beneath the surface to uncover a lot more than just the stuff I write about on WAMC.net.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Local news media types appear to fear engaging the wrath of station CEO Chartock. Indeed, do you think if a single local main-stream-media-connected journalist in Albany were to dig into WAMC's finances (as has been done on <a href="http://www.wamc.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.wamc.net/" rel="nofollow">WAMC.net</a>) that there would be any need for a Web site like WAMC.net? All I do on WAMC.net is to interview WAMC personnel, dig up applicable documents, and attempt to find out how the broadcaster and its boss manage to run through $6 million dollars every year.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>I challenge any of the brainiacs here to come up with evidence or documentation that can refute a single allegation in the <a href="http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wamc.net/taxcheat.html" rel="nofollow">"Tax Cheat"</a> piece.

<dd>The Baltimore Dechter article is an arm's-length piece written by someone in a city and state 300+ miles to the south of Albany, NY -- far from the sway of Mr. Chartock, his political cronies, and any perceived influences from Albany. In Albany, Chartock is viewed by many people I have interviewed as a guy who will retaliate in most nasty fashion when crossed. The result is that if one is trying to make a living in local radio, TV or print in the Albany market, then Albany truly becomes a very small town indeed. If an enterprising journalist wants to keep a job and survive there, one does not buck that system or its perceived powers-that-be -- at least not if they want to keep a job. I've spoken with quite a few people in local Albany media who wish to remain in the area and who express the view that were they to bring forward information that created negative publicity for Chartock or WAMC, that their personal livlihoods would be in jeopardy. The result is this: puff pieces get published about WAMC and its CEO that rarely get beyond happy talk and the status of press release. Articles that are critical either don't get written, or if written don't get published by the local editors. It is interesting to note that most who have been willing to spill the beans about their time at WAMC have been willing to speak frankly because they either are no longer in local media, have independent sources of income, or live far enough away that Chartock poses zero threat to their livlihood.</dd>

<dd>In the Discussion Section here on Wiki, I have heard it repeated ad nauseam that my WAMC.net material is unsourced and based on rumors. That's a charge that is simply untrue -- protecting sources is not the same as being unsourced. Others here charge that since WAMC.net is not a main stream media site, or because its articles have not been picked-up by MSM, that articles should therefore not be quoted or used as source material. Why is any of that relevant if the material is factual, and the individuals being interviewed are quoted accurately?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, the Baltimore Dechter article is a piece of journalism that fits Wiki's current template for sourcing: meaning it's well-researched, independently written, and most importantly for Wiki, it's been published by a main stream media outlet. So now the big complaint here on this Discussion Page devolves to being that the section on Accusations of Bias relies too heavily on the Dechter article for quotes. Yet, it is precisely because the Baltimore article deals with the topic of bias in a definitive and arm's-length manner that its observations about broadcast bias by Chartock on WAMC are the perfect source from which to draw context and quotes about this subject.</dd>

<dd>I don't think it reasonable that the naysayers here should be able to have it 'both' ways: "Can't take too many quotes from the Dechter article; Can't use WAMC.net as a source." I think it's unreasonable to refuse to use valid quotes in context from an article like the Dechter piece -- no matter how many are used -- so long as that article gives a fair and accurate portrayal of Chartock and WAMC (something that just has not been forthcoming from the Albany press for so many years). Likewise, I think it unreasonable to refuse to accept applicable quotes in context from individuals interviewed for articles that appear on WAMC.net.Fungible 21:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
