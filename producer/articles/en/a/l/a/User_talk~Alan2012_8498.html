<dd>You have surfaced several high quality references. Congratulations - good, incisive points, and welcome.

Reading the Talk pages and edit histories in articles that interest you may give you important vicarious experience that is useful.

<p>Though you may not realise it from my latest edits, I'm a sympathizer. But Multi-posting on WP looks very much like POV pushing--the subtler technique is to say somewhat different things each time, &amp; keep it short. I removed the duplicate from one clearly less appropriate talk page, Weasel words. I think it should have been kept on the p-r talk page, but I am not about to get into a quarrel there with a respected editor, so it is still on RS, where I added some comments. I will get what I think the key part of it back on peer-review, and in the article, not the talk page, though I am going to wait a few days. I've cited jefferson in (peer-reviewed) published work, which will help. I've posted my email if you prefer to go offline. If you answer here, I will see it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your advice. I think I'll go with my original plan. There is nothing remotely like spamming going on; these were SINGLE, information-dense posts and I do not plan to go back and argue for or try to "sell" anything, much less hector anyone. THey can do with the info as they please. I am doing for them as I would have them do for me: inform me of a very important couple of publications in this area, and with them a critical change in the status of peer review, at least in the biomedical sphere. By the way, my post it seems is something of a hot potato. Someone on the Quackwatch talk page wanted to MOVE IT OFF, entirely! Ha! I can understand. It is not pleasant to see a sacred cow savaged like that. "A wonderful hypothesis slain by an ugly fact", as some pundit put it. Thanks again. -- <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan2012_b312.html" title="User:Alan2012">Alan2012</a> 00:41, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As it so happens, that editor has been somewhat busy over the last week and didn't notice the reinsertion of the post. The moving of the post has nothing to do with my opinion of the content. The Quackwatch talk page, an obscure location among millions of similar pages, only frequented by a small number of specific editors who won't necessarily be interested in the post, is simply not the right place for the post, and won't result in discussion that is useful to Wikipedia. Posting there would be like publishing the results of the Human Genome Project in Physical Review D. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 01:46, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>Hi Alan. Thanks for your note. My reminder about civility was not meant for your individually, but for everyone there on both sides.

I just saw the edit you were referring to above.</s> I'm sure you felt (and possibly feel) justified in your anger, but lashing out like rarely helps; it only puts other editors' backs up and, in the worst case scenario, results in sanctions against you. No matter how deserved you feel that kind of criticism is, it is always better to bite your tongue, remain civil, and (if must be) temporarily disengage.

I mostly agree with your comment in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Talk%7ECold_fusion_0816.html#.22ScienceApologist.22" title="Talk:Cold fusion">Talk:Cold fusion -- "Science Apologist"</a>, but unfortunately it violates <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Better for everyone if we can keep the temperature down.

<dd>Hi Alan. What a wild world Wiki is! I found what I believe is your block log and don't see any listed. Here it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Alan2012" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Alan2012" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Thanks for daring to ask important questions on the arbitration. I see that that Fyslee found a reason to remove them. Apparently, they weren't in the right place.

<p>I reverted your recent edits to this article, as the tone was unencyclopedic and some of the material included self-references to Wikipedia. It is possible that some of it could be added to the article if worded in more neutral and objective style, but as it was, it was unacceptable. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hit bull: thanks for your comments. The self-ref to Wikipedia was intended to give the reader a clue as to what is really going on; i.e. that some rather extremely negative bias against garlic was at work in the editing of that entry. Whatever. I won't insist on that part. But I do insist that the facts be told -- which is, as you can see, the point of the bulk of my edit. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan2012_b312.html" title="User:Alan2012">Alan2012</a> 15:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could I suggest that mundane editorial disagreements are most likely to resolve quickly and productively when editors observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain polite per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback and ask questions.</li>
<li>Keep the discussion focused. Concentrate on a small set of related matters and resolve them to the satisfaction of all parties.</li>
<li>Focus on the subject rather than on the personalities of the editors.</li>
</ul>

<p>See response on your talk page. If anyone is being incivil here, it is you. Your wholesale reverts are mindless and indeed uncivilized, since the <i>specific</i> objections either have been or are being addressed; see the Talk page. Note that I did not say that <i>you</i> are mindless; I said that your <i>wholesale reverts</i> are mindless, as they clearly are (read the content). I will say however that you are, in reverting as you have, being extremely rude and disruptive. Your feedback <i>has</i> been solicited, repeatedly, and you've refused to give any, except continuing with wholesale reverts. I don't care about your personality, I care about what you have to say, of substance, about the actual content. So far you've said practically nothing. Why not? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan2012_b312.html" title="User:Alan2012">Alan2012</a> 16:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: General assertions of "POV", without being specific as to what and how, don't cut it. Simply be specific, as Shot Info was, and we can start talking. If you wish, <i>you</i> could step in and take Shot's place in the text above; i.e. respond to my comments, point by point, with whatever you see or object to. I await, and will take pleasure in, your first intellectually substantial contribution here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan2012_b312.html" title="User:Alan2012">Alan2012</a> 21:05, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't want to be too dogmatic here, but Wikipedia's <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">talk page guidelines</a> specify that article talk pages are to be used to coordinate improvement of the article, rather than as a platform for one's personal views or to discuss tangentially related subjects without direct relevance to the editing process. I understand you have an interest in mainstream medicine and its potential biases, particularly regarding pharmaceutical advertising. However, using <a href="../../../g/a/r/Talk%7EGarlic_1855.html" title="Talk:Garlic">Talk:Garlic</a> as a platform to debate such issues is not appropriate. There are plenty of forums to debate such issues; Wikipedia article talk pages are generally not one of them, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox, nor a battleground</a>.

<p>Thanks for your comments. Please see mine on the garlic talk page. What I posted was in no way a "tangentially related subject", unless you truly believe that the quality of sources is irrelevant. (Do you?) What I posted is directly relevant to producing quality encyclopedia entries. Indeed there are few things that could be more relevant than the matter of reliability of sources. In truth, what is happening here is that you are labelling, pejoratively, the matters that I raise (regarding relative source quality) as "personal views" and "tangents", when it is obvious that they are not. Please stop. It is unbecoming for an intelligent person, which I still assume you to be. You may find these issues uncomfortable, but that is no excuse. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan2012_b312.html" title="User:Alan2012">Alan2012</a> 19:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
