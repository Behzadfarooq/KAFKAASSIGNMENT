<p>I made a correction to the Radio series, the person who updated it recently (and they may have been building on something I originally, and mistakenly, wrote) said that Alan shot Forbes on the radio program. It happened on the final episode of the TV series. And it did not end his BBC chat career, that fate was sealed when he punched Tony Hayers on the 1995 Christmas special. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESponline_922b.html" title="User:Sponline">User:Sponline</a> 23 March 2006</p>

<p>I notice that someone who altered a comment said 'fictional characters aren't born'. That may be true, but how is it of relevance here? Alan Partridge is clearly a real person, as we live and breathe.</p>

<p>Why fictional?

<p>As much as we all love them, i fear the quotes sections is getting a little too comprehensive. The problem appears to be that every week or so, another editor appears and adds his or her favorite Partridge quotes. WP is not a collection of quotes, so i think we should think about pruning these and then limiting the addition of new ones. I'm not quite sure how to go about it, though. I would suggest starting with context. They have to stand alone to the reader unfamiliar with the subject.</p>
<p>For example, although the "Dan, Dan" scene is among my favorite of all time, it is really prety meaningless as a quote. The comedy is all in the context. Similar with the Chris Rea/Mini Kiev monologue. That isn't a quote, it is a scene. Finally, the "Oh Ladyboys" quote is a minor part of a larger joke (it was said as a gesture of disgust after taking a sip of the mixture). Its pretty meaningless as a standalone quote to anyone not familiar with the scene.

<p>Am I right that Partridge got himself a Lexus because he thought it was a luxury car (presumably he was strapped for cash so couldn't get something prestigious)? I have added this to the Lexus page trivia section but it keeps on being removed (possibly by irate Lexus owners, who presumably have done a Partridge themselves!) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 07:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is what I thought. He even got a mention when Top Gear were reviewing Lexi as a 'mark against' buying a Lexus. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 08:48, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further to this, Partridge has affected the image of the Lexus to such an extent that he is referre to in <a href="http://www.parkers.co.uk/choosing/carreviews/review.aspx?model_id=423" class="external text" title="http://www.parkers.co.uk/choosing/carreviews/review.aspx?model_id=423" rel="nofollow">Parkers</a>] Price guide: "If you fit into Lexus' buyer profile for the IS, you're probably young, affluent and style-conscious.

<p>In opening paragraph:- "Two radio and three television series..." surely "four television series"? The Day Today, KMKYWAP and the two series of I'm Alan Partridge??</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think, in this case, "series" refers to "shows" as opposed to "seasons" (to adopt the US terms). The character has appeared in three different series (of whch one had two, em, series). Perhaps the paragraph should say "Two radio and three television shows" to make that clearer. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 19:59, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"and, in the series finale, his guest Lord Morgan of Glossop died from an apparent heart attack."</p>
<p>Where did this come from? Alan cleary shoots him in the chest by accident when looking at the dueling pistols! Hence why LMoG says "Be careful with that!", then the gun goes off and blood appears on LMoGs chest.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are confusing the radio show with the tv show. The man Alan shoots on the TV show of KMKYWAP is Forbes McAllister; Lord Morgan of Glossop appeared on the radio version of Alan's show. 86.41.215.16 14:17, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am struggling to find any reference in the programme to the car used by Alan t drive to Dundee. The article says the car was a Vauxhaull Vectra, but I don't believe this is the case. Alan went to great lengths to hold on to his Rover 800 in series 1 of I'm Alan Partridge, and has a Lexus in series 2. I can't recall a Vectra ever being mentioned.</p>

<dd>True, Gord. True. Tell me - your middle name isn't <i>Alan</i>, by any chance?

<dd>Oooooohh - sorry, Gord. Imagine how embarrassed I feel now, thinking that you were Gordon Burns! I thought it was a bit strange that Gordon Burns would be writing in to Wikipedia telling people that he looked like Alan Partridge and not bothering to sign his posts, mind you, but stranger things have happened, I'm told.

<dd>Ironic, Gord? No way. There's clearly a plot afoot. I reckon this Steve Cougar guy, whoever he is, reads Wikipedia and deliberately went on the program to flummox us.
