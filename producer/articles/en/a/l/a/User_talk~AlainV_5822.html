<p>Hi Alain, concerning the "fancy" language - I don't remember! It was probably just the "long-lost ancestor" and the "atavistic grandchild", especially since they're right at the beginning of the article. The rest seems fine. There's no real reason for the language to be dry and technical in articles on antiques - readers probably would expect a friendlier tone. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarj_Tiefert_437d.html" title="User:Marj Tiefert">Marj</a> 19:16, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Marj! I will try do be a bit more formal on contemporary forms like the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubicle_desk.html" title="Cubicle desk">Cubicle desk</a> though. Alain V., noticing that the snow has finally stopped on this Saturday 29 afternoon.</p>

<p>Hi. Good work you are doing; I just have some minor style notes. Although =x= style headers are available, we have a convention never to use them; and definitely never as the first thing in the article - can you in future not use them, and make sure that the first use of the article name within the article is <b>boldfaced</b>, (like '''this''')? Thanks, <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 07:48, Dec 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I had been wondering what that was all about. After I put in a new article sometimes other editors would do this change from the equals x style header to boldface. Some other times the other editors would go through my text very thoroughly, cleaning up all kinds of things (and thus giving a good name to the concept behind Wikipedia) but leaving the equals x style header alone! Not being too sure what was the proper usage (independently of the indications in the text which is titled "How to edit a page") I left everything they changed "as is" and went on creating new pages as before. After reading your comment I went to the "list of desk forms and types" and did the change over to boldface and it seems to work. I also had a slight impediment in that my keyboard does not show the ' symbol properly: It looks just like another comma. The snow is thick outside and shows no sign of disappearing on this 16th of December 2003.</p>

<p>Thanks for the note, and I always forget to check these things. I have redirected the page, and all you need to in the future is put #REDIRECT [[Wooton desk]] as a single line in the page, and it should work.

<p>Ah yes, the "pipe trick". A very useful variation of this trick is that you can simply put a "pipe" (|) after something enclosed in parentheses in a link, and the parentheses (along with their content) will disappear, like so: <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_%28currency%29.html" title="Pound (currency)">Pound</a> is a quicker form of writing <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_%28currency%29.html" title="Pound (currency)">Pound</a> (have a look at the source text). Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 05:21, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Merci Alain for fixing up <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_de_Vaucanson_6f4f.html" title="Jacques de Vaucanson">Jacques de Vaucanson</a>. That sentence in the first section was horrible. I must have been very tired when I wrote it. I hope I have fixed it somewhat. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecumanus_9e44.html" title="User:Decumanus">Decumanus</a> 04:51, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alain, do you know if Alexeieff &amp; Parker were ever considered members of the NFB? my understanding is that they were invited to make one film there.<a href="../../../d/h/o/User%7EDhodges_406c.html" title="User:Dhodges">Dhodges</a> 17:12, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>They were invited several times over a period of more than 30 years. I have just dug more to find out what exactly was their contractual relationship with the NFB and have found conflicting reports. I am going to remove or change what I put in the pinscreen article to reflect this ambiguity.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying your cabinet-making input! At <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_crafts_movement.html" title="Arts and crafts movement">Arts and crafts movement</a> you might add a note on the distinction between "cabinet-maker" and "furniture designer" after all. In the mid-19th century the big English commercial furniture-makers had designers who <i>weren't</i> trained as cabinet-makers, or as upholders/upholsterers either. The Arts and crafts movement was consciously trying to re-integrate the roles, as part of their reform efforts. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 17:21, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks! I will put this in (somewhere in the A and C mvt article but maybe somewhere else also) given the specific request for it. I had been meaning for months to put the 4-5 cabinet making links I put in yesterday (or was it the day before? Those wikiholic "lost weekends" are addling my brain and making me leave for Montreal later and later)and I am always telling myself I have got to finish those rough sketches for all the desks, and put the bibliographies in, and put more non-Brit craftsmen in the list of furniture designers and... and... Whew, first of all I have to get back from Montreal and take my usual place in front of my home computer, next to my reference works, and then maybe I can take a few minutes to succumb to the temptation of adding a Greene and Greene desk article, since they were part of the Arts and Craft movement in the States and then... Whew! <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 00:32, 2004 Feb 2 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah yes, I almost forgot. Among the things I absolutely just have to do is add a section on the desk as a symbol of power (political, literary or other) in the general desk article. I have been telling myself this nearly every day, since the day you added some fine paragraphs to the "Bureau du Roi" article I had started, thereby making it a real honest to goodness historical article.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 00:50, 2004 Feb 2 (UTC)</p>

<p>Photocopying corrected typewriter pages... Yes, ain't that the truth. I almost thought about mentioning it myself. It of course also solves the problems of the corrections showing through.</p>
<p>I was finishing my degree around 1975, and one of the happiest moments of my graduate-student life was when, just in time, the university library announced that they would accept photocopied thesis submissions as long as the photocopies themselves were made on proper high-rag-content thesis paper. So I was able to prepare my thesis on erasable bond and photocopy it onto thesis paper! Hooray! What a boon to humankind! <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 03:26, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good morning. I saw your listing of the Chapman Space "Station" on the VfD listing and took a look at the pages. May I recommend in the future using the "move this page" feature when you find a mis-titled article? It automatically cleans up the old page. Note: It will leave a redirect at the old site, but I think that's okay. Obviously at least one person already made this mistake or the page wouldn't have been created with the wrong title in the first place. Redirects take up no space and do no harm. (If it does create a conflict in the future, the redirect can always be cleaned out then.)

<p>I have not read the manual, just your reporting of its summary of the German army in WWII. However, if it is a recently re-edited government publication of the US government I would trust it for reporting the straight facts about the order of battle and other aspects of the organization of the German army. I would be wary of any evaluation of tactics howver. If you want something close to an official US evaluation of WWII German army tactics you might want to look iinstead at some of the writings of colonel Trevor N. Dupuy. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 23:31, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I saw the message you posted on my talk page. (Is this where I'm supposed to reply&#160;? I'm not sure.) You would know better than me how often the term "direct manipulation" is used outside of academia, so please feel free to put back material regarding this in the article. The main reason I edited the article so much is I don't think "direct manipulation" and "wimp/gui" are equivalent terms. However, I probably have a biased view of things; I would welcome more editing of the article to achieve a more balanced view. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMcGuffin_220e.html" title="User:MichaelMcGuffin">MichaelMcGuffin</a> 12:22, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was at UIST 2003 as well, but missed Horvitz's talk. I'm not sure what controversy you're referring to with respect to direct manipulation and Shneiderman. There are multiple (possibly complementary) approaches to designing interfaces and interaction styles. An encyclopedia can define each of them; list the generally agreed-upon pros and cons of each approach; and also present more controversial arguments for or against each approach, attributing these arguments to the people or groups who advance them. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMcGuffin_220e.html" title="User:MichaelMcGuffin">MichaelMcGuffin</a> 13:00, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alain. Thanks for your addition to the page on Dan Simmon's <a href="../../../i/l/i/Ilium_%28novel%29.html" title="Ilium (novel)">Ilium</a>. I did not know that extropianism derived originally from H.G Wells - well done!</p>
<p>One gripe though. You also added this comment which seems to me to have NPOV issues:<br />
&gt; Because of the literary style it can be considered as something more than <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_opera.html" title="Space opera">space opera</a>,<br /></p>
<p>That sounds like your personal opinion. Do you have a source for this?<br /></p>
<p>&gt;though some critics repeatedly pin this label on nearly everything Simmons produces.<br /></p>
<p>I respectfully suggest you remove this para or alternatively write a more neutral version that outlines the views of the 'literary' and 'space opera' camps? You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about people who think Simmons writes space opera? Who thinks this? Why do they think it? And why does a 'literary' style elevate it above space opera? If we're being neutral here, what's wrong with a novel being a space opera, or some people thinking that it is?</p>
<p>I suggest that, if you remove the paragraph altogether, the question about whether or not Ilium is a space opera never arises...perhaps you are the only one worried about whether or not critics think it's a space opera? The page hasn't exactly been inundated with hordes of writers rushing to call the book a space opera....so why mention it at all?</p>
<p>You might as well assert that the literary stlye means it can be considered as something more than a cookbook, or a Volvo maintenance manual.....it just doesn't seem to me a pertinent point.</p>

<p>Hi Alain - the data table has been a constant headache for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_8cfc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft">WikiProject Aircraft</a> - not only has it been a bear to edit (as you discovered), but when the main skin of Wikipedia changed a few months back, the table that had been painstakingly added to so many pages was rendered very hard to read. There has been a general consensus among Project participants to replace the old blue table with a text section. You can find a full description of the standard <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_page_content_894f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/page content">here</a>. You can't be blamed for the confusion - the new standard was rolled out only hours before your contribution.</p>
<p>I agree with you that a bit of colour - something to "brand" the articles with would be desirable, but in the end the practicality of the text format has won out. Maybe there's another way of achieving this?</p>
<p>Rest assured though - this can be thought of as "stable". The tables were in use for nearly a year, but it was the fact that <i>any</i> table format we came up with was always going to be vulnerable to skin changes that was really the killing blow.</p>

<p>The idea of adding roundels or insignia was kicked around for a while, but this creates all kinds of problems for aircraft that were used notably by a large number of users.

<p>I can certainly understand your being upset, and I shall briefly explain my reasoning for removing said paragraph from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrialisation.html" title="Industrialisation">Industrialisation</a>.</p>
<p>"Pre-industrial economies generally rely on sustenance standards of living, whereby the population focuses collective resources on producing only what can be consumed by the population, though there have also been quite a few pre-industrial economies with trade and commerce as a significant factor."</p>
<p>As far as I know it is entirely common for pre-industrial societies to produce far beyond sustenance standard, ie. Italy, Netherlands, Britain, Spain, China, India, +others all knew prosperous pre-industrial periods of great abundance. I did not feel like adding a caveat saying, that pre-industrial economies generally rely on sustenance standards of living, but quite often do not. It seems like we can't make up our mind if we say that. Which is it? Do they or don't they? Seems to me that some do, and some don't, just as some industrialized countries suffer from lack of food (N. Korea?). It doesn't seem to me that living at a sustenance standard is a mark of a pre-industrialized country, but maybe that depends on your definition of industrialisation?</p>

<dl>
<dd>allright, I shall soon rewrite the paragraph to suit your concerns. Almost all of these societies faced famines periodically, I still do not think that constitutes living at a subsistance level. Perhaps some elements of the society did, but some of these societies as a whole were more than capable of producing more than they needed. Ronald Seavoy's book, Famine in Peasant Societies seems to argue, to me, that pre-industrial societies do not necessarily live at a subsistance, level, rather pre-commercialised societies do. However, his book is far from universally acclaimed, so perhaps we should not base an encyclopedia article on his theory. Still, I will, when I get a moment, soon rewrite the offending paragraph.</dd>

<p>Good Morning Alain; Thanks for your insights into what citizens of the US of A should be called. Certainly the old WWI song "Over There" featuring the rousing chorus, "The Yanks are Coming, the Yanks are coming" did not just refer to those from New England. Several years ago, when I still watched TV and lived close enough to Canada to pick up the CBC I was a news special in which a team traveled from the Maritimes to BC asking Canadians the same questions, "What does it mean to be a Canadian?" After the trip was over they did a recap and discovered that it meant a lot of different things in different part of Canada, but there was one element of Canadian self-identification that all Canadians agreed upon, "We are NOT Americans." They were clear about what/who the word "American" referred to, and it was not them. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 15:31, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anything giving an idea of the scale of the object would be good. For instance, a work glove on the floor next to the pallet if you feel artistic and want to give an effect akin to that of Renaissance artists (who were aware of the symbolism of hands or gloves) or a coffee cup if you want to give an idea of the reality of work. A yardstick or a meter instead would be technical but useful also. A picture of a wooden pallet would be great since they are still in the majority. Most people never see a pallet or else they see it from afar on a pile, in the back of a warehouse, never getting an idea of just how big or small it is. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 04:05, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alain-</p>
<p>I replaced the information about the LV Monorail project from the Bombardier article that you deleted. I would appreciate it if you'd keep it there. It's a large news story in the area and quite a topic of discussion here in Las Vegas and Western US. Our city was recently denied government funding, and the entire city's mass transit system is now made to suffer because of the mistakes of that company. Additionally, millions of dollars in income were lost due to Bombardier's mistakes, and people could have been injured or killed because of the parts falling off the monorail. What is now apparently going to be the Monorail in it's entirety was supposed to be just the first phase of an ambitious plan to connect many parts of our fast-growing city. My hope is that when the next city is considering Bombardier to build a mass-transit system, some members of the public will be able to hear the whole story about Bombardier before millions of dollars in tax-payer money is wasted.</p>
<p>Thank you, Robert</p>
<p>I put the explanation on the talk page of the Bombardier article --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 21:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alain. Some of the material you removed from the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a> article wasn't speculative. See <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_%28active_countermeasures_system%29.html" title="Arena (active countermeasures system)">Arena (active countermeasures system)</a>, and external links there; versions have been in production in Russia since the '80s (but I don't know how widely deployed).

<p>No, French is not considered a language with tonic stresses, unlike English or Spanish. It is true French words have a slight stress on the last syllable, but this is a regular pattern, unlike in languages with tonic stresses, and it is much lighter than a tonic stress as occurs in languages with tonic stresses. Therefore, it is never indicated in IPA. Now, I don't know if the particular Quebecois French is considered an exception, possessing tonic stresses. If you find a serious linguistic article or book that specifically says that Quebecois French, unlike standard French, has tonic stresses, then we should add the stress in the IPA pronunciation. However, I have never heard that Quebecois French was different from standard French in that respect. I believe even in Quebecois French the slight stress on the last syllable is much lighter than a real tonic stress (compare the Quebecois pronunciation of "sur parole" and the English/American pronunciation of "on paROLE"). <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 18:21, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm curious to know what a Pacific lodge is. You added it to list of house styles, and it's not something I've heard of, so I'm guessing it's Canadian. You don't happen to know more Canadian styles, do you? I was going to put in something more precise about Quebec styles, but realized I didn't know enough (I had several cottage styles in mind). And there's a style of ranch house I once saw in Calgary that is, I think, purely Canadian, but I don't know what it's called. <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 11:07, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m a historian working at the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University (<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" class="external free" title="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://chnm.gmu.edu/</a>) and as part of our project on the History of Science, Technology, and Industry we are very interested in digital historical works, including people writing history on Wikipedia. We’d like to talk to people about their experiences working on articles in Wikipedia, in connection with a larger project on the history of the free and open source software movement. Would you be willing to talk with us about your involvement, either by phone, a/v chat, IM, or email? This could be as lengthy or brief a conversation as you wish.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>I learned about the <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> file format from other wikipedians, and have been very impressed by it. I tell all my friends...if you haven't tried it already, take some of your wikipedia drawings of desks and, using the original bitmap files, convert them to PNG using Paint or whatever program works for you. You'll see a smaller file with better image quality. I tried to convert one from JPEG, but some of the image quality couldn't be recovered.

<p>Hmm, you suggest a google image search. Many of the writing desks shown there aren't strictly speaking "escritoires". I will source a picture of a "real" escritoire soon. I know my description isn't very clear, but a picture or two might help.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be that my "strict" idea of what an escritoire is and isn't may be a bit more constrictive than current use, in which case I am open to being convinced. --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlashme_49c3.html" title="User:Slashme">Slashme</a> 05:57, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, yes. You know, the description of an "escritoire" you give is exactly what I was thinking of when I wrote the stub. My descriptive abilities are not very clear, and I think especially the use of the word "cupboard" was unfortunate. I have asked my mother to take a picture of the escritoire she commissioned for herself some years ago, and I'll put it on the page when I get it. I'll also fix my stub a bit, and you can expand it, as you're clearly much more of an expert than I am! --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlashme_49c3.html" title="User:Slashme">Slashme</a> 13:08, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm no expert either. I just threw myself on the topic of desk forms during my spare time for about two years. Since then I let my interest simmer.</p>
<p>From the little I know those two pictures represent very original variations of the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slant_top_desk.html" title="Slant top desk">Slant top desk</a> form, without being slant top desks. It looks as if the two pieces are one of a kind commissions or the fruit of a very dedicated "amateur" woodworker. By amateur I mean somebody who can easily spend thousands of hours a year on this hobby, and an even higher figure in dollars on tools and wood. The first one, with what looks like an icosahedron on top ("a small writing desk") can't be called a slant top desk because there are rows of drawers underneath the slant top "writing and storage" part. And it can't be called a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desk_on_a_frame.html" title="Desk on a frame">Desk on a frame</a> because that form has nothing underneath. The other desk ("A writing desk") is an extremely interesting combination of the typical slant top desk and the side drawer form of the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davenport_desk.html" title="Davenport desk">Davenport desk</a>. Of course, it can't be called a slant top desk, any more than a Davenport desk, because of this unusual mix. So, those two pictures are not useful for illustrating specific desk form.</p>
<p>On the other hand they might have other uses. A great place to put one of them would be to illustrate the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_making.html" title="Cabinet making">Cabinet making</a> article since desks are made (in the case of original items like these) by cabinet makers. I favor the simpler one over the slant top desk- Davenport combination, because it's simpler, more classical to my eyes. Also, I may be influenced by that icosahedron on top, which also looks like a fine piece of woodworking. That choice is personal. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 05:33, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know this might sound TOTALLY CRAZY since these edits were three (!) years ago. Anyway, I've been continuing to clean the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> article and noticed you wrote a lot of the original stuff for business culture - my question is what reference(s) would you use to back up the first couple of paragraphs?

<dd>That would be great - thanks for the response&#160;:). I'll to try to look into some as well - it seems like an interesting topic too. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 23:54, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personnaly I don't understand where the problem in Punic miliatry forces is that a society with lots of trade shouldn't be militarized. Just look at South Korea (until shortly under a military rule) or the USA (higher proportion of soldiers per civilian than other Western societies) or the deceased German Empire (strong Prussian influence) or <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.</p>
<p>Just look at that piece of South Korean history:</p>
<p>In 1960, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Revolution_953f.html" title="April Revolution">a student uprising</a> led to the resignation of president <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syngman_Rhee_4153.html" title="Syngman Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a>, whose government had become autocratic and corrupt. Then followed a period of profound civil unrest and general political instability. General <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park_Chung-hee_41d4.html" title="Park Chung-hee">Park Chung-hee</a> led a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Council_for_National_Reconstruction_4091.html" title="Supreme Council for National Reconstruction">military coup</a> (the "5.16 Revolution") against the weak and ineffectual government the following year. Park took over as president from 1961 until his assassination in 1979, overseeing rapid <a href="../../../e/x/p/Export-oriented_industrialization.html" title="Export-oriented industrialization">export-led economic growth</a> as well as severe political repression.</p>
<p>The year following Park's assassination was marked by considerable political turmoil as the previously repressed opposition leaders all clamored to run for the presidential office. In 1980, General <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chun_Doo-hwan_a3bc.html" title="Chun Doo-hwan">Chun Doo-hwan</a> launched a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27etat.html" title="Coup d'etat">coup d'etat</a> against the transitional government of Choi Gyu Hwa, the former prime minister under Park and interim president, to assume the presidency. Chun's <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27etat_of_December_12th_f63b.html" title="Coup d'etat of December 12th">seizure of power</a> triggered particularly violent protests in Gwangju, South Cholla province, where protesters raided police stations and military compounds to seize weapons. Chun sent in the special forces to suppress the uprising, which is now termed the <a href="../../../g/w/a/Gwangju_Massacre_258c.html" title="Gwangju Massacre">Gwangju Massacre</a>. Chun stated his intent to serve only a single term from the outset and eventually allowed direct presidential elections in 1988 under pressure from widespread popular demonstrations. That year, Seoul hosted the [1988 Summer Olympics]. South Korea's <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic.html" title="Economic">economic</a> development was also largely due to the many large, family owned businesses within the country, which came to be known as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaebol.html" title="Chaebol">Chaebols</a>. Some of the most famous and richest <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaebol.html" title="Chaebol">Chaebols</a> include <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samsung.html" title="Samsung">Samsung</a>, <a href="../../../l/g/_/LG_3138.html" title="LG">LG</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/u/Hyundai.html" title="Hyundai">Hyundai</a>.</p>
<p>Any questions that military excludes trade and the like? But the theses of the trade "empire" really needs proof. For example nobody would attribute Greece the like, although its pottery was widespread. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 13:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Militarism discourages trade, except when it supports it directly, in some very special circumstances. This went into an extreme with the autarcic nature of the Nazi state, which discouraged normal trade with other countires and encouraged the complete subjugation of the economy of other countries by the German one. At any rate all the examples you give (South Korea, Imperial Germany of the 19th and early 20th century) are all those of complex inditrialized societies and they are absolutely not relevant to the much more simple economis of classical antiquity. Furthermore, what is at stake here is not the exclusion of trade for war or vice versa but the fact that the "Myth" of the commercial nature of the Punic empire is the prevalent one in current historiography, even if the sources for that "myth" turn out to be less numerous than one would like. If you go against all of the scholarly books that repeat that myth then it's up to you to state extremely clearly the sources which supoort that attack to the "Myth" of the punic commercial empire and to sum up the logic of their attack and their concrete foundations. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 23:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You do not seem to understand what a "commercial link" is. You have falsely labled the two links you removed as "commercial" when they certainly are not. They do not charge one dime for services. All items are free, public access. Would you consider Wikipedia's request for donations, commercial? <b>Wikipedia is a commercial site</b>. It both solicits donations and draws in millions of dollars, therefore, according to your own logic <u>Wikipedia itself is commercial</u>. Feel free to see my userpage, why I am in dispute of the revisions, and have no intention to make any further <i>generous</i> contributions as I have in the past, until those two links you've removed without reasonable explanation, are restored. To better clarify the issue, websites such as the commercial cybersquatter link, <a href="http://yoursite.com/favicon.ico" class="external free" title="http://yoursite.com/favicon.ico" rel="nofollow">http://yoursite.com/favicon.ico</a> which is displayed right in the midst of <a href="../../../f/a/v/Favicon.html" title="Favicon">Favicon</a>. And <a href="http://www.match.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.match.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.match.com/</a> which charge fees for use of their services, are "commercial" links, but on numerous occasions, certain editors have either overlooked or failed to make such <u>a simple</u> distinction. As a side note, on driving <b>legitimate editors</b> away from Wikipedia: I've noticed many of the articles I've created, contributed to or checked over, seem to have been vandalised more than I remember occuring in the past. Admins obviously <u>cannot</u> keep up with the problem. One article I repaired, had escaped attention for at least three days. Since some people insist on driving away <b>legitimate contributors</b>, this is to be expected, and should only expect the problem to become worse in the future. This includes the growing sentiment which has been becoming more and more prevalent around the web, e.g., simply Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=wikipedia+not+a+reliable+source" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=wikipedia+not+a+reliable+source" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not a reliable source</a>.
