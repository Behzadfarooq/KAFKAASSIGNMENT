<p>Hello, Alan. I've only just seen your comments on Harold Wilson. Not being an economist, I'm not sure how he ranks among specialists in that particular field, but I do know that his academic prowess at Oxford was legendary. I feel also that he was an "intellectual" as distinct from, say, a "clever man" - despite the image of ordinariness that he tried to cultivate. I've heard him called "one of the finest minds of the century" on more than one occasion - all the more tragic that he should have suffered such a mental deterioration after his retirement. --<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a></p>

<p>Hi. I don't know enough about how zoologists or botanists uses the term "subspecies" -- is it the same as "variety?" Is a "subspecies" of a particular animal the same as a "population?" Offhand I would guess that what physical anthropologists call "populations" of humans may correspond to what zooligists call "subspecies" of an animal. I think the real problem is not the gulf between scientists who study humans and scientists who study other animals, but the gulf between scientists and laypeople. Scientists see "species" (and necessarily "subspecies") as statistical phenomena whereas many laypeople see species (and race) as fixed things. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<p>I can't remember if the decomposition was to turn the sphere inside-out, or to create two spheres of the same size as the original.

<p>I honestly hadn't thought about it but I suspect that either South Africa decided not to re-apply or did and was rejected. I have a hunch that it was the latter. I'll see if I can get some information from the Commonwealth Secretariat to see if they know, or else check with the South Africans themselves. Thanks for the observation and the praise.

<p>I must be better at NPOV than I thought. In real life I am very much anti-Tory.
