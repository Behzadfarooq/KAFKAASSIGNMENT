<p>Thanks for all your great contributions to the NJ pages. Quick thing, you took out a reference to Jersey City's nickname "Chill Town" because it was original research and unencyclopedic.

<p>Chris, welcome aboard on to <a href="../../../n/j/_/WP%7ENJ_29f7.html" title="WP:NJ">WP:NJ</a>. We've (or at least I've) made much progress in a very short period of time and there's much more that can be done, particularly with the assistance and guidance of an experienced Wikipedian such as yourself. I'd love to learn about creating maps, and I would really want to create some maps for NJ legislative districts. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:52, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alan, thanks for the kind welcome. I agree, you've made tremendous progress in the NJ government articles. The maps I created were based on the Bergen County map at the state's website, <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dep/gis/digidownload/images/mun/bermun.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.nj.us/dep/gis/digidownload/images/mun/bermun.gif" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, with some basic image editing software (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gimp_a137.html" title="The Gimp">The Gimp</a> in my case). As for maps for NJ legislative districts, see <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Congressional_District_f64b.html" title="New Jersey Congressional District">New Jersey Congressional District</a>, which incorporates public domain maps from the National Atlas. I'm not sure if there are corresponding maps for the state legislature's districts. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 22:41, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good clarifications to my edits on the New Jersey main page, regarding the constitutional amendment passed yesterday. One thing I am never quite sure of on Wikipedia is how to word descriptions of events that have been set in motion but have not officially taken effect yet. (Like the decision to create a position that will first be elected in November 2009 and whose first occupent will be sworn in in January 2010.) You have improved my description.</p>
<p>On another note, I am interested in helping with the Wikiproject:NJ when I have some time to do so. I have done a considerable amount of work on the page for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgewater_Township%2C_New_Jersey_c6e9.html" title="Bridgewater Township, New Jersey">Bridgewater</a>, where I live, though I have found it irritating to have to deal with edits by certain other residents who wish to use the article as a soapbox to complain that taxes are too high, there's too much traffic, or about a part of town they don't like, or whatever. I also have not had time to do really substantive additions and improvements on that page, as I see you have done in the Teaneck article. I also never knew, before today, how many articles there were on the different forms of government etc. in NJ and may have a few contributions to make there. I already left a question in the talk page on the Walsh Act article. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutron_462a.html" title="User:Neutron">Neutron</a> 23:04, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi, here is my logic on what I put on Codey should be the last acting gov/senate pres. I hope this would not happen, but what if he were to die or resign from the senate prior to Jan 06 would the new pres of Senate become both acting gov/pres of Senate. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 23:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is a portion of the Interpretive Statement that appeared on the ballot question that was approved on Election Day regarding the implementation of the office of Lieutenant Governor" "In the event of a permanent vacancy in the office of the Governor occurring before the inauguration date of the first Lieutenant Governor, the President of the Senate, followed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, would become Governor, rather than acting Governor. A vacancy would be created in the Legislature if the Senate President or Assembly Speaker becomes Governor, to be filled in the manner currently provided by the Constitution." So even if something were to happen to Acting Governor / Senate President Codey (perhaps as mundane as his resigning to take another post), his succesor would be the Governor, but wouldn't retain the Senate seat. That's what I based my statement on. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:50, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So that part would take effect immendiently following the Nov election &#160;? <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 12:31, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's already in effect, now that the ballot item has passed. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 12:59, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is probably a better place than your Talk page to discuss this, but since this is here already... I have been trying to find the actual constitutional amendment, not just the ballot question or interpretive statement, and have been unable to do so. Maybe what I am looking for is in the "enabling legislation" that I have seen referred to. The question is this: If Acting Gov. Codey vacates his office (regardless of how) before Corzine takes office, there would be some period of time before the Senate elected a new president. (I do not think there is an automatic succession to that position.) In the interim, wouldn't the Speaker of the Assembly be Acting Governor? But with the new amendment, wouldn't the Speaker immediately become Governor, and lose his seat in the Assembly? Then what happens when a new Senate President is elected? I suspect the answer is somewhere (and I suspect the answer is that the Speaker of the Assembly would only be acting Governor and keep his Assembly seat) but I do not know where to find the answer. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutron_462a.html" title="User:Neutron">Neutron</a> 17:04, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I more than appreciate your question. It is entirely unclear to me what the exact sequence of steps (and their timing) that would take place in the event that Acting Governor Codey vacates the office of Governor, particularly in a circumstance where his Senate seat were also vacated. I agree that there could be a point in time where there is no Senate President and a bizarre chain of vacancies could occur. What if Codey stays in teh Senate but steps down as Senate President? Again, does it go over to the Assembly, or does the Senate get a chance to appoint Codey's successor (who would then become Governor) thus creating another vacancy. I will research this issue and invite you (and our other New Jersey Government junkies) to research this. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Found it: <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2004/Bills/ACR/100_I1.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2004/Bills/ACR/100_I1.HTM" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> This is the text of the amendment itself. (Maybe that should be "amendmentS" because several different sections of the Constitution are amended.) The answer to the question that we are discussing is that the Legislature avoided any such event as we are contemplating, and that the amendment has NOT yet gone into effect. It becomes effective at noon on January 17, 2006, which I have to assume is the moment that the current gubernatorial term (the one James McGreevey was elected to) ends and Jon Corzine is sworn in as the new governor. Therefore, Codey is still "Acting Governor," Senator and President of the Senate (alhough there is a bill in the Legislature to declare him and Donald DiFrancesco to have been Governors retroactively, but that is a different story.) If "something happened" to Codey between now and Jan. 17, then the Speaker of the Assembly would step in as Acting Governor (while retaining his Assembly posts), then the new Senate President would become Acting Governor. After Jan. 17, if Corzine were to vacate the office of Governor, THEN the Senate President would become Governor, but lose his seat in the Senate. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutron_462a.html" title="User:Neutron">Neutron</a> 01:08, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>thanks for finding that info. I am from Minnesota, but this NJ acting governor/ president of senate was interesting to me, but I thought the new gov was inagurated on Jan 10, but that probably would not matter. So it is possible (hopefully for many reason it would not happen but) someone else could still be acting gov/pres senate or speaker house <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 03:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

In this situation I could be wrong but in the past I seem to recall that there always was a special election when a State or Federal seat is vacated then a caretaker is put in place until a special election or a general election is called. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterrick_032d.html" title="User:Misterrick">Misterrick</a> 01:01, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There shouldn't be any problem with most of the articles, as they mostly link to what are now redirects. I've gone through and fixed up the major index pages. If all goes according to plan I'll be gradually expanding the other articles and will change the links at that time. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 21:10, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>It was part of a "wilderness known only to the <b>egyptians</b> until the early 1700's."</li>
<li>That John Fell "was taken prisoner at his home by a band of <b>25 one-armed Loyalists</b>."</li>
<li>That the area "was known as '<b>The Turdpike'</b>."</li>
<li>That in 1848, "the first train ran through the town, <b>killing many</b>."</li>
<li>That in 1880, "Hopper Yeomans ran a <b>traveling party shop, carrying beer and pizza by wagon</b> to customers on his route."</li>
<li>And what about the plethora of brothels, including one that "became known as <b>Winter Brothers' Whoopie Parlor, later changing from ladies to strictly mannequins</b>."</li>
</ul>
<p>This is great stuff! If I didn't know better, I would have assumed that this was from a Wikipedia page that had been altered by a clever vandal.

I would just like to let you know that I am a student at CNHS and live in CN, and the number of students that you have listed are way off.

<p>Thank you for your wikification/cleanups to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_Hornstine_04ad.html" title="Blair Hornstine">Blair Hornstine</a> article. I have one question about the last edit; I used "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plain_Dealer_%28newspaper%29_e063.html" title="The Plain Dealer (newspaper)">The Plain Dealer (newspaper)</a>" in the news article template because that properly links to the article about the newspaper. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plain_Dealer_%28Cleveland%29_3f92.html" title="The Plain Dealer (Cleveland)">The Plain Dealer (Cleveland)</a> does not, and I'm not sure from reading the Plain Dealer article if the (Cleveland) disambig is even necessary -- are there other newspapers named "The Plain Dealer"?</p>
<p>The news article template doesn't seem to give me the flexibility to do a [[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|The Plain Dealer (Cleveland)]] style link.</p>
<p>Do you have ideas on how we can keep using the template but get the Plain Dealer link to work properly?</p>

<p>You clearly have been doing this a lot longer than I have. Put it up for discussion. The numberings of governors isn't as important as the time of term service. The only real problems of listing every term would inevitably lead to the quesion whether or not acting governors should be included. My other concern about your template would be the size of it. (Perhaps you could even split the template into three smaller templates.) -<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogsheng_f60c.html" title="User:Rogsheng">User:Rogsheng</a></p>

<p>Right now I have included Ohio and New York officials into the list as well. I like the state by state idea, but don't know if there is enough.</p>
<p>Quick favor....on the Union County Freeholder Board template, could you update chair and vice chair. Mirabella is now chair and Kowalski is vice chair. Thanks.</p>

<p>A prominent newspaper editor who worked for papers like the <i>New York Daily Mirror</i> named Philip A. Payne lived in West New York, according to an article in the Jan. 29, 2006 <i>Union City Reporter</i> (which I assume was also printed in the Hudson Reporter's other area papers.) There is no article on him as of now, and I have other article I wish to work on, so as a suggestion, if anyone wants to make a one on him, and you want the article as reference, you can see it in full at: <a href="http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/9012/philippaynearticle7hw.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/9012/philippaynearticle7hw.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/9012/philippaynearticle7hw.jpg</a>. I'm sending this message to more than one Wikipedian that I saw on the History page for the West New York article, so you don't have to respond to me about this. You can also begin a section on Noteworthy Residents for that city's page (as I did for Union City), and place him in there. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 00:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../g/o/r/Image%7EGordonMJohnson.jpg_1572.html" title="Image:GordonMJohnson.jpg">Image:GordonMJohnson.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alansohn_Archive_1_b25a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alansohn/Archive 1">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box.
