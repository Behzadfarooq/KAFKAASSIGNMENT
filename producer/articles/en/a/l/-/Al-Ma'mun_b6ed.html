<p>In 802 <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harun_al-Rashid_e296.html" title="Harun al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> father of al-Ma'mun and al-Amin had ordered that al-Amin succeed him and al-Ma'mun serve as governor of <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khurasan.html" title="Khurasan">Khurasan</a> and as caliph after the death of al-Amin. Al-Ma'mun was reportedly the older of the two brothers, but his mother was a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persian</a> slave while al-Amin's mother was a member of the reigning Abbasid family. After al-Rashid's death in 809, the relationship between the two brothers deteriorated. In response to al-Ma'mun's moves toward independence, al-Amin declared his own son Musa to be his heir. This violation of al-Rashid's testament led to a civil war in which al-Ma'mun's newly recruited Khurasani troops, led by <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahir_bin_Husain_645a.html" title="Tahir bin Husain">Tahir bin Husain</a> (d. 822), defeated al-Amin's armies and laid siege to Baghdad. In 813, al-Amin was beheaded and al-Ma'mun recognized as caliph throughout the empire.</p>
<p>There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of al-Ma'mun's reign, while the caliph was in <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merv.html" title="Merv">Merv</a> in Khurasan. On November 13, 815 Muhammad Jafar was acclaimed caliph in Mecca. He was defeated and abdicated asserting that he'd only become caliph on news that al-Ma'mun had died. Lawlessness in Baghdad led to the formation of neighbourhood watches. When in A.H. 201 (817) al-Ma'mun named Imam Ali ibn Musa his heir, this was not accepted by people in Baghdad. They gave allegiance to Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi. His forces fought Kharijites, al-Ma'mun's and arrested the neighbourhood watch commander Sahl ibn Salamah.</p>
<p>Imam Ali ibn Musa informed al-Ma'mun of happenings in Baghdad and al-Ma'mun set out for the City of Peace on the day the fast ended, April 12, 818. At Tus he stopped to visit his father's grave. In early September Imam Ali ibn Musa died. Al-Mamun buried the Imam beside the caliph's grave. Al-Ma'mun wrote to Hasan ibn Sahl his governor in Iraq, the Hijaz, etc. informing him of his grief on the Imam's death. The governor fell ill and al-Ma'mun appointed Dinar ibn Abdallah to replace him. Some of Ibrahim's commanders deserted him. Ibrahim hid.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari_70f7.html" title="Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari">Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari</a> states that Al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad on August 11, 819 (v. 32, p. 95). He wore green and had others do so. Informed compliance with this command was despite popular opposition to the colour, on August 18th he reverted to traditional Abbasid black. While Baghdad became peaceful, there were disturbances elsewhere. In A.H. 210 (825-826) Abdallah ibn Tahir secured Egypt for al-Ma'mun freeing Alexandria from Andalusian pirates and quelling unrest. The pirates moved to Crete where al-Tabari records their descendants were still living in his day. Abdallah returned to Baghdad in 211 (826-827) bringing defeated rebels with him.</p>
<p>Also in 210 there was an uprising in Qum sparked by complaints about taxes. After it was quashed, the tax assessment was set significantly higher. In 212 there was an uprising in Yemen. In 214 (829-830) Abu al-Razi who had captured one Yemeni rebel was killed by another. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sind was rebellious. In 216 (831-832) Ghassan ibn Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for al-Ma'mun was the uprising headed by <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babak_Khorramdin_2f82.html" title="Babak Khorramdin">Babak Khorramdin</a>. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd.</p>
<p>There was also struggle against the Byzantines. In 215 (830) al-Ma'mun led a victorious force across the border. He captured several fortresses, sparing the surrendering Byzantines. The next year, learning Byzantines had killed some sixteen hundred people, he returned. This time some thirty forts fell to the Caliphate forces. The following year Byzantium's Theophilus wrote to al-Ma'mun. The caliph replied that he carefully considered the Byzantine ruler's letter, noticed it blended suggestions of peace and trade with threats of war and offered Theophilus the options of acknowledging divine unity, paying tax or fighting. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign and died on the way.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ma%27mun_b6ed.html" title="Edit section: Al-Ma'mun's Civilization">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Al-Ma'mun's Civilization</span></h2>
<p>Al-Ma'mun's reign is marked by his efforts as a humanist and scholar. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated magnificently and with tolerance. He sent an emissary to the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> to collect the most famous <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuscript.html" title="Manuscript">manuscripts</a> there, and had them translated into <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>. It is said that, victorious over the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Emperor</a>, Al-Ma'mun made a condition of peace be that the emperor hand over of a copy of the <i><a href="../../../a/l/m/Almagest.html" title="Almagest">Almagest</a></i>. Al-Ma'mun also conducted, in the plains of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, two astronomical operations intended to determine the value of a terrestrial degree.<a href="http://www.cosmovisions.com/Almanon.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cosmovisions.com/Almanon.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanon_%28crater%29.html" title="Almanon (crater)">Almanon crater</a>, on the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>, has been named in recognition of this caliph’s contributions to astronomy.</p>
<p>Al-Ma'mun's record as an administrator is also marked by his efforts toward the centralization of power and the certainty of succession. The <i>Bayt al-Hikma</i>, or <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Wisdom_b9d2.html" title="House of Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>, was established during his reign. The <i>ulama</i> emerged as a real force in Islamic politics during al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the <i><a href="../../../m/i/h/Mihna.html" title="Mihna">mihna</a></i>, which was instituted in 827.</p>
<p>The <i>mihna</i>, or 'ordeal,' is comparable to Medieval European inquisitions only in the sense that it involved imprisonment, a religious test, and a loyalty oath. The casualties of Abbasid inquisition would not approach a fraction of those executed in Europe under similar circumstances. In the effort to centralize power and test the loyalty of his subjects, al-Ma'mun required elites, scholars, judges and other government officials to undergo the test, which was a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The penalty for failing the mihna could include death.</p>
<p>The controversy over the <i>mihna</i> was exacerbated by al-Ma'mun's sympathy for <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazili</a> theology. Mu'tazili theology was deeply influenced by <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristoteles.html" title="Aristoteles">Aristotelian</a> thought and Greek rationalism, and stated that matters of belief and practice should be decided by reasoning on the basis of the Qur'an. This defied the literalist position, according to which everything a believer needed to know about faith and practice was spelled out literally in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>. Moreover, the Mu'tazilis stated that the Qur'an was created rather than eternal, in opposition to general Muslim opinion that the Qur'an and the Divine were coeternal. The fact that the Mu'tazili school had its foundations in the paganism of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> further disenchanted a majority of Islamic clerics.</p>
<p>Although <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mahdi_9285.html" title="Al-Mahdi">al-Mahdi</a> had proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heresy</a>, and had claimed too the ability to declare orthodoxy, religious scholars in the Islamic world believed that al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the <i>mihna</i>. The penalties of the <i>mihna</i> became increasingly difficult to enforce as the <i>ulama</i> became firmer and more united in their opposition. Although the <i>mihna</i> persisted through the reigns of two more caliphs, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mutawakkil_f037.html" title="Al-Mutawakkil">al-Mutawakkil</a> abandoned it in <a href="../../../8/4/8/848.html" title="848">848</a>. The failure of the <i>mihna</i> seriously damaged Caliphal authority and ruined the reputation of the office for succeeding caliphs. The caliph would lose much of his religious authority to the opinion of the <i>ulama</i> as a result of the <i>mihna</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>ulama</i> and the major Islamic law schools became truly defined in the period of al-Ma'mun and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnism.html" title="Sunnism">Sunnism</a>, as a religion of legalism, became defined in parallel. And doctrinal differences between Sunni and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> began to become more pronounced. <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hanbal_50b7.html" title="Ibn Hanbal">Ibn Hanbal</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanbali.html" title="Hanbali">Hanbali</a> legal school, became famous for his opposition to the <i>mihna</i>. Al-Ma'mun's simultaneous opposition and patronage of intellectuals led to the emergence of important dialogues on both secular and religious affairs, and the <i>Bayt al-Hikma</i> became an important center of translation for Greek and other ancient texts into Arabic. This Islamic renaissance spurred the rediscovery of Hellenism and ensured the survival of these texts into the European <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a>.</p>
<p>Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khurasan.html" title="Khurasan">Khurasan</a> by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor for his military services in order to assure his loyalty. It was a move that al-Ma'mun soon regretted, as Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became increasingly powerful in the state, contrary to al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahirid_dynasty.html" title="Tahirid dynasty">Tahirid dynasty</a> became a threat as al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and his other opponents.</p>
<p>The <i>shakiriya</i>, which were to trigger the movement of the capital from <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samarra.html" title="Samarra">Samarra</a> during <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mu%27tasim_12af.html" title="Al-Mu'tasim">al-Mu'tasim</a>'s reign, were raised in al-Ma'mun's time. The <i>shakiriya</i> were military units from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, hired, complete with their commanders, to serve under the Caliph.</p>
<p>Al-Ma'mun, in an attempt to win over the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> Muslims to his camp, named the eighth <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam.html" title="Imam">Imam</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ar-Rida_c186.html" title="Ali ar-Rida">Ali ar-Rida</a>, his successor, if he should outlive al-Ma'mun. Most Shi'ites realized, however, that ar-Rida was too old to survive him and saw al-Ma'mun's gesture as empty; indeed, ar-Rida died in <a href="../../../8/1/8/818.html" title="818">818</a>. The incident served to further alienate the Shi'ites from the Abbasids, who had already been promised and denied the Caliphate by <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-%27Abbas_7967.html" title="Al-'Abbas">al-'Abbas</a>. It is the belief of some that Ma'mun has Ali Ar-Rida poisoned.</p>
<p>Al-Ma'mun also attempted to divorce his wife during his reign, who had not borne him any children. His wife hired a Syrian judge of her own before al-Ma'mun was able to select one himself; the judge, who sympathized with the caliph's wife, refused the divorce. Following al-Ma'mun's experience, no further Abbasid <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">caliphs</a> were to marry, preferring to find their heirs in the harem.</p>
<p>The Abbasid empire grew somewhat during the reign of al-Ma'mun. <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> rebellions in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindh.html" title="Sindh">Sindh</a> were put down, and most of <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkestan.html" title="Turkestan">Turkestan</a>. Battles against the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> continued in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and al-Ma'mun would die while leading an expedition in <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardis.html" title="Sardis">Sardis</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the breaching of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza_01b6.html" title="Great Pyramid of Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>. He apparently entered the pyramid by unblocking a tunnel made by grave robbers in ancient times. Because the pyramid had already been robbed, his expedition found only the empty Granite sarcophagus.</p>

<p>Al-Tabari (v. 32, p. 231) describes al-Ma'mun as of average height, light complexion, handsome and having a long beard losing its dark colour as he aged. He relates anecdotes concerning the caliph's ability to speak concisely and eloquently without preparation, his generosity, his respect for the Prophet and religion, his sense of moderation, justice and his love of poetry.</p>

<p>At Tabari (v. 32, pp. 224-231) recounts how Al-Ma'mun was sitting on the river bank telling those with him how splendid the water was. He asked what would go best with this water and was told a specific kind of fresh dates. Noticing supplies arriving, he asked someone check whether such dates were included. As they were, he invited those with him to enjoy the water with these dates. All who did this fell ill. Others recovered. Al-Ma'mun died. As he was dying he spoke, expressing his belief in the unity of God and his reliance on God's mercy. He encouraged his successor to continue his policies and not burden the people with more than they could bear. This was on August 9, 833.</p>
<p>Al-Ma'mun died near <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarsus.html" title="Tarsus">Tarsus</a> and the city's major mosque contains a tomb reported to be his. He was succeeded by his brother, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mu%27tasim_12af.html" title="Al-Mu'tasim">al-Mu'tasim</a>.</p>
