<p>What is the correct terminology for the mosque? I have seen "Al Askari" and "Al Askariya" - someone told me that the difference is that the "ya" ending changes the noun into an adjective. Is this correct? And is the current spelling correct for the article? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 15:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "ah" is the feminine ending. "-iyy" is an adjectival ending, or strictly speaking a "nisbah" in Arabic grammatical terms - it is used to make a noun into an adjective, for example, "askar" means "the military, soldiers" as a noun; "askariyy" means having to do with the military, and by extension a member thereof, a soldier. "askariyyah" is the feminine form of "askariyy". So in this article, "hadhra" sounds like a feminine noun (though I don't know itmyself as a word for shrine) which would cause "askariyy" to become "askariyyah" if used attributively after it. Conversely, the two words for mosque - "masjid" and "jaami`" - are both masculine and therefore would be al-masjid al-`askariyy or al-jaami` al-`askariyy depending on which applies. Is that as clear as mud?</dd>
<dd>Looking at www.aljazeera.net, it refers to it as "mirqad al-imam `ali al-hadi" and "darih [mausoleum] al-imam `ali al-hadi" and doesn't mention it as the `askari anything. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 17:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Palmiro is correct, I don't think this shrine is too widely known as the Askari Mosque in Arabic (see Cam's post below), but it is referred to as "Al-masjid al-Askari" by some sources and as 'Al-Rawda Al-Askariyah' in other writings. Rawda I think means 'under care' or 'sanctuary' or 'shrine' or something like that (we normally use it to refer to a kindergarten). As Palmiro said, Mirqad as probably a more popular name in Arabic. But 'Askariya' (fem) would follow 'Rawda' (fem), while 'Askari' (masc) follows 'Masjid' (masc). <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:01, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Any idea what "hadhra" might be or might mean?

<p>If this mosque is one of Islam's holiest sites, I think that a bit more about it needs to placed into the article, since it's obviously a notable topic in itself even before it was bombed - it would be a shame if its past as a holy site was to be forgotten and all the emphasis placed on it's destruction. <a href="../../../x/y/a/User%7EXYaAsehShalomX_ac1b.html" title="User:XYaAsehShalomX">XYaAsehShalomX</a> 19:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Damage, not destruction. I'd be willing to bet that within two years there will be a new dome on the mosque. Still, you are right, there needs to be more history.

<p>I am having trouble finding evidence that this structure is a mosque, except in some media reports. It always seems to be called a shrine or a tomb/mausoleum in Muslim pages I am finding. I found this quote: "what their [U.S. forces'] spokesman called the 'Golden Mosque' which is, in fact, the magnificent shrine of two Shia Imams" (The Spectator, Dec. 6, 2003 <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/spectator/spec26.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiwar.com/spectator/spec26.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

The structure (the tomb of the two imams) is described in a separate section on tombs of Samarra.

<dd>I'm unsure if this is technically a mosque (which, to the best of my understanding, would be a structure in which prayer services take place) but there was an excellent segment on NPR's All Things Considered today (Feb 22, 2006) about the structure. The shrine may be inside the mosque or may be the mosque proper. The shrine is one of 4 pilgrimage sites in Shia Islam in Iraq, and is the resting place of the 10th and 11th (of 12) Imams I think you've hit on an excellent point, however - is this structure a mosque or rather a housing place for the shrine? --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 03:11, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With my crude searching and cruder Arabic skills, I could not find one Arabic name for this structure which is significantly more common than any other. I added an Arabic name for the building which appears several times in press releases at iraqigovernment.org and at arabic.cnn.com.

<p>I don't think Sunnis would have much to gain by bombing an islamic holy site even if it is most important to Shias. The group responsible would most likely be a third party who would want to throw Iraq into chaos, either because they want to make the Sunnis and Shias destroy each other, or to make both groups destroy the peace coalition forces have been working hard to maintain. I think Iran is pretty suspicious, how they cast the blame on America and Isrial. Their reason, "America and Isrial oppose god and justice", made no sense what so ever.</p>

<dd>I have no particular stance on the truth of this particular claim, but deleting information should be done if you can find credible information to the contrary or lack of substantiation. A simple google search for "ali al-hadi and poison" yields over 500 results. Many are mirrors of Wikipedia content, but there are several which are not including the citation I link here. <a href="http://www.islamicresearch.org/imamat_or_khilafat.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.islamicresearch.org/imamat_or_khilafat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamicresearch.org/imamat_or_khilafat.htm</a>. I think perhaps before deletion, you should work to substantiate the truth with a definitive citation. The mere speculation of poisoning should perhaps even be included in the article as "who may have been poisoned" or some such.

<dd>Um... What? Who may or may not have been poisoned is not generally good content for an encyclopedia article.

<dd>I'll grant that it's not worth including false or misleading facts or sheer speculation, however I know nothing about this subject except that the information was being purported false and I was able to do a search and at least find that it may not be as cut-and-dry as had been suggested. I don't know if there are groups of people who dogmatically consider him to have been poisoned, I don't know if it's considered blasphemous to say he may have been poisoned - in short, I know almost nothing on this subject except that I don't believe you should eliminate existing information from an article on the basis of lack of citation without even making a search for citation *yourself*. My link is certainly not very informative, but it suggests that there may (emphasis on MAY) be truth to the statement.
