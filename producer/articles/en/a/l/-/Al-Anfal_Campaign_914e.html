<p>Thousands of civilians were killed during chemical and conventional bombardments stretching from the spring of 1987 through the fall of 1988. The attacks were part of a long-standing campaign that destroyed almost every Kurdish village in a vast areas of northern Iraq -- along with a centuries-old way of life -- and displaced at least a million of the country's estimated 3.5 million Kurdish population. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/IRAQ913.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/IRAQ913.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Independent sources estimate 50,000 to more than 100,000 deaths; the Kurds claim about 182,000 people were killed. <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> collected the names of more than 17,000 people who had "disappeared" during 1988. <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/pages/irq-article_6-eng" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/pages/irq-article_6-eng" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The campaign has been characterized as <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocidal</a> in nature, notably before a court in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hague_6158.html" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>.

<p>In March 1987, Saddam Hussein's cousin from his hometown of <a href="../../../t/i/k/Tikrit.html" title="Tikrit">Tikrit</a>, Ali Hassan al-Majid, was appointed <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary-general.html" title="Secretary-general">secretary-general</a> of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Region, which included Iraqi <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>. Under al-Majid, who "even by the standards of the Ba'ath security apparatus ... had a particular reputation for brutality," control of policies against the Kurdish insurgents passed from the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_Army_7c79.html" title="Iraqi Army">Iraqi Army</a> to the <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27ath_Party_2744.html" title="Ba'ath Party">Ba'ath Party</a> itself.</p>
<p>This was the prelude to the intended "final solution" to the Kurdish problem undertaken within months of al-Majid's arrival in his post. It would be known as "al-Anfal" ("The Spoils"), in a reference to the eighth <a href="../../../s/u/r/Sura.html" title="Sura">sura</a> of the Qur'an.</p>
<p>Anfal, officially conducted between <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_23.html" title="February 23">February 23</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, would have eight stages altogether, seven of them targeting areas controlled by the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotic_Union_of_Kurdistan_7512.html" title="Patriotic Union of Kurdistan">Patriotic Union of Kurdistan</a>. For these assaults, the Iraqis mustered up to 200,000 soldiers with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_support.html" title="Air support">air support</a> -- matched against Kurdish <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla.html" title="Guerrilla">guerrilla</a> forces that numbered no more than a few thousand.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when captured Kurdish populations were transported to detention centers (notably the concentration camp of Topzawa near the city of <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkuk.html" title="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a>), they were subjected to the classic process of gendercidal selection: separating adult and teenage males from the remainder of the community. According to HRW/ME,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With only minor variations ... the standard pattern for sorting new arrivals [at Topzawa was as follows]. Men and women were segregated on the spot as soon as the trucks had rolled to a halt in the base's large central courtyard or parade ground. The process was brutal ... A little later, the men were further divided by age, small children were kept with their mothers, and the elderly and infirm were shunted off to separate quarters. Men and teenage boys considered to be of an age to use a weapon were herded together. Roughly speaking, this meant males of between fifteen and fifty, but there was no rigorous check of identity documents, and strict chronological age seems to have been less of a criterion than size and appearance. A strapping twelve-year-old might fail to make the cut; an undersized sixteen-year-old might be told to remain with his female relatives. ... It was then time to process the younger males. They were split into smaller groups. ... Once duly registered, the prisoners were hustled into large rooms, or halls, each filled with the residents of a single area. ... Although the conditions at Topzawa were appalling for everyone, the most grossly overcrowded quarter seem to have been those where the male <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detainee.html" title="Detainee">detainees</a> were held. ... For the men, beatings were routine. (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 143-45.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a few days of such treatment, without a single known exception, the men thus "processed" were trucked off to be killed in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">mass executions</a>. According to HRW/ME, the "standard operating procedures" of the gendercidal killings (extended, in some cases, to other segments of the population -- see below) were "uncannily reminiscent of ... the activities of the <i><a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzkommandos</a></i>, or mobile killing units, in the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a>-occupied lands of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some groups of prisoners were lined up, shot from the front, and dragged into predug <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_grave.html" title="Mass grave">mass graves</a>; others were made to lie down in pairs, sardine-style, next to mounds of fresh corpses, before being killed; still others were tied together, made to stand on the lip of the pit, and shot in the back so that they would fall forward into it -- a method that was presumably more efficient from the point of view of the killers. <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldozer.html" title="Bulldozer">Bulldozers</a> then pushed earth or sand loosely over the heaps of corpses. Some of the grave sites contained dozens of separate pits and obviously contained the bodies of millions of victims. (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 12.)</p>

<p>The genocidal and gendercidal focus of the Iraqi killing campaign varied from one stage of Anfal to another. The most exclusive targeting of the male population occurred during the final Anfal (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>-<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>). This was launched immediately after the signing of a <a href="../../../c/e/a/Ceasefire.html" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, which allowed the transfer of large amounts of men and matériel from the southern battlefronts. It focused on "the steep, narrow valleys of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badinan.html" title="Badinan">Badinan</a>, a four-thousand-square mile chunk of the <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagros_Mountains_3aa2.html" title="Zagros Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a> bounded on the east by the Greater <a href="../../../z/a/b/Zab_River_a295.html" title="Zab River">Zab River</a> and on the north by <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>." Here, uniquely in the Anfal campaigns, lists of the "disappeared" provided to HRW/ME by survivors "invariably included only adult and teenage males, with the signal exception of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrian</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caldean.html" title="Caldean">Caldean</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/z/Yezidi_Kurds_718a.html" title="Yezidi Kurds">Yezidi Kurds</a>," who were subsidiary targets of the slaughter. Many of the men of Badinan did not even make it as far as "processing" stations, being simply "lined up and murdered at their point of capture, <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summary_execution.html" title="Summary execution">summarlily executed</a> by firing squads on the authority of a local <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_officer.html" title="Military officer">military officer</a>." (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 178, 190, 192; on the fate of the Christians and Yezidi Kurds, see pp. 209-13.)</p>
<p>Even amidst this most systematic slaughter of adult men and boys, however, "hundreds of women and young children perished, too," though "the causes of their deaths were different -- gassing, starvation, exposure, and willful neglect -- rather than bullets fired from a <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalashnikov.html" title="Kalashnikov">Kalashnikov</a> [rifle]." (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 191.) On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._6e1d.html" title="U.S.">U.S.</a> forces in Iraq discovered hundreds of bodies of Kurdish women and children at the site near al-Hatra, believed to be executed in early 1988 or late 1987. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/13/iraq.graves/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/13/iraq.graves/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>In its book <i>Iraq's Crime of Genocide</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-300-06427-6</a>), HRW/ME writes: "Throughout Iraqi <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>, although women and children vanished in certain clearly defined areas, adult males who were captured disappeared en masse ... It is apparent that a principal purpose of Anfal was to exterminate all adult males of military service age captured in rural Iraqi Kurdistan." (pp. 96, 170). Only a handful survived the execution squads.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, directive SF/4008 was issued under al-Majid's signature. Of greatest significance is clause 5. Referring to those areas designated "prohibited zones," al-Majid ordered that "all persons captured in those villages shall be detained and interrogated by the security services and those between the ages of 15 and 70 shall be executed after any useful information has been obtained from them, of which we should be duly notified." However, it seems clear from the application of this policy that this referred only to males "between the ages of 15 and 70." HRW/ME takes this as given, writing that clause 5's "order [was] to kill all adult males," and later: "Under the terms of al-Majid's June 1987 directives, death was the automatic penalty for any male of an age to bear arms who was found in an Anfal area." (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 11, 14.) A subsequent directive on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, supports this conclusion: it calls for "the deportation of ... families to the areas where there saboteur relatives are ..., except for the male [members], between the ages of 12 inclusive and 50 inclusive, who must be detained." (Cited in Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 298.)</p>

<p>"<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabization.html" title="Arabization">Arabization</a>," another major element of Al-Anfal, was a tactic used by Hussein's regime to drive Kurdish families out of their homes in cities like Kirkuk, which are in the valuable <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_field.html" title="Oil field">oil field</a> areas. The campaign used heavy <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_transfer.html" title="Population transfer">population redistribution</a>, most notably in Kirkuk, the results of which now plague negotiations between Iraq's <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Iraqi_Alliance_5c32.html" title="United Iraqi Alliance">United Iraqi Alliance</a> and Kurdish <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Patriotic_Alliance_of_Kurdistan_47b9.html" title="Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan">Democratic Alliance</a>.

<p>Iraq's Kurds now strongly resent Arabs still residing in Ba'ath-era Kirkuk housing, and view them as a barrier to Kirkuk's recognition as a Kurdish city (and regional seat) in an increasingly <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereign</a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Autonomous_Region_3692.html" title="Kurdish Autonomous Region">Kurdish Autonomous Region</a>.
