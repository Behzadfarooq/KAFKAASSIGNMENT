<p>The group named al-ahbash are a sunni group from lebanon. The books written by sheikh abdullah al-habashi from (al-habashah) are authorised and approved by the azhar of egypt, which is the biggest islamic authority in the world. The books of sheikh al-habashi are taught in kulliyat al-shari`ah (shariah college). The wahhabis of saudi arabia who carried out 9/11 employ people to sit on the internet and lauch hate campaigns against people who expose their fallacies and their non-sunni views. Enough said, the whole Muslim world is talking against their deviancy not just the ahbash sunni group of lebanon. I have reverted to muslimunity's post which is a much more succint and neutral view.</p>

<p><b>Al-Ahbash</b> is a Sunni Islamic movement and non-political group initiated in Lebanon in the early 80s; alternative names are: the Ahbash, Habashis, al Habashiyyin, and Jam'iyyat al- Mashari' al-Khayriyya al-Islamiyya (in English, Association of Islamic Charitable Projects - AICP).</p>

<p>The group follows the Sunni (Shafi`i) teachings through the guidance of Sheikh `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Harari al-Shaybi al-`Abdari, also known as al-Habashi ("the Ethiopian"). It follows Sunni theology with Sufism. It advocates co-existence with non-Muslims, and an opposition to political activism and violence (its slogan is "the resounding voice of moderation").</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>OK</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>At its core the revivalist movement initiated by the Ethiopian (Habashi) Sheikh who migrated from Ethiopia (al-Habashah) to Damascus then Beirut, carries a traditional outlook and practice of Sunni Islam.</p>
<p>It is highly controversial within some extremists circles for its religious stance against Wahhabism, and its conciliatory and diplomatic position with governments (notably Syria and Western governments).</p>

<p>The movement's objectives carry a strong opposition to the politically oriented movements that it sees as heretics, such as the group named al-jama`a al-islamiyya, or the wahhabi movement or hizbut-tahrir, whose calls have been rendered extremist and non-Islamic through the Sheikh's interpretation and academic methodology.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>POV - "whose calls have been rendered extremist and non-Islamic" is an opinion.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One would gather that it might carry a stron opposition to at least one non-politically motivated movement as well. Ideally Al-Ahbash's case for what is political and what is heretical as well as a general outline of the Sheikh's interpretantion and academic methodology should be presented. In fact, the aforementioned outline should be at the top of the page. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 02:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Initially in the 80s, it was an older generation that supported the movement's path. This generation of people used their established contacts (some Syrian) which were heavily relied upon during the complex Lebanese civil war period for the protection of the association that housed the movement's spiritual guide (jam`iyat al-mashari` est. 1930).</p>
<p>In the current climate (post 9/11), we are witnessing the weakening of the 'older generation' effects on the general movement's path and especially its political path. A new generation of younger men in their 30s (some of whom are highly educated at western universities) are taking the lead at the movement. This generation professes a strong Islamic outlook enshrined in non-rebellious Sufi practices and a heavy emphasis on education and awareness as a contemporary alternative for regional stability.</p>
<p>The leadership of the movement by this new generation who has been personally raised by the spiritual guide himself (Sheikh Abdullah al-Habashi), is seen by some as a pure expression of the Sheikh's intent and a reforming period for the Levant.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification on 'non-political'</span></h2>
<p><b>Is non-political accurate? - Al-Ahbash has put up candidates for the Lebanese parliament.</b></p>
<p>True they have done that, but my understanding is that there is a difference between a political party constituted to run for parliaments and between a religious movement which might have individuals who are politically active and who might receive the support of the movement. The group as it states about itself focuses on the dissimenation of Islamic Sunni knowledge through education and other peaceful and non-violent means of interaction in communities.</p>
<p><b>The reason why wahhabism was stated to be extremist</b>, is that at its heart is a call for the use of arms and violence in the pursuit of domination and control. 9/11 was carried out by young men affected by the wahhabi ideology. This is not an opinion but rather a fact.</p>
<p>The other reason why Wahhabism is extremist is that Muslim scholars in the last two decades have written extensively against their deviation away from true Islamic thought. I believe a research was conducted by Dr Hersi Mohammed from Malaysia to find out the extent to which the wahhabi ideology was rejected throughout the Muslim world, and the result of his findings were over 100 books written by major Islamic scholars in the last 2 centuries from Rabat to Istanbul, Cairo, Mecca, Dhaka and Jakarta. This fact makes the wahhabis' claim to be a mainstream ideology in the Muslim world ludicrous and biased.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree non-political is obviously not accurate. I think it comes from the fact that al-ahbash are more related to sufi traditions and sufi are generally viewed in the west as moderate, therefore non-political religous groups which is not always correct.--<a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquitor_1cfe.html" title="User:Equitor">equitor</a> 10:29, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree: there's a tendency in the West to reserve "political" as meaning "militantly political". Perhaps the description could be clarified in relation to its different roles inside Lebanon (where it is involved in politics) and more generally worldwide (where the published stance is education about Islam). <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 10:50, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">20% of the Sunni vote in Beirut is BIG!</span></h2>
<p>Given the sympathy vote that Hariri's son Saad received, for AICP to have received 20% of the Sunni vote in Beirut (an-Nahar newspaper 31/05/2005) entails that AICP is in deed BIG. The Wahhabis who believe that voting is kufur (blasphemy) do not even contribute to voting. In Beirut they are clandestine and they carry out commando style operations from Ain el-Helwe Palestian refugee camp where the Lebanese police force does not have access.</p>
<p>The 5 Wahhabis who killed Sheikh Nizar al-Halabi the leader of AICP in 1995 believed that AICP was a BIG sunni group that undermined the very existence of the violent Wahhabi methodology in Lebanese society. For that reason they cowardly killed him outside his house with his 10 year old son by his side.</p>
<p>The very fact that the Wahhabi McKhan is pushing his warped Riyad based theories on Al-Ahbash page indicates to any person with an average brain capacity that he fears them, and he thinks they are a BIG and powerful group.</p>
<p>The operations of AICP are open and transparent, and not everything that any individual does constitutes official AICP operation.

<p>After all, don't Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP claim to be Sunni Muslims? IF THEY TRULY ARE THEN WHY DON'T MAINSTREAM SUNNI MUSLIMS ACCEPT THEM AS THEIR OWN?</p>
<p>Why would mainstream Sunni Muslim Scholars issue several Islamic Decrees to warn people against them?</p>
<p>and so on and so forth......</p>
<p>These are all legitimate questions which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP try to avoid.</p>
<p>I am NOT a Wahabi nor I am a Salafi. I am just a Sunni Muslim who knows the background of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP very well.</p>
<p>However, it is quite obvious that Muslimunity is attacking Wahabis to win some sympathies.</p>
<p>I just want Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP to be treated the way they truly are: a stray sect / cult who hide behind mainstream Sunni Muslims</p>
<p>I think that is fair and not far from the truth.</p>

<p><b>1- Not a religious sect</b></p>
<p><br />
AICP is rather a religious association (group) within the Sunni sect. The Sheikh does not have an interpretation that mixes Sunni and Shia, the Sheikh rather states in his books that he follows the Sunni way (Shafi` in practice and Ash`ari in creed). On Sufism the Sheikh and his students follow the Qadiri and the Rifa`i Sufi orders. His book as-Sirat al-Mustaqim (The Straight Path) states the above positions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I knew it that you will eventually resort to ebonics / semantics. Indeed, AICP IS the MAIN FUNDING SOURCE and "non-profit" front of Al-Ahbash / Habashies in the West and around the globe. Therefore, AICP, by default, IS a RELIGIOUS SECT / CULT who hides behind mainstream Muslims ALL OVER THE WORLD. As far as your Sheikh's "teachings" are concerned, they are nothing but an unintelligent and dubious innovations to become prominent by picking-and-chosing-as-per-neccessity from different Muslim school of thoughts. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

</dl>
<p><br />
<b>2- Not a political party</b></p>
<p><br />
Refer to my earlier statement above about the group not being a political party that runs for parliamentary posts. The group is apolitical and Sufi in nature. On the contrary, its quietness on political issues has at times resulted in strife for the association. Yes, the group did support Adnan Traboulsi and Taha Naji in the Lebanese elections in 2005, but it was not a Sheikh from the group that was running for the elections, rather the two were civil men that are students of Sheikh Abdullah al-Harari, and they were in the political scene even before they met the Sheikh.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To borrow your own words from your previous post, " for AICP to have received 20% of the Sunni vote in Beirut (an-Nahar newspaper 31/05/2005) entails that AICP is in deed BIG." AND yet you want people to believe that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies are NOT a Political Party? <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

Please, bring some INDEPENDENT sources or a link from Al-Azhar University by itself in due course.

They did try to create one on their own in Australia but they misreably failed and got exposed at the hands of mainstream Sunni Muslims. It is NOT about Al-Azhar approved books nor it is about having a Muslim names and / or anything else. It is all about Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP being treated for what they truly are: a stray sect / cult who hides behind the mainstream Sunni Muslims.

<dd>Muslimunity, I just don't want to leash boredom on the people with the graphic details of basics of Islam to highlight the difference between Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's innovations and mainstream Sunni Muslims beliefs. For example, the followers of Al-Ahabash / Habashies / AICP pray towards the Southeast/East-Southeast contrary to mainstream Sunni Muslims who pray towards the Northeast/Northeast-North from North America. As far as your "politically correct" language is concerned, the bad news IS that it is not going to work on WikiPedia as its founder and editors are more concerned about NPOV guidlines making your accusation of me "pushing my religious ideology" quite "laughable and ludicrous."

They don't even believe in the authenticity of the content of the Quran by differentiating and classifying the content of the Quran into different categories.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AICP and it's Battle Against wahhabi Heresy</span></h2>
<p>Al-Azhar doesn't approve heretic movements such wahhabism. AICP collaborates with al-Azhar, the oldest Sunni institution in the world. Al-Azhar is a high Sunni authority despite what McKhan the Wahhabi thinks. Wahhabism breads odious terror factions such as al-Qaeda and its global franchises.</p>
<p><br />
AICP (Association of Islamic Charitable Projects) Lebanon was not built overnight, and if it did not have deep roots in Sunni ‘aqidah (doctrine) supported by the Azhar it would have vanished long time ago, and it would not have received the widespread popularity and appeal in Beirut, the base of the organisation and the place where it all began almost 30 years ago. AICP played a big role in the Lebanese civil war by promoting a sense of co-existence with the nasara others who were torn up into a bloody feud with some sections of the Muslim community. The civil Sunni attitude of tasawwuf that AICP promotes also helped ease the tension internally within the Lebanese Sunni population, by repelling the attitudes of the heretic militants who for political reasons hijacked the name of Islam and hid in refugee camps that were out of bounds for the Lebanese army.</p>
<p><br />
It was from these outlawed hot-places and refugee camps that the clandestine commando style operations indiscriminately took place against the civilian population of Beirut. Accompanying these cowardist unholy operations were fake cries of Allahu Akbar in order to appeal to the Muslim population. But these cries driven by a lust for domination were all fake cries and calls for indiscriminate killing. These propagandists killed Sheikh Nizar al-Halabi the former leader and founder of AICP, because of the real threat he posed to them. Sheikh ‘Abdullah al-Harariy is not the founder of AICP but rather the religious guide. He is a Sunni scholar from Harar in al-Habashah (East Africa) whose local Beiruti students from traditional Sunni Lebanese families initiated civil and institutionalised da‘wah work in the form of an NGO (Non Governmental Organisation) called AICP and which was originally founded in 1930.</p>
<p><br />
Sheikh ‘Abdullah al-Harari before residing in Beirut traveled through al-Quds and Damascus where he was received as a Shafi‘i scholar. Azhar scholars have approved the Sheikh’s books and have received them with high esteem. The sheikh’s attitude towards secular governments is unique in contemporary times, in that he scrupulously relies on the traditional Sunni fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) in order to find ways of achieving da‘wah related goals without getting into cross fire with government forces. At a time of Syrian domination upon the political scene in Lebanon during the civil war, AICP with the direction of the Sheikh found ways for dialogue and interaction even with the Syrian forces. This does not make AICP a direct supporter of the Syrian Baath party in any way shape or form. This is called diplomacy at times of strife, order to promote the bigger goal which is to protect the true Islamic teachings from those deluded deviants who resided in ‘ain el-helwe.</p>
<p><br />
Australia.</p>
<p>However, with time this small Beirut based picture grew, and what was a Lebanese snapshot, has now become an Australian picture with ‘ain el-helwe having migrated legs and arms here and AICP having local organizations and institutions. It’s the same battle, but has now grown to a world stage. Incidentally, abu-Muhjin the leader of the commandos of ‘ain el-helwe and the assassinator of Sheikh Nizar al-Halabi has been recently found in Iraq as abu-Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi’s sidekick and second man. The ‘ain elhelwe propaganda, which was praised many times in the Sydney based magazine called nida’ul islam and which was referred to as the heartland of the Islamic revolution inside Lebanon, brought with it a dark propagandist machine of hate against AICP's local branch. It was that magazine which initiated the ugly and racist word habashi in reference to the Sheikh. The Sheikh is their top opponent, because his academic Sunni refutations exposed them in Lebanon like no other. He refuted their fake cries of Allahu Akbar by quoting Imam abu-Hanifah, Imam ash-Shafi‘i and other true Sunni scholars.</p>

<p>These are all legitimate questions which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP try to avoid."</p>
<p><br />
AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash call all those mainstream Sunni Muslims - Kaafir (non-Muslim) and blasphemous .etc - who dare to challenge their scholar's INNOVATIONS. Indeed, AICP is the front of Al-Ahbash / Habashies: a STRAY SECT / CULT which hides behind the MAINSTREAM SUNNI Muslims to get legitimacy and to hide their TRUE COLORS.</p>
<p>Muslimunity, Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies love to intimidate. They love to pressure people to cave in and fulfil their demands. Fortunately, these tactics are NOT going to work on WikiPedia as it has stated NPOV guidelines.</p>
<p>AND last but not the least, what kind of "Muslim" are you? On the one hand, you use an id like Muslimunity and on the other - quite ironically - you castigate Wahabis, you launch personal attacks on me by accusing me of being a Wahabi though I have repeatedly trounced your claims by telling the truth that I am NOT a Wahabi but a mainstream Sunni.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fraudulent links provided by McKhan</span></h2>
<p>McKhan who is obviously a hardcore Wahhabi and a member of the same movement as usama bin laden [Wahhabism] has provided his usual rehashed rants and clandestine links. The content for all his illicit rants and links has been produced in Riyadh-Saudi (HQ of the Wahhabi movement) against the strongest global organisation (AICP) that has produced Azhar based refutations against Wahhabism; usama bin laden's movement.</p>
<p>McKhan has confessed already that AICP is linked to what he termed as a 'corrupt' Azhar. To McKhan, al-Azhar in Egypt is not 'corrupt' as he hatefully claims without proof. In fact, to the contrary and to McKhan's demise Al-Azhar is the most recognised Sunni authority and the oldest academic center in the Muslim world. It's recognised by Muslim Sunni scholars in South East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East north Africa, East Arica West Africa and the rest of the Muslim world. The only people that have historically had a problem with al-Azhar are the Wahhabis, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>On that premise, I wonder who is short of legitimacy?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">McKhan is an offstream Wahhabi propagandist</span></h2>
<p>McKhan's claims are lies and his links are Wahhabi links. They are easily refuted by quoting the Azhar who regard Sheikh Abdullah Al-Harari's books with high esteem. The Sheikh's books carry the stamp of the Azhar on the inside. No Wahhabi book will ever carry that stamp. The Sheikh is a Shafi`i Sunni scholar from Harar in Ethipoia originally, he then travelled to the Hijaz and then to Jerusalem, Damascus and then settled in Beirut. The Sheikh was granted permission by the Muftis and the sholars of those cities to teach inside the cities' mosques, where he was attended by the highest scholars. Enough said.</p>
<p>The Sheikh's war on usama bin laden's movement is on. He will continue to refute this deviant and illicit movement and expose its baseless clandestine operations by quoting the early traditional scholars of Islam.</p>
<p>Wahhabism is on the decline.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AICP is free from Hariri claims</span></h2>
<p>AICP is not implicated in the killing of the Hariri nor are any of its members. No evidence has been provided by the staunch ignorant campaign that has been launched by some Gulf based Arabic satellite channels including al-Jazeera. It seems there are some Wahhabi journalists inside <b>al-Jazeera</b> that are driving this smeer campaign against AICP.</p>
<p><br />
AICP had to go through al-Arabiyya TV channel to be able to refute the Wahhabi driven hate campaign and false accusations.</p>
<p><b>Below is an interview by AICP spokesman Shaykh Abd-al-Qadir al-Fakihani.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>Lebanese Islamic group denies involvement in Al-Hariri killing</b></p>
<p>21 October 2005</p>
<p><b>BBC Monitoring Middle East</b></p>
<p>Text of telephone interview with spokesman for the Lebanese Sunni Islamic group Al-Ahbash, Shaykh Abd-al-Qadir al-Fakihani in Beirut by Muhammad Abu-Ubayd, broadcast live by Dubai-based news channel Al-Arabiya TV on 21 October</p>
<p><br />
[Abu-Ubayd] On the line with us is Shaykh Abd-al-Qadir al-Fakihani, official in charge of the media of the Al-Ahbash movement in Lebanon. Shaykh Abd-al-Qadir: Your movement's name was mentioned in [head of the international investigation commission, Detlev] Mehlis's report for involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. What is your comment on what is in the report?</p>
<p>[Al-Fakihani] Good morning and thank you for this telephone call. First, I would like to say that we have not yet had the time to fully read the report, but we - just like many others - heard about it from the satellite television stations' translation of the report after midnight. As we have heard, the report gives details of the investigations and what the suspects and eyewitnesses said. The report gives details of many issues. In fact, we were surprised by what happened last night in terms of the large and serious rush to report things perhaps in an effort to record a media scoop or out of competition with others. We had hoped that some news media would be careful in their translation of the report into Arabic. We hoped there would be no rush or distortion of the words of the report, especially since we are faced with a serious, sensitive and important issue that requires accuracy in translation and in conveying the real information. For example, a satellite television station, and I will not name it now, said Ahmad Abd-al-Al, an official in Al-Ahbash, is one of the key people involved in the assassination. I want to ask where this satellite channel got this information from. Is this television station an international investigation commission? Where do these words come in Mehlis's international report? There is no such thing. There is no accusation against Ahmad Abd-al-Al or the Al-Ahbash movement. All the report says is that contacts took place between Ahmad Abd-al-Al and Lebanese security officials after the assassination. Ahmad Abd-al-Al cooperated with them in his capacity as a Lebanese citizen and an official in Al-Ahbash movement. He cooperated out of his desire to reveal the truth about the one who killed or assassinated Rafiq al-Hariri.</p>
<p>[Abu-Ubayd] Why should Mehlis say a contact took place minutes before the assassination?</p>
<p>[Al-Fakihani] This is an important question and I thank you for it. A short while ago, the Presidential Palace in Lebanon issued a statement denying this. I was told a short while ago that the Presidential Palace denied that a contact took place between President Emile Lahhud and Ahmad Abd-al-Al minutes before the blast. I would like to add - and this is important because we have the right to fully respond - that a massacre occurred yesterday in some of the news media. You participated in that massacre.</p>
<p>[Abu-Ubayd] We conveyed facts and nothing more.</p>
<p>[Al-Fakihani] No, no, a satellite channel said Ahmad Abd-al-Al is a key suspect. This is a media massacre that has nothing to do with facts. I tell you right now: Where is the text, word or sentence in the report which says Ahmad Abd-al-Al is a key suspect? The report did not say at all he is a principal or non-principal suspect. After the assassination, Ahmad Abd-al-Al tried to help the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people and the lovers of Al-Hariri to uncover the perpetrators. Is this a charge against him?</p>
<p>We want to say that Al-Ahbash as an Islamic movement and as a current and association of projects has absolutely nothing to do with it. Some of yesterday's media massacre echoed mere dreams and wishes by some. We do not belong to such groups and these are not our principles.</p>

<p>and so on and so forth......</p>
<p>These are all legitimate questions which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP try to avoid."</p>
<p><br />
The more you get MAD, the more it becomes CLEARER that AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash call all those mainstream Sunni Muslims - Kaafir (non-Muslim) and blasphemous .etc - who dare to challenge their scholar's INNOVATIONS. Indeed, AICP is the front of Al-Ahbash / Habashies: a STRAY SECT / CULT which hides behind the MAINSTREAM SUNNI Muslims to get legitimacy and to hide their TRUE COLORS.</p>
<p>Muslimunity, You cannot intimidate me. Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies love to intimidate. They love to pressure people to cave in and fulfil their demands. Fortunately, these tactics are NOT going to work on WikiPedia as it has stated NPOV guidelines.</p>
<p>Once again, last but not the least, what kind of "Muslim" are you? On the one hand, you use an id like Muslimunity and on the other - quite ironically - you castigate Wahabis, you launch personal attacks on me by accusing me of being a Wahabi though I have repeatedly trounced your claims by telling the truth that I am NOT a Wahabi but a mainstream Sunni.</p>
<p><b>P.S:</b> Muslimunity, If you will continue attacking me personally and calling me a "Wahabi" and the follower of lunatic Osama &amp; Co., I will request the WikiPedia Editors to ban you permanently the way you were banned from the other forum in which you tried to portray as a "Muslim" and then got disclosed eventually.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stop re-posting the same Wahhabi propaganda</span></h2>
<p>I would advice that the repeated posts be stopped. These posts as stated earlier are taken from wahhabi based websites sympathetic with usama ben laden's global terrorist operation. They are fraudulent fabrications coming out from the same illegitimate centers in riyadh that publish literature for bin laden's wahhabi movement.</p>
<p>So stop re-posting the same post over and over. These posts only show how extremist in thought the wahhabi underground movement is.</p>
<p><b>The Sunni orthodox group Al-Ahbash are an international and non-violent association with the logistical capacity and the theological defense capable of refuting with traditional Sunni teachings the wahhabi idelogies of usama bin laden's movement of evil</b> - this is an AICP stated objective.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that 5 from the ayn al-helwe wahhabi group usbat al-ansar were charged and executed for killing the former leader of AICP in 1995. Abu mohjen the leader of usbat al-ansar (convicted in absentia) is still on the loose and reported to be al-zarqawi's second man in Iraq.</p>
<p>AICP resorted to the Lebanese security system in the wake of the killing of their leader in 1995, and not one bullet was shot. This is testimonial to AICP's non-violent and philanthropic conviction.</p>

After all, I am not the one who is attempting to modify that page to fit to my bill but Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP and its followers by themselves.

<p>And last but not the least, I wonder what is so sacriligious and contemptuous about being Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP which doesn't make its followers comfortable enough to be proud of their sect / cult that they like to "fit-in" among mainstream Sunni Muslims.</p>

<p>The source of this statement is located here: <a href="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" class="external free" title="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" rel="nofollow">http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40</a> in the section entitled "THE SHI'A DIMENSION". Being of Iraqi origin i think i would be able to recognize Shi'a and what is mentioned in that article has nothing to do with Shi'a, in fact I know that Abu Hanifah himself said the same thing regarding Imam Ali. Besides if this Shaykh Al-Habashi quoted Imam Ash-Shafi'i then how does that make it a Shi'a belief? That doesn't make any sense. Although we don't go as far as to curse Mu'awiya and declare him a blasphemer, clearly his actions resulted in thousands of muslims being killed and such an act has nothing to do with ijtihad. Ijtihad is reserved for those who reached that level in Islamic knowledge and Mu'awiya was not a Mujtahid. I also remember hearing that the Great Scholar of Hadith An-Nasa'i was killed by some ignorant people because he wrote a book about the merits of Imam Ali and when they asked him why doesn't he write about Mu'awiya he said there is no confirmed hadith that praises Mu'awiya (may Allah have mercy on him) the only confirmed hadith mentions that he eats alot. So those people got upset and killed him. Again, if this Shaykh is following An-Nasa'i in this issue how does that make him a partial Shi'a???</p>

<p>I think we are having a good discussion apart from some people who are attemtpting to modify the page to fit to their own agenda. Indeed, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP is / are mixing Shia and Sunnis' teachings with Sufism. A cursory view of their scholar's "teachings" will reveal that all Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP insist upon is the "teachings" of their own "scholar." If something fits to the "teachings" of their "scholar" regardless whether it is coming from Shia or Sunni or Sufi school of thought - that is automatically "suitable" or "legal" for them.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with the inter-workings of the Ahbash but i have met a few here and there. In any case, do have an example in which they mix Sunni Ideas with Shi'a? Personally i refuse to declare any person(s) claiming to be muslim a deviant without concrete proof. And it seems to me that people as usual are just making claims and expecting people to bindly follow them. So if you have proof i'd like to see it for my own sake because i wouldn't want to follow a group that's deviant.</p>

<p>Some of what you said i agree with. However, i am actually familiar with the website called Talkaboutislam.com and i've spoken with the person who established it. Based on that i can not accept the source you cited as an Academic Resource because it makes the claim that talkaboutislam.com is an Ahbash endorsed website when in fact it is not. The person who established it has an Ahbash background but he is his own person. The doesn't answer to their leaders; he is a rouge so to speak. i know that for a fact. So one can not take the actions of one person and label it the methodology of an entire group. I'm actually going to find the phone number to their headquaters and call them to see what they have to say about this. I'd rather hear it from the "horse's mouth".</p>

<p>The links which have been posted against them so far have been information compiled by people labeled as wahhabis or salafis. And honestly i don't trust them. I don't want to get into that issue right now but i would i will try to do more research. I did speak with a friend of mine who lives close to New York and i asked him about the Ahbash. He told me that they were good and that the shaykhs from Senegal praise them. I have another friend in Malaysia who i will contact as well and i will atempt to read their books and i will weigh what they say according to the rules of the Religion and what the scholars from 1000 years ago said. If i find that they say things which Abu Hanifah (my Imam) or Malik or Shafi'i didn't say then i will stay away from them, if not then i will consider them guided. May Allah guide us All!

<p>American_Iraqi, You know the guy who runs TalkAboutIslam.com and you even tried to defend him in your above lines. In your recent post, your friend in New York have told you that Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are "good" people. Further, you are undermining the links posted in this page by following the tag-line of Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP who try to "label" everybody who is out there to disclose them as wahhabi or salafi. Doesn't it show that you are "biased" and "irrational" already? AND yet you have got the audacity to claim that you would like to have "rational and non-biased discussion" regarding this definition of Al-Ahbash? - AND - you would like to hear the truth from "horse's mouth"? WOW! I am really impressed. Nevertheless, I wish you good luck with your "research" and "phone calls" to the AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash. Lets see what sort of cat you bring out of the sack.</p>

<p>Now, as i said, unless you cite the soruces, i will edit the page every time it violates the NPOV rule. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 00:43, 9 February 2006 (UTC)cronodevir</p>

<p>Another non-NPOV opinion. The group themselves will admit to teachign Sunni Islam and Sufi teachings, they don't however admit to teachign Shia Islam, so there should be a footnote or a soruce stateing WHO exactly says that this group teaches Shia beliefs, You cannot jsut edit the artcle and post your opinion, you must cite soruce. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 00:53, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your ULTIMATE goal IS to HabashaNIZE this page AND to promote Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP belifs...</span></h2>
<p>You just want to make sure that aicp.com / Habashies / Al-Ahbash blends-in among the mainstream Sunni Muslims. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version is NEUTRAL 'coz there are lots of stuff which can be written on Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP but, obviously, you wouldn't like it as it won't fit your agenda.</p>
<p>I am quite content with that version 'coz I have NO agenda like you. I just want the page to be neutral. And what you are trying to do here is to HABASHANIZE that page using WikiPedia's NPOV guidelines.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> is a third / independent party. It is all about differentiating between Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP, a religious CULT, AND Sunni, mainstream Muslims - BUT - keeping this page NEUTRAL. And your whole purpose to be on WikiePedia IS to HABASHANIZE the WikePedia pages to promote AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash's agenda.</p>
<p>If you will read the whole discussion then you wouldn't be asking me about the sources 'coz they are there. But you are simply ignoring them. Why? Because they don't fit to your agenda. AND that is the bottom line.</p>
<p>I have gone through the list of your "contributions" to WikePedia pages and I have seen that you are delibrately placing aicp.com links and you are linking back to their web-site.</p>
<p>So, I will keep reverting back to <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></p>
<p><br />
How is following wiki guidelines 'habashinizeing' it?...you have no logic man.</p>
<p>So, your linking to website that ADMIT to whahabism, and ADMIT that they are indeed a deviant sect, and?</p>
<p>Also, it doesn't matter if the soruce are in the discussion page, THEY HAVE TO BE ON THE ARTICLE PAGE, preferable in the SAME line as the statement is being made.</p>
<p>again, an example would be: Group Y believes A according to <a href="../../../x/_/_/X.html" title="X">X</a></p>
<p>note i made X a link, becasue THAT is how you cite your soruces, people clikc the link and it goes to the soruce, if it is an external link you would say:</p>
<p>Group Y beleives A according to X<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">1</a></p>
<p>Again, place your sources on the page for EVERYONE to see them and judge wether your soruces are valid or not, you cannot hide the soruce on the discussion page as not everyone looks at the discussion page. Thus this would be considered an act of hideing information, or 'convinently placeing it somewhere in which it is unlikely to be read" the same way big company use tiny ass text on thier products to let you know the turth about things which would be opposeing to thier product.</p>
<p>Again, again. I don't CARE if you want to post your anti-habashi stuff, BUT if you do it you WILL cite the soruces, or ti will be removed, though i think the only reason you won't cite them is becasue you know people won't and don't believe your soruces, but that is another discussion.</p>
<p>Also, you seem to think that a non-muslim writeing an artcle about a muslim group is smart idea, i for one think it is the worst idea, thus i frankly don't care that there is a supposedly npov version 'wirrtten by a non habashi/nonmuslim" You don't ask a Rocket Sceintist to write an article about Psycology.</p>
<p>I'm even giveing you the benefit of the doubt and letting you post your obviously wrong opinion, so long as you provide soruces.</p>
<p>So, i say you either provide soruces for those two claimes, or we continue this edit war.</p>

When two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only a third / independent party, in this case that party is <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>, can help.

<p>It doesn't matter if I can find them, YOU HAVE TO POST THEM WHERE OTHERS CAN SEE THEM, its a very simple concept, post the soruces on the same exact page with a footnote leading to the statement or with the soruce as a link directly in the statement.</p>
<p>You can't put the soruces for one opinion on an artcle, on another page other than that article. Very few people actually read the discussion page, much less know that it exists. And the fact that it is convenint for you to burry your so called soruces on the discussion page and not on the article page where everyone can see them has no sway on wether or not your following the guidlines, the guidlines say you MUST state a soruce, OBVIOUISLY, on the same page.</p>
<p>I am not supposed to read something on G.W Bush article that states and opinion, and then have to go to the Government article to find the soruce for the info posted on the GW Bush article.</p>
<p>The soruces have to be on the same page for everyone to see them, i would do it myself, but i don't consider anyhtign you have posted to be a soruce. So i won't do it, i will how ever remove statements that are uncited and completely random.</p>

<p>and this:</p>
<p>"<b>Sixty Million Dollar questions</b> are: that IF Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are Sunnis and they don't have any MAJOR conflict with mainsteam Sunnis then why on the earth they need to invest, market and disseminate their favorite scholar's teaching in the name of Islam by using "Islamic" sounded web-sites like:</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why do they need to innovate, market and disseminate their favorite scholar's "teachings" in the name of Islam using such hedious methods and tactics? After all, don't Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP claim to be Sunni Muslims? IF THEY TRULY ARE THEN WHY DON'T MAINSTREAM SUNNI MUSLIMS ACCEPT THEM AS THEIR OWN?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why would mainstream Sunni Muslim Scholars issue several Islamic Decrees to warn people against them?</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on and so forth......</p>
<p>These are all legitimate questions which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP try to avoid."</p>
<p>But that won't make THAT page NEUTRAL. Will it?</p>
<p>Thats why <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version is a compromise - but - obviously it is not 'NPOV-Compliant' according to Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP because it doesn't glorify them. Instead, it spells out the core and neutral information by clearly differentiating between Sunnis and Habashies / Al-Ahbash. If you want to be considered among mainstream Sunnis then JOIN THE MAINSTREAM SUNNIS - otherwise - remain in the RELIGIOUS CULT of Habashies / Al-Ahabash / AICP. It is your choice.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will keep reverting back to <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version which is way more NPOV-compliant and academic and contain the NEUTRAL sources with-in.</p>

Your kafir scholars like bin baaz and albani arew NOT sunni scholars, they are stanchly whahabie, nor are there any official sunni shcolars in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Secondly, it doesn't matter whos point of view the artcile is coemign form, what DOES matter is the fact that there are staements on the page that arn't backed with evidence.</p>
<p>You see, for everyone else jsut tuneing in, the habashis biggest enemies are the whahabies, and vice versa, it has been made clear this guy McKhan is a whahabie. and it si also clear he is pushign forward hsi agenda, if you will notice, untill this post, i ahve not even ocne critizised his whahabie group, yet every other sentence coeming from him is a slander to AICP, calling us a cult and a sect, we follow Ahl-Sunnah wal-Jummah, the exact same stuff that you hear us saying, can be found in books by most classical shcolars such as Imam SHaffiyyah, Imam Hanbal, Imam Malik, Imam Hannafi, Imam Ahsari, Ibn Asakir, Imam anawawi, imam at-hawawiyy.</p>
<p>I have been trying to avoid a religious debate by simply stateing the obviosu...That Mchan is posting commenst ON the artcile WITHOUT the soruces lsited ON the article, he is posting the comment on the artcle that we&#160;:</p>
<p>1. Teach shia beleifs, which is false.</p>
<p>2. We teach heretical beleifs. Which of course is false.</p>
<p>THese are the main statements i am concerned with, BOTH of which are cited by NO soruces what so ever, and they are VERY major offenses agaisnt thew subject.</p>
<p>Its like if i posted a comment on Mother Tersas artcle that says "She advocated the slautghering of animals" without psoting any sources.The reason i disapprove of a non muslim article the artcle, becasue a non muslim doesn't know exactly HOW biased these comments are.I do nto wish to turn this into a religious debate as to wether those two statemnets are true, i know they arn't McKhan knows they arn't, this arguement has been going on sence the 20's.</p>
<p>IMHO i woudl simply remove both commenst if i coudl, but that would be biased.</p>
<p>I don't care if they are there, but you MUST cite the soruces, you most QUOTe the perosn that said this, if you don't your makeing it look like two things.</p>
<p>1. that these statemenst are known facts, which they arn't. and 2. without citeing sources, you make it seem as if the Wiki is takeing a side of the arguement, which is completely agaisnt policy. As it woudl be stupid and wrogn for me to post information agaisnt the people i follow, i ahve simply chose to delete the commenst untill soemone else posts them correctly.</p>
<p>McKhan, i'm going to report you for breaking the policy of Wiki if yopu keep reverting it back to the invalid version of the artcile. Your goign against the wiki policy by posting un supported statements, if you insist on keep the commenst, you msut post soruces on the same page. You know as well as i do and everyone else here, the average user doesn't and won't read through an entier discussion page jsut to find the validity of one statement.</p>
<p>BTW, the core of this problem, for you non-muslims is, the Habashies say Allah is not in the sky, and he does nto have parts...the whahabies, the anthropomorphists, say that Allah does have a body, and Is in the sky phsyicaly.</p>
<p>Also the term habashi was coined by whahabies becasue the foudner of AICP was from a place in ethiopia called habash.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">McKhan is NOT a Wahabi but belong to a mainstream Sunni Muslim family which is Sunni for CENTURIES</span></h2>
<p>Once again, you are NOT able to answer any of my question with any logic, reason or rationality. Consequently, you have resorted to your tactics by accusing me as a Wahabi.</p>
<p>I am NOT a Wahabi. To the contrary, I belong to a mainstream Muslim family who is Sunni for centuries. And I have seen with my own eyes what sort of hedious tactics, slogans and singboards Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP are using to hide their true colors and to blend-in among mainstream Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>Here is something which is written academically about the Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP's Shi'a Dimension.</p>
<p><i>THE SHI'A DIMENSION</i></p>
<p><i>One of the most revealing aspects of Shaykh Habashi's thought is his acceptance of the Shi'a doctrine of legitimacy. He begins by quoting Shafi'i, that everyone who fought 'Ali was a baghi (transgressor). 37 Habashi further cites Ibn Hanbal to jus tify 'Ali's caliphate against Mu'awiya and his "faction of transgressors" (al-firqa al-baghiya) . 38 As a further step, Habashi underlines the legitimacy of all four members of the Prophet's family -Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn -by citing the canonical writings of Muslim and al-Nisa'i . 39 Equally significant is Shaykh Habashi's rejection of the use of ijtihad by some Sunni jurists to legitimize Mu'awiya's opposition to 'Ali. As a case in point, Habashi takes issue with Ibn Taymiyya's view that fighting with 'Ali against Mu'awiya was neither a duty nor a Sunna. This product of Ibn Taymiyya's ijtihad is found invalid by Habashi because of the presence of a clear Qur'anic text and hadith. In support of his position, Habashi cites the verse "fight the group that is a transgressor," along with the Prophet's hadith warning 'Ammar bin Yasir, a companion of Muhammad and 'Ali, about the faction of transgressors who would kill him. Habashi concludes that "the faction of transgressors" was that of Mu'awiya, and fighting on 'Ali's side was a duty and Sunna . 40 Furthermore, Habashi explicitly disagrees with most contemporary Sunni jurists by citing several ahadith in order to uphold the legitimacy of the imama of 'Ali and of his sons Hasan and Husayn.41 Also, Habashi upholds the teachings of Imam Husayn's son, Zayn al-'Abidin, who is held in high esteem by the Ahbash . 42 Yet, beyond his acceptance of the foregoing doctrinal positions, Habashi's closeness to Shi'ism comes from another source-his deep immersion in Sufism.</i> (Source: <a href="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" class="external autonumber" title="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Further, If Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP are such a good Muslim then why do they hide behind the mainstream Sunni Muslims in the West and around the globe. They failed misrebly in Australia, Middle East and in North America. Indeed, it is rigt there in that academic article what Habashies' true beliefs are but they refuse to let it go.</p>
<p><b>And last but NOT the least, that FATWA has been issued by the mainstream SUNNI scholars, which includes but NOT limited to MAINSTREAM Sunni scholars like <a href="http://www.ahmadsakr.com/bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ahmadsakr.com/bio.html" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ahmad H. Sakr (founding member and president of the Muslim Students Association of the U.S.A and Canada - AND - the Islamic Society of North America (or ISNA)</a> and <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/livefatwa/english/Guestcv.asp?hGuestID=vU7648" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/livefatwa/english/Guestcv.asp?hGuestID=vU7648" rel="nofollow">Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi (former President of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)</a>.</b> What sort of other MAINSTREAM Sunni SCHOLARS do we need to prove the fact that Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP are NOT, I repeat NOT, among the mainstream SUNNI Muslims but a religious CULT.</p>
<p>And NOT only that non-Muslims academics have also proven the fact that Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP promotes its agenda and hide its true colors by twisting the facts. To borrow words from <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>, <i>"If put more neutrally - "that the web presence downplays the Sufi elements"? - I'd have to agree. This journal article <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:HtYngZiIlbQJ:www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf+AICP+Sufism&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:HtYngZiIlbQJ:www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf+AICP+Sufism&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context</a> from <a href="http://www.isim.nl/" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/" rel="nofollow">ISIM</a> (which looks a respectable University of Amsterdam source) supports the view that Al-Ahbash presents itself on the web as simply "Islamic", with a covert agenda at times. For example, <a href="http://www.talkaboutislam.com" class="external text" title="http://www.talkaboutislam.com" rel="nofollow">TalkAboutIslam.com</a> claims on the front page to be an unaffiliated group of Sunni scholars - until you click the link <a href="http://www.talkaboutislam.com/islam/" class="external text" title="http://www.talkaboutislam.com/islam/" rel="nofollow">the true teachings of Islam and the true islamic doctrine</a> and find it's an AICP site."</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 20:27, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Go and figure why would MAINSTREAM Sunni Scholars will issue a FATWA against their so-called "Sunni" compatriots - AND - How can Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP continue using their hedious tactics to promote their religious cult and MISGUIDE people in the presense of non-Muslim academics and authors? It doesn't make any sense. Does it?</p>
<p>I knew it all along and know for the future that Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP will continue to HABASHANIZE this page and other pages of the WikiPedia by using their hedious tactics and to promote their agenda.</p>
<p>So, I will keep reverting back to the <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version of this page which is somewhat neutral and quite WikePedia NPOV-compliant.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></p>
<p>Ok, do you believe ibn tmaiyyah was a great scholar?...if you do, then your a whahabie. Beacsue every sunni scholar of his time declared him incorrect on everyhting. He was also arrested 4 times on counts of blasphemy. The only ones today who see any light in his works are the whahabies and modernists. And the modernists don't hate the Habash.</p>
<p>Secondly. The Shia do not have INCORRECT aqqedah, all of their problems are issues with FIQH, not aqqedah. They believe god exists without a place, does nto have a body or location. Some shia however believe Allah does not decree the destiny of everyone.</p>
<p>The whahabies believe Allah phsyically sits on the arsh and has a phsyical body. They think allah is bound by space and time. Which is kufr.</p>
<p>Thirdly, i didn't answer your questions because they are not relevant, I am not argueing the ligitamacy of the habashies, I am argueing the fact that there are un backed comments on the page. You seem to fail to see that this discussion has NOTHING to do with religioun, but with wiki poloitics and guidlines. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN if you want your hearsay posted on the article, what i DO care about si wether you back it up with soruces or not and wether they are on the same page in open view for everyone to read and deduce thier own judgements.</p>

<p>Fourthly. Besides this fact, the article is NOT complete. In the future, i am planning on adding ALOT to it, such as the history of the gorup, and what they beleive in reguards to Aqqedah. I have no shame for anyhtign they say, as it is complete authentic sunni islam according to the classical scholars. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 12:53, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mainstream Sunni's FATWA against the Habashies / AICP / Al-Ahbash</span></h2>
<p>"Al-Ahbash is a stray sect that follows `Abdullah ibn Al-Habashi. It has recently appeared in Lebanon taking advantage of the ignorance and poverty that resulted from the Lebanese civil war. It calls for the revival of the approaches of the advocates of the science of Kalam (theology), Sufis, and the Batiniyyah, with the aim of corrupting the Islamic creed, fragmenting Muslims and distracting them from their main issues.</p>
<p><b>Establishment:</b></p>
<p>`Abdullah Al-Harari Al-Habashi is `Abdullah ibn Muhammad Ash-Shybi Al-`Abdary by lineage, and is called Al-Harary because he comes from the city of Harar in Abyssinya (Al-Habashah). He came to Lebanon in 1950 after he incited sedition against Muslims there. He joined hands with the ruler of Indragy , the son in law of Hilasilasy , against the Islamic schools for teaching Qur’an in the city of Harar in 1376 AH/1940 CE causing what is known as the sedition of the Kolob country which resulted in sentencing the manager of the schools to twenty three years of imprisonment then he was exiled to Joury county and died there.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rest of the Sheikhs and callers to Islam fell in the hands of Hilasilasy who humiliated them and drove them to flee to Egypt and Saudi Arabia. That’s why `Abdullah Al-Harary was called ‘ the leader of the sedition”. Since he came to Lebanon he kept inciting sedition exactly as he used to do in his country and kept spreading his corrupt beliefs, insulting the Prophet’s Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) accusing `A'ishah, the mother of the believers (may Allah be pleased with her) of not following Allah’s orders in addition to issuing wrongful fatwas.</p>
<p>Al-Habashi has recently succeeded in attracting a large group of insolent fanatics who do not consider anyone as a Muslim unless he declared his submission to their leader and his corrupt creed that includes the Batinyyah and the Rafidah. Moreover, they force themselves on people by going to their houses and insisting that they learn the Habashi creed.</p>
<p><b>Beliefs and dogmas:</b></p>
<p>Reading thoroughly all that has been issued by such sect, one would clearly see that they violate the principles of Islam and its main creed. Following are some of their beliefs:</p>
<p>1- Concerning creed, they follow the condemned school of Irja'. It is well known that the Islamic creed held by the Prophet’s Companions and their successors states that faith is a matter of declaring in words, believing in the heart and all this must be reflected in action for belief without practice and submission to Shari`ah has no place in Islam. However, according to them it is not necessary that faith be reflected in action and hence a person remains a believer even if he neglects all the pillars of Islam. 2- Such a sect consider it permissible to seek the help of the dead besides instead of that of Allah and this is clearly considered in the Qur'an and Sunnah as ascribing partners to Allah. They urge people to do so claiming that the dead get out from their graves to fulfill the requests of those who call upon them and then get back to the graves. Allah Almighty says: “They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah.” (Yunus: 18)</p>
<p>3- They consider that the Qur'an is not the words of Allah but that of Gabriel.</p>
<p>4- They claim to follow the Shafi`i School in respect to fiqh and belief. However, they are, in fact, very far from the principles of the School of Imam ash-Shafi`i.</p>
<p>5- They claim that Allah has created the universe and sent the Messengers to humans for no purpose or wisdom and whoever attributes any of Allah's actions to the Divine Wisdom is a mushrik.</p>
<p>6- They abuse the Prophet’s Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) particularly Mu`awiyah, `A'ishah, Khalid ibn al-Walid. They declared that Mu`awayh (may Allah be pleased with him) was not a true believer. In such case, they are similar to the Rafidah who also insult the Prophet’s Companions. [Muslims must abstain from discussing the relationship between the Prophet’s Companions and their disagreements. They must also recognize their role in promoting Islam and their being privileged with the Companionship of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). It is confirmed that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Do not abuse my Companions for if any one of you spent gold equal to Mountain Uhud (in Allah's Cause) it would not be equal to a mudd or even a half mudd spent by one of them."‏ Allah Almighty says: “And those who came (into the faith) after them say: Our Lord Forgive us and our brethren who were before us in the faith, and place not in our hearts any rancor toward those who believe. Our Lord! Thou art Full of Pity, Mercifl.” (Al-Hashr: 10)]</p>
<p>7- One of the most flagrant violations of this sect is their issuing of wrong fatwas that contradict the Qur'an and the Sunnah. For instance, they consider gambling with non-believers permissible in order to take away their money as long as this does not lead to sedition. Moreover, they consider robbing the harvest and the cattle of non-believers and permissible. They also consider it permissible to deal in Riba (interest) with non-Muslims, and to join lottery games. Moreover, one of their most obvious violations to the principles of religion is their declaration that it is permissible to look lustfully at women, on television or elsewhere, and also that intermingling between men and women without any restrictions is permissible. These are some examples of their weird fatwas that clearly contradict Shari`ah and consider all grave sins as permissible practices.</p>
<p>8- One of their mean ways of making Mulsims abstain from following the scholars of Islam is their belittling of their status, insulting them and labeling many of them as kuffar (non-Muslims). Among the scholars which they labeled as kuffar Ibn Taymiyyah, Adh-Dhahabi, Muhammad ibn Abdel-Wahhab, Sayyed Sabiq, Sayyed Qutb, etc."</p>
<p>Translated excerpts, with modifications, from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Muyassarah fi Al-Adyan wal Madhahib Al-Mu`asirah.</p>
<p>In this context, we'd like to cite for you the following fatwa issued by the eminent Muslim scholar, Dr. `Ali Jum`ah, Professor of the Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence at Al-Azhar University:</p>
<p>“This sect follows `Abdullah Al-Harary Al-Habashi, and it has surface and deep levels. At the surface, this sect seems to adhere to the Shafi`i School of Jurisprudence, and to Imam Al-Ash`ari’s School as regards creed. However, at the deep level, their main intention is to corrupt the Muslim creed and incite sedition amongst the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, they are paid agents to the enemies of Islam.</p>
<p>After inciting sedition in Harar, `Abdullah Al-Habashi moved to Beirut where he started deceiving young men into joining his suspected group. He worked as an editor for publishers in Lebanon and started to cooperate with the Jews and their agents in South Lebanon. He started in the seventies to spread his corrupt thoughts and to declare many scholars as non-Muslims, especially Imam Ibn Taymiyyah , Imam Muhammad `Abdul Wahhab , the Hanbalis and all those who held different views from his under the pretext that they violate the principles of Imam Al-Ash`ari or what he has understood from the texts of the Shafi`is .</p>
<p>Moreover, he urged his followers to incite sedition wherever they go. For instance, they cause such a controversy concerning the direction of the Qiblah in America violating all the principles of modern science claiming that they are just innovations and rejecting substantial evidence. They caused the same problem in Japan.</p>
<p>In addition to causing a problem over their following other Muslims in prayers, the problem over food, the controversy over getting married to women belonging to other revealed religions and other issues that are controversial amongst Muslim scholars.</p>
<p>They hold strange deviant views that have never been expressed by any Muslim sect, group or movement. They declared that intermingling between men and women is permissible without any restrictions, and that Muslim leaders are not true believers and that it is permissible to cooperate with non-believers. They also once spread that their leader died then they declared that it was a rumor. In such a way, they made people detest them as they were always linked with sedition. Several Muslim authorities warned against such a sect including: the Islamic Research Academy at Al-Azhar, the General Authority for Research, Fatwas and the Islamic call and guidance in Saudi Arabia, the Higher Council for Fatwas in Northern America.</p>
<p>In order to continue deceiving people, they usually do not express their true views and intentions in the books or any of the publications that they issue. Even the books issued by their leader is quite ordinary and do not contain any of their aberrant views which is, in fact, part of their plan to deceive people and attract more followers. However, many of their followers repent and revert to the true path when they learn the truth about such sect."</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned facts, we'd like to conclude with the following points:</p>
<p><b>1- The Ahbash group is a stray group that is not considered among main stream Muslims and they have to revert to the true path of the Companions and their successors, both in belief and in action.</b></p>
<p><b>2- It is not permissible to follow the fatwas of such sect.</b></p>
<p><b>3- They are not trustworthy and people must be warned against their dangerous corrupt views. Moreover, Muslims should advise the followers of such sect to revert to the true path.</b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">It sitll doesn't change the fact that your version is NON-NPOV</span></h2>
<p>Your version it not NPOV, which is the point of this discussion?..i have no care in wasteing my time trying to refute you, as you don't believe ion authentic Sunnah wal-Jummah. I will not discuss this further with you, i will simply continune to revert the page to a npov complaint version.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">You are twisting and abusing WikiPedia NPOV-Gudilines = Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP are a stray sect / CULT</span></h2>
<p>I find it quite amusing that you belong to a STRAY sect / CULT and yet you think that you are 'authentic' "Sunni." Your attempts of sanitizing the Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP have proven to the readers that Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP have identity crisis as they mix Sufism, Shia-ism and Sunnism - delibrately - and use their teachings - selectively - to fit to their agenda. The question is how many places will you go to sanitize Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP from the stigma of its own identity crisis.</p>
<p>Here are <b>your own words</b>: "<i>The Shia do not have INCORRECT aqqedah, all of their problems are issues with FIQH, not aqqedah. They believe god exists without a place, does nto have a body or location. Some shia however believe Allah does not decree the destiny of everyone.</i>" ... and YET you have got the audacity to complain about the Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP's Shia Dimension.?</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> is NOT a follower Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP like you and not a Sunni Muslim like me.<a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has used independent sources.</p>

<p>Secondly, We don't teach shia beleifs, we mearly tell people that not all shia are kafir, becasue thier problem is a Fiqh problem, it has nothing to do with thier aqqedah.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Imam Anawawi IS a sufi, in his book the 30 hadith he proves At-Tasswuf, yes you condem him and call him a blasphemer.

<dl>
<dd>"Ijaza" (meaning Permission in Enlgish)? from who? From AICP, Al-Ahbash / Habashies or their agents or "scholars"? Nobody is going to seek ANY such permission.

<p>As i said, go ask the whahabies what they believe, they will tell you Allah has a foot and a smile and a face and a shin bone and he sits on the arsh, this is all kufr and blapshemy and anyone who believes it is a kafir.</p>
<p>McKhans problem with AICP is that we say no, Allah does not have a body and he exists without a place.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dd>My problem with AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash is that they are pathlogical liars and misguide people by putting up signboard of "Jama' Ahl Wa Sunnah" on the front of their center and once you are in you find out that you are into a cult which not only openly blasphemes and calls others Kaafirs but also market and preach its mixture of Sunnism, Shiaism and Sufism in the name of Islam / Sunnis. I have SUTUDIED Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP for quite sometime.

<dd>I just couldn't care less about Wahabis. This page is about Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies. <b>Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP have divided the word of Allah into two categories: First, word which is not sound or letter. Second, which is the pronounced and written word, which says the word of Allah, but it is in reality composed by Gabrael. And that Allah - the Exalted speaks in everlasting words which have no beginning or end, and are not composed of continuing letters or annunciations which are separated or combined. They believe it to be a self discussion in which God talked within Himself, because in their opinion the words of God are not a language, a letter, or a sound. This is blasphemy because they are twisting and reinterpreting the words of the wholy Quran and YET Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP has got the audacity to call all the mainstream Sunni Muslims "Kafirs" who don't agree with their teachings.</b> <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Its very simple, we follow the Aqqedah of The Asharis [Ashari is one of the two major scholars of Aqqedah from the time right after the propeht Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa salaam, the other scholar being Maturidi] There is NOTHING like Allah, its a very simple concept. ALlah is not like anyhting, thus, Allah is not like humans, who have a face a smile a hand and a shin bone.</p>
<p>Also, there is a Surah in the Quran, i forget the name, i iwll get it later, where the whahabies state two things, There is an ayyat where yadd is mentioned, and it is refering to one of the prophets alayhi salaam, According to whahabie methodlogy, we must take every describtive ayyat literally. But they interpert Yadd as power in this instance. Later in the surah, there is an Ayyat where Allah is mentioned and the word Yadd is used, but here, they interpert yadd not as pwoer, but as a human hand. [well they say: "a human hand, but not like ours"] this alone is clear blasphemy.</p>

<dd>The truth of the matter is that You ONLY follow Abdullah Al-Harary Al-Habashi and his "teachings" a mixture of Sunnism, Shiaism and Sufism. <b>Why don't you put on the FRONT signboards of your centers that you follow Abdullah Al-Hararay Al-Habashi? Why don't you? I will see how many mainstream Sunni Muslims will attend your centers.</b> At the surface, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP seems to adhere to the Shafi`i School of Jurisprudence, and to Imam Al-Ash`ari’s School in terms of creed. However, at the deep level, their main agenda is to corrupt and misquide the Muslim creed and incite sedition amongst the Muslims by marketing, preaching and disseminating their own twisted beliefs. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

<p>Secondly, in ibn tmaiyyahs book Aqqedah al-wasityyah [sp?] Ibn tmaiyyah states that this dunya is beginingless, obviously, sence Allah is the only one without a begining, this is also blasphemy.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is known in history that muhammad ibn abdulwahahab was infected with british ideas, and it is known that muhamma dibn abdulwahahab attacked medinah and mecca killing everyone, and declared them all kafir, he states that he was the only muslim left, and that he was here to 'revive' the religioun. Baseicly, he denied the scholarship as a whole, which is even priased in the Quran, and yet he denied its valitity, sorta like todays modernists. <a href="http://www.aicp.org/IslamicInformation/English/WahhabiyyahFitnatul.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aicp.org/IslamicInformation/English/WahhabiyyahFitnatul.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aicp.org/IslamicInformation/English/WahhabiyyahFitnatul.htm</a></p>

<dd>If Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are READY to put it in bold and clear words on the signboards of their centers that THEY FOLLOW Abdullah Al-Harary Al-Habashi then I have no problem with them.

<p>The fact that he is opposed to AICP is proof that he is a whahabie, even the shia do not oppose us in this manner, the whahabies are the only active group agaisnt us. And many more good things have been said by me and others in this thread, than mckhan can refute.</p>
<p>Mckhan is baseing our culthood on the fact that we print and sell books?..wtf? Saudi Arabia prints EDITS and chnages interpertations of the translations of the Quran and the hadith books.</p>

<p>As soon as i find the right admin, i will report this vandalism you have shown. Your pushing your own beleifs onto the artcle by posting your OWN unsoruced comments. tearlach was so earge to write a good NPOV complaint version of the article, he would have said soemhtign abotu this by now.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Reality of Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies</span></h2>
<p><b>Habashies / Al-Ahbash / Ahbash / AICP / TIES / ACL</b></p>
<p>The Ahbash / Al-Ahbash / Habashies, officially known as the Association of Islamic Charitable Projects (AICP), or Jam'iyyat al-Mashari' al-Khayriyya al-Islamiyya which also operates under Jammat Ahl Sunnah in the US and other parts of the world, is one of the most controversial Muslim sect among all the Muslim sects / groups.</p>
<p>On their official web-site, www.aicp.org, they claim to be "The Resounding Voice of Moderation," a claim which is propogated by anti-Islam writers like Daniel Pipes and Jeff Jacoby (See Zionist Connection) on their behalf. However, their critics, a group of Islamic Researchers which includes researchers and scholars like Dr. Muzzamil Siddiqui and Dr. Ahmad Sakr .etc, point out that <i><b>"They hold strange deviant views that have never been expressed by any Muslim sect, group or movement. They declared that intermingling between men and women is permissible without any restrictions, and that Muslim leaders are not true believers and that it is permissible to cooperate with non-believers."</b></i></p>
<p>They further point out that <i><b>"several Muslim authorities warned against such a sect including: the Islamic Research Academy at Al-Azhar, the General Authority for Research, Fatwas and the Islamic call and guidance in Saudi Arabia, the Higher Council for Fatwas in Northern America"</b></i> despite claims made by some of the followers of Ahbash / Al-Ahbash / Habashies group that they are supported by Al-Azhar.</p>
<p><b>All over the world, they use the signboards / slogans of Ahl As Sunnah wal Jamaat on their centers and materials of propaganda. They call themselves "authentic" Sunnis and they call authentic mainstream Sunnis "Kaafirs."</b></p>
<p><b>Further, to misguide the mainstream Sunni Muslims, new Muslims and Muslim youth, they are creating web-sites all over the world wide web, running their web-sites as "authentic" mainstream Sunni Muslims and linking on all the Free Forums / Encyclopedias like WikiPedia by using Islamic sounding domain names like:</b></p>

<p>Since they are not part of Islamic Jurisprudence council, they have formed their own "high" council to issue Fatwas in Australia:</p>

<p><b>e). They claim that Allah has created the universe and sent the Messengers to humans for no purpose or wisdom and whoever attributes any of Allah's actions to the Divine Wisdom is a mushrik.</b></p>
<p>According to one Fatwa (Religious Decree) issued by Islamonline.net, <i><b>"they usually do not express their true views and intentions in the books or any of the publications that they issue. Even the books issued by their leader is quite ordinary and do not contain any of their aberrant views which is, in fact, part of their plan to deceive people and attract more followers. However, many of their followers repent and revert to the true path when they learn the truth about such sect."</b></i></p>
<p>Consequently, they conclude with the following points:</p>
<p><b>1- The Ahbash group is a stray group that is not considered among main stream Muslims and they have to revert to the true path of the Companions and their successors, both in belief and in action.</b></p>
<p><b>2- It is not permissible to follow the fatwas of such sect.</b></p>
<p><b>3- They are not trustworthy and people must be warned against their dangerous corrupt views. Moreover, Muslims should advise the followers of such sect to revert to the true path."</b> <i>(Source: "Al-Ahbash: Evolution and Beliefs" - IslamOnLine.net - June 07, 2003)</i></p>

<p>You failed to state that these are known Whahabie websites. And that there is no official authority of sunni islam in saudi arabia. Also, could you state the ijaza ofthe men who have made 'fatwas' agaisnt us? Before one is allowed to give religious fatwas, he must be given ijaza by the shiekh who taught him, and even in some cases, he msut have a solid chain of sheikhs leading up to the propeht sallalahu alayahi wa salaam, please, you must state the qualifications of those that give fatwas, so as not to confuse people or tricking them into thing such and such person is a valid mujatahid or mufti. -cronodevir</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">McKhan is vandalizeing</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, i would like to say that i am a part of AICP, yet all the changes i make are reverted by peopole who are NOT from aicp.</p>
<p>Here is what i don't get. HOw the FUCK is Mckhan or a non-muslim even, a better auhtroity on AICP than someone who is actually IN aicp?</p>
<p>Why the hell would i ask an asian to write an article on europe? Common sense tells you that if you want an article about europe, then you would go to a ueropean FFS!</p>
<p>Haveing someone write an article they know nothing about is stupid. I'm in aicp, i know what is taught, and i can tell you what we teach, and i can tell you we DON'T mix beleifs with other sects, and we don't teach shiism, in fact alot fo what we say is jsut as much anti shia than it is anti whahabie.</p>
<p>My point is, if there is ANYONE suited for the job of writeing an article, it would be someone who has soemhtign to do with the article in the first place.</p>
<p>Me telling you what we teach isn't a biased view, it is the correct view, becasue i'm telling you what we teach, why the hell would i lie about the very thing i am trying to uphold?</p>
<p>Why the hell would steven king write a book, then go out and tell people it isn't his work?</p>
<p>WTF is that? "We can't use information on AICP website for the article about AICP becasue its biased" what the hell is that? Are you going to tell me you can't use information from google.com to wirte an article about google.com? Also note, that none of the information on aicp is copyrighted, its under no lisences what so ever. And it wouldn't matter anyhow, sence the website isn't even in ameirca or europe.</p>
<p>I am getting tired of people telling a scientist that he doesn't know anythign about the science he is in. [an anaology]</p>
<p>IMHO the best way to have the article is to firstly cite information on the article , from the soruces obviously. if i want to write an article about yahoo.com, obviously, i'm going to use information i got...believe it or not....from yahoo.com.</p>
<p>The article should contain what AICP says, becasue what AICP says is, obviously, what AICP is, if anyone has objections to this view, we can start a subsection in the article with other point of views.</p>
<p>But this McKhan guy who is NOT in aicp, is trying to tell ME who is in aicp, what aicp teaches, it's very illogical. Especially when he used NONE of the aicp texts to try and refute me, if you will ntoice,ALL of his soruces say "aicp says this aicp says that" yet he doesn't have&#160;! book or text that is actually FROM aicp, that says what he claimes. He has all this 'proof' against us, yet he can't provide a single quote from OUR aicp books that says what he claimes. Obviosuly, McKhan doesn't know how to debate, snece he cannot adqutly provide proof that we say or claime what he says we do.</p>
<p>Mckhans argument is absicly this "AICP teaches shia beleifs becase this scholar who is not in aicp and who admits to being a salafi and not a sunni, says so."</p>
<p>That is like asking a jew to write a biography on Jesus.</p>
<p>I don't care if McKhan wants hiw opinion psoted on the article, but he WILL make it CLEAR that it is HIS opinion, and NOT a fact.</p>
<p>As for tearlach, his version is incorrect ebacsue there are many major claimes that are uncited, and have absolutly no link or footnote stateing that the 'proof' is in the external links. -cronodevir</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">McKhan is simply following the WikiPedia NPOV Guidlines</span></h2>
<p>I never started this reversion war. I told you from the day first, when you started vandalising this page after failed attempts to creat a page on Abdullah_al-Harariyy, that this version has been agreed upon and written by a NEUTRAL party, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>. Though, I, as a mainstream Sunni who have studied the Habashies / AICP / Al-Ahbash for quite sometime and know about them in-depth, have had my disagreements with <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> but I am content with this somewhat NPOV-compliant version.</p>
<p>This page is NOT about what Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies - or - mainstream Sunnis are saying about each other. It is about NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW which <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version has achieved somewhat. It will be unfair to say that he didn't quote the sources as he did. He / She only used INDEPENDENT / ACADEMIC sources and did his / her own research.</p>

<p><br />
POV). It is NOT about what AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies - or - mainstream Sunnis like to have on that page. It IS about INDEPENDENT / ACADEMIC / NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW. And <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version is somewhat WikePedia NPOV Guidelines compliant and that IS the MOST RELEVANT thing in this whole matter. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></p>
<p>"is somewhat WikePedia NPOV Guidelines compliant" you even admit it isn't NPOV, thus proveing that there are statements which do not follow NPOV guidelines, there are actually 20 or so incorrect statements abotu the group. I am only dealing with 2 right now. The two statements i am tlkaing about, indirectly imply that all AICP people are kafirs. Which is the exact POV McKhan wants the article to show. Way to go wikipedia for calling a major religious group kafirs.</p>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, It has NOTHING TO DO with McKhan's personal opinions. Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies call all those individuals "Kaafirs" and "non-Muslims" and "Wahabis" who disagree with their beliefs. It is all about WikiPedia NPOV guidelines. It is NOT an AICP platfrom. It is an ENCYCLOPEDIA. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

<p>If it was all about guidelines, you wouldn't be here debateing wether "and other ehretical beleifs" and "they mix shism with sunnis" are cited or not, when the clear and obivous fact is that they ARN"T sourced, there is no source pointing to these claimes, they are jsut utterly random statements put in the article by you, which i might add were both acts fo vandalism, if you had posted soruces for these statements, the article would meet NPOV guidelines, but sence these statements are not cited. They are POV, and according to you, this is wikis POV. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 23:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ditto! - You keep recycling the same "objections" over and over again. All of your "objections" have been DISCUSSED on this very page. The sources, INDEPENDENT, NEUTRAL and ACADEMIC, are right THERE on that page. Fairly and impartially speaking, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has given AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies quite favorable POV by providing <i><b>a).</b></i> an external link to Al-Ahbash / Habashies' arch web-site and to another contrary link <i><b>b).</b></i> quoted your BOGUS and OXYMORONIC claim that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies <i>advocates pluralism, and opposition to political activism and violence</i> (There is ample material available over the internet to refute both claims. Here is <a href="http://www.lcps-lebanon.org/pub/breview/br4/parlmtpt1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lcps-lebanon.org/pub/breview/br4/parlmtpt1.html" rel="nofollow">a write-up</a> + <a href="http://www.meib.org/images/0104_ahbash1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.meib.org/images/0104_ahbash1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Associated Press photograph (Member of Al-Ahbash brandishing clubs and knives)</a> as an example) - and - <i><b>c).</b></i> quoted AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' FRADULENT slogan from their own web-site, "the resounding voice of moderation" (Says who? AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies by themselves?). AND yet you have got the audacity to claim that <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version is NOT good / favorable enough for the Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP&#160;? Your ultimate goal IS to sanitize Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies to hide your agenda to blend-in among mainstream Sunni Muslims on each and every platfrom. Thats why people like you pop-up, on the behalf of AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies, after every few weeks to rant and rave and complain about this page - and - simply IGNORE all the TANGIBLE / NEUTRAL / INDEPENDENT / ACADEMIC sources because they don't "represent" the - DESIRED - AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' "POV." Perhaps, you don't appreicate the fact that if I will write that page according to my wishes, that page will NOT be somewhat NEUTRAL like the way it is NOW and same goes for you. AND I told you in the very beginning that - when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version doesn't only serve the purpose but also meets the WikiPedia guidelines. Once again, let me remind you that it is an ENCYCLOPEDIA which aspires to maintain NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW. It is NOT mainstream Sunnis' or Habashies' platform. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

<p>It still does not change the fact that the page is not NPOV. Secondly. "TANGIBLE / NEUTRAL / INDEPENDENT / ACADEMIC sources" according to whom? You?. Also. "when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job." What two parties? AICP is 1 group with oen set of goals. There is no division amoung themselves about what they teach. Thus there is no arguement or debate going on. Sence we know what they teach and what thier goals are. I a member of AICP, have been trying to make the article TRUTHFUL about what we say, who are YOU to tell ME what WE say? Your not even in the group. There is no debate. There is only me trying to make the article truthful and NPOV [truth..is not a point of view] If there was an article on why 1+1=2, it is clear there should be no debate about it. Me being a memebr of AICP, am telling you wqhat we teach, but you, not being a memebr, are trying to tell us what we teach?..and you want to tlak about logic? When you speak on behalf of a group to whom you have NO link to? You, shouldn't even be posting anyhting, sence you are obviosuly not AICP, you are not fit to tell the readers what AICP is. Sence tearlach is not AICP, he is not fit to tell people what AICP is. The ONLY people fit to tell you what aicp is are the people who are IN aicp. DER DER DER! Use common sense. Again, all of your 'proofs' are from random uncreditable men whom do not have any ijaza from any sheikh to give fatwas on any subject. You seen aicp member with knives and guns? LOL!, i have seen whahabies blow the shit out of ameircan and british buildings..and you want to get mad beacsue an aicp member had a knife? get a fucking life man. What AICP teaches is not soemthign that is up for 'debate' AICP is here today, they can tell you what they teach. We do not need some forigner to tell everyone else what we teach. Again. i ask, who are you, and what is your status and credability, to edit an article you have no business editing? And please, stop trying to use big words that have no relevence to this subject, you have not posted a single academicly crediable soruce yet. NOR have you posted a single neutral soruce. Tangible?..How is it tangible that someone who is not from ACIP, possibly teach otehrs what AICP says? Why do people have to read YOUR POV on what aicp teaches? Why not jsut ask us? My point being, this article is about AICP, thus only people who are linked with aicp should be able to speak for AICP. Just like if there was an article on molucular biology, a phsyics professor has no business trying to speak for the molecular biology community. Learn your place McKhan, it is not a representative of AICP. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 05:18, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Congratulations! Once again, you have proven the fact that you cannot have a rational dialogue without resorting to language like "get a fucking life man" and ebonics like "from random uncreditable men whom do not have any ijaza from any sheikh to give fatwas" .etc. Nobody is going to seek "Ijaza" (permission) from any AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' "Shekikh." By using such tactics you are simply violating the WikiPedia civility guidelines. I just couldn't care less what Wahabis do and don't. All I know that I belong to a family which is mainstream Sunni for centuries and Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies are just a "new-born" CULT which is trying its best to hide its agenda and beliefs to blend-in among mainstream Sunnis. Under this pretext and context, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version serves the WikiPedia-NPOV guidelines. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

Seeking ijaza is not ebonics. McKhan, belittleing the religioun is blasphemy, watch yourself. One is REQUIRED to seek ijaza from a creditable SUNNI scholar. Every website you have posted is admitily whahabie or 'salafi'. Why could you care elss what your family does? Why are you hideing the fact that your a whahabies, EVERY claime you have emntioned today is mentioned ONLY by whahabies and thier misguidence. Stop lieing McKhan, its a major sin. No one has to seek ijaza from aicp. they HAVE to seek ijaza from a creditable sunni scholar, that of which you know nothing about, proof by your psoting incoherint crap from these whahabie websites. Also, you yourself said tearlach's version isn't NPOV compliant...jsut they way you WANTED it to be. That is why your fighting in this debate, beacsue you want the artticle to stay exactly the same, becasue it makes AICP look bad, and becasue you KNOW it isn't NPOV, as you have pointed out. Watchign you debate on is like watching a animal run from the butcher. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 12:40, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

What sort of other MAINSTREAM Sunni SCHOLARS do we need to prove the fact that Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP are NOT, I repeat NOT, among the mainstream SUNNI Muslims but a religious CULT." Quit telling me what is "blasphemous" and what is NOT. At least, I don't follow that CULT which claims to be "Sunni" and then divides the word of Allah into two categories: First, word which is not sound or letter. Second, which is the pronounced and written word, which says the word of Allah, but it is in reality composed by Gabrael. And that Allah - the Exalted speaks in everlasting words which have no beginning or end, and are not composed of continuing letters or annunciations which are separated or combined. They believe it to be a self discussion in which God talked within Himself, because in their opinion the words of God are not a language, a letter, or a sound. This IS the biggest <b>blasphemy</b> because they are twisting and reinterpreting the words of the wholy Quran and YET Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP has got the audacity to call all the mainstream Sunni Muslims "Kafirs" who don't agree with their teachings. And last but not the least, If Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are READY to put it in bold and clear words on the signboards of their centers that THEY FOLLOW Abdullah Al-Harary Al-Habashi then I have no problem with them. My problem starts when they hide that and their other agenda and let the mainstream Sunni Muslims find out by themselves when its too late. I am also opposed to Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP because, to borrow words from the mainstream Sunni scholars' <a href="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/habasi_history.htm" class="external text" title="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/habasi_history.htm" rel="nofollow">FATWA - Al-Ahbash: Their History and Their Beliefs</a>, <b>a).

<p>Again, you quote MEN, what are there qualifications?..jsut becasue the man is head of an 'islamic' group doesn't make him a scholar. Abdullah Harriy has a solid and trusted chain of teachers all the way to the propeht sallahu alayhi wa salaam, who do your men have?..a peice of paper from medinah saying "They are scholars"?. Secondly, to say attributed created things [sound, vocalizations, letters] to Allah is tashbih. And you are comiting it. Allah is nto related to any CREATED things, vocalizations are created things, letters and words are created things. Allah is not attributed with the creation. your attributeing created attributes to Allah. THAT is blasphemy. Your saying Allah speaks like we do, which implies that Allah is similar to us. THIS IS BLASPHEMY. by sayign Allah speaks like we do, you are likeining him to the creation, and makeing tashbih. The clause "not like ours" or "not like we do" does not clear the statement from, blasphemy. to say "Allah has a hand, but not like ours" Your makeing tashbih becasue your attributeing a created thing 'hand' AND your giveing a similarity. These things are tashbih. Of course, alot of this is dealing with translated things. for instance, with Yadd. We don't deny that Allah has yadd. we do deny that Allah has a hand. yadd, does not only mean "hand". but when a leyman translates it to say 'hand' you get all kinds of problems. In the end, saying Allah speaks like we do is tashbih. also, we do NOt claime that ethe messenegrs were sent with no purpose, i garantee you you will nto find anyhting even liek this in OUR [acip] books. Me, being in aicp, was taught that EVERYTHING in existances has a purpose and a reason. I can ask ym sheikh now and he would tell me that. So that claime is incorrect anyways. Also, the are sahih ahdith PROVEING that tawwasul is halal, even mainstream sunni scholars say this. The very men you quote admit tawwasul. Next claim? Faith must be reflected in action? Ok. according to you, if one has no legs, they cnanot stand in prayer, and thus they are akfirs becasue they didn't pray. See how illogical this is? Not everyone is ABLE to do the actions. YOU are condeming every single person who doesn't do every single act of worship. You have just labeled the entire ummah kafirs. According to your methodlogy. {which is btw, the same claim made by Muhammad ibn abdulwahahab, the leader of the whahabie movement.}<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 00:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

In response to your line "i garantee you you will nto find anyhting even liek this in OUR [acip] books," - ONCE AGAIN, I will borrow the words from that <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544180" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544180" rel="nofollow">FATWA</a> which reads: <b>"In order to continue deceiving people, they usually do not express their true views and intentions in the books or any of the publications that they issue.

Just to let you know that Dr. Ahmad H. Sakr and Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi are NOT based in Saudi Arabia but in North America and ISNA is the biggest mainstream Sunnis' organization in North America.

Lol, this is funny, FIRST off, what you claime is not in ANY AICP books, NOR is it taught by ANY aicp sheikhs, NOR can you quote any of these claism from any of the AICP sheikhs....yet this is whatw e say? Your the one who is being rediculious "They don't say this in any of thier books, nor do they teach this, but this is what they REALLY mean" WTF? you are basicly saying that we teach what we don't teach. Also, Ph.D is not a valid qualification of giveing a fatwa. There is only ONE way of getting qualification for give a fatwa, and that is the way of the Sunnah, which is to seek ijaza from thier shiekh. You expect me to believe what soem guy from an amiercan university says about islam? I beg to differ. you are very strange, first you amke claimes about us, yet you cannot even prove we say them. And then you quote from western apologist 'shcolars' who have no qualifications over anything. Why not just quite the bullshit? We don't say what you claim, nor do we teach it, why don't you get a clue and realize WE DON"T BELIEVE THOSE CLAIMES? How can you jsut rnadomly attribute stuff to us which we have never even said? Nor have we ever taught. Nor can you prove that any of those claims came from us. Yet your saying this is what we say. I do hope the admins see this fallacy McKhan is proveing to have...."They don't teach it, nor is it in any of thier books, nor do thier shikhs say this, but this is what they REALLY mean." oh my God, you are a funny character. Yep, we teach sunni views, like McKhan said, so that we can get more followers. "Even the books issued by their leader is quite ordinary and do not contain any of their aberrant views which is, in fact, part of their plan to deceive people and attract more followers." We teach sunni islam to attract followers, then when your a follower, we apparently still teach sunni islam, then after you have been with us, apparently, we still teahc sunni islam. But we really teach other things, and not sunni islam" Um? this is what you call an oxymoron. How can you in one line admit we teach sunni beleifs, then in the next say we don't? How is it possiable that ever single book and sheikh from aicp, teache saunthtic sunni islam, as you have said. yet teahc msiguidence at the same time? "None of this books say it" Uh, no shit? Maby that is becasue we don't say it period? Get a clue. I should submit this ti bash.org Yep, lol, everyone, we teach sunni islam, we believe sunni islam, but we really have diffrent teqachings than sunni islam, but we don't want you to know. Yes, we lie about our own belief. LOLOL! the bottom line is, we don't teach what McKhan claims, even McKhan said so himself. Yet somehow, after not ever sayign or etachign what he claims, he believe this is what we say. That is like if i was a white guy, and i had a friend who was black, McKhan would be that guy that coems up and says "But you really hate him despite what you say, i know you hate him" <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronodevir_37bb.html" title="User:Cronodevir">Crono</a> 12:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

So, no matter how many "WTF" you use or how much psycho-babbling or sanitizing you do... The fact remains the same: Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP is a CULT which hides its beliefs and agenda to blend-in among mainstream Sunnis.

What shcoalrs have you quoited? i ahve seen none. Secondly, i find ti funny every time your defeated in battle, you always come up or invent a new word to some how counter it, such as the word "psycho-babbling". Secondly, how do you "hide the beliefs you teach"? If i am teaching them, i'm not hideing them am i? Your arguement fails in simple logic. First, you give your claims, and then i ask you to provide proof that we said those claims, and you say 'we are hideing it"...i'm sorry, but this isn't the situation, the situation is You are makeing claimes, based off nothing, you said it yourself that we don't say the things you claime we do, but we 'secretly say the things you say we do', secretly? what in the hell are you talking about? I can contact sheikh abdullah if i wanted to and i garantee he would not agree with the things you claime he agrres with. The simply point is, and you yourself have proven this, is your makeing claimes based off hearsay. PLEASE PROVIDE A SOURCE FROM AICP THAT STATES ANY OF THE CLAIMES YOU MADE. Quote one of our books or shcolars. The fact that you said we don't say those things, proves that your claimes that we DO say them is based off nothing, as you have no evidence to rpove it. "AICP says this, becasue 'mainstream sunni' shcolars said so, and sence AICP hides its beleifs, we have no rpoof they say this" That is your arguement, point blank. In the end, there is no proof from AICP soruces that implies we teahc shia or ehretical beleifs, and McKhan has proven this. McKhan, your contradicting yourself in the same sentence. "They teach this, but they don't teach it"</p>

<dd>And don't forget it is all about DIFFERENTIATING between mainstream Sunnis and the CULT of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP. If your AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies are so proud of themselves then I dare them to STOP using the signboards of Jamat Ahl Wa Sunna all over the world on their centers and materials and then I will see how many mainstream Sunnis walk into their centers. In North America, Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies don't even pray in the same direction as of mainstream Sunnis. And last but NOT the least, learn how to Google about Habashies. It may open up your eyes. In the fervor of "rescuing" and "sanitizing" your Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP group, don't forget that WikiPedia is NOT a religious platform. It is a platform which aspires to maintain NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW. And <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version so far remains to be meeting the WikiPedia NPOV Guidelines. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan">McKhan</a></dd>

It is a major sin to speak without knowlage McKhan, as you have proven you cannot provide daleel that we said most of those claimes. You have also proven you are only blindly following what your 'scholars' tell you. You do not do any research yourself. Scholars must also provide proof for what they say.

<dd>Ditto! You think that it IS a religious "discussion" and I am here to "prove" something. As I already mentioned, to me, it is all about DIFFERENTIATING between mainstream Sunnis and the CULT of AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies. And so far, you are helping me to corroborate that DIFFERENCE by establishing the fact that you know nothing about mainstream Sunnis' beliefs. In my humble and logical point of view, Denying the totality of the Quran and calling it mere the conversation of Gabriel and / or twisting its meaning is THE BIGGEST SIN in Islam. Go and Figure. You are more than welcome to <i><b><a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" rel="nofollow">Ask a mainstream Sunni scholar</a></b></i> for any sort of "evidence" or "prrof." From the very start, you have been intentionally IGNORING, like rest of the agents / followers and sympthaizers of AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies, all the sources which are provided through out this very page - <b>and</b> - on the various search engines like Google and Yahoo about Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP. You INSIST, like rest of the agents / followers and sympthaizers of AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies, that ONLY the AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' endorsed sources are "authentic," "truthful" and rest of the sources are either "Wahabi" sources or "they follow their scholars blindly." You even criticized the NEUTRAL / ACADEMIC sources quoted by <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>. These are old AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' tactics which they have used and continue to use over and over again in their defense.

The decree describes al-Ahbash of holding "deviant and perverse views" and taking part in "extremist and fanatical" behaviour. The statement is signed by key Islamic leaders, including Australian Federation of Islamic Councils president Ameer Ali and the imam (leader) of Sydney's Lakemba Mosque, Sheik Taj el-Din Al Hilaly. "The behaviour and practices of the Ahbash are based on creating division and hatred amongst people," the statement said. "This does not serve the interest of the Muslim community and is directly at odds with the general policies of Australia's multicultural society."</a>) without any shred of evidence or knowledge then I am sorry but you are way off the sanity and rationality line. You insist someone to baby-sit you. Nobody is going to do that.

Proof we said everyhting you say we did. please. The letters and words in the Quran is the expression of thew eternal kalaam of Allah, the phsyical created paper, and language is NOT eternal. You are saying that when i pick up a Quran, it is phsyicly the Kalaam of Allah. And it isn't, it is the expressions of the kalaam of allah which was revealed to the propeht salallahu alayhi wa salaam through angel jibril amin. The book itself isn't eternal, there is a last page, and there is a first page.</p>

<dd>So, you are admitting, ONCE AGAIN, that Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies are NOT mainstream Sunnis but a CULT.

IslamOnline.net is a Whahabie website, not a muslim website.</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, YES! IslamOnLine.net is a "Wahabi" website, though it is out Qatar, and ALL those web-sites, based in various parts of the world, which are refuting and disclosing the AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies as a CULT / SECT are ALSO - either - "Wahabi" web-sites - or - "they follow their scholars blindly." I am sorry but your arguement doesn't fit the logic.</dd>

<dd>Once again, you are in the violation of WikiPedia civility guidelines by resorting to profanity like "dumbass." If AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies claim to be mainstream Sunnis - then - Why can't they pray / preach with / to mainstream Sunnis in THEIR mosques? After all, Don't they claim to be mainstream Sunnis? May I state one of the FEW reasons. Becasue they will be - and - have been KICKED OUT as soon as it is discovered that they belong to a CULT called AICP / Al-Ahbash / AICP.</dd>

<p>Why does isna manufactor and sell thier own books aswell? Also, Becasue ISNA, the whahabist/modernist movement, is not mainstrem sunnism. [ISNA has mixed elements from both extremes. But that is another discussion.]</p>

<dd>I know very well where the Kaaba is and I am also well-aware of the arguments from the both sides. BUT AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies don't pray to the Kaaba for scientific reasons.

<p>The propeht SAWS didn't have a PHD. The sahabah didn't have a PHD, infact, NONE of the classical scholars ahd PHD. Obviously, a PHD means utter shit when it coems to your qualifications. And where did he get a PHD, in a western university? Or from teh whahabies in saudi arabia?</p>

<dd>Thanks for clearing up the doubt that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies are, in fact, stuck in the DARK AGES therefore they believe, nowadays (in this 21st century), "PHD means utter shit." Please, advise your folks to REMOVE the BOGUS slogan of <i>"The Resounding Voice of Moderation"</i> as soon as possible. You are going way too far off the insanity and rationality line NOW by comparing your pathetic "Shekih" to Prophets. Go and get a life.</dd>

<dd>This is a very good question for ISNA. Why don't you get in-touch with them? I am sure they will get back to you when they will have time. (NOTE: Please, ASK them - Why don't they put Jamat Ahl Wa Sunna on their Centers / Material like Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies do?)</dd>

Please make up your mind. Secondly, you boguth no proof in your claimes, the fatwa, you provide didn't have proof, nor do any of the links, none of them quote ANY aicp material. And yes, you are a whahabie, and your a kafir for this statement: "stuck in the DARK AGES" when refering to the knowlage of the sahabah and the prophet sallahu alayhi wa salam for belittleing them. This is an act of Riddah. Everyone, McKhan thinks we shoudl leave the ways of the propeht saws as those ways are the 'dark ages'. Nice going numnuts. Belittleing the religioun is blasphemy.

Further, you are in the DIRECT violation of Surah Al-Ahzab. Alas!

<hr />
<p>The claim that AICP is a CULT is simply refutable by 2 points.</p>
<p>1) Everything they say wheather anybody likes it or not has a proof from the scholars before them</p>
<p>2) The fact that most claims defaming them are either lies or simply true yet the writer's ignorance think it's not.</p>
<p>example of the first, AICP fought in 82 against Israel during the invasion of Lebanon. So they are not linked to zionism it's just baseless.</p>
<p>Example of the second the "dead walk out of their graves". They simply beleive it's not impossible, and any claim it is, is refuted by Hadith Al-Israa: Didn't the Prophet meat with the Prophets before him and performed prayer with them as their Imam? Weren't all the Prophets passed away by then?except Issa and Al-Khader. So Allah is capable of every thing and there is no proof that it's impossible to happen. Plus the Ibn Omar Hadith when he met the burning man.</p>
<p>We confess that lots of currents try to defame AICP. But thoes currents and sects have their issues. 4 examples I'm sure anyone defaming AICP can be linked to one of these groups.</p>
<p>1-Wahhabies. Less than 2 million followers, with lot's of resources. mostly divided among themselves, some are Bin-Ladinests and some are Oil Rich Arab buisness men who live mostly in London and sometimes own an MTV-like Satelite stations, and the inbetweens. These have Wrong beleifs and innovations, Ranging from: "If a Muslim lives in the USA and works without trying to blow stuff up killing innocents. He is no longer a Muslim and Killing him thus is OK" to "If some one said O Muhammad, He committed blasphemy or it's forbidden" to Tashbeeh.</p>
<p>2-Ekhwan: Call themselves the muslim brotherhood or Al Jamma'a Al Islamia(the group of Islam) or other. These prooved to be polymorphic. their 1st founder intended it to be a resistance movement against British occupation to Egypt (Hassan Al Banna) but due to an organizational glitch, the resistant cells fell under the influece of ignorant power-players with more ambition than piety. The Imam denounced what they were doing in his last days, and he was assassinated before he could fix what happened. Came an ex-communist called Sayyed Qutub who put the guide lines to a Social model of a Terrorist. With claims like "There is No Islam these days. The entire Humanity has commited blasphemy, and the leaders of the Islamic world are not applying the Laws of Islam thus anyone who doesn't revolt is a Kafir" in short he claimed that the situation is now the same as it was before Prophet Muhammad came. One student was very influenced by this man, He was in Colledge when Sayyed Qutub was executed for his crimes, His name is Ayman Athawahiri. Bin Laden's right hand.</p>
<p>Of course they are polymorphic because despite their real founder claimed it's blasphemy even to work in any governmental Job. His followers now Enter Elections. and win it for 2 reasons: People have a Passion for slogans like "Islam is the solution" and "Vote for Islam" and the corrup nature of other alternatives</p>
<p>3-Hizbuttahrir: AKA the party of Liberation. Mostly found in European countries like Denmark and England. Their founder is a Clocksmith who read a few books and claimed himself to be a Khalifah. He live in Beirut and he appointed his sons as Sultans of Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Obviously no body took him seriously, but for various reasons he got some support from English Intelligence (mostly political reasons) He was seen comming out of the british embassy carrying a bag of money, when asked about it he claimed "we Asked them to become Muslims, they refused so we asked them for Jizzya"(Jizzia is a Tax collected from Non-Muslims in Islamic Rule). They have similar beleif to Ekhwan the claim anyone who doesn't have Pledged Allegence to a Khalifa Dies a non-Muslim. Also weird Jurespedance rulings like a Man is not allowed to look in the face of a woman marrigable to him(not his mother, sister,...) Yet he can kiss her in the face. (Islamically He can look anywoman in the face(not lustfully) and can't kiss a woman Marrigeable to him)</p>
<p>4-Variouse Pseudo-Sufis. These are the one's who give sufis a bad name among some Muslims. they are Mostly based around an imposter who claimes to be vary pious and of a High rank. Examples are: Rajabis(followers Of rajab Deeb, a Syrian imposter) and Qubursis (refuted by Samir Al Kadi in detail at AICP<a href="http://WWW.AICP.ORG" class="external autonumber" title="http://WWW.AICP.ORG" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> )</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP IS a CULT which hides behind the mainstream Sunnis to seek LEGITIMACY &amp; RECRUITMENT = Take it or Don't take it</span></h2>
<p><b>Habashies / Al-Ahbash / Ahbash / AICP / TIES / ACL</b></p>
<p>The Ahbash / Al-Ahbash / Habashies, officially known as the Association of Islamic Charitable Projects (AICP), or Jam'iyyat al-Mashari' al-Khayriyya al-Islamiyya which also operates under Jammat Ahl Sunnah in the US and other parts of the world, is one of the most controversial Muslim sect among all the Muslim sects / groups.</p>
<p>On their official web-site, www.aicp.org, they claim to be "The Resounding Voice of Moderation," a claim which is propogated by anti-Islam writers like Daniel Pipes and Jeff Jacoby (See Zionist Connection) on their behalf. However, their critics, a group of Islamic Researchers which includes researchers and scholars like Dr. Muzzamil Siddiqui and Dr. Ahmad Sakr .etc, point out that <i><b>"They hold strange deviant views that have never been expressed by any Muslim sect, group or movement. They declared that intermingling between men and women is permissible without any restrictions, and that Muslim leaders are not true believers and that it is permissible to cooperate with non-believers."</b></i></p>
<p>They further point out that <i><b>"several Muslim authorities warned against such a sect including: the Islamic Research Academy at Al-Azhar, the General Authority for Research, Fatwas and the Islamic call and guidance in Saudi Arabia, the Higher Council for Fatwas in Northern America"</b></i> despite claims made by some of the followers of Ahbash / Al-Ahbash / Habashies group that they are supported by Al-Azhar.</p>
<p><b>All over the world, they use the signboards / slogans of Ahl As Sunnah wal Jamaat on their centers and materials of propaganda. They call themselves "authentic" Sunnis and they call authentic mainstream Sunnis "Kaafirs."</b></p>
<p><b>Further, to misguide the mainstream Sunni Muslims, new Muslims and Muslim youth, they are creating web-sites all over the world wide web, running their web-sites as "authentic" mainstream Sunni Muslims and linking on all the Free Forums / Encyclopedias like WikiPedia by using Islamic sounding domain names like:</b></p>

<p>(Please, read this article,Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context - <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf</a> - to find out how Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP are using the web to hide their agenda and promote their beliefs by posing as "authentic" mainstream Sunnis.)</p>
<p>Since they are not part of Islamic Jurisprudence council, they have formed their own "high" council to issue Fatwas in Australia:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.darulfatwa.org.au" class="external free" title="http://www.darulfatwa.org.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.darulfatwa.org.au</a></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>"At the surface, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP seems to adhere to the Shafi`i School of Jurisprudence, and to Imam Al-Ash`ari’s School in terms of creed. However, at the deep level, their main agenda is to corrupt and misquide the Muslim creed and incite sedition amongst the Muslims by marketing, preaching and disseminating their own twisted beliefs."</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP have divided the word of Allah into two categories: First, word which is not sound or letter. Second, which is the pronounced and written word, which says the word of Allah, but it is in reality composed by Gabrael. And that Allah - the Exalted speaks in everlasting words which have no beginning or end, and are not composed of continuing letters or annunciations which are separated or combined. They believe it to be a self discussion in which God talked within Himself, because in their opinion the words of God are not a language, a letter, or a sound. Moreover:</b></i></p>
<p><b>a). Concerning creed, they follow the condemned school of Irja'. It is well known that the Islamic creed held by the Prophet’s Companions and their successors states that faith is a matter of declaring in words, believing in the heart and all this must be reflected in action for belief without practice and submission to Shari`ah has no place in Islam. However, according to them it is not necessary that faith be reflected in action and hence a person remains a believer even if he neglects all the pillars of Islam,</b></p>
<p><b>b). Such a sect consider it permissible to seek the help of the dead besides instead of that of Allah and this is clearly considered in the Qur'an and Sunnah as ascribing partners to Allah. They urge people to do so claiming that the dead get out from their graves to fulfill the requests of those who call upon them and then get back to the graves. Allah Almighty says: “They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah.” (Yunus: 18), c). They consider that the Qur'an is not the words of Allah but that of Gabriel,</b></p>
<p><b>d). They claim to follow the Shafi`i School in respect to fiqh and belief. However, they are, in fact, very far from the principles of the School of Imam ash-Shafi`i,</b></p>
<p><b>e). They claim that Allah has created the universe and sent the Messengers to humans for no purpose or wisdom and whoever attributes any of Allah's actions to the Divine Wisdom is a mushrik.</b></p>
<p>According to one Fatwa (Religious Decree) issued by Islamonline.net, <i><b>"they usually do not express their true views and intentions in the books or any of the publications that they issue. Even the books issued by their leader is quite ordinary and do not contain any of their aberrant views which is, in fact, part of their plan to deceive people and attract more followers. However, many of their followers repent and revert to the true path when they learn the truth about such sect."</b></i></p>
<p>Consequently, they conclude with the following points:</p>
<p><b>1- The Ahbash group is a stray group that is not considered among main stream Muslims and they have to revert to the true path of the Companions and their successors, both in belief and in action.</b></p>
<p><b>2- It is not permissible to follow the fatwas of such sect.</b></p>
<p><b>3- They are not trustworthy and people must be warned against their dangerous corrupt views. Moreover, Muslims should advise the followers of such sect to revert to the true path."</b> <i>(Source: "Al-Ahbash: Evolution and Beliefs" - IslamOnLine.net - June 07, 2003)</i></p>

<p>You failed to state that these are known Whahabie websites. And that there is no official authority of sunni islam in saudi arabia. Also, could you state the ijaza ofthe men who have made 'fatwas' agaisnt us? Before one is allowed to give religious fatwas, he must be given ijaza by the shiekh who taught him, and even in some cases, he msut have a solid chain of sheikhs leading up to the propeht sallalahu alayahi wa salaam, please, you must state the qualifications of those that give fatwas, so as not to confuse people or tricking them into thing such and such person is a valid mujatahid or mufti. -cronodevir</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A Smear Campaign...</span></h2>
<p>Like I said anyone trying to defame AICP Can be Linked to one of the above mentioned currents. For instance the one who said they Allow male female intermingiling is Ekhwan. they beleive that men and women sitting in the same room is not allowed.</p>
<p>THe claims about a connection between their creed and Murjeaa is madeby a wahhaby named Abdurrahman Dimashkiyyah. He has a false beleive that mere sinful actions will make a person blasphemous. so when we say a man remains a muslim even if he didn't pray -out of laziness- Although he'll probably suffer for that in Hell in the afterlife, Dimashkiyyah claims he is not a faithful anymore. Murjiaa on the other hand say that faith is all it takes for a person not to enter Hell, a big difference.</p>
<p>I'll Ask the Reader to look at this claim by McKhan:</p>
<p><br />
<i>According to one Fatwa (Religious Decree) issued by Islamonline.net,</i> <b>"they usually do not express their true views and intentions in the books or any of the publications that they issue. Even the books issued by their leader is quite ordinary and do not contain any of their aberrant views which is, in fact, part of their plan to deceive people and attract more followers. However, many of their followers repent and revert to the true path when they learn the truth about such sect."</b></p>
<p><br />
How can anyone defend himself from such a ridiculuse bable. It's like when some Ignorants say that Sept. 11 is made by CIA and Bin Laden lives in the White house(beleive me I heard this theory). Mckhan simply is commisioned to conduct a smear campaign in the web against them, thats all. --Advisor 10:14, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context</b></p>
<p>by THOMAS PIERRET <i>(The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM)</i></p>
<p><i><b>The Lebanon-based al-Ahbash movement advocates a radical neo-traditionalist version of Sunni Islam. Although numerically modest, it has established branches in several Western countries, where it continues the campaign it started in the Middle East against the Salafi trend. The movement uses the Internet innovatively and demonstrates that the strategic use of web-based interactive communication tools does not necessarily lead to the reinforcement of a culture of dialogue; on the contrary they can also serve as a means to achieve virtual ideological hegemony.</b></i></p>
<p>The Association of Islamic Charitable Projects (AICP) was founded in Beirut in 1982 by a group of Sunni ulama who, together with their followers, were nicknamed “al-Ahbash” (The Ethiopians) after their Ethiopian-born spiritual leader, the scholar and Sufi Shaykh Abdallah al-Harari al-Habashi. Since its inception, the AICP has been backed by the Syrian regime, which considers its strong commitment to traditional non-political Sunni principles and its insistently anti-Salafi stance as a means to counter the rise of political Islam in Lebanon. However, this radical neotraditionalist ideology and the paranoid worldview it implies are not exclusively linked to the particular context of Lebanon but constitute a vehicle for an organization that has become transnational by establishing branches in France, Germany, the United States, Australia, and even the Ukraine.</p>
<p>As a global but numerically marginal network made up of small groups, often facing hostility of other Sunni communities, the Ahbash have been quick to take advantage of the Internet. The English speaking—i.e. global-oriented—official website of the AICP (www.aicp.org) is dedicated to conventional uses but is rather innovative from a technological point of view. Since the web makes religious material available worldwide at very low cost, the AICP’s website provides a wide range of exoteric and esoteric contents through written as well as audio resources, among which is a radio station broadcasting from the Beirut headquarters of the movement and daily interactive religious lessons. A look at the website’s Guest Book shows that visitors using this material to improve their Islamic knowledge are not necessarily members of the AICP and sometimes live in regions where the association is not formally present (South Asia, Turkey, Nigeria, and Mindanao). Therefore, one may conclude that the website leads to an extension of the AICP’s ideological sphere of influence. However, we need to be somewhat more cautious than Olivier Roy who asserts that, thanks to the Internet, “one directly joins the Sufi neo-brotherhood [among which is al-Ahbash]” and “one can learn the thought of the Shaykh through its discourse and no longer [have to be] in [direct] contact with him.” [1] As far as Sufism informs the content of thissie, we would suggest that this kind of electronic material is basically more of a showcase for the brotherhood or an aid for the ritual-mystical practices of geographically isolated members. Indeed, visiting a website does not replace the master-disciple relationship, which remains an essential part of Sufism, including that of the Ahbash. Strikingly, Shaykh Abdallah is only surreptitiously referred to on the AICP’s websites since, to use Michael Gilsenan’s words,2 the management of the physical absence of the founding saint—who is more than 80 years old and can only travel abroad occasionally to meet his disciples—is still carried out orally by his deputies.</p>
<p>The second function of the Internet for the Ahbash is to improve the global cohesion of the movement by weaving links between grass roots members of the different branches worldwide, all the more so since these branches are established in highly “connected” countries. Of course, such links are not really useful with regard to close and sizeable communities as in Lebanon or France, but they are of invaluable help for isolated individuals living in Australia or North America. It is certainly not a coincidence that the Ahbash’s website was the first in the Islamic cyberspace to provide 24-hour voice chat groups in different languages.</p>
<p><b>Ideological spider webs</b></p>
<p>At first sight, devices such as live interactive lessons or voice chat groups seem to encourage debates within the movement, but, on the contrary, close examination reveals that these instruments are primarily used by the leadership to increase its ideological control on their followers and to attract new devotees. Similarly, if one checks the AICP’s unofficial e-forums (www.talkaboutislam.com), one discovers that they function as ideological spider webs. <b>Nothing points to the fact that these websites, which only present themselves as being “Islamic,” are actually part of the Ahbash’s cyber network. For instance, they are not related to the official websites by any hypertext link. Therefore, the random visitor is normally unaware that he or she is exposed to a set of selected opinions through carefully controlled debates.</b> <b>Firstly, zealous participants frequently post chapters of books edited in Lebanon by the AICP, but without any reference to the author or the editor. Secondly, veteran members answer questions concerning fiqh (jurisprudence) and reprimand novices whose religious knowledge is considered “deviant.” Thirdly, a team of regulators supervise the discussions and are in charge of censoring the Ahbash who are too keen to use takfir (excommunication) —since such a stance is considered a mark of extremism by most of the Sunnis—but above all of eliminating most of the messages posted by participants of Salafi persuasion.</b> Ideological hegemony is thus achieved by the creation of a neo-traditionalist virtual space in which they assess very critically the ideas of leading Islamic personalities such as Amr Khalid, Khalid al-Jundi and Yusuf al-Qaradawi. In the same way they reduce the Wahhabi doctrine to a mere “heresy” in line with the Ottoman scholarly tradition of which they consider themselves to be the inheritors.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">In answer to the questions</span></h2>
<p>Ekhwan and mainstream sunnis are not the same. All the views that Mckhan is reflecting is by the Muslim Brotherhood party.</p>
<p>1)Islamonline is NOT a mainstream sunni website, it's fatwas come from Dr. Youssef Al Qurdawi who was once imprisoned in Egypt for his involment in Ekhwan/Muslim brotherhood movement. Besides I don't think they'll allow them to express a point that Dr. Qardawi by claiming the Prophet used to make mistakes in matters of releigion has commited blasphemy(belieing Quraan and common sense), and thus is no longer a muslim until he repends and utter the testemonials of faith(shahadatan).(among other grave mistakes he needs to address)</p>
<p>2)"Their own centers" is not very fair, it's not like they ask for ID if you want to enter a mosque. besides they are Muslims with a Message to bring people back into moderation and to spread the word of Islam. And why Hizbuttahrir and Qubursi followers do that? and why the so called "Islamic council" headed by Dr. Qardawi does that? this question could be asked to hundreds of groups.</p>
<p>3) Most Sunnis accept them and the ones who doesn't usually is because of fanatism and smear campaigns like the one conducted here. Al-Azhar accepted them. The Na^imiyyah university, the Qarawiyin university in Morocco, Nizamiyyah Rizwiyyah in Pakistan, azZiyadah in Jakarta (Indonesia) also. Non biased writers commended them too.</p>
<p>4)Like I said before any "Decree" issued can be linked to one of the 4 main groups I talked about, and not to mainstream Sunni like Mckhan said.</p>
<p>5)baseless claim. Made by Ekhwan who were refuted in debate hundreds of times. and a sign of defeat.</p>
<p>6)for Hundreds of years Muslims in North America prayed to the right direction. Enter some Ekhwan/Muslim brotherhood flowers they told people: "you and your ancestors were all wrong" and they made them pray to a direction that points North. their original direction was correct. It's the new direction that is wrong, and it's the Ekhwan that promoted sedition.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">McKhan is NOT a "Wahabi" nor he belongs to "Ekhwan/Muslim Brotherhood," "Hizbutahrir" - or - ANY Islamist group. He is a mainstream Sunni whose family has been mainstream Sunni for centuries....</span></h2>
<p>I have read all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=80.84.141.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=80.84.141.22" rel="nofollow">"contributions"</a> and under the id of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Advisor" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Advisor" rel="nofollow">Advisor</a> + other by the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.</p>
<p>Indeed, 65.92.130.151 / Muslim Sunni / Cronodevir / Crono as well as his buddies 62.131.149.252 and 82.194.62.22 and Advisor belong to a CULT called Al-Ahbash / Habashies / Association of Islamic Charitable Projects (AICP) which hides its agenda and beliefs to blend-in among mainstream Sunnis to seek legitimacy and recruitment.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, <b>65.92.130.151 / Muslim Sunni / Cronodevir / Crono is the webmaster of Sunna.info and Qiblah.us (Both of the web-sites are part of a blatant and hegemonic smear campaign against the mainstream Sunni Muslims to seek legitimacy and recruitment) and other web-sites - and - promotes his CULT by incorporating hidden links to Islam-related web-sites. In other words, he is NOT only violating the WikiPedia guidelines by promoting AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies but also corrupting the integrity of the WikiPedia Islam-related pages / content by incorporating AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' beliefs.</b></p>
<p><b>65.92.130.151 / Muslim Sunni / Cronodevir / Crono is NOT a mainstream Sunni and YET, he is using the id "Muslim Sunni" to decieve people.</b></p>
<p>It is quite obvious that the agents of Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies are trying to "link" me either to "Wahabis" or "Ekhwan/Muslim Brotherhood" or "Hizbuttahrir" or "Kaafirs" because I am exposing the Al-Ahbsh / Habashies / AICP, a CULT which hides behind the mainstream Sunnis like myself in order to seek legitimacy and recruitment.</p>
<p>I have dealt with these agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP for quite sometime now. And when they cannot find anything else they resort to personal attacks by calling the the other party to be member of either "Wahabis" or "Ekhwar/Muslim Brotherhood" or "Hizbuttahrir" or "Kaafir" or anything else which will rock their boat.</p>
<p>In other words, they try to use "politically correct" and "mainstream" language to divert the criticism. Fortunately, it doesn't work as the World Wide Web has plenty of material available to refute and expose the claims of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.</p>
<p>In my case, as I have repeated consistently, I am a maisntream Sunni and my family have been mainstream Sunni for centuries even before the "birth" of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP or its "Sheikh." Therefore, I am NOT part of - nor - I belong to "Wahabis," "Ekhwan/Muslim Brotherhood," "Hizbuttahrir," or any other "Islamist" group. I have interacted with the CULT of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP and researched them fully. I ONLY quote either INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL or ACADEMIC sources.</p>
<p>As far as the "argument" is concerned that <i>"Al-Ahbash fought the Israelis"</i> then Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP should stand corrected as The Lebansese fought against the Israli invasion not merely the Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP. Besides, It has been reported quite widely that Al-Ahbash "movement" started in Lebanon in 1982.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Al-Ahbash#The_Reality_of_Al-Ahbash_.2F_AICP_.2F_Habashies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Al-Ahbash#The_Reality_of_Al-Ahbash_.2F_AICP_.2F_Habashies" rel="nofollow">zionist connection</a>. Since when Daniel Pipes, Jeff Jacoby .etc have joined the list of "non-bias" writers?</p>
<p>As I pointed out earlier on this very page, It is NOT about "Qurdawi" or IslamOnline.net and it has NOTHING to do with "Ekhwan/Muslim Brotherhood" or "Hisbuttahrir" .etc. - It is about the group of <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" rel="nofollow">mainstream Sunni scholars</a> who issued that decree, which includes but NOT limited to, other mainstream Sunni Scholars like <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ahmad H. Sakr (founding member and president of the Muslim Students Association of the U.S.A and Canada - AND - the Islamic Society of North America (or ISNA)</a>, Al-Azhar grauduated <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/livefatwa/english/Guestcv.asp?hGuestID=lW6ym3" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/livefatwa/english/Guestcv.asp?hGuestID=lW6ym3" rel="nofollow">Shari`ah Researchers</a> and <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/livefatwa/english/Guestcv.asp?hGuestID=vU7648" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/livefatwa/english/Guestcv.asp?hGuestID=vU7648" rel="nofollow">Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi (former President of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)</a>. NOW, If Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are NOT ready to accept them as mainstream Sunni scholars. That is their problem. By NOT accepting mainstream Sunni scholars, they are simply PROVING the FACT that Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are NOT part of mainstream Sunnis and hold deviant beliefs and agenda contrary to the mainstream Sunni beliefs.</p>
<p>Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies have not only their own centers here in the West and around the globe but also they use the signboards of mainstream Sunnis' "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah" though it has been proven time and time again, NOT only by the mainstream Sunni Shcolars but also by the <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">NON-Muslim academics</a>, that Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies are a CULT which use hedious tactics to seek legitimacy and recruitment. The point is that WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BUILD THEIR OWN CENTERS, IF THEY ARE PART OF MAINSTREAM "SUNNIS"? WHY CAN'T THEY PRAY IN OTHER MAINSTREAM SUNNI MOSQUES?</p>
<p>Once again, it should be noted that all who oppose or expose the AICP / Al-Ahbash / AICP are either "Wahabis" or "Kaafir" or part of "Hizbuttahrir" or "Ikhwan" or some other type of "fantics" in the eyes of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP. This mentality of the AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies proves the arrogance and self-rigteousness of the AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies, a CULT which hides behind the mainstream Sunnis, Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah to propogate their agenda and beliefs to seek legitimacy and recruitment.</p>
<p>This argument that "for Hundreds of years Muslims in North America prayed to the right direction" is quite luducrious as the America is only 200 years old. And the claim that Muslims have been praying in the "wrong" direction and ONLY Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP knew to pray in the "right" direction is way off the line. It is NOT about the direction of the Al-Qiblah nor it is about the scietific reason. It is about using it to promote SEDITION. It is a FACT which I have learned first hand by interacting with Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies along-with other things. Most of the Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP even don't know the scientific reasons. One of AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' Italian <a href="http://www.amislam.com/qiblah.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.amislam.com/qiblah.htm" rel="nofollow">outlet</a> have been using the research of a mainstream Sunni writer to justify their claim.</p>
<p>Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are waging a blatant and hegemonic smear campaign against the mainstream Muslims and they have proven it over and over again by using the same hedious and dirty tricks.</p>
<p>According to an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL research paper published on the AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies by The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM), <i><b>"The Lebanon-based al-Ahbash movement advocates a radical neo-traditionalist version of Sunni Islam. Although numerically modest, it has established branches in several Western countries, where it continues the campaign it started in the Middle East against the Salafi trend. The movement uses the Internet innovatively and demonstrates that the strategic use of web-based interactive communication tools does not necessarily lead to the reinforcement of a culture of dialogue; on the contrary they can also serve as a means to achieve virtual ideological hegemony."</b></i></p>
<p><b>AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies's agents lurk around WikiPedia Islam/Muslim-related pages like Islam, Qibla, Sunni Islam, Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab .etc to incorporate / place / promote hidden links to Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's sponsored Islamic/Sunnis/Muslim sounding web-sites like:</b></p>

Firstly, zealous participants frequently post chapters of books edited in Lebanon by the AICP, but without any reference to the author or the editor. Secondly, veteran members answer questions concerning fiqh (jurisprudence) and reprimand novices whose religious knowledge is considered “deviant.” Thirdly, a team of regulators supervise the discussions and are in charge of censoring the Ahbash who are too keen to use takfir (excommunication) —since such a stance is considered a mark of extremism by most of the Sunnis—but above all of eliminating most of the messages posted by participants of Salafi persuasion."</b></i></p>

<p>Mckhan keeps on assuring that he is a "Mainstream sunni" and that all others are not. Maybe he has other understanding to this term but my understanding is that a mainstream sunni is a Sunni Muslim that abides with the path of Sunni Scholars before them.

In my humble and logical point of view, Denying the totality of the Quran and calling it mere the conversation of Gabriel and / or twisting its meaning is THE BIGGEST SIN in Islam. Go and Figure.

<dd>2 points: what is Denying the totality of the Quraan? and when did anyone said it's the conversation of Jibril? And when did the AICP twist it's meaning? how can this be true if they beleive in the Hadith that says what means if anyone says his Oppinion in a meaning of a verse, he will be punished in the judgment day? you are not talking about the AICP I know. What kind of a conversation is this if you Just throw accusations without reference. --Advisor 12:02, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, I am talking about Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies. AND I am NOT going to baby-sit anybody for any reference. Go and figure. As far as I am concerned, to me, it is all about DIFFERENTIATING between the CULT of Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies and the mainstream Sunnis. If you want "reference" then <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1118742803355&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/Page/FatwaCounselE" rel="nofollow">ask a mainstream Sunni scholar</a>. But Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's agents wouldn't do that. Because Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies are so schizophrenicin and cultish in their mentality that in their mind every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs is either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign." In other words, all the mainstream Sunni Muslims are "wrong" or "Kaafir" altogether - but - whatever Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are saying or preaching is "Islamic" or "Muslim." If this is NOT a CULT then what else it is. <b>The bottom-line and the burning question is that if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are so unique and proud of their "scholar" then why don't they be simply proud of it by DEMONSTRATING that CLEARLY and CATEGORICALLY on their "Musallahs" that this center / material belongs to Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP. Why do they need buy domain names and put on the signboards and hide behind "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Is it about recruitment or legitimacy or the fear they will be exposed? Or is it about hedious tactics practiced by the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies, to borrow words from THOMAS PIERRET (The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM)'s THOMAS PIERRET (The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">report</a> which tells us "Nothing points to the fact that these websites, which only present themselves as being “Islamic,” are actually part of the Ahbash’s cyber network.

Firstly, zealous participants frequently post chapters of books edited in Lebanon by the AICP, but without any reference to the author or the editor. Secondly, veteran members answer questions concerning fiqh (jurisprudence) and reprimand novices whose religious knowledge is considered “deviant.” Thirdly, a team of regulators supervise the discussions and are in charge of censoring the Ahbash who are too keen to use takfir (excommunication) —since such a stance is considered a mark of extremism by most of the Sunnis—but above all of eliminating most of the messages posted by participants of Salafi persuasion. Ideological hegemony is thus achieved by the creation of a neo-traditionalist virtual space in which they assess very critically the ideas of leading Islamic personalities such as Amr Khalid, Khalid al-Jundi and Yusuf al-Qaradawi.

<p><b>Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context</b></p>
<p>by THOMAS PIERRET <i>(The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM)</i></p>
<p><i><b>The Lebanon-based al-Ahbash movement advocates a radical neo-traditionalist version of Sunni Islam. Although numerically modest, it has established branches in several Western countries, where it continues the campaign it started in the Middle East against the Salafi trend. The movement uses the Internet innovatively and demonstrates that the strategic use of web-based interactive communication tools does not necessarily lead to the reinforcement of a culture of dialogue; on the contrary they can also serve as a means to achieve virtual ideological hegemony.</b></i></p>
<p>The Association of Islamic Charitable Projects (AICP) was founded in Beirut in 1982 by a group of Sunni ulama who, together with their followers, were nicknamed “al-Ahbash” (The Ethiopians) after their Ethiopian-born spiritual leader, the scholar and Sufi Shaykh Abdallah al-Harari al-Habashi. Since its inception, the AICP has been backed by the Syrian regime, which considers its strong commitment to traditional non-political Sunni principles and its insistently anti-Salafi stance as a means to counter the rise of political Islam in Lebanon. However, this radical neotraditionalist ideology and the paranoid worldview it implies are not exclusively linked to the particular context of Lebanon but constitute a vehicle for an organization that has become transnational by establishing branches in France, Germany, the United States, Australia, and even the Ukraine.</p>
<p>As a global but numerically marginal network made up of small groups, often facing hostility of other Sunni communities, the Ahbash have been quick to take advantage of the Internet. The English speaking—i.e. global-oriented—official website of the AICP (www.aicp.org) is dedicated to conventional uses but is rather innovative from a technological point of view. Since the web makes religious material available worldwide at very low cost, the AICP’s website provides a wide range of exoteric and esoteric contents through written as well as audio resources, among which is a radio station broadcasting from the Beirut headquarters of the movement and daily interactive religious lessons. A look at the website’s Guest Book shows that visitors using this material to improve their Islamic knowledge are not necessarily members of the AICP and sometimes live in regions where the association is not formally present (South Asia, Turkey, Nigeria, and Mindanao). Therefore, one may conclude that the website leads to an extension of the AICP’s ideological sphere of influence. However, we need to be somewhat more cautious than Olivier Roy who asserts that, thanks to the Internet, “one directly joins the Sufi neo-brotherhood [among which is al-Ahbash]” and “one can learn the thought of the Shaykh through its discourse and no longer [have to be] in [direct] contact with him.” [1] As far as Sufism informs the content of thissie, we would suggest that this kind of electronic material is basically more of a showcase for the brotherhood or an aid for the ritual-mystical practices of geographically isolated members. Indeed, visiting a website does not replace the master-disciple relationship, which remains an essential part of Sufism, including that of the Ahbash. Strikingly, Shaykh Abdallah is only surreptitiously referred to on the AICP’s websites since, to use Michael Gilsenan’s words,2 the management of the physical absence of the founding saint—who is more than 80 years old and can only travel abroad occasionally to meet his disciples—is still carried out orally by his deputies.</p>
<p>The second function of the Internet for the Ahbash is to improve the global cohesion of the movement by weaving links between grass roots members of the different branches worldwide, all the more so since these branches are established in highly “connected” countries. Of course, such links are not really useful with regard to close and sizeable communities as in Lebanon or France, but they are of invaluable help for isolated individuals living in Australia or North America. It is certainly not a coincidence that the Ahbash’s website was the first in the Islamic cyberspace to provide 24-hour voice chat groups in different languages.</p>
<p><b>Ideological spider webs</b></p>
<p>At first sight, devices such as live interactive lessons or voice chat groups seem to encourage debates within the movement, but, on the contrary, close examination reveals that these instruments are primarily used by the leadership to increase its ideological control on their followers and to attract new devotees. Similarly, if one checks the AICP’s unofficial e-forums (www.talkaboutislam.com), one discovers that they function as ideological spider webs. <b>Nothing points to the fact that these websites, which only present themselves as being “Islamic,” are actually part of the Ahbash’s cyber network. For instance, they are not related to the official websites by any hypertext link. Therefore, the random visitor is normally unaware that he or she is exposed to a set of selected opinions through carefully controlled debates.</b> <b>Firstly, zealous participants frequently post chapters of books edited in Lebanon by the AICP, but without any reference to the author or the editor.

If this is NOT a CULT then what else it is. <b>The bottom-line and the burning question is that if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are so unique and proud of their "scholar" then why don't they be simply proud of it by DEMONSTRATING that CLEARLY and CATEGORICALLY on their "Musallahs" that this center / material belongs to Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP. Why do they need buy domain names and put on the signboards and hide behind "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Is it about recruitment or legitimacy or the fear they will be exposed? Or is it about hedious tactics practiced by the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies, to borrow words from THOMAS PIERRET (The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM)'s THOMAS PIERRET (The International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">report</a> which tells us "Nothing points to the fact that these websites, which only present themselves as being “Islamic,” are actually part of the Ahbash’s cyber network. For instance, they are not related to the official websites by any hypertext link. Therefore, the random visitor is normally unaware that he or she is exposed to a set of selected opinions through carefully controlled debates. Firstly, zealous participants frequently post chapters of books edited in Lebanon by the AICP, but without any reference to the author or the editor. Secondly, veteran members answer questions concerning fiqh (jurisprudence) and reprimand novices whose religious knowledge is considered “deviant.” Thirdly, a team of regulators supervise the discussions and are in charge of censoring the Ahbash who are too keen to use takfir (excommunication) —since such a stance is considered a mark of extremism by most of the Sunnis—but above all of eliminating most of the messages posted by participants of Salafi persuasion. Ideological hegemony is thus achieved by the creation of a neo-traditionalist virtual space in which they assess very critically the ideas of leading Islamic personalities such as Amr Khalid, Khalid al-Jundi and Yusuf al-Qaradawi. In the same way they reduce the Wahhabi doctrine to a mere “heresy” in line with the Ottoman scholarly tradition of which they consider themselves to be the inheritors"&#160;?</b></p>
<p>Moreoever, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP keeps recycling the same "objections" over and over again. All of their "objections" have been DISCUSSED on this very page. The sources, INDEPENDENT, NEUTRAL and ACADEMIC, are right THERE on that page.</p>
<p>Why? Because their ultimate goal is to HABASHANIZIE this page and other pages on the WikiPedia and similar projects to DMINISH the DIFFERENCE between mainstream Sunnis and Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP to seek legitimacy and recruitment.</p>
<p>Fairly and impartially speaking, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has given AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies quite favorable POV on WikiPedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>a). by not calling them a CULT but merely a "sect"</li>
<li>b). by providing an external link to Al-Ahbash / Habashies' arch web-site and to another contrary link</li>
<li>c). by quoting their BOGUS and OXYMORONIC claim that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies advocates pluralism, and opposition to political activism and violence (There is ample material available over the internet to refute both claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>d). by quoting AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' FRADULENT slogan from their own web-site, "the resounding voice of moderation" (What kind of "the voice of moderation" is this which castigates every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs as either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign.")</li>
</ul>
<p>AND yet Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP have got the audacity to claim that Tearlach's version is NOT good / favorable enough for the Habashies / Al-Ahbash / AICP&#160;?</p>
<p>As I pointed out earlier that their ultimate goal IS to sanitize Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies to hide their agenda to blend-in among mainstream Sunni Muslims on each and every platfrom to seek legitimacy and recruitment.</p>
<p>Thats why their agents pop-up after every few weeks to rant and rave and complain about this page - and - simply IGNORE all the TANGIBLE / NEUTRAL / INDEPENDENT / ACADEMIC sources because they don't "represent" the - DESIRED - AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' "POV." Indeed, they don't appreicate the fact that if I will write that page according to my wishes, that page will NOT be somewhat NEUTRAL like the way it is NOW and same goes for them. AND I have repeatedly mentioned on this very page that - when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job. Tearlach's version doesn't only serve the purpose but also meets the WikiPedia guidelines. Once again, let me remind you that it is an ENCYCLOPEDIA which aspires to maintain NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW. It is NOT mainstream Sunnis' or Habashies' platform.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The way I see it:</span></h2>
<p>1) in the issue of identity of Al Ahbash: Mckhan is supposed to bring evidence for his claim that they do not belong to Ahlussunnah, All he was capable of was 1)quoting the artile linke in the wiki main article about 2 things, the first is the claim of the writer that we beleive Quraan is the word of Jibril not of Allah, while I know for a fact that this is viewed by them as by all Muslims as Blasphemy. This is not the case dispute with Mushabbiha here, It's wheather the Attribute of Allah "speach" Resembles the that of the speach of creation. The Mushabiha said it's speach resembles that of humans (letters Language sound) while the Mou'tazillah(a sect that disapeared in name now) said that Allah doesn't have this Attribute. Both views are non-Islamic and it doesn't reflect the path of true sunnis. The next is his claim Ahbash twist the meaning of Quraan, actually this is not true, but in the article I can see that he is talking about Ta'aweel. In this case I'll put infront of our non-wahabi brothers and sisters the following explenation:</p>
<hr />
<p>Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Who does not resemble the creation. To Him belong the endowments and the befitting perfections and commendations. I ask Allah to raise the rank of Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, and to protect his nation from that which he feared for it.</p>
<p>Allah said in the Qur'an: Surat Al-^Imran, ayah 7 means: [Allah is the One Who has sent down to the Prophet the Book that contains muhkamatayat, which are the foundation of the Book, and other ayat which are mutashabihat.] So, know firmly, that the Qur'an contains two types of ayat: Muhkamat ayat and Mutashabihat ayat.</p>
<p>Muhkamat ayat:</p>
<p>These are the ayat that have only one meaning according to the rules of the Arabic language or else the meaning of the ayah is clearly known. Examples of this type of ayat are: the saying of Allah, ta^ala:</p>
<p>Suratash-Shura,ayah 11 means: [There is nothing like Him] and His saying, ta^ala:</p>
<p>Suratal-Ikhlas, ayah 4 means: [There is nothing which is equal to Him], and His saying, ta^ala:</p>
<p>SuratMaryam,ayah 65 means: [Do you know of anything which is similar to Him? There is none.]</p>
<p>These are the ayat that can have many meanings according to the rules of the Arabic language. Assigning meanings to these ayat requires thorough thinking so that acceptable meanings are given to them.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the Arabic language, these ayat are mutashabihat; so they can have many meanings. If meanings are assigned to them, this must be done in a manner that complies with the language and the Religion, and does not contradict the ayat that are muhkamat. Surely the ayat of the Qur'an do not contradict one another. Likewise, the ahadith (sayings of the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam,) do not contradict one another, and they do not contradict the ayat of the Qur'an.</p>
<p>Wahhabies don't care and insist that the explain the verses of Quraan in a way they contradict other verses.</p>
<p>The methodology of the true Salaf in adressing this issue was: The Salaf were the scholars who lived during the first three centuries after the Hijrah of the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam. For the most part, this methodology consisted of giving general explanations, since the scholars of the Salaf believed that these ayat have meanings befitting to the perfection of Allah. Rather than saying what these meanings are, they referred these mutashabihatayat to the muhkamatayat. A good example is the saying of Imam ash-Shafi^iyy: which means: "I believe in what Allah revealed according to the meaning that Allah willed, and in what the Messenger of Allah conveyed according to the meaning that the Messenger of Allah willed." In other words, the proper befitting meanings are not according to the sensuous and physical meanings that delusions would lead to--such as places, shapes, limbs, movements, sitting, colors, directions, smiling, laughter, or any other meanings which are not permissible to be attributed to Allah.</p>
<p><br />
Furthermore, the Arabs during these three centuries spoke the Arabic language with a natural disposition and great eloquence. Their understanding of its meanings was so sharp that they did not need to attribute specific meanings to the mutashabihat ayat. Instead, they understood that these ayat have meanings that befit Allah, and that it is impossible that they would have sensuous and physical meanings that do not befit Allah.</p>
<p><br />
Nevertheless, it is well known that some of the scholars of the Salaf did attribute specific meanings to mutashabihat ayat. In his Sahih, in the chapter Tafsirul-Qur'an (the explanation of the Qur'an,) Imam al-Bukhariyy attributed a specific meaning to the term "illa wajhahu" in Surat al­Qasas, ayah 88. He said, "illa mulkahu," i.e., he said that word "wajh"--which is an attribute of Allah--means "Mulk" or "Dominion."</p>
<p>Methodology of Khalaf:</p>
<p>The Khalaf were the scholars who lived after the first three centuries. For the most part, this methodology consisted of giving specific meanings to the mutashabihatayat. The scholars of the Khalaf lived at a time when the people started to lose their natural disposition for the Arabic language. Seeing that the people had become weaker in the language, the scholars of the Khalaf feared that those with perversity in their hearts would read meanings into the mutashabihatayat that do not befit Allah. They feared what is mentioned in SuratAl ^Imran, ayah 7. Allah said:</p>
<p>[Those who have perversity in their hearts, they follow the mutashabihat ayat seeking discord and searching for unbefitting meanings based on their delusions.] In order to protect the creed of Islam, the scholars of the Khalaf followed the example of those scholars among the Salaf who chose to give specific meanings to the mutashabihat ayat. Referring them to the muhkamatayat, they gave specific meanings to the mutashabihatayat in compliance with the language and the Religion. They gave correct, acceptable meanings to the mutashabihatayat. Allah said: Ayah 7 in Surat Al-^Imran means: [No one knows their true meanings except Allah and those who are firmly rooted in the knowledge of the Religion. The latter say, "We believe in it, all of it is from our Lord" and none will understand the message except men of comprehension."] In relation to this ayah, Ibn ^Abbas said: "I am one of those who are firmly rooted in the knowledge of the Religion." It is well known that Ibn ^Abbas is generally regarded as being foremost among the Companions in the explanation of the meanings of the ayat of the Qur'an.</p>
<p>Among those who have perversity in their hearts are the mushabbihah, those who liken Allah to His creation. The followers of Ibn Taymiyah and Muhammad Ibn ^Abdil­Wahhab are among the group of the mushabbihah. They falsely claim that it is prohibited to assign specific meanings to the mutashabihatayat and especially those that pertain to the attributes of Allah. Moreover, they innovated a devilish rule that assigning specific meanings to these ayat would lead to canceling these attributes of Allah. This claim of theirs leads to interpretations of the ayat of the Qur'an that contradict one another and interpretations of the ahadith of the Prophet that contradict one another and contradict the ayat of the Qur'an. Furthermore, their claim accuses the Islamic scholars among the Salaf and the Khalaf of blasphemy for denying the attributes of Allah. This would include: Ibn ^Abbas, Sufyan ath­Thawriyy, Mujahid, Sa^id Ibn Jubayr, Malik, Ahmad, al­Bukhariyy, an-Nawawiyy, Ibn Rajab al­Hanbaliyy, Ibn-ul-Jawziyy, Ibn Hajar, al­Bayhaqiyy, Abu Fadl at-Tamimiyy, ^Abdul-Qahir al-Baghdadiyy, the linguist and scholar of hadithMurtada az-Zabidiyy, and others.</p>
<p>Foremost, by this claim of theirs they are contradicting the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam. Al-Bukhariyy related that the Prophet made a du^a' (a supplication) for Ibn ^Abbas. The Prophet said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;O Allah, teach him the Knowledge of Hadith and the explanation of the Qur'an.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>In the chapter, Tafsiral­Qur'an, (Explanation of the meaning of the Qur'an), Imam al-Bukhariyy says that the term wajhahu in Suratal­Qasas,ayah 88, means "His Dominion." However, those mushabbihah who liken Allah to the creation say, "We do not interpret, but rather we go by the literal meaning," and hence (they say) wajhahu means "His face."</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-^Asqalaniyy, in his book, Al­Fath (an explanation of the meaning of Sahih al­Bukhariyy), Volume 6, page 39-40, said: " ..... in reference to al-Bukhariyy's saying that the attribute of Allah, ad-dahik, means 'mercy,' it is closer to say that it means 'acceptance of deeds.' Yet, the mushabbihah insist on taking the literal meaning, and they say that Allah smiles, or laughs.</p>
<p>The scholars of the Salaf explained the term saq by 'hardship,' and the ayah to mean 'a day of anguish and hardship.' This explanation is known to have been given by Ibn ^Abbas, Mujahid, Ibrahim an Nakh^iyy, Qatadah, Sa^id Ibn Jubayr, and a multiple of scholars. Both Imam al-Fakhr ar­Raziyy in his Explanation of the Qur'an, Volume 30, page 94 and Imam al-Bayhaqiyy in his books, Al-'Asma' was­Sifat, (page 245) and Fath-al-Bari, (Volume 13, page 428) related this explanation from Ibn ^Abbas. Ibn Qulayb also related that about Sa^id Ibn Jubayr who took his knowledge from ^Abdullah Ibn ^Abbas and Ibn ^Umar. Yet, the mushabbihah insist on taking the literal meaning and attribute 'the shin' to Allah, by saying saq literally means 'shin.' Imam Mujahid, the student of Ibn ^Abbas, said that the word wajh means 'qiblah,' i.e., the direction of prayers during the voluntary prayers while traveling and riding on an animal. Yet, the mushabbihah insist on taking the literal meaning; they say the term, wajh, means 'face.'</p>
<p>Similarly, if ayah 12 in Suratat-Tahrim: was taken literally, it would mean that Allah blew part of His Soul into ^Isa (Jesus.).) However, the scholars said that this ayah means: [Allah ordered Jibril to blow into ^Isa the soul which is honorable to Allah.</p>
<hr />
<p>An Example of the ill beleif of Wahhabies. Is a small debate between a Sunni Scholar and a Scholar in Wahhabi relegion when the wahhabi said that Ta'aweel is forbiden and all verses are to explained without considering it a metaphore. the sunni replied with a verse that if it is not taken as there is a metaphore would mean "anyone in this world is blind will be blind in the afterlife and more misguided" while it actually means "any one in this world is blind from the truth....". The wahhabi thought for a second(Ironically he WAS blind) and said: "except this one". This shows how misguided they are.</p>
<p><br />
2) the artile which the link lead to. Has a big fat lie that will blow it's integrity to dust. The claim that in Lebanon the Ahbash consider the qiblah is towards the north. Lebanon is a few thousands Kilometers North of Mecca, obviously if they said Mecca is to the north, NOONE will follow them and they'd be less than a Hundred. since they are in tens of thousnads, and noone ever claimed the rotate direction of prayer 180 Degrees and here's a proof that Mckhan's intentions are NOT disscusion Just defamation:</p>
<p>3) Mckhan Claimed Ahbash promoted sedition by asking North American Muslims to Pray to South east. Yet when confronted with Mr. Khans Article about the issue he aknowledged it and claimed AlAhbash stole it. NOW if someone copied it w/o giving him credit then it's unethical and should be corrected. <b>BUT Mckhan admits the man is Not AICP and apparently he beleives he was right in concluding that Qiblah is to the South East. Which means Mckhan thinks that by showing to the people where the Qiblah is preventing them from praying to the WRONG direction (also building mosques and burrying the dead) and doing the good thing of Ordering the Obligatory and Forbidding the Unlawful(Amr Bil Ma'aruf wa Nahi 3an Munkar) they are promoting sedition. So According to Mckhan:"Being wrong is right and being right is wrong".</b> May Allah Guide him.</p>
<p>Next like I said before, <b>in courts the burden of the proof is on the prosecutor so Mckhan should bring proof for his claims.</b> This is not Babysitting this how debate goes, I assumed what he said about the issues he brought after I dared Him. are from the article from the Link. Thus I replied accordingly. but I won't do it again. and like I said, this article's integrity is shattered.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Authenticity of the Glorious Qur'an</span></h2>
<p><b>Question:</b> While doing some research, I found that there was some sites saying that there are grammar changes in the Qur'an. Is this true? Thank you!</p>
<p>I do not understand what you mean. Language comes first and the grammar comes later. The Qur'an sets the standard for grammar and style, for as recognized by the highest authorities of the Arabic language from the time of its revelation, the Qur'an is unsurpassed in style and expression; it is the ultimate measure of grammar and style in the language.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is axiomatic among the scholars, that the Qur'an that sets the standard for Arabic grammar and style, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>If, therefore, some eccentric minds have 'discovered' lately that the Qur'an 'breaks the grammar rules', it is due to sickness in their minds. Their agenda definitely is to cast doubts in the minds of the people about the Inimitable Book. So take care who you learn your religion from, for as scholars have taught us: "This knowledge is religion; so you must take care who you learn it from!"</p>
<p>May Allah help us all to remain steadfast on sound faith-ameen.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</p>
<p>All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.</p>
<p>Dear brother, thanks for contacting us. We pray to Almighty Allah to strengthen our faith and guide us to what pleases Him, He is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful!</p>
<p>As regard your question, we’d like to cite for you the following:</p>
<p>“The Holy Qur'an was presented to the people of Arabia by the Holy Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. It was presented in parts over a period of 23 years of his prophetic life. The book presents itself as the word of Allah and the Holy Prophet also presented it as such.</p>
<p><b>The Muslims believe that the Holy Qur'an, being the revealed word of Allah, is the cornerstone of their faith. They get their philosophy, beliefs and laws from this book it is the basic source of the Islamic faith. It is the Word of Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him, who read it out before the world loud and clear. Not only did he recite it to the people of Arabia, he also made elaborate arrangements to ensure that its contents be preserved and his Companions should learn it by heart and should also write it down. The Holy Prophet's stress on the supremacy of the Book of Allah, over all other sources of knowledge, was unequivocal and categorical.</b></p>
<p><b>The Holy Qur'an has reached us through Tawatur:</b></p>
<p>The Holy Qur'an has reached us through the process of Tawatur (historical continuity and perpetuation achieved through transfer from generation-to-generation) When we say that the Qur'an has reached us through Tawatur, we imply that so many people in every generation conveyed it to the next and so on that there can be no doubt about its authenticity. It was not transmitted by a few persons in one generation to a few persons in the next. It was handed over by the entire generation to the next generation. The Generation of the Companions witnessed the revelation and compilation of the Holy Qur'an during the life of the Holy Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and then handed it over to the next generation and so on.</p>
<p>Its certainty has far exceeded the need for any debate. In the presence of established history, we would not accept any individual reports and rumors to the contrary. For instances a report in one of the history books that claims that Akbar the Great never ruled in India, would not be considered by us. The fact that Akbar the Great ruled over India for half a century is so established, that any odd report to the contrary would be simply ignored. So is the case of the Holy Qur'an. Since it has achieved the status of Tawatur, no odd report would affect its credibility.</p>
<p>When generations and generations of people without interruption hold the Qur'an as the one and only version of the divine guidance received from the Holy Prophet, such reports would not infringe upon its authenticity. The evidence for the Qur'an is so overwhelming, involving millions of people, that it would simply override any odd reports that may be found anywhere.”</p>
<p>Excerpted, with slight modifications, from <a href="http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/quran/0005.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/quran/0005.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/quran/0005.htm</a></p>
<p>In the light of the above, dear brother, it’s clear that all what non-Muslims say or fabricate against the Glorious Qur’an is totally groundless, for the authenticity of the Qur’an is not only upheld by Muslims but confirmed by non-Muslims as well, as will be clarified in the following:</p>
<p>“Attesting to the Qur'an’s authenticity, in his best-seller book <i><b>The Bible, The Qur’an and Science</b></i> the French researcher, historian, scientist Dr. Maurice Bucaille writes:</p>
<p><b>"Thanks to its undisputed authenticity, the text of the Qur’an holds a UNIQUE Place among the books of Revelation, shared neither by the Old nor the New Testament. In the first two sections of this work (meaning his book), a review was made of the alterations undergone by the Old Testament and the Gospels before they were handed down to us in the form we know today. The same is not true for the Qur’an for the simple reason it was written down at the time of the Prophet; we shall see how it came to be written, i.e. the process involved . . .. As the Revelation progressed, the Prophet and the believers following him recited the text by heart, and it was written down by the scribes in his following. It therefore starts off with two elements of authenticity that the Gospels do not possess."</b> Professor Hitte also writes: "Biblical text has been subjected to editorial and amendatory treatment, but not the Qur’anic ... In its phonetic and graphic reproduction, as well as in its linguistic form, the Qur’anic text is identical with its celestial original. "</p>
<p><b>The Qur’an is unique in consistency, harmony, intelligence and rationality:</b></p>
<p>The Qur’an is the book without inconsistencies; one part of its text, (or doctrine) does not clash with the other. In fact, it sets the absence of contradiction, irrationality, and incoherence, as one of the criteria for checking the authenticity of any divine revelation. It states "Do they not ponder the Qur’an (with care)? Had this book been from anybody but Allah, you would have found much inconsistencies.” (Surat An-Nisa:82).</p>
<p>Because contradictions and inconsistencies call for the negation of one part, which is in conflict with the other and this automatically invalidates portions of the book. In turn that makes it difficult for a man to remain true to any one value, thereby creating mental conflict, emotional and spiritual instability. "Skip some, follow some," “pick and choose" and "no absolutes" become the pattern. And these exercise an extremely damaging influence upon a truth-conscious, rational man with regard to belief in Allah and with regard to the credibility of the book itself. And it leads to dilemmas where sincere minds become "disjointed" and "disenchanted," eventually steering them away from the book or turn them into hypocrites.</p>
<p>Dr. Maurice Bucaille, who had absolutely no reason to favor one book, especially that of Islam, over the others (if anything, as human nature is, he would only favor the books of his own religion, but not the Qur’an) attests to the Qura’nic claim in his book. "The Quran ... is not only free from contradictions in its narrations, the sign of various human manipulations to be found in the Gospels, but provides a quality of its own for those who examine it objectively and in the light of science i.e. its complete agreement with modern scientific data.”</p>
<p>The Book may be great but what is its impact on the people, you might ask. If no impact it has any significance. How true! The Qur’an is unique in terms of its Blitzing Impact, also.</p>
<p>There have been many other religious books and revelations before the Qur’an. But of these, only the Holy Qur’an had the most electrifying impact upon the people. Its lightning-like rapidity, in a short few decades, reached the hearts and minds of the masses of several continents, transforming the lives of idolaters, alcoholics, exploiters, abusers, perverts, into men and women of pristine monotheism, of highest virtue and piety. Call it what you may - the most sensational spiritual revolution, or the spiritual blitzkrieg, the revolution of which the mankind had never witnessed before. To this very day, no other religion comes even close to matching Qur’an's record of the spectacular impact on lives of masses.”</p>

<p>Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies are so schizophrenic and cultish in their mentality that in their mind every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs is either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign." In other words, all the mainstream Sunni Muslims are "wrong" or "Kaafir" altogether - but - whatever Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are saying or preaching is "Islamic" or "Muslim." If this is NOT a CULT then what else it is. <b>The bottom-line and the burning question is that if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP are so unique and proud of their "scholar" then why don't they be simply proud of it by DEMONSTRATING that CLEARLY and CATEGORICALLY on their "Musallahs" that this center / material belongs to Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To SummerizeThe Situation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>1) I have tried to be very objective in this discussion, all Mckhan did was bring up 2 types of "exposings" as he called it</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First he claimed that we call all who oppose AICP, they call him "Kaafir" "Wahabi", "Ekhwan". Thats simply not true. But all thoes who critisize them can be linked to one of the 4 groups I mentioned above. Thus I didn't judge Mckhan by his "Opposition" to AICP but by his links to Islamonline and Islamweb Articles and by his claim that AICP Twist the meanings of Quraan(Refuted Above) which is a claim by a certain wahhabi who was debated in Australia and was refuted by AICP. there are excerpts from a book he wrote a while back.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>AICP Actions as a Group: Islamonline, Islamweb all are websites that don't stamp the term Ekhwan or Wahhabi on there frontpage so why should they stamp Habashies on theirs? does Mckhan want Islam to become CULTs? AICP beleives they are on the right path and they are YET to be refuted. All the opposition can do is spread articles around the Web w/o debate(full of lies like I said earlier) so people like Mckhan Steer away from Ahbash. instead of signing in on TalkaboutIslam.com and disscusing what he thinks is wrong about what we do.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2)Mckhan Answered my dare, and although he didn't bring up references, I refuted him since I'm familiar with what the infamouse article says. Still waiting for answer(this time I'll consider any article w/o references as null).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3)It's up to the neutral reader to determine if we are a cult. or a group of MUSLIM SUNNIs trying to protect the nation from going ASTRY or EXTREME. Not for Mckhan or his damaged Islamonline pseudo-scholars. (I mentioned earlier some of their weird fatwas)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An example of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP / ICPA's strategy to divide the mainstream Muslims and promote sedition</span></h2>
<p><b>ICPA-AFIC connection: Pathetically Flawed</b></p>
<p><i>by Dawood Yusuf</i></p>
<p><b><i>The MCR alleged that the Liverpool-based Muslim organisation, the</i> ‘Australian Islamic House’<i>, has ‘affiliation with some people, with some ideas, terrorist linkage’; and the</i> Bangladesh Islamic Centre <i>had ‘ties with Libya’.</i></b></p>
<p>In what could only be seen as a sinister move, the national Muslim organisation in Australia went to great lengths to recognise and legitimise a fringe group that, in the past fewyears, had been a source of divisionand confusion in the Muslim community of New South Wales.</p>
<p>In its October issue of the Muslim News newspaper, the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils(AFIC) ran two articles, titled NewSouth Wales Muslims Form NewState Council and Children’sCarnival 2000. On the surface, theyseemed unconnected. But at a closerlook, these two articles revealed thatthey were crafted to demonstratewhat were the official tactical lines ofAFIC.</p>
<p>In the article titled Children’s Carnival 2000, nothing seemed unusual. AFIC was simply promoting an organisation, the Islamic Charity Projects Association (ICPA), which represented the ‘Sydney Arabic com-munity’ in an annual carnival. But was it? The Muslim News is the official mouthpiece of AFIC. In the last two years AFIC had been struggling to impose itself as the leader of the Australian Muslim community. The repeated sackings of its members such as Bilal Cleland and Zakariah Mathews (to name just a few), sus-pension of a state member council (Islamic Council of NSW) and alle-gations by its former Treasurer (Mr Iqbal Tahir) of misappropriation of funds and mismanagement were blunders of AFIC presented asachievements.</p>
<p>AFIC got away with all them. In a letter, the former Treasurer Mr Iqbal Tahir outlined this reasons for resigning from AFIC saying that in his 20 years of involvement withAFIC, he had never come across such contemptuous treatment of the AFIC Constitution and its Federal Council. The business of the AFIC hadn’tbeen that good!.</p>
<p>It would be sheer naiveté to think that, as an organisation with the only Muslim newspaper, the AFIC was unaware of the nature of this particular local organisation. AFIC just as many others knew very well the nature of the ICPA.</p>
<p>The issue that obviously had triggered AFIC and the Muslim News to promote the ICPA was the dispute between a handful of officials of AFIC and the chairman of the Islamic Council of New South Wales. As it has been suggested, the dispute should not have led the AFIC and the Muslim News to promote such a deviant group as the ICPA and to publish an article about their activ-ities.</p>
<p>The Muslim leaders could have sought a retraction. But whether the AFIC would allow it to be published in the next issue the Muslim News is just another matter. The point that needs to be made is about the disruptive and dangerous ICPA-AFIC connection.</p>
<p><b>The ICPA is a group that is also known as the Ahbash, or Habashies who are a deviant misguided sect much similar to the Qadianis. It is part of a wider circuit, with bases in various parts of the world.</b> For an indepth look at the group, their teachings and their beliefs, readers may refer to an article written in the 5th issue of the Nida’ul Islam magazine (October-November 1994).</p>
<p>The Australian-based ICPA came out of oblivion, following the allocation of temporary or Special Event radio licences by the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA). Through their Muslim Community Radio (MCR), the ICPA began to broadcast in English and Arabic their twisted religious messages and political agenda.</p>
<p>The group had successfully made a case of representing Muslims in NSW to the ABA until in 1996 when the Islamic Council of NSW (ICNSW) representing twenty Muslim organisations and mosques, decided to apply for these temporary or Special Event licences. Since then,the ABA had been thrown into somekind of uncertainty or confusion as to which organisation — the ICPA or the ICNSW —to allocate the licences. And on the other hand, the two organisations had been locked in a bitter struggle to secure temporary or Special Event licences, especially during Ramadan season.</p>
<p>The struggle came to a head in recent months when the ABA decided to allocate three permanent Sydney-wide Community Broadcasting Licences. Under the ABA guidelines, aspirant groups would make a written submission, followed by a hearing whereby applicants would be given the opportunity to make their case orally to an ABA panel.</p>
<p>Both the ICNSW and the ICPA made their submissions for a permanent licence and both claimed to representthe same target groups — the Muslimc ommunities of NSW. It was at this point that the ICPA who had applied for its MCR service went on a severe attack against the Muslims of NSW. From the transcripts of the hearings, it was clear that the MCR was targeting the very communities it claimed torepresent, especially those who are affiliated with the ICNSW. The MCR alleged that the Liverpool-based Muslim organisation, the ‘Australian Islamic House’, has ‘affiliation with some people, with some ideas, terrorist linkage’; and the Bangladesh Islamic Centre had ‘ties with Libya’.</p>
<p>In addition, the ICPA claimed in their MCR application that they had the support of various mosques and communities including Turkish and Shi’ites. The six major Turkish communities in NSW subsequently had denied that there was any connection, let alone support, to the MCR application. At a meeting on 2 September 2000, these Turkish societies resolved to ‘reconfirm’ their support to the application of the ICNSW. Some smaller and less established societies have also written directly to the ABA, outlining how they were ‘misled’ by the MCR. It was doubtful before, as it is now, whether the ICPA and their MCR service —targeting primarily the Arabic community of Lebanese descent — had the support of the wider Muslim community. The MCR’s spokesperson Mr Mehioeven boasted at the hearings that one of the members of the Islamic Egyptian Society had ‘supplied’ them with the minutes of the ICNSW, which was attached to a bulk of other damning documents to oppose the application of the ICNSW. The same Islamic Egyptian Society is now AFIC’s leading organisation — together with the Islamic Society of Manly-Warringah — of the newly formed ‘Supreme Islamic Council of New South Wales’.</p>
<p>In the same October issue of the Muslim News, AFIC reported how a new state council had been formed (supposedly) following ‘the damning judgement of the Supreme Court of NSW in January 2000’. Almost every Muslim in NSW, obviously, viewed the whole recent court issue of ICNSW/AFIC as an embarrassment and a waste of financial resources. Based on AFIC’s own admission, it would seem some of the leading opponents of ICNSW had actually acted on what a Supreme Court Judgehad said and went on to create the so-called ‘Supreme Islamic Council of NSW’. It’s more likely that it was just another pathetic attempt of AFIC — particularly after it had failed in its takeover attempt of the ICNSW — at justifying its creation of a rival state council.</p>
<p>The ‘Supreme Islamic Council of NSW’ had since contacted the ABA with a lengthy submission — predictably damning to the radio licence application of the ICNSW — stating that it would now represent the Muslims of NSW and would seek recognition of AFIC as the local statecouncil. The submission also arguedthat the ICNSW had refused membership to fifteen Muslim organisations.</p>
<p>On 07 December 2000, the ICNSW wrote to the ABA rejecting the claim. It argued that it had yet to see any evidence to substantiate the ICNSW’s denial of membership to fifteen Muslim organisations.</p>
<p>The letter also stated that all the Imams (clergy) of all established Mosques and Mussalas in NSW (except for the Islamic Charity Projects Association) have given their official support to the Council’s application for a permanent licence and that the Imams have also spoken strongly against fragmenting the Muslim community by creating a rival state council.</p>
<p>“At a meeting of the Federal Councils of the Australian Federation of Islamic Council (AFIC) on Sunday 19 November 2000, the so-called Supreme Islamic Council of NSW has been rejected unanimously by all other state Islamic Councils”, said the letter.</p>
<p>The AFIC’s strategy to promote the ICPA through the Muslim News was to deliberately bring to naught any prospects for the ICNSW to secure apermanent licence. AFIC was promoting the activities of the ICPA, representing the Sydney Arabic community, to cause maximum damageand to bring humiliation to the Muslim Arabic leaders.</p>
<p>The ICPA-AFIC connection had only worsened the state of uncertainty or confusion of the ABA on the issue of representation of Muslims in NSW, not to mention how effective this connection had been to disrupt and divide the NSW Muslim community. The AFIC’s strategy to create a rival state council and to promote the ICPA is pathetically flawed.</p>
<p>The only conclusion that the ABA, or anyone for that matter, could reach from the ICPA-AFIC connection is that the organisation of the Muslim community in NSW is in shambles and that it is immature — politically. In this respect, the ABA would have no choice but to exclude the possibility of allocating a permanent licence to either one of the two applicants that were targeting the Muslim community audience. It would probably take a long time before such an opportunity to come.</p>
<p>Through the October issue of the Muslim News, AFIC had two articles, seemingly unconnected, inflicting serious damage to the very people whom they claimed to represent. They had cost the Muslim community dearly. Only time will tell as to what extent the ICPA-AFIC connection will impact on the community. A monitoring mechanism and an action plan must be developed to ensure that this dangerous and disruptive connection is put to an end. The easiest way to this is to remove those responsible for it and make them accountable.</p>

<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>to ignore / discredit all the INDEPENDENT, NEUTRAL and ACADEMIC sources and material which doesn't follow the tag-line of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP,</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to take the liberty to recapitulate the core points of content of this page as per following:</p>
<p><i>Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's Objections:</i> "an interpretation of Islam combining elements of Sunni and Shi'a theology with Sufism"<a href="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" class="external autonumber" title="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>&#160;? + "anti-Salafi, and with Sufi and other beliefs seen as heretical"<a href="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/habasi_history.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/habasi_history.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>&#160;?</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> / <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s Response:</b> <i>It was an attempt to summarise and merge the descriptions at the three cited sources: their own promotional website; a critical description; and what appears to be a fairly balanced and properly-sourced paper in an academic journal. It incorporated other academic sources such as <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context</a>.</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 15:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC) + <i>Read <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. I chose those links because they represent a spread of views: one well-referenced and (as far as I can tell neutral) academic article; one from the official AICP site, which is completely uncritical of Al-Ahbash; and one fairly representative of what its critics say about it.</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 02:15, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Morever, fairly and impartially speaking, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has given AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies quite favorable POV on WikiPedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>a). by not calling them a CULT but merely a "sect"</li>
<li>b). by providing an external link to Al-Ahbash / Habashies' arch web-site and to another contrary link</li>
<li>c). by quoting their BOGUS and OXYMORONIC claim that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies advocates pluralism, and opposition to political activism and violence (There is ample material available over the internet to refute both claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>d). by quoting AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' FRADULENT slogan from their own web-site, "the resounding voice of moderation" (What kind of "the voice of moderation" is this which castigates every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs as either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign.")</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP don't appreicate the fact that if I will write that page according to my wishes, that page will NOT be somewhat NEUTRAL like the way it is NOW and same goes for them. AND I have repeatedly mentioned on this very page that - when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP leave mainstream Sunnis alone and be proud of themselves by clearly and categorically identifying / declaring themselves as "Jamat Al-Ahbash" rather than "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Alas! Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP will not do that as it will be an asthama to their strategy of seeking recruitment and legitimacy under the guise of "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah."</p>
<p>And last but not the least, lets not forget that WikiPedia is NOT a religious, AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash's or mainstream Muslims' platform. WikiPedia is an encyclopedia which aspries to follow the Neutral Point of View (NPVO). Consequently, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version meets the WikiPedia guidelines as the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP insists on their own POV. And I know they will keep coming back to modify, sanitize, recruit and / or rescue Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.</p>
<p><b>Further Reading:</b></p>
<p>You may always use major search engines like Google and Yahoo for research. You might be amazed to find out that there are SO MANY web-sites and material out there which have REFUTED all the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies CLAIMS and BELIEFS .etc by quoting and using AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' own material. This page, for which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's agents are waging their "Jihad" at - to sanitize and rescue themselves, is just, as they say, a drop in the ocean.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Al-Ahbash are pushing the envelope on WikiPedia to seek legitimacy and recruitment and pursue their agenda...</span></h2>
<p>As I predicted on this very page, Al-Ahbash / Habashies' agents are back to promote themselves. Their main web-site aicp.org has got links to all their sister web-sites and YET they would rather REMOVE a crucial link (castigating it as a "Wahabi" link) and post ALL the links to their web-sites. Furthermore, they always seek special treatment by putting their links on the top of others' links. The truth of the matter IS that all these following links should be listed on that page:</p>

<p>And last but NOT the least, "Muslim_sunni" has proved one more time that he is using WikiPedia as well as other similar projects as link-farms to promote his group's agenda which hegemonously and blantantly seek legitimacy and recruitment under the guise of mainstream Sunnis - though - they delibrately DENY the TOTALITY of the Quran.</p>
