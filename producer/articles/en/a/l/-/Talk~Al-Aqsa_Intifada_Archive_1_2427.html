<h3><span class="mw-headline">Temple Mount incident</span></h3>
<p>Does anyone remember what was said at first, when Sharon visited Temple Mount?</p>
<ul>
<li>Was there a claim from any advocate that Sharon was "violating" a holy place sacred to Islam?
<ul>
<li>As in, Jews aren't supposed to enter Muslim holy places?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was there a claim that a political leader like Sharon should not make political statements in a holy place (whether it's sacred to Muslims or Jews)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I am not advocating a point of view here, but trying to sort out who said what, okay? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ariel Sharon had the legal right to enter the Temple Mountain (any Israeli citizen can do it). He didn't enter the Muslim structures. He also didn't make political (or any other) statements on the Temple Mountain. As far as I remember, the complaints to him centered on these facts:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>(implicit) Sharon is a Jew, and Jews are considered inferior and tame all over the Arab world (sad truth here). An open visit by a Jew is akin to an insult to the famous Arab pride.</li>
<li>(explicit) Sharon was accompanied by a crowd of body-guards. Although they did not harm anyone (the riots began later), and bearing arms there is not forbidden (Israeli policemen are stationed there regularly), they were criticized rather harshly. My pet theory is that what upset Arabs most was Sharon's having signs of respect around him in a Muslim holy place. --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your insights, Uri. Okay, any advocates with another POV want to answer the same questions? I'd like to get some "balance" (possibly for inclusion in the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Mount_9e35.html" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a> article. ==<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, the subject on why Sharons visit on temple Mount angered so many Palestines need further explanation. This is what I think is the Arabic view:</p>
<p>1. Sharon is (obviously) seen as a war criminal, reasons for that can (easily) be found in the article about him. He is seen as a proponent to all Arabs. 2. Therefore Sharon visiting temple Mount would be the same as a KKK member visiting a black neighbourhood. 3. WHY did Sharon have to visit temple Mount? Wouldn't it have been very easy for him to foretell what would happen? And he knew that the visit would anger the Palestinians so it seems like the visit was done to provoke violence from the Palestinian side. 4. Sharon claimed that he did it as a message of peace, which might have added gasoline to the fire because it might have been interpreted by Palestines as "peace means that we control temple Mount"</p>
<p>And for a NPOV I think we should be careful when adding attributes to a whole ethnicity... ==<a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I forgot last night one more reason</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Jews want to take over the world" motive. The fact that Sharon visited the Temple Mountain somehow made Muslims believe this is the next location of "Jewish takeovers" which would result in their holy sites destructed, and perhaps the building of another Temple.</li>
</ul>
<p>As to NPOV, would you deny the average Arab hates Jews guts? --<a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriyan_1dfa.html" title="User:Uriyan">Uri</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Just to stick my oar in: To say that "Sharon visiting temple Mount would be the same as a KKK member visiting a black neighbourhood." is grossly unfair. Sharon's visit was primarily to visit the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism. I agree that he didn't <i>have</i> visit the Temple Mount, and he probably knew it wouldn't help. But the idea of attributing to the visit the status of igniting the intifada is rather overblown. I have read a statement by Marwan Barghouti (which unfortunately I cannot find the link to) which seemed to imply that he and others were preparing for an uprising anyway, and used the crowd protesting Sharon's visit in order to cause a bit of trouble.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes; Palestinian sources have publicly confirmed that this second intifada was pre-planned, and that Sharon's visit was only used as a pretext. Sadly, however, the Western press failed to report this information. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Uri - I'm guessing you're Israeli, and I do understang where your view comes from, as your contact with Arabs is presumably Palestinians, and especially seeing terrorist on television etc. but you really shouldn't expect it to be an accurate portrayal of a vast race. Your comments only make you appear rather narrow, and add fuel to the old Zionism=Racism arguement.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi, just a question. I believe the (first) intifada was nicknamed "war of stones" or something similar (some even claim intifada means "war of stones", but that is not true). I recall that name was also often used, maybe it's worth mentioning somewhere? <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Q, please note that the term "occupied territories" is not <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral.html" title="Neutral">NPOV</a>, while <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a> are neutral. A neutral sentence is one that both sides of a controversy can agree is correct.</p>
<p>You might say, quite accurately, that an event</p>
<dl>
<dd>took place in the West <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank.html" title="Bank">Bank</a>, which is regarded as an <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_territory.html" title="Occupied territory">occupied territory</a> by most Arabs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wikipedia does not seek to suppress any point of view (POV), but merely to label each POV clearly, so readers know who advocates it. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>A perfectly understandable and reasonable point. However, who gets to define which terms are POV and which aren't? It's perfectly fair to call the Palestinian territories the occupied territories because that's what they are - occupied ("a region under the control of a different nation") territories ("not an established nation"). Writing "The West Bank and the Gaza Strip" is every time is far longer. "Palestine" is inaccurate, as it is more likely to refer to historic Palestine, which includes present day Israel. To declare that it is too POV, one should additionally propose a non-POV term that's not as unwieldy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who support the Palestinian cause could raise equivalent objections about terms prefered by Israel - i.e, it's not "curfew", it's lockdown. They're not "settlements", they're colonies. They're not "targetted killings", they're assasinations. Etc. If one opposes the use of the term "occupied territories" but supports the other terms, then the rule that you're basically using is "If the Israeli government uses the term, it's non-POV; if Palestinians do, it's POV". That logic is in itself POV. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure "occupied territories" is that objectionable, even though it is a politically-defined term. The US news media use it pretty regularly. Also, in articles that are specifically <i>about</i> the Arab view of things, it's certainly not out of place. In more general contexts I'd prefer to avoid it by just naming the places explicitly--Gaza, West Bank, etc. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concerning Uriber's comment about a POV link</span></h2>
<p>Half of the links referenced in the text are from POV sources (Palestine Monitor, IDF website, etc). Normally this is to be discouraged, but on such a contentious topic, I think it's necessary - *when presented in the context of what each side is claiming, to show what they're claiming*.</p>
<p>What do other people think? --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Depends. If the link is to bring a statement of an official body (IDF, the PA, Israel or other) than it is okey to bring POV link as long as you say so. For example: "the PA claims that &lt;link&gt;" or "Figures provided by the..." etc. But when you want to give a report on curtain event - put an NPOV link (news report from the press).</dd>

Recent raids in Rafah left many families homeless. Israel's official stance is that their houses were captured by militant and were destroyed during battles with IDF forces. Palestinians deny it and claim that many houses were destroyed to create a large buffer zone in the city, displacing several hundred people. They claimed that the entire southern side of the city was completely destroyed, making it very unlikely that an entire portion of a city had been siezed by "terrorists" <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/hic-opt/docs/UN/OCHA/OCHAHU_190104.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reliefweb.int/hic-opt/docs/UN/OCHA/OCHAHU_190104.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. However, a group of Rafah's residents blamed the destruction on the militant tunnel operators who uses the civilian structures as cover for illegal smuggling. Rafah resident, Abdallah Abu Mohsen, told Al-Hayat al-Jadidah:</p>

<dd>The only site on the entire net (as far as google knows) that claims that quote is a private website. "Intelligence.org.il" may sound impressive, but it's a private website. It's run by a guy named Yehuda Friedman, on the NetVision ISP. If you want to get in touch with him to ask him to back it up, you can call him at +972-3-549-7019 or write him at P.O. Box 3555, Ramat Hasharon, Israel. Until it can be backed up, though, I'm not going to accept it. It's from a site which has about as much authority as a geocities page. That's really not acceptable - heck, if an impressive sounding DNS name was what mattered, I could go register intelligence.to right now, and start making stuff up. If you can back it up, I'd gladly no longer dispute it with you, although I might want to qualify it. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<p>I expect that the quotation is genuine, but without context it is misleading. It is well established that some tunnels existed and some of the local residents were not happy about it. The problem comes in the interpretation. We are being urged to believe that the tunnels are the primary cause of the house demolitions along the border but this does not follow from the quotation and it does not follow from the evidence. The evidence is that an explicit policy was established to clear a corridor along the border and this policy was carried out regardless of who lived in each house and regardless of any evidence that each house was used for anything except living in. I believe that the evidence collected by NGOs and the UN establish this without doubt. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 12:30, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, this is already a matter of interpatation (unless you can bring a signed order that proves there is such a deliberate policy). Therefore, I support in presenting both POVs. The Israeli POV that the house demolitions is due smuggling tunnels, and the Palestinian POV that the house demolition is due the "buffer zone" policy and let the reader judge for himself. For that reason, I didn't removed Rei's <i>reliefweb</i> link with an aerial photo of the demolished area. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 12:42, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) The World Bank defines NGO as "private organizations that pursue activities to relieve suffering, promote the interests of the poor, protect the environment, provide basic social services, or undertake community development" (Operational Directive 14.70). Think tanks are not NGOs.</p>
<p>2) You are taking a one step-distanced approach from newspapers by quoting a think tank. Newspapers quote from PNAC, too, but that's hardly a reason to trust PNAC as a valid source.</p>
<p>3) Searching for "Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies (C.S.S)", you get 228 hits. The Project for a New American Century gets 30,800 hits. Your point? It's still a think tank.</p>
<p>4) What reason on earth would a person have to remove a satellite picture that shows the scale of the destruction of the camp, apart from obvious bias? Are you claiming that the satellite is an unreliable source or something?</p>
<p>In short, Think Tanks Are Not Valid References. If this is true, then there should be more than just a reference on a think tank's website. You have yet to address: If a measurable percentage of the people whose houses were destroyed considered the few who made tunnels as the source of the blame, why is the only reference on a think tank's website? --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>I treated NGO as simply "non governmental organization". I don't see why only social workers count for you as a reliable source of information.</li>
<li>Right now, you are the only one doubting the source - without no good reason.</li>
<li>Hits doesn't counts.</li>
<li>The same reason you want to remove the quotation. I have no problem with the sattelite picture.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>"In short, Think Tanks Are Not Valid References" - I don't brought comentary, I brought a quotation from Arab newspaper which isn't accesible on the web.</li>
<li>"You have yet to address: If a measurable percentage of the people whose houses were destroyed considered the few who made tunnels as the source of the blame, why is the only reference on a think tank's website?"
<ul>
<li>Don't forget we don't have access to the majority of the Arab press. Most of the newspapers there don't upload daily editions in English (if any).</li>
<li>The Palestinian Authority isn't a democracy, and the people there are scared from the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Martyrs%27_Brigades_7306.html" title="Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades">al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades</a> and the street <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a> of Arafat's resisters and suspected collaberators.</li>

<p>Response:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oh, please. You know very well that I listed NGOs and newspapers. Heck, I'll even take something from a government website - but think tanks are not good references. You do admit that this group is little more than a think tank, don't you?</li>
<li>Without Good Reason??? You pick some website off the net and claim that they're authoritative because they say so? How on earth is that a good reason?</li>
<li>I assume that you mean "hits don't count". I was pointing out that not only is it a think tank, it's a rarely-referenced think tank. Little known. I.e., even less trustworthy a source than your average think tank.</li>
<li>No, I want to remove your quotation because you refuse to back it up with an authoritative source. Because you can't find a single other thing to back it up. If you wanted to remove the satellite picture by the same logic, you'd have to claim that the satellite was lying, or that the UN doctored the picture. I don't think you're dumb enough to claim anything like that.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>No, you didn't bring a quotation from an arab newspaper. You brought a quotation from a think tank's website which claims that it is from an arab newspaper, and then you tried to portray this as being some sort of general concensus from the area. Here, I'll give you a *video interview* which has some people from the buffer zone in Rafah in it <a href="http://www.daughtersoftiresias.org/Media/Video/Israel-Palestine/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.daughtersoftiresias.org/Media/Video/Israel-Palestine/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Do *they* seem to be putting the blame on the people with the tunnels? Um, no. Your portrayed view that a significant portion of Gazans blame the few people with the tunnels is false, and there's a reason that you can only seem to support it with an article from a think tank instead of any sort of reputable source.</li>
<li>"The Palestinian Authority isn't a democracy, and the people there are scared from the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Martyrs%27_Brigades_7306.html" title="Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades">al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades</a> and the street <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a> of Arafat's resisters and suspected collaberators." - you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Almost all of the journalists - *westerners, even* - who have been killed in Palestine have been killed by the IDF. All of the international volunteers who have been killed in Palestine - both NGOs and solidarity groups like the ISM - have been killed by the IDF.</li>
<li>I'll ask again: Why is the only case that you can present to show this viewpoint from a think tank's site? Why hasn't any sort of newspaper elsewhere found such a viewpoint to exist - and in fact, instead, found quite the opposite? Hell, I used to know a person who stayed in Gaza (ISM), staying in houses on the border to discourage the IDF from bulldozing them. Everyone was furious with the Israelis for destroying everything they owned without compensation - they viewed the tunnels as a cheap excuse to build a big buffer zone and drive them from their homes. I'm sure if you searched, you could find some people who blamed the people with the tunnels more than the IDF, but you'd have to really search.</li>
<li>There's a reason why Rachel Corrie has been treated like a shahida for defending houses, and it's not because people were angry at tunnel owners. &#160;;)</li>
<li>Lastly, I think I'll add that Israel brags that no suicide bomber has come from Gaza since the intifada began, thanks to the walls surrounding it. So, while any weapons being smuggled through the tunnels might be used to attack the IDF or to attack the illegal Israeli colonies in Gaza, they're not being used for terrorism in Israel. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></li>

<li>This group is a private research institute, and bring quotations from Arab press as well as commentary.</li>
<li>You have no proof that the quotation from Al-Hayat al-Jadidah wasn't said and you make blame me and this website in some "consiperacy" theory and forging without any proof what so ever. I even proved to you that this website is count as reliable by mainstream press. I begining to think that the only reason you object is racism.</li>
<li>Wake up. There are life outside the web, a specially in foreign languages.</li>
<li>But you are oviously do. If you claim that the quotation is a forgery, I expect you to prove your point. Otherwise, stop throwing false accusations.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The interview only prooves that there Rafah resident who think differently, that's all.</li>
<li>I suggest you stop with this ill incitement immidietly.</li>
<li>I answered on this before.</li>
<li>How Rachel Corrie got to do with it? The only reason you rise her is to encourage hatred. I can also bring the hundreds of atrocities commited by the Palestinian.</li>
<li>First, Anti-Air missile can be smuggled through the Karni crossing and can be directed against airliners flying over the Gaza Strip. Secondly, Attacking Israeli civilian in the settlement is not legitimate and not moral what so ever. The IDF has every right to defend the settlers from being murdered by Palestinian terrorists. <b>I strongly condamn you for advocating the mass murder of innocent civilians.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 22:12, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Response (by a hitherto disinterested party):</p>
<ol>
<li>That's what a think-tank is. A private research institute.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>If I recall correctly, you were the one who first used the term "conspiracy". In addition, unless you can provide the actual source (meaning the original source, that copy of الحيات الجديدة or, if it existed, a link to that article on the الحيات الجديدة website, the actual existance of the newspaper article is questionable, since you quoted somebody who quoted it. In fact, that's 3 layers deep: you quoted that website, which quoted الحيات الجديدة, which (if it really printed such an article) quoted whomever originally said it. Just in the same way that I wouldn't quote something Britney Spears said People magazine quoted Justin Timberlake as saying, I would never in my right mind quote a quote of a quote, especially if any point in the line of quoters and quotees one quoter displayed an obvious bias against their (or, if they are not the same, the original) quotee.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Well, yes, there definitely is. The problem I have is, afaik, not the same as <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">User:Rei</a>'s: hu doesn't approve of your quoting that specific website which in turn quoted a newspaper whose very existance is suspect. I, on the other hand, only have a problem with the fact that you are quoting a quote of a quote. To demonstrate problems with quote depth, especially when across 3 different languages (first Arabic, then through Hebrew, then through English): I might tell a Japanese friend you said "無罪の民間人の大量殺人を薦めてから咎められます。", and then he in turn could tell his Australian friend that you said "I reproach you for your recommendation to slaughter a civilian." That is clearly quite different than what you originally said, and in this case there is no bias involved, and also I made all 3 up and it only travels to Japanese and then back to English instead of from one language to another to another.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>If you are so sure that this newspaper article is real, why can't you prove it? I think that the burden of proof is on you, because you are the one who claimed the existance of the article, and not on him, because he only challenged it, not said it was for-sure-not-real.</li>

<ol>
<li>In short, THINK TANK.</li>
<li>You call it a conspiracy to question a random website on the net that has 288 hits referencing it. How naïve can a person get? "The Return of the Nephilim" <a href="http://www.returnofthenephilim.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.returnofthenephilim.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, a end-of-times conspiracy magazine which believes that Christ's second coming involves the return of interdimensional aliens that disguise themselves as humans, gets over 1,500 hits. Apparently, I'm a racist and a conspiracy theorist for not believing a 288 hit website. I must be horribly racist and conspiratorial not to believe in the second coming of the Nephilim, then! I should start believing in Cold Fusion, Lifters being based on antigravity, holocaust denial, and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, shouldn't I?
<ul>
<li>I think you already believing in the last two things. I showed you already thaat is not just annonymous source but a rather a well-known organization, which even is cited by mainstreem press. You keep ignoring it without any good reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes. <i>And if it's true, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SECOND REFERENCE.</i> Why can't you?
<ul>
<li>I answered before. Read, for a change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oh, come on! I could start a website today that cites a made-up article from WAFA, and ask you to disprove it. Would you be able to?
<ul>
<li>I showed you already thaat is not just annonymous source but a rather a well-known organization, which even is cited by <b>mainstreem press</b>. You keep ignoring it without any good reason. If this is helping you, there is a link to it from the <a href="http://www.idf.il" class="external text" title="http://www.idf.il" rel="nofollow">IDF website</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>No, the "interview" shows that a little known think tank website claims that their translation of an article which isn't backed up anywhere else claims that there are people who think otherwise.
<ul>
<li>I guess floralism and multi-opinions is strange to your political culture. Can't you accept the fact that different people have different opinion?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ah. It's ill-incitement to point out facts. Got it. Is that why you refuse to do it?
<ul>
<li>Palestinian terrorists murdered more than 1000 innocent people during the last 4 years - both Israeli and Palestinian. The Al-Aqsa Brigades ravaged Nablus and what the Iraqis did to American in Fallujah is a common practice withib Palestinian society - burning people alive, stabbing them, mutilate their bodies and hang them on poles in the streets. In that situtation, no wonder why people affraid to speak against Arafat. Intead of relating to that point, you start to accuse the IDF in order to encourage hatred and fury.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No, you have not answered why you can't find it anywhere else. I'll ask again: WHY can you not find anything else that backs this up?</li>
<li>I brought her up to show that she has been highly *honored* by the people of Rafah for working to stop the demolitions; you are trying to claim that there's a relevant percentage of people who were having their homes destroyed who blamed the people with the tunnels more than the IDF. If you had *read* what I wrote instead of stopping after seing her name, you would have realized that.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>LAF. Ok, please - enlighten me. When was the last time that the Palestinians - whose most advanced weapon is the Qassam Rocket, a welded-shut tube with a couple of fins stuck on the side - shot down an aircraft? Why don't you just start scare-mongering that they're going to develop nuclear weapons, or a Death Star while you're at it, and then use it as an excuse to just gas them all?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There were some attempts, all of them were foild before they reached the executing level.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>As for the Israeli colonists in Gaza, lets not forget that they're committing <b>ethnic cleansing</b> ("The systematic elimination of an ethnic group or groups from a region or society, as by deportation, forced emigration, or genocide" - American Heritage Dictionary). That they're violating several dozen parts of the Geneva Conventions just by being there alone. And lastly, not to excuse either side, but the let's not forget fact that the violence has been tit-for-tat between the colonies and the Palestinians.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>That's a false accusation, even to your dictionary definition such a thing do not happen in Gaza. Do you see a major decrease in Gaza population? Have you gone so ill that you are now turning into ridicilous <b>blood libels</b>? Have you no shame?</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"The IDF has every right to defend the settlers from being murdered by Palestinian terrorists." - I assume the settlers have the right to murder Palestinians?
<ul>
<li>The settlers in the Gaza Strip never murdered Palestinians. In fact, according to Btzelem - only 19 Palestinian were killed by West Bank settlers (the total number is 32, but that's include Palestnian terrorists killed during attack on Israeli civilians) <a href="http://www.btselem.org/Hebrew/Statistics/Fatalities_Lists/Pal_by_Is.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btselem.org/Hebrew/Statistics/Fatalities_Lists/Pal_by_Is.asp" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or do you look at the conflict through a one-way mirror, and simply not notice the fact that the colonists have killed just as many (with a lower average age of victims, at that)? Finally, I'll add, if the IDF was doing its job under international law, it would be uprooting and moving <b>every last colonist</b> to the pre-1967 borders, not continually confiscating more land for them without recompense.
<ul>
<li>You look at the conflict through a one-way broken mirror.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>I strongly condemn you for advocating policies that have resulting in the death of 3 times as many civilians, an even worse ratio concerning children, over 10 times worse a ratio for the wounded, the destruction of several billion dollars of property, the making of tens of thousands of homeless, policies of lockdown (such as forcing, under threat of death, the entire population of Nablus under house arrest for over 100 days), the widescale destruction of cultural property, and the continual theft of land which, in the case of Gaza, has made it one of the most population dense areas on earth and little more than a prison camp.</b> How can a person justify that in their mind without viewing the Palestinians as little more than animals? I really can't picture that sort of view that land is yours for the taking, even though millions of people already live in an area - and that it's ok to kick them off, and that any attempts by the people to strike back are terrorism and deserve further brutality. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a>

The actions of the Israeli military in Rafah have nothing to do with tunnels. The majority of the house demoltions (over 1100 since 2001) is for the massive wall construction. They're systematically demolishing homes along the Egyptian border to create a buffer for the massive wall. You think there were tunnels in 1100 homes? In fact, the IDF says they've found over 50 tunnels. Yes 50, but they've destroyed 1100 homes, and killed over 300 people. There have been some tunnels throuout Rafah's history that were used for smuggling goods from Egypt, but now they're largly accepted as too dangerous. Any arms that did come in through them could only be used for internal resistance within the Gaza Strip, as Israel has tightly seeled off the greenline between Gaza and Israel proper. This internal resistance in hugely popular with the Palestinians, because it is almost exclusively against military targets (though some settlments, which are debatably a military target) and they feel this provides them some meager protection from they hyper aggressive, super violent, murderous Israeli occupying army. I'll happily respond to other questions if you need any other quotes or information. thanks -joe</i></dd>

<p>I was hoping he could get me a direct quote from some residents, but oh well. He lived with some of the people on the border when he was over there, and (needless to say) talked with a wide variety of Palestinians the whole time he was over there. This is not meant to be some sort of all-inclusive proof - just more evidence that your presentation of this sort of "blame those with the tunnels more than the IDF" view is either incredibly rare if even extant at all. By the way, I suggest you actually watch some video <a href="http://www.daughtersoftiresias.org/Media/Video/Israel-Palestine" class="external text" title="http://www.daughtersoftiresias.org/Media/Video/Israel-Palestine" rel="nofollow">from Palestine</a> for once (the audio quality is good, although the video quality is bad, mainly in the night-shots in the beginning) (it's by Sandra Jordan, an international news reporter for the <i>The Observer</i> (a London newspaper) - have you ever watched more than a 30 second clip from people living in Palestine made by someone other than an Israeli (esp. IDF) journalist?), instead of just reading think tanks web sites' inaccurate portrayals of the situation over there. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></p>
<p>Well, quoting from Joe</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>"but now they're largly accepted as too dangerous."</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Which implies that some residents (largly accepted even imply that many residents) think that the tunnel is the cause (or execuse, in a pro-Palestinian anti-Israeli formulation) to the intensive IDF operation there, which include destruction of houses used for terror, hiding tunnels and attacking soldiers. Report on the <a href="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=7&amp;docid=28434.EN" class="external text" title="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=7&amp;docid=28434.EN" rel="nofollow">last tunnel found</a> counts as many as 80 tunnels already been found and destroyed by IDF forces. Many of the houses didn't destroyed directly because of tunnels, but rather because they hosted terrorist who shot sniper-fire and anti-tank missile over the IDF forces. Since terrorists commit frequent attack on IDF forces on the border with Egypt and use the house as sniping posts - the result is many houses destroyed. The far side of Rafah is relatively intact, since the war between IDF and terrorists of Rafah in waging mainly near the border above the tunnels. <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/Duck_Duck_Goose.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/Duck_Duck_Goose.asp" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Pictures: <a href="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/images/tunnel1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/images/tunnel1.jpg" rel="nofollow">tunnel found in a house</a> , <a href="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/images/smuggling_tunnel_graph.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/images/smuggling_tunnel_graph.gif" rel="nofollow">diagram of a smuggling tunnel</a>, <a href="http://www.israel-wat.com/abuse.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.israel-wat.com/abuse.jpg" rel="nofollow">Gaza's terrorists use children as human shield</a> , <a href="http://www.israel-wat.com/tunnels_eng1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.israel-wat.com/tunnels_eng1.jpg" rel="nofollow">another tunnel inside a house</a>.

<dd>Oh, give me a break! He directly stated, "This myth is as rediculous as your friend's notion that the people of Rafah blame anybody other than the military for their miserable situation.". Are you completely blind??? How on earth could you have missed that line? <i>Operating a tunnel</i> is widely viewed as being too dangerous. The blame, however, by residents, is almost soley on the Israeli military; resistance activities actually have a lot of public support. I can't believe you can do selective-reading to that extreme of a level.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The funny thing about your "human shields picture"? <i>Your Picture Isn't People Using Human Shields</i>. It's kids gathering around to watch people fight. Human shields? How about instead of quoting from a lobbying group, you actually check a human rights group's website (notice how my references are from relief organizations and newspapers, and yours are from sources that are about as partisan as physically possible? Take a clue from that). Let's see what Amnesty International, for example, has to say. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=site%3Aamnesty.org+%22human+shields%22+occupied&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=site%3Aamnesty.org+%22human+shields%22+occupied&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Why, virtually all of their references to using human shields are in reference to the <b>IDF using Palestinians as human shields</b>. There's a reason for that: it hapens many, many, many, many, many, many times - it is standard procedure when resistance is encountered during house searches for the IDF to take human shields. Virtually every time they occupy a home to use as a sniper's nest, they use the residents as human shields instead of letting them go. These are *REAL* human shields - not people who came to watch others fight, but people who have guns to their heads making them defend the IDF with their bodies. It's standard practice - and it's horribly, horribly wrong.</dd>

<dd>Have you no shame? You know very well that children should not lie near gunmen.

Even AP photographer figured out that terrorist using the children here as human shield. Of course you'll again blame me in Zionist consiperacy as you always do. The rest of your allegation are irrelevant to the matter and are twisted in a Bolshevik kind of a way. There was a use in Palestinian in order to burst into house, but after the Israeli court ruled it is disallowed, it ceased almost completly. Have I mention how the Palestinian systematicly murder children in buses and cafes? How they slaughter 30 innocent people who sat to celebrate <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover_massacre.html" title="Passover massacre">Passover</a>. How on earth can you justify those atrocities? <b>I call you to stop changing the topic by making inciting and irrelevant accusation toward Israel.</b> You have an ill custom to resolve any conflict - eveb rergarding to a technical aspect of a source - to boneheaded chant in the style of furious Arab mob. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 19:29, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The far side of Rafah is relatively intact, since the war between IDF and terrorists of Rafah in waging mainly near the border above the tunnels." What sort of logic is this? These are *people's homes*. Did the people on the south side just happen to all be terrorists, and the people on the north happen to be ordinary civilians? Do you honestly believe that? Please, answer that. Do you not care about all of the innocent people who are having their houses down without recompensation, or do you honestly believe that there was some sort of strange real-estate marketting scheme ("Oh, you're a Terrorist(TM)?

<dd>""The far side of Rafah is relatively intact, since the war between IDF and terrorists of Rafah in waging mainly near the border above the tunnels." What sort of logic is this?" The logic is simple. In the far side of Rafah, homes aren't used to hide tunnels and attack IDF forces. That' so simple. Why on the far side the houses don't conceal tunnels? Because it is too far from the border.</dd>
<dd>"or do you honestly believe that there was some sort of strange real-estate marketting scheme". I can't believe what I'm hearing. What stupid question is that? When terrorists want a house they don't buy it, they take it by force and gun-threats. What is so bizzare in the fact the terrorists are taking over building near the border, and when one building is demolished they tru to take over another building? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 19:29, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

But I don't care about you, and there's no conspiracy, no matter how much you'd like people you disagree with you to believe in one.

<dd>"There was a use in Palestinian in order to burst into house, but after the Israeli court ruled it is disallowed, it ceased almost completly.". WRONG. The Israeli supreme court refused to intervene on most of the recent cases of taking human shields, and cases of keeping families prisoner in their own homes when the homes are siezed to be snipers nests hasn't even made it to the court yet. Israeli soldiers testified in April of 2002 in the former case about how it was normal practice and was typical for it to be ordered by their commanding officers. The army said it would "clarify" its policy. Then, in August 2002, it emerged that the army had simply renamed the strategy to the "neighbor policy" after a Palestinian human shield was killed. A temporary injunction was issued against the policy; the court later postponed action on the case, and in Jan of 2003, while human shields continued to be used in the meantime, approved the renamed-again practice of "prior warning". They kept being brought back to court, as new pictures continued being taken of Palestinians held at gunpoint as human shields by the IDF, including the case of one person being strapped to a jeep's windshield to stop stones from being thrown at them as they fired at the stone throwers. Amnesty International continued to document the use of human shields the whole time, through 2003 and into 2004. <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/isr-summary-eng" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/isr-summary-eng" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Oh no Mustafaa that isn't possible, those dirty arabs aren't smart enough to make websites!!!!! They're evil cockroaches and are too stupid to use the internet! Oh wait. One of my best online friends is an Arab programmer LIVING IN A REFUGEE CAMP IN THE <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">FUCKING</a> GAZA. He has actually had his phoneline cut off, and sometimes when I talk to him over msnim he is using a secret phoneline to dial in. Sometimes he tells me about how his parents friends just got killed by the IDF, or about how he's afraid for his little brothers and little sisters but he's trying hard to keep from crying because he doesn't want them to think all hope is lost. His whole giant family lives in a tiny two-story apartment in a refugee camp. He attends university (when he can) because contrary to what you may think, MK, Arabs are not all mentally retarded. He has made it clear to me many many times that he doesn't have a problem with Jewish people, just Zionists. When I told him my mother is Jewish, he had no problem with that and he doesn't think any less of me or her. When I told him that I observe some Jewish holidays, he had no problem. He is very smart and a normal person. He has never blown himself up, which he should have already since according to you Palestinians all like to blow themselves up on busses. Nobody in his immediate family has done so either. He has never gunned down settlers or IDF soldiers. He has, however, as a child thrown rocks at Israeli soldiers. If the Israeli guards for his refugee camp were to catch him carrying a Palestinian flag, he would be taken into custody and quite possibly killed on the spot because anybody who is ever in posession of their country's flag is obviously an evil terrorist. You seriously need to shut the fuck up, MK.</dd>

<dd>To whoever locked this thread: Note that MathKnight has denigrated to referring to his opponents as "skinhead racists". This is a person who responded to me, "Of course you'll again blame me in Zionist consiperacy as you always do. The rest of your allegation are irrelevant to the matter and are twisted in a Bolshevik kind of a way". He's had, now, four different people tell him that his quote shouldn't be used as it stands. His method to defend his point is almost exclusively <a href="http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~heycock/proof.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~heycock/proof.html" rel="nofollow">Proof by Vehement Assertion</a>. I suggest that the forum consider the issue closed and the thread be unlocked; the quote-of-a-quote-of-a-quote translated two ways by a heavily biased unaccountable organization (a pro-Israel think tank), flatly contradicted by essentially every other source and at best an extreme-minority's opinion, should not be there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Terrorist organisations</span></h2>
<p>It not NPOV to refer to Palestian militant groups as "terrorist organisations", even if groups have been known to target civilians. The IDF (and Jewish settler paramilitaries) is not described as a terrorist organisation in this article, even though they have killed more civilians than Palestinian militants have. Under international law armed resistance to foreign occupation, includig guerria warfare, is legal. Also, to be NPOV only attacks on civilians should be described as terrorist attacks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The U.S. and other governments refer to them as "terrorist organizations" precisely because the deliberately target civilians, which the IDF does not do, even though the IDF has killed about 30% more civilians than the Palestinian groups have. And it is not clear that there are any "Jewish settler paramilitaries" currently active in the territories, because the only known one had its members arrested and jailed by the Israeli government. Regarding armed resistance, because the territories are disputed, and Israel has a legitimate claim, the actions of the terrorist organizations are not covered under "resistance to foreign occupation"; in any event, international law does not sanction deliberate targetting of civilians under any circumstances. That said, I've left in your changes of "terrorist" to "militant".

<dd>I suggest you set up the facts before applying Newspeak here. Mudrder is a deliberate killing, in non of the cases above you can prove that there was an intention to kill an innocent people (Iman Hams was mistakenly thought to be a bomb-layer after traveling in a restricted area and Durrah was shot by Palestinians).</dd>
<dd>As for the <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a> of the soldier in Ramallah, their muderder is described as lynched by almost every civilizied source who reported on that, including the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a> (a pretty pro-Palestinian source) who writes:
<blockquote>
<p>In video footage that will remain etched on memories for a long time to come, Israeli TV broadcast the <b>lynching</b> of Israeli soldiers by a furious Palestinian mob in the West Bank town of Ramallah.</p>
</blockquote>
and you can find a detailed account inside <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, of how Palestinian mob stabbed them to death and mutilated their bodies. It was not just a killing - a bullet in the head or a bomb - but a lynch where a brutal mob slaughtered and mutilated a person by daggers, stone and their bare hands. Therefore, "<a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a>" is the NPOV term.</dd>
<dd>Since you come from a society where such acts are considered as an all-family entertainment (I have pictures of Palestinian children taking part in a lynch of another Palestinian) you don't understand why it is considered by Western as a brutal, gruesome, cruel and inhuman act which sparks anger and harsh condamnation. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 06:36, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting. The first article claims that they were "disguised as Palestinians and reportedly carrying explosives, sub-machine-guns and guns with silencers", yet the third (CNN) says that Palestinians state they were "in civilian clothes and driving a civilian car". The sources disagree, and obviously, as with everything involving Israel, there is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> involved here.

As for "lynched" and "murdered", I'd like to first understand if you dispute the accuracy of those terms, before we move on to whether or not they should be used in the article. The definition of "lynch" is " To execute without due process of law, especially to hang, as by a mob" and of "murder" is "The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice"; is there any dispute this happened? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 18:18, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Palestinians dress as "civilians". Israeli soldiers in civilian clothes in Palestinian cities under israeli military occupation are disguised as civilian Palestinians. Perhaps Israel's history of sending assassins dressed in civilian clothes into palestinian areas to kill Palestinians has something to do with this perception. But really, tell us more about your primitive ideas of ethnic dress. Jews wear Levis, Palestinians wear burnooses? 2. Lynching and murder are POV terms. The soldiers/assassins were killed. Why do you dispute that Palestinian children are murdered by Israeli soldiers but accept that Israeli soldiers are murdered by Palestinians? Because of your pro-Israeli POV. 3. You defend POV edits. Your troll-like tactic of Slothful induction is noted yet again. 4. Consisttency is good. Why don't you practice it? 5. Palestinians generally do not engage in <i><a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbara.html" title="Hasbara">hasbara</a></i>, pro-Israeli propaganda. You do. Who else is supposed to perceive Israeli attempts at assassination of Palestinians but Palestinians? The Chinese? It is the Israeli government's assertion that the reservists were lost. At first, the Israeli government admitted that they were assassins. The world will never know considering that Israelis regularly lie and manipulate every event. Hence the need for hasbara.

<p>Overall, the term is <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a> and not a mere killing. When just writing "two reservists killed" one might think that they were killed during a gunfight, which is clearly not the case. The term lynch is used even by BBC to describe the act of a mob beating them to death and mutilating the bodies (an act of lynch by all definition). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 06:36, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Killed is the term used in all other articles describing Palestinians murdered by Israelis. It is imbalanced and POV to describe Israelis as murdered but Palestinians as killed. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 13:30, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You could answer in the already existing discussion. Lynching is a POV term, since what the mob have done is perfectly matches the definition of a lynch, a specially when they also mutilated the bodies. There is no other name to that and just writing "Two Israeli reservists were killed" is actually covering the truth about what happened there. Now, tell me honestly, if you would in a middle of an article a line saying "Two Israeli reservists were killed" - wouldn't you claim that this event has no encyclopedic importance? The special thing about the Ramallah lynch, and what made it well known is the fact it documented a "Lynch mob's brutal attack" (BBC description, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>) and not just a mere gunfight killing. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 21:37, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about the shooting of little Palestinian girls and boys on their way to school or in their classrooms or in their homes? Why don't Wikipedia's Zionists describe that as a murder, war crimes, or atrocities? Because when the victims are Arab, your attitude is different than when the victims are Jewish. NPOV demands that these killings be described in a neutral way. See <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al_Durrah_8f28.html" title="Muhammad al Durrah">Muhammad al Durrah</a> and Ghadeer Mkheemer to see how Zionists have NPOVed the descriptions of those atrocities. The killing of the Israeli soldiers should be described in similar neutral terms with full discussion of the conspiracy theories that they were captured assassins. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 00:13, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why not just accuse me of anti-semitism? Why can't you answer the question? The disparate descriptions reflect pro-Israeli bias. It is not NPOV to claim that Israelis are subjected to lynchings but when Palestinians are murdered, it is always disputed as "justified" or "accidental" or "maybe the Palestinians faked their own deaths!" This isn't a neutral description. It uses loaded terms to elicit an emotional response and is purely a Zionist POV. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 04:45, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I answered your question. The Israeli soldiers were captured and executed by members of an angry crowd who suspected them of being assassins. Their deaths were the inevitable result of Israeli policies of targetted assassination. This is the way people act when they have been oppressed and subjected to inhuman measures, similar to the brutality exhibited by Israelis reacting to the trauma of the Holocaust. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 05:28, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"This is the way people act when they have been oppressed and subjected to inhuman measures, similar to the brutality exhibited by Israelis reacting to the trauma of the Holocaust." You've gone too far. What the Palestinian are going though is nothing like the Holocaust - not in scale, not in essence, not in anything.

You think that the Jews suffering in the Holocaust makes the Palestinians feel like they should endure another 50 years of oppression under the Israeli military occupation because Israelis feel that the Palestinians haven't suffered as much under Shamir, Begin, and Sharon (yet) as Jews suffered under Hitler?

<blockquote>
<p>Especially fierce battles took place at the Jenin refugee camp; 32 Palestinian militants, 22 Palestinian civilians, and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the violence, and many homes and buildings were reduced to rubble. Israeli authorities prevented the international press from entering the refugee camp for several days as <b>rumors of the carnage swirled through Palestinian communities</b> (1). Allegations of widespread massacres echoed in the world press for several weeks (2), further damaging Israel's reputation in the court of world public opinion. However, <b>these allegations were later found to be exaggerated</b>. Many Israelis believe the "Jenin massacre" allegation was the first blood libel of the so-called New antisemitism. Many Palestinians believe that the IDF committed atrocities in their assault on the refugee camp. The battle of Jenin is still a sensitive issue for both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for removal of Alberuni's paragraph of Jenin are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old paragraph is good enough and NPOVed.</li>
<li>Alberuni's version is factual disaccurate.
<ol>
<li>Need rewording.</li>
<li>Echoed in word press? But who raised them? It is well documented that Palestinian official were those who raised the massacre allegations and claimed number of 500-3000.</li>
<li>A misleading term suggesting that a massacre did occure, but in small number - which is FALSE. AS both HRW, Amnesty and UN commission found: "<b>NO MASSACRE TOO PLACE in Jenin"</b>.</li>

<dd>You need to learn English and NPOV before questioning edits. "It is well documented" please provide the well documented evidence. Arutz Sheva doesn't count. Killing dozens of civilians is a massacre. I'm sorry that i have to explain it to anyone. It may not have been as large of a massacre as people feared but it was still a massacre. Please show the quotes from HRW, Amnesty and UN that say "No massacre took place". I believe it's your interpretation. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 17:05, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For instance: HRW reports that "There is strong prima facie evidence that in some of the cases documented grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, or war crimes, were committed.

<dd>MathKnight, your POV is not validated just because a gang of Zionist POV pushers revert the page on your behalf. NPOV demands that this article's bias be corrected. You are a horrendously biased Israeli partisan and you sincerely believe that your extreme POV should be laced into Wikipedia. Your English is also extremely poor. There is not much that can be done to rehabilitate you or educate you but I will show you the evidence as if you are a good faith editor and will be reasonable when faced with facts (even though I know better).</dd>
<dd>You are correct that the HRW report found "no evidence to sustain claims of massacres" but that is not the same as saying that "no massacre occurred" as you are inserting in the article. "Human Rights Watch’s research demonstrates that, during their incursion into the Jenin refugee camp, <b>Israeli forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, some amounting prima facie to war crimes.</b> Human Rights Watch found no evidence to sustain claims of massacres or large-scale extrajudicial executions by the IDF in Jenin refugee camp. <b>However, many of the civilian deaths documented by Human Rights Watch amounted to unlawful or willful killings by the IDF.</b> Many others could have been avoided if the IDF had taken proper precautions to protect civilian life during its military operation, as required by international humanitarian law. ... <b>Some of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch amounted to summary executions, a clear war crime,</b> such as the shooting of Jamal al-Sabbagh on April 6."</dd>
<dd>The subsequent UN report is more explicit: "<b>Many credible sources have reported about atrocities committed in the camp and about the presence of prima facie evidence of war crimes. In addition, it is probable that a massacre and a crime against humanity might have been committed in the Jenin refugee camp</b> - a probability that was enhanced by the statements made at some point by the occupying forces about hundreds of Palestinians being killed in the camp and their reported attempts to move bodies from the camp to what they referred to as the graveyards of the enemy." <a href="http://www.un.org/peace/jenin/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/peace/jenin/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Amnesty International also documented Israel's many war crimes in Jenin, among them: "In several cases the IDF caused the deaths of Palestinians by demolishing homes while residents were still inside. IDF soldiers frequently failed to give adequate warnings before demolishing houses, refused to allow family and neighbours to warn residents, failed to offer help themselves or to call rescue units or ambulances and sometimes shot at those who tried to help. The failure to properly investigate killings in disputed circumstances and those clearly unlawful have created a climate where members of the IDF believe that they may carry out such violations of the right to life with impunity. <b>Unlawful killings violate the "right to life" laid down in Article 6 of the ICCPR. Amnesty International considers that some of these abuses of the right to life would amount to "wilful killings" and "wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health" within the meaning of Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention dealing with grave breaches of the Convention; "grave breaches" of the Geneva Convention are war crimes.</b> <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE151432002?open&amp;of=ENG-PSE" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE151432002?open&amp;of=ENG-PSE" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></dd>
<dd>You <b>falsely</b> claim that "a Palestinian official" said 500 people were massacred in Jenin. In fact, Saeb Erekat was on CNN on April 10 and what he said was that there were <b>500 Palestinian casualties throughout the West Bank caused by Operation Defensive Shield.</b> This was later confirmed by the UN and Amnesty International: "In the four months between 27 February and the end of June 2002 – the period of the two major IDF offensives and the reoccupation of the West Bank - <b>the IDF killed nearly 500 Palestinians.</b> Although many Palestinians died during armed confrontations <b>many of these IDF killings appeared to be unlawful and at least 16% of the victims, more than 70, were children.</b>" <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE151432002?open&amp;of=ENG-PSE" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE151432002?open&amp;of=ENG-PSE" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.

<p>The IDF prevented anyone from entering the refugee camp so there would be no witnesses to their atrocities and war crimes. Without independent verification of th numbers killed, it is no one's fault but Israel's if rumors of their massacres take on a life of their own. Even the Israeli military overestimated the killing. Amnesty described all of this too: "During the fighting Palestinian residents and Palestinian and foreign journalists and others outside the camp saw hundreds of missiles being fired into the houses of the camp from Apache helicopters flying sortie after sortie. The sight of the firepower being thrown at Jenin refugee camp led those who witnessed the air raids, including military experts and the media, to believe that scores, at least, of Palestinians had been killed. <b>The tight cordon round the refugee camp and the main hospital from 4-17 April meant that the outside world had no means of knowing what was going on inside the refugee camp;</b> a few journalists were able to slip into the area at risk to their lives after 13 April, but only saw a small portion of the camp, including some dead bodies before leaving. Those within the camp reachable by telephone were confined to their homes and could not tell what was happening. <b>It was in these circumstances that stories of a "massacre" spread. Even the IDF leadership appeared unclear as to how many Palestinians had died: General Ron Kitrey said on 12 April that hundreds had died in Jenin before correcting himself a few hours later saying that hundreds had died or been wounded.</b>"</p>

<dd>So you see <b>Math</b>Knight, when one or two dozen Israelis are killed, it is clearly described as a massacre in Wikipedia. When 22 Palestinian civilians are killed by the IDF in <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenin.html" title="Jenin">Jenin</a> or 42 Palestinian civilians are killed by the IDF in <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabalia.html" title="Jabalia">Jabalia</a>, you and others struggle to dismiss and discount the deaths and feel compelled to dispute that these are also massacres of innocent civilians. Why? I certainly hope it is not because you are some kind of bigot who believes that the lives of Jews/Israelis are worth more than the lives of Palestinians. Your version of reality leaves out many salient facts and manipulates the facts that you do include in order to paint the picture you would like to see rather than anything approaching the truth. My edits are NPOV. I do not include unconfirmed reports and I describe and attribute all allegations accurately. I do not try to insert my POV as if it is fact. You seem incapable of editing neutrally or accepting a neutral version because a neutral version does not absolve Israel. You yourself admitted in your last edit summary that your edits are POV, you just believe that your POV represents the truth. You should not be editing these subjects of you are unable to maintain NPOV. Also, you need to use Spellcheck. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 04:54, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me explain you something: a massacre is intentional mass killing of civilians. Since in Jabalia and Jenin there was no wanton deliberate killing of civilians (more than 50% of the deads were armed terrorists), but only civilians who were killed during battle in populated area. HRW claim that some of these deaths could be prevented and some might be "unlawful killing" but in the bottom line it rules out the Palestinian accusation about massacre. So in Jabalia, no credible newspaper called the fighting there a "massacre". I cited my sources pretty well, and as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Magazine_89f3.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a> concluded: <b>"A Time investigation concludes that there was no wanton massacre in Jenin, no deliberate slaughter of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers.

Aug 1, 2002)</a> A United Nations investigation has rejected claims that hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed in Israel's attack on the Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin. In a report released on Thursday the UN said the overall number of Palestinians killed was 52 - around half of whom may have been civilians - while Israel lost 23 soldiers there. Of particular concern is the use, by combatants on both sides, of violence that placed civilians in harm's way. The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, said the report's aim of finding out exactly what happened in Jenin had been blocked by Israel's decision to refuse access to UN investigators. A Palestinian official has rejected the UN's conclusions, insisting that a massacre took place. The Israeli Foreign Ministry has welcomed the findings, saying the report "clears up misconceptions" about events in Jenin. Israeli troops attacked Jenin on 3 April, days after launching a wide-scale offensive on the West Bank following a wave of suicide bombings in Israel, which it alleges were planned in the camp. The BBC's Greg Barrow at the UN says the report offers few conclusions and merely reports allegations that have already been made.</p>

<p>Describing the killing of Israelis as "brutal" is POV. Is the killing of Palestinians ever described as "butal"? It seems not to be despite the fact that 1000s more palestinians are killed than Israelis. Who claims that the killing of Israeli soldiers were brutal? Some people might claim that the killings were appropriately harsh or not brutal enough.

<p>"At the same time, Netanyahu continued the policy of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_settlement.html" title="Israeli settlement">settlement</a> construction which Palestinians viewed as a violation of the Oslo agreement, <b>though this was nowhere outlined in the agreement itself</b>" The point is not whether this was in the Oslo agreement, it was intentionally deferred because Rabin refused to agree to limit Jewish settlement construction. The point is that Palestinians viewed continued settlement construction as a violation of the Oslo agreement. The Palestinians agreed to allow Israeli military protection to all <b>existing</b> settlements and to settlers and Israelis traveling in PA territory. Palestinians felt violated when Netanyahu and Sharon stepped up settlement construction to "create facts on the ground" ahead of a final agreement on the issue. The way MathKnight and the other Wikipedia Israelis/Zionists write this line, they try to push their POV, argue the case for Israel, and make it seem that objectively, the Palestinian concerns were illegitimate. "though this was nowhere outlined in the agreement!" as if "How dare those unreasonable Palestinians expect good faith restraint after signing an agreement with Israelis who don't care if the cancer of settlement construction in Palestinian territory subverts the peace process?

<dd>As a neutral 3rd party here is my take: factually, the killing of the 2 Isreali reservists could be described as a "lynching". The use of this term by itself would not necessarily demonstrate a POV-bias in my opinion, as the actions of the Palestinian mob pretty well fit the definition of a lynching. However, the entire paragraph describing the "lynching" almost certainly does exhibit a POV-bias, as it describes in greusome detail the brutality of the killing. Sure, the description may be factually accurate, but it comes accross as gratuitous in the context of the larger article. To then call it a lynching on top of that is simply redundant. Here is my proposed compromise: Either remove the explicit description of the killing and simply say they were lynched by the mob, or keep the description and remove the clause describing it as a lynching. I think that would at least reduce the percieved POV-bias as well as the redundancy. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 23:18, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise suggestions</span></h2>
<p>I believe that there is an element of truth to both arguments in this debate. 1) There does seem to be some POV bias in the way the killing of the 2 Israelis is described. 2) The term "lynching", however, is not innaccurate in this instance (although perhaps redundant). In an effort to reach a compromise between the 2 entrenched parties, I offer 2 alternate versions of the sentences in question. The first version uses the term lynching but removes the gratuitous description of the killing. The second version retains the description of the killing (edited down a bit for brevity) and removes the redundant lynching description. Either of these versions should be sufficiently NPOV to resolve this dispute, IMO. It will require a willingness to compromise by both parties however. As to the POV-bias in articles describing the killing of Palestinians, I would suggest bringing those concerns up in those articles rather than here. Since there is no unified editorial voice in Wikipedia, you'll have to challenge them one at a time. Complaining of a systematic policy of bias won't accomplish anything here. Anyway, here are my two compromise proposals. Feel free to comment...</p>
<p>An agitated Palestinian mob stormed the police station and lynched the two soldiers. The killings were captured on video and broadcast on TV, outraging Israeli public opinion.</p>
<p>An agitated Palestinian mob stormed the police station, beat the soldiers to death, and threw their mutilated bodies into the street. The killings were captured on video and broadcast on TV, outraging Israeli public opinion.</p>
<p>These versions explain the events without either whitewashing the brutality of the killings or being unnecessarily gratuitous or belaboring. Whether the word "lynch" is used specifically seems irrelevent to me.</p>
<p>Here is the current version of the passage for reference:</p>
<p>An agitated Palestinian mob stormed the police station, beat the soldiers to death, threw them out the window, stabbed them, dragged them on the road and mutilated their bodies. The killings, described as a lynching by international press, were captured on video and broadcast on TV, outraging Israeli public opinion.</p>

<dd>Amnesty International and the BBC (among others) described the killings as "lynchings" <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/aidoc/ai.nsf/afec99eadc40eff880256e8f0060197c/64f59dc0b44c5fef80256aff0058b1b8/$FILE/ch3.pdf" class="external text" title="http://web.amnesty.org/aidoc/ai.nsf/afec99eadc40eff880256e8f0060197c/64f59dc0b44c5fef80256aff0058b1b8/$FILE/ch3.pdf" rel="nofollow">Amnesty</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/969778.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:59, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think his point is that calling them a lynching and then describing the act is redundant. Judge 'em as a lynching, which is abhorrent in and of itself, or describe the act. That's all I think he's saying, and not that calling the actions a lynching is unwarranted. (Side note: Jayjg, I tried to fixed your links. They weren't turning into links properly. The Amnesty one still doesn't. As a newb, if I've overstepped my bounds, I am sorry). <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFive_c4cf.html" title="User:Five">Five</a> 06:40, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, in an attempt to provide a compromise, my version left out the contested word "lynching" altogether, and instead simply described the actions, leaving it to the reader to decide if it was lynching, or a justified and reasonable killing (as Alberuni has posited). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:53, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term "<a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a>" is a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_term.html" title="Loaded term">loaded term</a>. It is used to label a particular killing as <b>unjustified</b>. It thus takes a moral position.</p>
<p>Wikipedia articles do not take moral positions, for one very important reason: that is, none of us contributors can agree on moral issues; and the battles over WHICH MORAL POSITION any given article should take would be endless.</p>
<p>It's so much easier, therefore, to say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>two reservists were killed by Arabs in the wake of blah, blah, blah.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to add commentary to this, I suggest we QUOTE SOMEBODY OTHER THEN OUR OWN SELVES. Like,</p>
<ul>
<li>the Jerusalem post called the killings "the worst lynching since the 1930s in the US";</li>
<li>the Palestine News-Free Press praised the killings as "the right lynching at the right time".</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't get all hung up on whet TERMS to use, when describing a killing. Was it murder? Was it "extra-judicial"? Forget interpretations, because you are not writing an editorial for your hometown newspaper; you are writing an encyclopedia article which transcends time and place.</p>
<p>Stick to the undisputed facts. The men entered the area. They died there. (We all agree on this) Somebody killed them (i.e., it wasn't an accident). The killers were "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Arab_c9fa.html" title="Palestinian Arab">Palestinian Arabs</a>. (If we agree on the identity of the killers, fine. If not, we describe the dispute as "X says the killers were Arabs, while Y says the killers were Israelis or Chechnyans or Little Green Men from Mars").</p>
<p>Try to focus FIRST on the parts we can all agree on, would you, please? As a favor to me? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--user:Ed Poor</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 15:49, Nov 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ed, the article doesn't use the word lynching, it hasn't since I took it out a week or two ago. Have you read the current version? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:10, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
