<p>I am very disappointed that WikiPedia administrators are letting people like <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMuslim_sunni_8e6c.html" title="User:Muslim sunni">Muslim_sunni</a> to abuse 3Rvv rule, to twist WikiPedia rules and regulations to his own benefit and to let him roam / lurk around the WikiPedia Islam-related pages to insert hidden links to his group's web-sites that his group can pursue their agenda of seeking legitimacy and recruitment under the guise of mainstream Sunnis - though - they DELIBRATELY deny the TOTALITY of the Quran.</p>
<p>Anybody with a little bit common sense can see that <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMuslim_sunni_8e6c.html" title="User:Muslim sunni">Muslim_sunni</a> is trying to TRICK / BY-PASS 3rvv rule by creating new ids like <a href="../../../a/i/y/User%7EAiysha_59c3.html" title="User:Aiysha">Aiysha</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatimah_Sunnia_f786.html" title="User:Fatimah Sunnia">Fatimah Sunnia</a>. His ultimate goal is to get me banned from WikiPedia.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, it is time for WikiPedia Administrators to step-in to stop this abuse as the integrity and credibility of WikiPedia guidelines is on stake.</p>

<p><b>.etc</b></p>
<p>who are ganging-up on WikiPedia Islam-related pages to SANITIZE themselves to pursue their agenda of seeking legitimacy and recruitment under the guise of mainstream Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>Indeed, FIRST - Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's agents tried to castigate me as a "Wahabi", "non-Muslim" .etc and NOW they are trying to FRAME me and trying to manufacture a CHAOS (by creating HOSTILE environment, by manipulating 3 Rvv rule, by calling me a "Wahabi" and therefore trying to portray me as a "Terrorist" .etc) to get me banned from the WikiPedia that they could continue their on-slaught on WikiPedia Islam-realted pages with free-hand to seek legitimacy and recruitment under the guise of mainstream Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>I hope WikiPedia administrators will be able figure that conspiracy.</p>

<p>I would like to take the liberty to recapitulate the core points of content of this page as per following:</p>
<p><i>Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's Objections:</i> "an interpretation of Islam combining elements of Sunni and Shi'a theology with Sufism"<a href="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" class="external autonumber" title="http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/al-ahbash.html#back-notes-40" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>&#160;? + "anti-Salafi, and with Sufi and other beliefs seen as heretical"<a href="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/habasi_history.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/habasi_history.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>&#160;?</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> / <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s Response:</b> <i>It was an attempt to summarise and merge the descriptions at the three cited sources: their own promotional website; a critical description; and what appears to be a fairly balanced and properly-sourced paper in an academic journal. It incorporated other academic sources such as <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context</a>.</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 15:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC) + <i>Read <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. I chose those links because they represent a spread of views: one well-referenced and (as far as I can tell neutral) academic article; one from the official AICP site, which is completely uncritical of Al-Ahbash; and one fairly representative of what its critics say about it.</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 02:15, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Morever, fairly and impartially speaking, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has given AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies quite favorable POV on WikiPedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>a). by not calling them a CULT but merely a "sect"</li>
<li>b). by providing an external link to Al-Ahbash / Habashies' arch web-site and to another contrary link</li>
<li>c). by quoting their BOGUS and OXYMORONIC claim that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies advocates pluralism, and opposition to political activism and violence (There is ample material available over the internet to refute both claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>d). by quoting AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' FRADULENT slogan from their own web-site, "the resounding voice of moderation" (What kind of "the voice of moderation" is this which castigates every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs as either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign.")</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP don't appreicate the fact that if I will write that page according to my wishes, that page will NOT be somewhat NEUTRAL like the way it is NOW and same goes for them. AND I have repeatedly mentioned on this very page that - when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP leave mainstream Sunnis alone and be proud of themselves by clearly and categorically identifying / declaring themselves as "Jamat Al-Ahbash" rather than "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Alas! Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP will not do that as it will be an asthama to their strategy of seeking recruitment and legitimacy under the guise of "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah."</p>
<p>And last but not the least, lets not forget that WikiPedia is NOT a religious, AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash's or mainstream Muslims' platform. WikiPedia is an encyclopedia which aspries to follow the Neutral Point of View (NPVO). Consequently, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version meets the WikiPedia guidelines as the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP insists on their own POV. And I know they will keep coming back to modify, sanitize, recruit and / or rescue Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.</p>
<p><b>Further Reading:</b></p>
<p>You may always use major search engines like Google and Yahoo for research. You might be amazed to find out that there are SO MANY web-sites and material out there which have REFUTED all the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies CLAIMS and BELIEFS .etc by quoting and using AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' own material. This page, for which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's agents are waging their "Jihad" at - to sanitize and rescue themselves, is just, as they say, a drop in the ocean.</p>

<p>This is your only way of running , first you say that i'm the webmasters of like 20 links i think or more</p>
<p>Jibran1 answered you on this&#160;: " I would put up a warning on Muslim Sunni too, if your accusations towards him are true, however, I could not find his name listed as the webmaster at the Sunna.info website.

<p>I am a mainstream Sunni and my family is Sunni even before your "Shaikh" was ever born. As I have reiterated before that I am NOT guilty of inserting / promoting HIDDEN links to WikiPedia AND other projects' Islam-related pages to seek legitimacy and recruitment for my group. It is the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies.</p>
<p>I know very well that the agents / sympathizers of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP will continue:</p>
<ul>
<li>to make attempts to Habashanize this page and other WikiPedia / similar projects' Islam-related pages by twisting WikiPedia and others' guidelines to the maximum extent and by incorporating hidden links to wage a blatant and hegemonic smear campaign using "Islamic" sounded web-sites</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to castigate / shun / discard / ignore / discredit / "refute" any criticism / evidence by any individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which exposes the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs - as either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear / defemation compaign"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to use "politically correct" language / jargon / ebonics / verbage / semantics to their benefit and pursue their agenda and beliefs against the other party</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to purse their "divide and conquer" strategy by trying to DIMINISH / LESSEN and ultimately REMOVE the FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE (S), demonstrated / presented / preached by themselves on this very page and by practicing their hedious, vicious, contemptuous and dangerous tactics elsewhere on the web and in their material and Musallahs, between mainstream Sunnis and Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP to seek legitimacy, recruitment and hegemonic superiority of their beliefs and agenda,</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>to ignore / discredit all the INDEPENDENT, NEUTRAL and ACADEMIC sources and material which doesn't follow the tag-line of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is sad but true that WikiPedia and other projects' Islam-related pages have become an easy target / "battle-field" for these people as most of the contributors and editors of these projects don't know the FUNDAMENTAL and SUBSTANTIAL difference (s) between these groups and mainstream Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP leave mainstream Sunnis alone and be proud of themselves by clearly and categorically identifying / declaring themselves as "Jamat Al-Ahbash" rather than "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Alas! Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP will not do that as it will be an asthama to their strategy of seeking recruitment and legitimacy under the guise of "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah."</p>

<p>You may always use major search engines like Google and Yahoo for research. You might be amazed to find out that there are SO MANY web-sites and material out there which have REFUTED all the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies CLAIMS and BELIEFS .etc by quoting and using AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' own material. This page, for which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's agents are waging their "Jihad" at - to sanitize, promote and rescue themselves, is just, as they say, a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>Anybody with a little bit of commonsense and by paying attention to the "date-stamps", "contributions", "target-pages", "style", "verbage", "semantics" .etc can figure the TRUTH out that there is an ON-GOING and Constant / Complex Vandalism + Delibrate 3 Rvv Manipulation by the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP:</p>

<p>The wahhabis of saudi arabia who carried out 9/11 employ people to sit on the internet and lauch hate campaigns against people who expose their fallacies and their non-sunni views.

AICP - Association of islamic charitable projects is a Sunni organisation and its books are approved by al-Azhar which is a Sunni university in Cairo (Egypt).</p>
<p>In 1999 the president of the Azhar (Egypt) Dr Ahmad Omar Hashem visited AICP HQ in Beirut and met with Sheikh Adbullah al-Harari the spiritual guide of AICP. AICP and the Azhar signed a memorandum of collaboration. Also the Sheikh's books (e.g. as-sirat al-mustaqim and al-maqalat as-sunniya) have been signed and approved by Azhar scholars implying the Sheikh's high esteem amongst the Sunni community.</p>

At the surface, this sect seems to adhere to the Shafi`i School of Jurisprudence, and to Imam Al-Ash`ari’s School as regards creed. However, at the deep level, their main intention is to corrupt the Muslim creed and incite sedition amongst the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, they are paid agents to the enemies of Islam.</i></dd>

He worked as an editor for publishers in Lebanon and started to cooperate with the Jews and their agents in South Lebanon. He started in the seventies to spread his corrupt thoughts and to declare many scholars as non-Muslims, especially Imam Ibn Taymiyyah , Imam Muhammad `Abdul Wahhab , the Hanbalis and all those who held different views from his under the pretext that they violate the principles of Imam Al-Ash`ari or what he has understood from the texts of the Shafi`is .</i></dd>

<dd><b>Question:</b> While doing some research, I found that there was some sites saying that there are grammar changes in the Qur'an. Is this true? Thank you!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not understand what you mean. Language comes first and the grammar comes later. The Qur'an sets the standard for grammar and style, for as recognized by the highest authorities of the Arabic language from the time of its revelation, the Qur'an is unsurpassed in style and expression; it is the ultimate measure of grammar and style in the language.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, it is axiomatic among the scholars, that the Qur'an that sets the standard for Arabic grammar and style, and not the other way around.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If, therefore, some eccentric minds have 'discovered' lately that the Qur'an 'breaks the grammar rules', it is due to sickness in their minds. Their agenda definitely is to cast doubts in the minds of the people about the Inimitable Book. So take care who you learn your religion from, for as scholars have taught us: "This knowledge is religion; so you must take care who you learn it from!"</dd>

<dd>“The Holy Qur'an was presented to the people of Arabia by the Holy Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. It was presented in parts over a period of 23 years of his prophetic life. The book presents itself as the word of Allah and the Holy Prophet also presented it as such.</dd>

<dd><b>The Muslims believe that the Holy Qur'an, being the revealed word of Allah, is the cornerstone of their faith. They get their philosophy, beliefs and laws from this book it is the basic source of the Islamic faith. It is the Word of Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him, who read it out before the world loud and clear. Not only did he recite it to the people of Arabia, he also made elaborate arrangements to ensure that its contents be preserved and his Companions should learn it by heart and should also write it down. The Holy Prophet's stress on the supremacy of the Book of Allah, over all other sources of knowledge, was unequivocal and categorical.</b></dd>

<dd>The Holy Qur'an has reached us through the process of Tawatur (historical continuity and perpetuation achieved through transfer from generation-to-generation) When we say that the Qur'an has reached us through Tawatur, we imply that so many people in every generation conveyed it to the next and so on that there can be no doubt about its authenticity. It was not transmitted by a few persons in one generation to a few persons in the next. It was handed over by the entire generation to the next generation. The Generation of the Companions witnessed the revelation and compilation of the Holy Qur'an during the life of the Holy Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and then handed it over to the next generation and so on.</dd>

<dd>Its certainty has far exceeded the need for any debate. In the presence of established history, we would not accept any individual reports and rumors to the contrary. For instances a report in one of the history books that claims that Akbar the Great never ruled in India, would not be considered by us. The fact that Akbar the Great ruled over India for half a century is so established, that any odd report to the contrary would be simply ignored. So is the case of the Holy Qur'an. Since it has achieved the status of Tawatur, no odd report would affect its credibility.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When generations and generations of people without interruption hold the Qur'an as the one and only version of the divine guidance received from the Holy Prophet, such reports would not infringe upon its authenticity. The evidence for the Qur'an is so overwhelming, involving millions of people, that it would simply override any odd reports that may be found anywhere.”</dd>

<dd>In the light of the above, dear brother, it’s clear that all what non-Muslims say or fabricate against the Glorious Qur’an is totally groundless, for the authenticity of the Qur’an is not only upheld by Muslims but confirmed by non-Muslims as well, as will be clarified in the following:</dd>

<dd>“Attesting to the Qur'an’s authenticity, in his best-seller book <i><b>The Bible, The Qur’an and Science</b></i> the French researcher, historian, scientist Dr. Maurice Bucaille writes:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>"Thanks to its undisputed authenticity, the text of the Qur’an holds a UNIQUE Place among the books of Revelation, shared neither by the Old nor the New Testament. In the first two sections of this work (meaning his book), a review was made of the alterations undergone by the Old Testament and the Gospels before they were handed down to us in the form we know today. The same is not true for the Qur’an for the simple reason it was written down at the time of the Prophet; we shall see how it came to be written, i.e. the process involved . . .. As the Revelation progressed, the Prophet and the believers following him recited the text by heart, and it was written down by the scribes in his following. It therefore starts off with two elements of authenticity that the Gospels do not possess."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Professor Hitte also writes: "Biblical text has been subjected to editorial and amendatory treatment, but not the Qur’anic ... In its phonetic and graphic reproduction, as well as in its linguistic form, the Qur’anic text is identical with its celestial original. "</dd>

<dd><b>The Qur’an is unique in consistency, harmony, intelligence and rationality:</b></dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Qur’an is the book without inconsistencies; one part of its text, (or doctrine) does not clash with the other. In fact, it sets the absence of contradiction, irrationality, and incoherence, as one of the criteria for checking the authenticity of any divine revelation. It states "Do they not ponder the Qur’an (with care)? Had this book been from anybody but Allah, you would have found much inconsistencies.” (Surat An-Nisa:82).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because contradictions and inconsistencies call for the negation of one part, which is in conflict with the other and this automatically invalidates portions of the book. In turn that makes it difficult for a man to remain true to any one value, thereby creating mental conflict, emotional and spiritual instability. "Skip some, follow some," “pick and choose" and "no absolutes" become the pattern. And these exercise an extremely damaging influence upon a truth-conscious, rational man with regard to belief in Allah and with regard to the credibility of the book itself. And it leads to dilemmas where sincere minds become "disjointed" and "disenchanted," eventually steering them away from the book or turn them into hypocrites.</dd>

<dd>Dr. Maurice Bucaille, who had absolutely no reason to favor one book, especially that of Islam, over the others (if anything, as human nature is, he would only favor the books of his own religion, but not the Qur’an) attests to the Qura’nic claim in his book. "The Quran ... is not only free from contradictions in its narrations, the sign of various human manipulations to be found in the Gospels, but provides a quality of its own for those who examine it objectively and in the light of science i.e. its complete agreement with modern scientific data.”</dd>

<dd>The Book may be great but what is its impact on the people, you might ask. If no impact it has any significance. How true! The Qur’an is unique in terms of its Blitzing Impact, also.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There have been many other religious books and revelations before the Qur’an. But of these, only the Holy Qur’an had the most electrifying impact upon the people. Its lightning-like rapidity, in a short few decades, reached the hearts and minds of the masses of several continents, transforming the lives of idolaters, alcoholics, exploiters, abusers, perverts, into men and women of pristine monotheism, of highest virtue and piety. Call it what you may - the most sensational spiritual revolution, or the spiritual blitzkrieg, the revolution of which the mankind had never witnessed before. To this very day, no other religion comes even close to matching Qur’an's record of the spectacular impact on lives of masses.”</dd>

<p>Morever, fairly and impartially speaking, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has given AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies quite favorable POV on WikiPedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>a). by not calling them a CULT but merely a "sect"</li>
<li>b). by providing an external link to Al-Ahbash / Habashies' arch web-site and to another contrary link</li>
<li>c). by quoting their BOGUS and OXYMORONIC claim that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies advocates pluralism, and opposition to political activism and violence (There is ample material available over the internet to refute both claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>d). by quoting AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' FRADULENT slogan from their own web-site, "the resounding voice of moderation" (What kind of "the voice of moderation" is this which castigates every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs as either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign.")</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP don't appreicate the fact that if I will write that page according to my wishes, that page will NOT be somewhat NEUTRAL like the way it is NOW and same goes for them. AND I have repeatedly mentioned on this very page that - when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP leave mainstream Sunnis alone and be proud of themselves by clearly and categorically identifying / declaring themselves as "Jamat Al-Ahbash" rather than "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Alas! Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP will not do that as it will be an asthama to their strategy of seeking recruitment and legitimacy under the guise of "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah."</p>
<p>And last but not the least, lets not forget that WikiPedia is NOT a religious, AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash's or mainstream Muslims' platform. WikiPedia is an encyclopedia which aspries to follow the Neutral Point of View (NPVO). Consequently, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version meets the WikiPedia guidelines as the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP insists on their own POV.

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>During the reign of Sultan Salim III (1204-1222 AH) many tribulations took place. One was the tribulation of the Wahhabiyyah which started in the area of al-Hijaz{1} where they captured al-Haramayn{2}, and prevented Muslims coming from ash-Sham{3} and Egypt from reaching their destination to perform Pilgrimage (Hajj). Another tribulation is that of the French who controlled Egypt from 1213 A.H. until 1216 A.H. Let us here speak briefly about the two adversities{4}, because each was mentioned in detail in the books of history and in separate treatises.</p>
<p><br />
Background On The Tribulations Of The Wahhabis</p>
<p>The fighting started between the Wahhabis and the Prince of Makkah, Mawlana Sharif Ghalib Ibn Bu Sa^id, who had been appointed by the honored Muslim Sultan as his ruling representative over the areas of al-Hijaz. This was in 1205 AH during the time of Sultan Salim III, the son of Sultan Mustafa III, the son of Ahmad. Previous to the outbreak of fighting, the Wahhabis began to build power and gain followers in their areas. As their territories expanded, their evil and harm increased They killed countless numbers of Muslims, legitimated confiscating their money and possessions, and captured their women. The founder of their wicked doctrine was Muhammad Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab, who originated from eastern Arabia, from the tribe of Banu Tamim. He lived a long life, about one-hundred years. He was born in 1111 AH and died in 1200 AH. His history was narrated as follows:</p>
<p>Muhammad Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab started as a student of knowledge in the city of the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam: al-Madinah al-Munawwarah. Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab’s father was a good, pious man among the people of knowledge as was his brother, Shaykh Sulayman. His father, his brother, and his shaykhs (teachers of religion) had the foresight Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab would innovate a great deal of deviation and misguidance, because of their observance of his sayings, actions, and inclinations concerning many issues. They used to reprimand him and warn people against him.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Some Of The Beliefs Of Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab</p>
<p>What Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab’s father, brother, and shaykhs speculated about him came true--by the Will of Allah, ta^ala. Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab innovated deviant and misleading ways and beliefs and managed to allure some ignorant people to follow him. His deviant and misleading ways and beliefs disagreed with the sayings of the scholars of the Religion. His deviant beliefs led him to label the believers as blasphemers! He falsely claimed visiting the grave of the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, and performing the tawassul{5} by him as shirk{6}. Additionally, he falsely claimed visiting the graves of other prophets and righteous Muslims (awliya’) and performing tawassul by them was shirk as well. He added to this by saying, "To call upon the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, when performing tawassul by the Prophet is shirk." He passed the same judgment of shirk on the ones who call upon other prophets and righteous Muslims (awliya’) in performing tawassul by them.</p>
<p>In an effort to give credibility to his innovations Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab embellished his sayings by quotations which he selected from Islamic sources, i.e., quotations which are used as proofs for many issues but not the issues which Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab was attempting to support. He brought false statements and tried to beautify them for the laymen until they followed him. He wrote treatises for them until they believed that most of the People of Tawhid{7} were blasphemers.</p>
<p>Alliance With The Su^udiyy Family</p>
<p>Moreover, Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab called upon the princes of eastern Arabia and the people of ad-Dar^iyyah{8} to support him. They carried his doctrine and made this endeavor a means to strengthen and expand their kingdom. They worked together to suppress the Bedouins of the deserts until they overcame them and those Bedouins followed them and became foot-soldiers for them without pay. After that, these masses started to believe that whoever does not believe in what Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab said is a blasphemer, and it is Islamically lawful (halal) to shed his blood and plunder his money.</p>
<p>The matter of Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab started to evidence itself in 1143 A.H. and began spreading after 1150 A.H. Subsequently, the scholars--even his brother, Shaykh Sulayman and the rest of his shaykhs-- authored many treatises to refute him. But Muhammad Ibn Su^ud, the Prince of ad-Dar^iyyah in eastern Arabia, supported him and worked to spread his ideology. Ibn Su^ud was from Banu Hanifah, the people of Musaylimah al-Kadhdhab{9}. When Muhammad Ibn Su^ud died, his son ^Abdul-^Aziz Ibn Muhammad Ibn Su^ud took over the responsibility of fulfilling the vile task of spreading the Wahhabi beliefs.</p>
<p>Many of the shaykhs of Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab in al-Madinah used to say, "He will be misguided, and he will misguide those for whom Allah willed the misguidance." Things took place as per the speculation of the scholars. Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab claimed his intention behind the madhhab he invented was "to purify the tawhid" and "repudiate the shirk." He also claimed people had been following the shirk for six-hundred years and he revived their Religion for them!!</p>
<p><br />
The Methodology Of Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab</p>
<p>Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab took the verses revealed to speak about the blasphemers and applied them to the Muslims. The following examples from the Qur’an illustrate this point. Allah, ta^ala, said in Surat al-Ahqaf, Ayah 5:</p>
<p>This verse means: [Who is more astray than the one who performs supplication (du^a’) to [worship] other than Allah; the one other than Allah he supplicates to will not answer his du^a’.] Allah, ta^ala said in Surat Yunus, Ayah 106&#160;:</p>
<p>This verse means: [Do not perform supplication (du^a’) to [worship] other than Allah; the one other than Allah you supplicate to will not benefit you and will not harm you.]</p>
<p>The verses in the Qur’an similar to these ones are numerous. Muhammad Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab gravely misinterpreted the previously cited verses and said: "The Muslim who asks help from the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, other prophets, or the righteous people (salihun), or who calls or asks any of them for intercession is like those blasphemers mentioned in the Qur’an." According to the false claim of Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab, the Muslims who do these things are blasphemers.</p>
<p>He also considered visiting the grave of Prophet Muhammad and the graves of other prophets and righteous Muslims for blessings as blasphemy. Allah revealed Ayah 3 of Surat az-Zumar in reference to the mushrikun:</p>
<p>This verse means: [Those who worship the idols said: "We do not worship them except to achieve a higher status from Allah."]</p>
<p>Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab falsely stated: "Those who perform tawassul (asking Allah by the prophets, for example) are similar to those blasphemers mentioned in Surat az-Zumar, Ayah 3, who claim they do not worship the idols except to achieve a higher status from Allah." He said: "The blasphemers did not believe the idols create anything; they believed Allah is the Creator." He gave his version of proof from the Qur’an by citing Surat Luqman, Ayah 25 and Surat az-Zumar, Ayah 38, in which Allah said:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>These verses mean: [If you ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and earth?’ They will say, ‘Allah’.]</p>
<p>In Surat az-Zukhruf, Ayah 87, Allah said:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Which means: [If you ask them, ‘Who created them?’ They will say, ‘Allah’.] Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab falsely concluded from these verses that the Muslims who perform tawassul are similar to those blasphemers.</p>
<p><br />
The Scholars Refute Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab</p>
<p>In their writings to refute Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab's sayings, the scholars said his deduction was false. The believers did not consider the prophets or the awliya’ as gods and they did not deem them partners to Allah. Instead, they correctly believe the prophets and awliya’ are good slaves and creations of Allah, and they do not deserve to be worshipped.</p>
<p>The blasphemers intended in these verses believed their idols deserved Godhood. They exalted them as one would exalt his Creator, even though they believed the idols did not create the heavens and the earth. The believers, on the other hand, do not believe the prophets or righteous Muslims (awliya’) deserve to be worshipped, nor do they deserve to be attributed with Godhood, nor do they exalt them as one would exalt God. They believe these people are good slaves of Allah, His beloved ones whom He chose, and by their blessings (barakah) Allah grants His mercy to His creation. Hence, when the slaves of Allah seek the blessings (barakah) of the prophets and righteous Muslims (awliya’) they are seeking these blessings as a mercy from Allah.</p>
<p>There are many proofs and examples from the Qur’an and Sunnah about this basic belief of the Muslims. Muslims believe Allah is the Creator, the One Who grants benefit and inflicts harm, and the only One Who deserves to be worshipped. Muslims believe that no one other than Allah has the power to affect the creation. The prophets and righteous people do not create anything. They do not possess the power to bestow benefit or inflict harm on others, but Allah is the One Who bestows the mercy upon the slaves by the righteous Muslims’ blessings.</p>
<p>Hence, the belief of the blasphemers, i.e., the belief their idols deserve to be worshipped and have Godhood, is what makes them fall into blasphemy. This saying of the blasphemers, as previously cited in Surat az-Zumar, Ayah 3, was said in an effort to justify their belief when they were disproved and shown idols do not deserve to be worshipped.</p>
<p>How can Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab and those who follow him find it permissible to equate the believers, who believed in tawhid, to those blasphemers, who believed in the Godhood of the idols? All the previously cited verses and the verses which are similar to them are specific to the blasphemers who associate partners with Allah--none of the believers are included. Al-Bukhariyy narrated by the route of Ibn ^Umar, may Allah raise their ranks, that the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, described the Khawarij as those who took the verses revealed about the blasphemers and attributed them to the believers! In the narration by the route of Ibn ^Umar the Prophet said:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt;What I fear most for my nation is a man who mis-explains the Qur’an and takes it out of context.&gt;&gt; This hadith and the previous one apply very well to the Wahhabis.</p>
<p><br />
Proofs For Tawassul The Permissibility of Asking Allah for Things by Some of His Creation</p>
<p>If performing tawassul had been blasphemy, then the believers, i.e., the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, his Companions, and the Salaf and Khalaf of this nation would not have done it. Yet it is mentioned in the sahih hadith of the Prophet that the Prophet used to ask Allah by saying:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt;O Allah, I ask You by the status of those who ask You.{10} &gt;&gt; Without doubt, this is tawassul. The Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, used to teach this supplication (du^a') to his Companions and order them to say it. This issue was expounded upon in different books and treatises refuting Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab.</p>
<p>There is a hadith related by al-Hakim that mentions after Adam ate from the tree, he performed tawassul by our Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam. He did that, because he saw the name of the Prophet written on the ^Arsh, Adam said: &lt;&lt;O Allah, by the dignity of this son [Muhammad], forgive this father [Adam].&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It was also related by Ibn Hibban, that upon the death of Fatimah Bint Asad, may Allah raise her rank, the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, with his own honorable hands, put her in her grave and said: &lt;&lt;O Allah, forgive my mother{11}, Fatimah Bint Asad, and widen her place by the status of Your Prophet and the prophets who came before me. You are the most Merciful.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>There is a hadith classified as sahih{12}, that a blind man asked the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, to make a supplication (du^a') to Allah to return his sight. The Prophet ordered him to make ablution (wudu’) and pray two rak^ahs and then say:</p>
<p>"O Allah, I ask You and direct myself to You by Your Prophet, Muhammad, the Prophet of Mercy. O Muhammad, I ask Allah by you to fulfill my need. O Allah, enable him to intercede for me."</p>
<p>The blind man did what the Prophet taught him to do{13} and Allah brought his sight back. Moreover, as related by at-Tabaraniyy, the tawassul made by the blind man was used by the Companions and Salaf after the death of the Prophet.</p>
<p>^Umar Ibn al-Khattab performed the tawassul by al-^Abbas (the uncle of the Prophet), may Allah reward their deeds, when he prayed the Salah of ’Istisqa’{14} with the people. There are other proofs mentioned in the books of the Islamic scholars but we will not recount them at length here.</p>
<p>The one who pursues the saying of the Companions and their followers will find a great deal of proof about the validity of calling the prophet by saying "O Muhammad" in his presence as well as in his absence and in his life as well as after his death. In fact, many texts include the phrase which means, "O Muhammad". Calling the name of the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, is permissible. An example is the saying of the Companion, Bilal Ibn al-Harith, may Allah reward his deeds, when he went to the grave of the Prophet. He said: "O Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to send rain to your Nation." His saying contains this format{15}.</p>
<p>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Sulayman al-Kurdiyy{16} was among the authors who wrote refuting Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab. He was Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab’s own shaykh. Among what he said is as follows:</p>
<p>O Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab, I advise you, for the sake of Allah, ta^ala, to hold your tongue regarding the Muslims. If you hear from anyone who asks for help from other than Allah that one has the power to effect things without the Will of Allah, then teach him the right thing about this issue, and show him the proofs which state no one other than Allah brings things from non-existence into existence. The one who rejects that is blasphemous. You have no right to label the majority of the Muslims as blasphemers{17} while you are deviant from the majority of the Muslims. In fact, it is more reasonable to consider the one who deviates from the majority of the Muslims as a blasphemer then to consider the Muslims as a nation as blasphemers--because the deviant one has followed a path other than the path of the believers. In Surat an-Nisa’, Ayah 15, Allah said:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This ayah means: [Whomever contends with the Messenger after the right path was exposed to him and follows other than the way of the believers, Allah will leave him to whatever he followed and put him in Hell (Jahannam)].</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The Permissibility Of Visiting The Grave Of The Prophet</p>
<p>Visiting the grave of the Prophet, sallallahu ^alayhi wa sallam, was performed by the Companions and the Salaf and Khalaf who came after them. Many hadiths cite the benefit of this deed and the scholars of Islam have written books about this matter{18}.</p>
<p><br />
Calling On Someone Other Than Allah</p>
<p>Among of what was mentioned concerning calling on someone other than Allah, whether that one is present, absent, dead or alive, is the saying of the Prophet:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt;If the animal of anyone of you went out of control in the wilderness, then call: ‘O slaves of Allah, help me’&gt;&gt;, since there are slaves of Allah [i.e. the angels] who will respond to him.</p>
<p>There is another hadith related by al-Bazzar in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt; If one of you lost something or needs help while in an open land, then let him say: "O slaves of Allah, help me."&gt;&gt; Another narration says:</p>
<p>which means &lt;&lt;Rescue me, because Allah has created slaves whom you do not see.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When traveling at nightfall the Prophet, sallallahu ^alyhi wa sallam, used to say:</p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt; O earth, my Lord and your Lord is Allah.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When the Prophet visited the grave of Muslims, he used to say:</p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt; O people of the graves, peace be upon you.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>In the Tashahhud in as-Salah the Muslim says:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>which means: &lt;&lt; "O Prophet of Allah, may Allah protect you from infirmities, and have mercy and blessings on you."&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>There is no harm in calling on and performing tawassul by someone unless one believes that someone other than Allah actually creates things. Hence, as long as one believes that only Allah creates them, there is no harm in performing tawassul. Likewise, attributing a certain doing to other than Allah does not harm unless one believes this doer actually creates. So once it is established the person does not believe the creating is for other than Allah then attributing a doing to other than Allah is understood in its proper context. When one says: "This medicine benefited me," or "This particular righteous Muslim benefited me," he is merely exposing the created reason of the benefit. These statements are also similar to when one says: "This food satisfied my hunger," or "This water quenched my thirst," or "This medicine cured me." When Muslims say such statements, they understand them in their proper context, i.e., food, water, and medicine are only reasons, and Allah is the Creator of their benefit.</p>
<p>The general proofs mentioned in this summary are enough to refute Ibn ^Abdul-Wahhab. The scholars of Islam have expounded on this issue in several treatises.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> / <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s Response:</b> <i>It was an attempt to summarise and merge the descriptions at the three cited sources: their own promotional website; a critical description; and what appears to be a fairly balanced and properly-sourced paper in an academic journal. It incorporated other academic sources such as <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_15/Review_15-50.pdf" rel="nofollow">Internet in a Sectarian Islamic Context</a>.</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 15:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC) + <i>Read <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. I chose those links because they represent a spread of views: one well-referenced and (as far as I can tell neutral) academic article; one from the official AICP site, which is completely uncritical of Al-Ahbash; and one fairly representative of what its critics say about it.</i> <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 02:15, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Morever, fairly and impartially speaking, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> has given AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies quite favorable POV on WikiPedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>a). by not calling them a CULT but merely a "sect"</li>
<li>b). by providing an external link to Al-Ahbash / Habashies' arch web-site and to another contrary link</li>
<li>c). by quoting their BOGUS and OXYMORONIC claim that AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies advocates pluralism, and opposition to political activism and violence (There is ample material available over the internet to refute both claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>d). by quoting AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' FRADULENT slogan from their own web-site, "the resounding voice of moderation" (What kind of "the voice of moderation" is this which castigates every that individual / web-site / organization / outlet - which - expose the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies' agenda and beliefs as either "Wahabi", "Kaafir", "non-Muslim", "Islamist" or part of a "smear compaign.")</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP don't appreicate the fact that if I will write that page according to my wishes, that page will NOT be somewhat NEUTRAL like the way it is NOW and same goes for them. AND I have repeatedly mentioned on this very page that - when two parties don't see each other eye to eye then only an INDEPENDENT / NEUTRAL party can do the job.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP leave mainstream Sunnis alone and be proud of themselves by clearly and categorically identifying / declaring themselves as "Jamat Al-Ahbash" rather than "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah." Alas! Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP will not do that as it will be an asthama to their strategy of seeking recruitment and legitimacy under the guise of "Jamat Ahl Wa Sunnah."</p>
<p>And last but not the least, lets not forget that WikiPedia is NOT a religious, AICP / Habashies / Al-Ahbash's or mainstream Muslims' platform. WikiPedia is an encyclopedia which aspries to follow the Neutral Point of View (NPVO). Consequently, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a>'s version meets the WikiPedia guidelines as the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP insists on their own POV. And I know they will keep coming back to modify, sanitize, recruit and / or rescue Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP.</p>

<p>You may always use major search engines like Google and Yahoo for research. You might be amazed to find out that there are SO MANY web-sites and material out there which have REFUTED all the Al-Ahbash / AICP / Habashies CLAIMS and BELIEFS .etc by quoting and using AICP / Al-Ahbash / Habashies' own material. This page, for which Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP's agents are waging their "Jihad" at - to sanitize, promote and rescue themselves, is just, as they say, a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>Anybody with a little bit of commonsense and by paying attention to the "date-stamps", "contributions", "target-pages", "style", "verbage", "semantics" .etc can figure the TRUTH out that there is an ON-GOING and Constant / Complex Vandalism + Delibrate 3 Rvv Manipulation by the agents of Al-Ahbash / Habashies / AICP:</p>

<p>Wahhabism strategy always refered to wiping out of its way all that is not a wahhabie product, and all that is not swallowing ‎it’s aggressive and hostile way of doing things. The evidence is clear thru out the history of this wahhabie sect ‎since it was established around 250 years ago till our present days. The terrorist attacks held by the followers of ‎the wahhabie sect around the world are in evidence to their hostile attitudes and deeds towards everything that is ‎not wahhabie, as we witness it here in the deeds of the wahhabie sect follower wiping out of sight all Sunni ‎Muslims official sites. ‎ It is time for this wahhabie sect and its followers to understand that their aggression won’t be tolerated in the ‎civilized world.‎</p>
<p>Dear Admin, I'm sure that it is obvious to you that Mckhan had erased links from the 'External links' section multiple times (exactly six times in a rw uptill now) after they had been put back. Further more Mckhan is listing my name along other names on the discussion page in a very unfriendly manner requesting hard actions against us inspite the fact that he was the one to handle wikipedia in a very disorderly manner. I am hopeful that the admin would intervene to keep Mr Mckhan in line with the rules.Vandalism by mckhan&#160;:<a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKhan_037d.html" title="User:McKhan"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">McKhan</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../m/c/k/User_talk%7EMcKhan_8968.html" title="User talk:McKhan">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_McKhan_e9b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/McKhan">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_McKhan_e0d2.html" title="Special:Blockip/McKhan">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) <a href="../../../a/i/y/User%7EAiysha_59c3.html" title="User:Aiysha">Aiysha</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hope Wikipedia will remain neutral rather than bestowing legitimacy on sects</span></h2>
<p>Those who point out that Al-Ahbash deny the totality of the Qurán do not become Wahabi or something else. In Islam there is no place for following Al-Ahbash or Al-Wahab. There is no instruction in the Qurán or Sunnah even to become Shiia or Sunni. The world needs to understand the 'simple straightforward message of the Qurán and teaching of Prophet Mohammed rather than bestowing sanctity on new sects and proving them as part of Islam.</p>
<p>Hope Wikipedia will remain neutral rather than bestowing legitimacy on sects or cults that follow personalities, for which there is no place in Islam.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revealing facts about the wahhabie sect‎</span></h2>
<p>As I have pointed out in my earlier post, the wahhabie sect was established by its founder Ibn ‎‎^Abdul-Wahhab around 250 years ago in a very violent and hideous method. History ‎registers violent acts by the radical founder of the wahhabie sect and his followers ‎against everyone who did not comply to them. They would announce all who did not ‎adopt their sectarian ideology as a blasphemer and therefore the wahhabies would give ‎themselves the right to exterminate anyone whom they see on their way. Massacres and ‎despoilments were committed by this hideous wahhabie sect, they used to slaughter their ‎victims hilariously while boasting their revolting deeds just as the wahhabie sect ‎followers did and continue to do in our present days in certain areas of the world. ‎ The Aicp did warn against this wahhabie sect over a decay and continues to do so in a ‎very civilized and academic manner supporting its articles by prominent resources, ‎although it had to pay the tax of speaking out and loud against this wahhabie sect but ‎still for the sake of preserving lives the AICP continues to enlighten people and warn ‎them against this wahhabie sect and wahhabie sectarian ideology that allows its followers ‎to exterminate with all means all that and who oppose them.‎</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ahbash are just students of Shafi3iy school</span></h2>
<p>Bismillah,</p>
<p>I don't know why some are causing all of this Fitnah about the Muslims. From what I saw from the Students of the known Sheikh Abdullah alHarariy (Known as al-Habashiy, from Habasha) I swear by Allah and he is my witness, that they are people striving to learn Islam accurately and teach it precisely. They are very careful in following and imitating the school of Imam al-Shafi3iy. I have never heard them say: our sheikh said this and that, our sheikh said this and that..</p>
<p>I read few of the Ahbash books, sheikh Abdullah is a strong sheikh, and only those who learnt from good trustworthy sheikhs will know that. Why do I say that&#160;? Because when you read his books like his book in tafseer al-Tahawiyyah (for Abu Ja3far at-Tahawiy) or his book assirat al-mustaqeem, you will see how he digs and derives EVERYTHING from a previously authored and accepted material. He always derives it from the saying of scholars like bayhaqiy, nawawiy, shafiey, ibn Hajar… all the time.</p>
<p>Unless some have something against such scholars, then there’s no reason to cause fitnah and gossip about al-ahbash (unless anyone saw bad thing from his students that I did not see). But as for knowledge, the Ahbash are precise, God Fearing, careful for others and extremely humble, namely their sheikh, extremely modes.</p>
<p>Allah is all knowing.</p>
