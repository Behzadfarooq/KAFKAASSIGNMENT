<p>If this mosque is one of Islam's holiest sites, I think that a bit more about it needs to placed into the article, since it's obviously a notable topic in itself even before it was bombed - it would be a shame if its past as a holy site was to be forgotten and all the emphasis placed on it's destruction. <a href="../../../x/y/a/User%7EXYaAsehShalomX_ac1b.html" title="User:XYaAsehShalomX">XYaAsehShalomX</a> 19:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Damage, not destruction. I'd be willing to bet that within two years there will be a new dome on the mosque. Still, you are right, there needs to be more history.

<p>Claiming the attackers are Sunnis or Americans or Jews or Kurds or Iranians is baseless speculation and vandalism to put in this article.

<dd>It is consistent with the history of the insurgency that this attack was carried out by Sunnis, particularly the mostly non-Iraqi extremists who consider Shi'as as non-Moslems.

<p>I don't think Sunnis would have much to gain by bombing an islamic holy site even if it is most important to Shias. The group responsible would most likely be a third party who would want to throw Iraq into chaos, either because they want to make the Sunnis and Shias destroy each other, or to make both groups destroy the peace coalition forces have been working hard to maintain. I think Iran is pretty suspicious, how they cast the blame on America and Isrial. Their reason, "America and Isrial oppose god and justice", made no sense what so ever.</p>

<dd>While discussion is fine, speculation, as <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> pointed out, would be vandalism (because it goes against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">KI</a> 21:59, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I can infer that it was most likely neither sunni nor shia responcible for the attack because if the attack was meant to be a message someone probably would have claimed responsibility therefore I believe the attack was by a third party who wanted to make sunnis and ahias fight each other or to place the blame on another group or country in order to cause muslims to attack that group or country. That narrowed the suspected groups down to those who where neither sunni nor shia and blamed another outside group. Iran blammed America and Isreal, both are countries that you could say Iran doesn't like and the explanation Iran gave for it's accusation was illogical (America and Coalition forces worked hard to maintain peace, making an act of terrorism out of the question) and made no sense. Iran is the most likely suspect, this is based on evedence it is not just speculation.</dd>

<p>How can someone claim that "Iran is suspicious"? Iran consists of 90% shia population. So therefore they will bomb there own holy site. That is just ridiculous. Wikipedia is not a blog, but it is necessary to clear some things out. Why would they bomb one of the most important and revered sites of Shia Islam. The mosque in Samarra is where Imam Muhammad Al-Mahdi (may Allah's peace be upon him) is known to have disappeared. He is the messiah of Shia Islam. Shias believe that they should strive to hasten his arrival every second of their lives in any way they can. Iran's government has even been criticized for striving for something that, in their opinion, is supersticious. It makes absolutely no sense for them therefore, to bomb Imam Mahdi's (AS) fathers shrine. That is considered an open war with him, and Iran most definately does not seek that.</p>

<p>Given that <i>al</i> means <i>the</i> in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a>, should we refer to the mosque as just "Al Askari Mosque" or "The Al Askari Mosque?" I don't know if there is a convention on this, but in my opinion the former works better, especially because it doesn't result in a bad translation. Not trying to make a big deal over it; just trying to get it clarified in case I need to stop calling it simply "Al Askari Mosque" and start calling it "The Al Askari Mosque." <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 03:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So is "The Al Askari Mosque bombing occured on February 22" a good way to say it or is it ignorant because it translates as "The the Askari Mosque"? (The river Rio Grande or the Rio Grande.) <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a></dd>

<dd>The first "the" refers to "bombing". And since "al" is part of the name, you can't really change it, thus "The Al Askari Mosque bombing" should stay as it is. Secondly, it's the Rio Grande River, not the River Rio Grande.</dd>

<p>In "Responsibility and accusations" section, there is an entry: "Iraqi President Jalal Talabani stated that the bombing was the work of takfiri groups seeking to stir up "sectarian strife" (Al-Hayat, 23 February 2006)". This info is very omportant, but the problem is, it is linked to the Wiki entry on Feb 23!</p>
<p>IMHO, it is much better to link to concrete articles because then it is possible to check and update info in the Wiki entry. Reference "Al-Hayat, 23 February 2006" looks great in print, but not in online document. It would be great if links to concrete news stories will not get edited out.</p>

<dd>Now that it's been a year, hopefully we can write this article without suffering from recentism. I don't know anyone credible that blames the US or Israel for the bombing, it's most likely an international terror group (al-qaeda) or sunni insurgents.
