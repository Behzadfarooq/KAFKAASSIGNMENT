<h2><span class="mw-headline">institute for counter terrorism</span></h2>
<p>why is this a source? it's practically an IDF source. so a research organisation comprised mostly of former IDF officials, officers etc criticizes the human rights numbers. i mean if B'Tselem was comprised mostly of former hamas would anyone take anything they say seriously? i changed the bbc numbers to B'Tselem numbers for 2000-2006. BBC was using B'Tselem's numbers.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Muhammed Al-Durrah caption</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> wrote in his edit summary "It is actually disputed if he was shot. Read the relevant article." I don't know what he is talking about, because the conspiracy theorists quoted in the "Controversy" section of the Al-Durrah article actually say that he was shot, though they think it was by Palestinian gunmen. It's also not disputed that there was a shootout between the IDF and Palestinians at the time. So the caption is only stating undisputed facts. Those who are interested in conspiracy theories can follow the link to the article. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinalis_6949.html" title="User:Sanguinalis">Sanguinalis</a> 10:59, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Specifically, according to the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Durrah_f90d.html" title="Muhammad al-Durrah">Muhammad al-Durrah</a> article and the CAMERA web page Isarig wants to link this page: Yosef Duriel does not dispute that al-Durrah was shot. IDF General Samia does not dispute that al-Durrah was shot. James Fallows does not dispute that al-Durrah was shot. Denis Jeambar and Daniel Leconte do not dispute that al-Durrah was shot. The producers of the German television documentary do not dispute that al-Durrah was shot. All these people suggest (wtih varying degrees) that al-Durrah was shot by Palestinian gunmen, not Israeli soldiers, but they do not suggest the incident was "staged".</p>
<p>The CAMERA article does not take position, it just purports to "sort out the claims and counterclaims"</p>
<p>Now let us look at the text Isarig wants to insert in the caption: <i>Many organizations and analysts have concluded that the incident was staged</i>. The only organization that claims this is the Metula "News Agency" (actually just a website), and four individuals: Richard Landes, Stephane Juffa, Gerard Huber, and Nahum Shahaf. The first three of these are associated with the Metula " News Agency". None of them can be called "analysts" - they don't have backgrounds in forensics or ballistics nor have any of them investigated a shooting before al-Durrah. A more accurate statement would be <i>A few individuals claim there is evidence that the event is staged</i>, but it would be inappropriate to put that statement in THIS article. The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy states: "We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view, and views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented except in articles devoted to those views." <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinalis_6949.html" title="User:Sanguinalis">Sanguinalis</a></p>
<p>To <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a>, who have reinserted this material: Who exactly are the "many organizations and analysts" who believe the shooting of Muhammad al-Durrah was staged, besides the one organization and handful of people I listed? What evidence do you have that this belief is NOT held only by a tiny minority? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinalis_6949.html" title="User:Sanguinalis">Sanguinalis</a> 10:23, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You haven't answered the question. What evidence is there that the view that the incident was staged is held by more than a tiny minority? If view X is held only by a tiny minority, then clearly inserting the text "There are concerns that X" in a Wikipedia article is a violation of NPOV policy: "We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view" <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinalis_6949.html" title="User:Sanguinalis">Sanguinalis</a> 03:05, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your summary of what the situation, as well as of my position is misleading. I did not insert the text "<i>Many organizations and analysts have</i>..." I inserted the text "<i>Some organiztions</i>..., which is factually correct. Your summary of who disputes the boy was killed is incorrect. Contrary to what you claim, the CAMERA article I cite quotes Denis Jeambar and Daniel Leconte, 2 independant journalists as saying "when Charles Enderlin gives up the little one for dead, killed by the Israelis, nothing could enable him to affirm that he [Al Dura] is really dead". This is also quoted in the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <i>Le Figaro</i>. The CAMERA article also cites Luc Rozenzeig (a Le Monde journalist) who "believes that events surrounding the Al Dura incident were staged.". The views of MENA journalists Juffa &amp; Huber were carried by reputable sources such as the Wall Street Journal Europe, Editions Raphael and others. So in summary, in addition to MENA, we have at least 3 other independant journalists who question if the boy is actually dead, and their views, far from being an extreme minority, were aired by numerous <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I am puttin gback my original caption, incorporating the changes suggest by [[User talk:Humus sapiens|ну?] <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 18:21, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you did insert the text "<i>Many organizations and analysts have</i>...", in this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=71187476&amp;oldid=71145527" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=71187476&amp;oldid=71145527" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. You are simply wrong about Jeambar and Leconte. First, take a look at the <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=\\ForeignBureaus\\archive\\200502\\FOR20050215c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=\\ForeignBureaus\\archive\\200502\\FOR20050215c.html" rel="nofollow">inverview</a> published by the Cybercast News Service, itself cited in the CAMERA article:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Leconte said he is satisfied that <b>the shooting really happened</b>, but he does not believe the bullets that struck the child could have been fired by Israeli troops.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Leconte said that after seeing further evidence presented by France 2, he believes <b>the shooting scene itself was real</b>. "At the moment of the shooting, it's no longer acting, there's really shooting, there's no doubt about that," Leconte told Cybercast News Service.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unless there was an "incredible manipulation" by France 2, Leconte said he believes that <b>both father and son were shot</b>. He cited recent footage in which the father, Jamal al-Durra, showed his scars from bullet wounds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Leconte said that <b>if Juffa believes the whole incident was staged, he would have to provide concrete proof</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...in 2002, a German television documentary concluded that Palestinian and not Israeli gunfire <b>killed the boy</b>. When they viewed the footage, Leconte and Jeambar <b>came to the same conclusion</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Second, in the Le Figaro article, Jeambar and Leconte wrote this:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>To those, like Mena, who wanted to use us to support the thesis of that the death of the child was faked by the Palestinians, we say that they are misguided, and are misguiding their readers. Not only do we not share this point of view, but we affirm that based on the knowledge of the file we have today, nothing allows us to affirm this, much to the contrary.</dd>

<dd>I'll grant you that Luc Rozenzeig supports the "incident was staged" theory. That makes five individuals - still a handful. The fact that one of them got an op-ed published in a right-leaning newspaper and another got his book published doesn't mean it is not a tiny minority view. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinalis_6949.html" title="User:Sanguinalis">Sanguinalis</a> 03:31, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tiny minority, yeah right. Read the actual article. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 18:57, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did read it. Many of the people quoted there who are critics of France 2 and the initial reporting of the incident do not actually say that the event was staged (see the above reply to Isarig). Rather they say it was Palestinian, not Israeli, gunfire that killed the boy, a much less incredible claim (friendly fire incidents are very common). I have shown that the conspiracy theory, that Palestinians faked the incident, in collaboration with France 2, is held by only a tiny minority. If there is a prominent individual or organization who endorses the conspiracy theory which I have missed, please tell us who it is. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinalis_6949.html" title="User:Sanguinalis">Sanguinalis</a> 03:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mitchell Commission Report Twisted to exonerate Sharon in instigating the intifada</span></h2>
<p>How is it that an extremely desperate attempt to revive the dead Oslo process in May 2001 as become the straw that apologists for Israel now cling to exonerate Sharon in responsibility for instigating the Intifada. First off the report completely exonerates the Palestinian Authority and says that there is no evidence that the intifada was in any pre planned or instigated by Arafat. Secondly when this report originally came out it was extremely criticized by right wing supporters of Israel because of the fact that it was highley critical of sharon. True the report did exonerate him of resonsibility for the intifada, but it was still highly critical of his visit to the temple mount. I personally think this was a bit of whitewashing by the Mitchell commission in order to please both the Israelies and the palestinians, seeing how this report was a desperate attempt to restart the peace process. However, reading this article you'd come away with the impression that the article was extremely favorable to sharon and particularly critical of arafat, which it wasn't. As for the other claims that there was activity before the visit to the temple mount that instigated the intifada, there is not one neutral source listed in this article that confirms any of these organizations. Just about all of them are extremely biased, Pro-Zionist organizations. The one bit of factual evidence to support the claim that the Intifada was pre-planned is the video of Imad Falouji shouting his mouth off, a man who by the way who originally worked for Hamas before briefly working for Fatah. The Israely propoganda machine will take any comment from some insignificant Plastinian Authority official and pass it off as the official position of the whole group. Of course some cynical memebers of the Palestinian authority will take advantage of the incident after the fact because it makes them look good to say they had everything planned out from the beginning when in reality they were probably sitting around twittling there thumbs. Most of Fatah, including arafat have denied they planned the intifada beforehand and there is absolutely no solid evidence to support the claim that he did, which the Mitchell Commission acknowledges. I'll agree that Sharon wasn't solely resonsible for the outbreak of the intifada, but he was at least 50% responsible, where as the other 50% was the break down of the peace process. I think this article and the article on Ariel Sharon contain great disinformation in this regard and should therefore be revised. annoynmous 9:41, 12 Decemeber 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arafat had first named the explosion of violence the "al-Aqsa Intifada". Imad Faluji, the Palestinian Authority’s communications minister, said in a public speech in December 2000, "[The uprising] had been planned since Chairman Arafat’s return from Camp David, when he turned the tables on the former U.S. president [Clinton] and rejected the American conditions."[http://youtube.com/watch?v=Qb5fIP-MfAc].

<dd>Timeshifter I want to thank you for your timely and courteous response. I like it that you were willing to actually talk to me instead simply threatining to have me removed from wikipedia which I'm sorry to say has been the typical experience for me when I edit wikipedia articles. My main grievance is that a lot of material in this article is biased against the palestinians. I'm sorry to say that this seems to be a bias the permutates through many of the articles on wikipedia dealing with the Israel palestine conflict. All I ask is that when wikipedia cites something as a fact that it relies on respected and mainstream organizations instead of biased groups with an axe to grind like standwithus.com. If you want to cite there accusations as accusations thats fine, but don't cite them as accepted fact. As for the controversy over what was the catalyst for the second intifada, I personally think this section needs to be reworked to reflect a more neutral point of view. The way it's betrayed in the article now gives the impression that Arafat and Fatah were completly responsible for the intifada and that Sharons visit to the temple mount was if anything incidental. This to me is an extremely false characterization. There is abosolutely no solid evidence to support the claim that Fatah pre-planned the intifada. If anyone would bother to actually read the mitchell commission report they would see that they agree that there is no evidence of this claim. The only piece of solid evidence is the speech of Imad Folouji several months after the start of the intifada which can easily be attributed to boasting after the fact to make fatah appear more competent than they actually are. I look forward to your response annoynmous 2:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Timeshifter, so far you've been very classy and elegant, so I'll try not to take personally your accusations of sockpupperty or what ever nonsense phrases you guy's use. I am just a concerned reader of wikipedia who wants to contribute and I don't I should have adhere to the mantra "Join the club or shut up". Wikipedia is so suppossed to be a place where all can contribute as long as they are constructive. Believe me when I say theres a lot more on this site I'd like to delete and change, but I don't because there are solid and legitimate sources to back up those things and I don't believe in editing something simply because it doesn't agree with my viewpoint. To me the attitude that I can't contribute because I don't have an official user name reinforces the notion that some have that wikipedia is just a big cult. I don't believe that because although I have encountered some people on wikipedia with a group think attitude, I find eventually that someone comes along with a reasonable attitude and is willing to come to a compromise. You seem like one of those people.</p>
<p>As for my complaints I guess I'm just angry that there at the very beginning of the article and immediately give off a very biased impression of the whole issue. The part on the Mitchell Commission was not added till recently because someone just had to slant the article in Israel's favor. As for the statistics of the number of casualties I know problem with saying that some people criticize the numbers, but to put them at the very beginning of the article and state them as fact when there not is very spurious in my opinion. Again I would like to thank for the classy you have responded to my edits. annoynmous 8:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The fact that you didn't automatically reverse my edits gave me the impression that you were willing to consider my complaints. I am not interested in gaining an offical user name, I am just a concerned wikipedia reader who feels this article is a little slanted in one direction. If you want I'll try and stick "annoynmous" at the end of every edit I make on this article from now on.

<p>Okay, I know have an official user name so I believe I'm entitled to make any edits I want and discuss with others how to make the article more neutral. I would appreacite if me and Timeshifter could get back to where we left off and that everyone else such as Isarig and John254 could leave us alone.</p>
<p>My complaint is that the two materials I edited out were at the very beginning of the article and right away give a biased feel for the rest of the article. The Mitchell commission material is already in the prior events section and serves no purpose at the front of the article other than to bias the article against the palestinians. The statistics that state the number of civilians killed on both sides is simply not accurate, they come from a biased pro-israel site called standwithus.com. If you want cite these accusations as accusations that's fine, but don't cite them as if there fact.</p>

<p>As for the Mitchell Commission report it, there is no reason for it to be at the very front of the article, especially since it already is in the prior events section.

<p>Thank you for finally speaking to me instead of just blindly reverting my edits. I see no problem with your wish to keep the Al-Durrah captions. Actually I didn't realize this until you pointed it out. I have no problem and agree there is a lot of controversy over the Al-Durrah photo. However, I must disagree with your inference that the Institute For Counter Terrorism in an unbiased source. The statistic they supposedly cite can be found at none of the mainstream Human Rights organizations such as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem etc. If you wish to put this statistic somewhere else in the article and state it as a accusation and not a fact I would have no problem with that. However, if you continue to state this statistic as accepted fact then I will have no choice but to continue reverting the article.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for being finally willing to talk to me sensibly and reasonably. annoynmous 23:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. What evidence is there that the ICT is not a relaible source? The fact that the otehr NGO's do not break out the casualties in that way is one of the critcisms of them, as indicated in the article, so the absense of that statistic from them is not evidence f ICT's bias. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 23:54, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First off the ICT is an organization based and founded in Israel, so to me that biases them a little bit. That fact that there statistics are cited no nowhere else except for in biases Lobbying groups like standwithus.com.</p>
<p>By the way, in the article when that statistic comes up, the link doesn't go to the ICT, it goes to the standwithus.com website. If this was such an accepted statistic why didn't you link to there site instead of the standwithus.com website. I looked at the ICT website and could find no breakdown of casualties figures on the main page. If you could tell me where at the website those statistics are I'd be happy to look further.</p>
<p>However, even if the statistics are there and the ICT a was reliable organization as you say, I think you would have to agree there assesment of the casualties is not the accepted by everybody fact of the matter and therefore should not be presented in the article as such.</p>
<p>As I said, If you want to move these numbers to another part of the article and state them as opinion instead of fact that's fine. annoynmous 24:18, 18 Decemeber 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To allege bias because of where the organization was founded and/or based is not logically sound. Is B'Tselem also biased in a pro Israeli way, using that logic? (And is probably not a wise thing to do from your POV - it would lead to similar objections against the use of many pro-Palestinian claims sourced to Palestinian sources). Second, it is false that the ICT's statistics and reports are used only by lobbying groups. A quick Google search will show you they are quoted by the Library of Congress <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/international/hispanic/terrorism/pakistan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.loc.gov/rr/international/hispanic/terrorism/pakistan.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the USAF academy <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/aul/bibs/terrsuic/suite.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.au.af.mil/au/aul/bibs/terrsuic/suite.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, California State University Sacramento <a href="http://library.csus.edu/guides/rogenmoserd/general/terrorism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.csus.edu/guides/rogenmoserd/general/terrorism.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and many others.</dd>

<p>finally, I have provided (as did TimeShifter) the direct report from the ICT. Feel free to replace the Standbyus source to the actual ICT report. If you have sources that actually dispute this figures (rather than sources that don't mention them), we may include them in the article as well. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 01:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You Have not provided the direct report from the ICT and neither did Timeshifter. Timeshifter looked at the source and came to the conclusion that the statistics had no merit.</p>
<p>As for my comments regarding ICT's bias, you seem to forget that B'tselem is a Human Rights organization, whereas ICT is a so called "Counterrorism Institute" and serves the same function in Israel as organization's like the Heritage Foundation or American Enterprise Institute serve in America. When your organization's whole purpose is so called "Counterrorism" excuse me, but just maybe you have a little bit of interest skewing the evidence in certain direction. Just because some unversity's cite them doesn't mean there informations accurate.</p>
<p>Once again, if you wish to move these numbers to a different part of the article and state them as opinion instead of fact, I have no problem with that. annoynmous 01:57, 18 Decemeber 2006(UTC)</p>
<p>Also I don't think an organization founded by the Ex-head of Mossad is especially credible in giving a balanced viewpoint on the Intifada. I don't care what university's quote them on Pakistan or suicide bombing, you can't say that this doesn't give them a bias toward one point of view. annoynmous 02:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am beginning to lose my respect for you, and finding it very hard to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faithwith</a> regards to your edits, when confronted by posts like the above. Take a look above, where I wrote 'The stats are from the Institute for Counter Terrorism (www.ict.org.il) which is referenced at the bottom of the page you were looking at. You can access the complete report <a href="http://212.150.54.123/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=439" class="external text" title="http://212.150.54.123/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=439" rel="nofollow">here</a>". Note the link at the end- it links directly to the ICT report. Furthermore, Timeshifter also provided a link to an updated report: "Here are later stats from them (through Jan. 1, 2005): <a href="http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm" class="external free" title="http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm</a> '. And contrary to your claim, he did not come "to the conclusion that the statistics had no merit" - he said they needed a little updating, the article currently says "3900 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis" were killed, and he wants it updated, and to include the breakdown between civilian and non-civilian. Please do not misrepresent other editors' comments. My comment regarding B'tselem was to counter your claim that ICT is biased becuase it was founded and located in Israel. That is a logical fallacy, and I'm glad my exmaple of B'tselem helped you see the error in your logic. You have now moved to a different claim - that the ICT is a partisan think-tank, analogous to the Heritage Foundation in the US. That is also false. The ICT is a non-partisan academic research institution, a project of the Interdisciplinary Center of Herzliya. You are welcome to your personal POV that if an organization uses "counterterrorism" in its name it is by definition biased, but I am not too impressed by your personal assessment, and you're going to have to produce some tangible evidence beyond your personal beliefs if we are to describe the ICT as biased. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> (<a href="../../../i/s/a/User_talk%7EIsarig_cb15.html" title="User talk:Isarig">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Isarig_c9e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Isarig">contribs</a>) 06:49, 19 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I'm sorry I didn't see before in the posts above that you had linked to the article. I didn't mean to implie that you were lying.</p>
<p>However, I think you you need to stop taking things so personally Isarig. There was a point where I lost all respect for you when all you said was "I'm done with you" and refused to talk to me. I had been talking with timeshifer for some time and then you and several others just started maddly reverting my edits and then blocking me from editing. I found that very insulting and hurtful and although I'm glad where talking now in a more civilized matter, I wish we hadn't had to go through that ordeal.</p>
<p>As for the numbers, I have stated again and again that the problem is stating the numbers as absolute fact, which they aren't, and having them right at the beginning of the article. You obviously haven't been listening to me, I haven't said you can't include them, I just said you need to state them as opinion.</p>
<p>As for the ICT's credibilty, I'm sorry they are think tank, plain and simple. Maybe there a think tank that does a lot of research, but that doesn't mean they get instant credibilty. Anyway the links you gave to where there quoted are about Pakistan and suicide bombing, not the intifada. When I asked you who quotes them, I was asking who quotes there numbers on the intifada casualties. I'm sorry there an oragnization founded in Israel, devoted to counterrorism and founded by an ex-head of Mossad. You can't tell me based on all that that there view on the situation is completely neutral.</p>
<p>I know of an Organization called the Palsetine Monitor that says that the number of civilians killed is at least 50% of the 3900 and could be as High as 75%. However, I wouldn't think of including them because I know that they get there stats from a plastinian based medical association and that there would be the appearance of bias. I would fully understand that and I would ask that someone do the same in regards to bias towards the Israelie side.</p>
<p>I have moved your updated numbers to the bottom of the page and stated them as opinion. I hope this will lead us, or at least begin to lead us to a mutual compromise annoynmous 14:15, 19 December 2006 (UTC</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Isarig, it occurs to me that we need to take a different approach to this argument. Something more expansive and nuanced. Namely what is the arguement you and others are trying to make with these numbers.</p>
<p>Please don't take that personally as a slight against you. We use numbers and statistics to advocate an opinion, none of us does to truly just report the facts. I include myself in that mold.</p>
<p>The argument that seems to want to be made with these numbers is that Israel takes great care in the occupied territories to not kill civilians, were as the Palestinians don't care who they kill. Well, form reading the reports of the mainstream human rights groups it would seem that this line of argument is fundementally flawed. They frequently accuse Israel of being reckless and indiscriminate in there killing of palestians. Now you can dispute that and say there wrong, but that is your opinion and not fact.</p>
<p>By the way, where does the ICT get there numbers from. Do they do there own research or do they just go by the IDF's numbers. I don't see a detailed account of every palestinian killed at there site like I do at B'tselem and Amnesty. Also, what is with these terms such as combatant and non-combatant. Why not just use civilian and non-civilian. In there original study back in 2002 they only said 45% were actual confirmed combatants and another 10% or 12% or probable combatants. There definition of probable combatant seems to be any one who is in the area of a battle zone. I really don't understand what the term combatant means. Can someone be a civilian and also be a combatant. If so it seems like highly dubious term. If an Israeli soldier shoots someone than later claims there a combatant that doesn't seems like a great methodology to me. Indeed, elswhere in the article you have it said that the palsetinians have disputed the designation of certian people as combatants.</p>
<p>Let's for the sake of argument assume I accept that the ICT is a respected organization. So is B'tslem, Amnesty and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society and they do not agree with the ICT's assessments. You still haven't shown me any reputable source where the ICT's numbers are quoted as fact. A reasonable person would come to the conclusion that these statistics by the ICT are at the very least disputed, and therefore be stated as opinion instead of fact.</p>
<p>If you want these numbers in the article fine, but don't put them at the very beginning of the article and state them as if they are the accepted fact by everyone. annoynmous 15:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not know which stats are more reliable than others. I suggest putting the basic stats on the wikipedia page. Maybe in the form of a range of deaths. And a range of civilian versus combatant percents. And some hard numbers for civilian casualties (also a range). And then putting reference links.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"terrorist" in combatant sections of infobox</span></h2>
<p>Bnwwf91 added the word "terrorist" to the Palestinian combatant section of the infobox. It says "Palestinian Authority: Several Palestinian terrorist/militant groups." See this revision difference:</p>

<p>NPOV requires all significant points of view. So I added the word "terrorist" to the Israeli combatant section of the infobox: "Israel: Israeli Defense Forces, and several Israeli terrorist/militant settler groups." --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMO, we should remove the word "terrorist" from the infobox entirely and just use "militant".

<dd>I agree. Thanks for the wikilink. I have often wondered how to use the word "terrorist" in wikipedia. Here is a relevant quote from the wikilink page:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The words terrorism and terrorist may be cited where there is a verifiable and cited indication of who is calling a person or group terrorist. This is the standard Wikipedia format 'X says Y'. If this is followed, the article should make it clear who is calling them a terrorist, and that the word does not appear to be used, unqualified, by the 'narrative voice' of the article. In other cases, terms such as 'militant(s)' may be a suitable alternative, implying a group or individual who uses force to attain their objectives." --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 04:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About Tewfik's messy, large, undiscussed deletions on Dec. 28, 2006.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please stop adding incivil headings, it does not help in editing what is already a contentious article. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 06:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like the method you used on Dec. 28, 2006 to delete large amounts of material was to go back to a Dec. 21, 2006 revision. Here is the revision difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96890886&amp;oldid=96871313" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96890886&amp;oldid=96871313" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96890886&amp;oldid=96871313</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Basically you went back to this Dec. 21, 2006 revision:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;oldid=95710786" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;oldid=95710786" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;oldid=95710786</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that in the meantime many changes have been made. There were 17 edits made since that Dec. 21, 2006 revision. Most of them were explained or resolved on the talk page. In the last week only one change has been objected to on the talk page, and I came to agree with that objection.</p>
<p>The revert wars had stopped for a week before this latest undiscussed mass deletion of yours. You seem to be the only registered wikipedia user to have a problem with these edits. Please. Let us not go back to abrupt editing. Please discuss major changes on the talk page first. Deleting uncontroversial casualty stat updates can only be looked upon as vandalism. Why did you go back to older casualty stats in the infobox and the casualties section? --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 07:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96890886&amp;oldid=95710786" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96890886&amp;oldid=95710786" rel="nofollow">diff between my edit and that of Humus sapiens</a>. I did not mass-revert, but rather painstakingly attempted to preserve any and all corrections of grammar, as well as rephrasing the image caption to flow better and link to the proper place while preserving your attempt to fix its neutrality (while you did mass revert my edits). What I did do was restore sourced information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=95755615&amp;oldid=95742975" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=95755615&amp;oldid=95742975" rel="nofollow">which you removed</a> [without even noting in the edit summary] while you moved some data and juxtaposed other unconnected information which served as original research to push an unsourced POV. What I also did was to revert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=95769229&amp;oldid=95755615" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=95769229&amp;oldid=95755615" rel="nofollow">your updates to the casualties</a>, which did not correlate to the cited source, as well as removing the passage added by Annoynmous which had been previously removed by two other users. While it is commendable that you view consensus-building on Talk as important, simply leaving a message there is not the same as having consensus, especially when no one with an opposing viewpoint was even active there in the last week (only one other user even used the Talk, and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96855049&amp;oldid=96853438" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=96855049&amp;oldid=96853438" rel="nofollow">comment on a general principle</a> unrelated to the edits which I reverted). I would be more than happy to have a discussion with you about including some of this new information, including updates to the numbers, but I sincerely hope that you can see what the problem with this last set of edits was.

<dd>So you put back all the unsourced material discussed in the previous talk sections. That unsourced material is original research. It is against wikipedia policy to put unsourced material and original research in an article. You recombined the economic costs and casualties sections. What logic is there for that? You went back to much older casualty stats. The newer stats matched up with the stats at the source at the time the stats were added to the article. There are newer numbers now of course. As I said you made a messy, lazy, large edit. It may not have been intentional vandalism on your part. But if you do it again, then it could be considered to be vandalism. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 01:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, I changed the section name per <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#Behavior_that_is_unacceptable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Talk page guidelines</a>. Secondly, as I said before, your posting to Talk when no one else has commented is not the same as consensus, and it is also not "material discussed in the previous talk sections" by anyone other than you, at least as far as the last week. Therefore, I reverted your additions, changes, and deletions, and I provided diffs above to show the major problems. Maybe you didn't realise, but the new numbers you added did not match the given citation, and while I'm not against separating the economic and human casualty sections, you should not remove a sourced passage about the internal Palestinian casualties, especially without even a mention in the edit summary or Talk of the removal. You also should not keep reverting wholesale to include the outright OR removed twice by Isarig and Humus sapiens. If you believe that I've reverted some other part of your work unfairly, please let me know which part.</p>
<p>I will try to separate the two sections, and since you keep making mention of unsourced material, perhaps you could make use of the {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}} citation request tag so that myself and others can know what you see as objectionable (while I found a link to the Haaretz article that you mentioned on Talk, keep in mind that print can also be cited). As for the casualty numbers, I disagree that the new <a href="../../../b/27/t/B%27Tselem_7aa1.html" title="B'Tselem">B'Tselem</a> report just added by <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabitual_gardner_1057.html" title="User:Habitual gardner">Habitual gardner</a> should be immediately accepted for the conflict box, especially as the past numbers in use here have been a compromise that also did not accept B'Tselem's at face value. Thus older [sourced, consensus] numbers will have to do until one of us can find newer sourced, consensus numbers. If you have another idea on how to approach this, please let me know. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 04:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would really appreciate, however, if you would acknowledge the problems that I've pointed out with the lack of sourcing to some of your edits, the undisclosed removal of sourced information, and the repeated addition of a total OR section with which I do not even believe you disagree (not to mention the wholesale reversion of my grammatical and stylistic corrections). <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 06:40, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I see that the guideline does not want a position to be taken in the section title. So I put my view on your deletions below the section title. The guideline says: "Keep headings neutral: A heading should indicate what the topic is, but not communicate a specific view about it."</dd>

<dd>You wrote: "Maybe you didn't realise, but the new numbers you added did not match the given citation." They did match the citation at the time they were added. Since then the number of deaths has gone up, and in my last edit I updated to the very latest death stats. In your last edit you deleted the up-to-date stats in this sourced sentence: "From <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">September 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_27.html" title="December 27">December 27</a> 2006 there were 1,017 Israelis killed by Palestinians and 4,046 Palestinians killed by Israelis."

<dd>I can't help it if you don't know how to add the columns and rows on the source page to get the total numbers for the stats.

<p>I'm not sure where the communication breakdown is happening. I reexamined all my edits to ensure I that I hadn't missed something. What I found that you are indeed correct about the numbers meeting the original B'Tselem citation (I failed to add the secondary column), and so you have my apologies for saying that they did not. However, you have still repeatedly reinstituted your changes wholesale including:</p>

<p>Additionally, the brand-new B'Tselem numbers as the official statistics are controversial and need to be discussed, though I will let them stand for now in the interest of compromise. Additionally, I think that I have been quite civil to you, and I do not appreciate your continual misuse of the terms vandalism and original research regarding my reversion of your work, nor the continual claim that I am 'lazily mass-reverting', when I have worked hard to preserve noncontroversial edits, while seeing them mass-reverted by you.

<p>Thanks for taking the time to figure out how to add up the B'Tselem columns and rows to get the death stats. No one is claiming any stats as "official". So stop acting like people are making that claim. Feel free to clarify it further in the article and infobox. By writing in "B'Tselem stats" or something similar. That is what is done in the casualties sections of other wikipedia pages. I listed some previously.</p>
<p>The quote from the Amira Hass editorial on casualties in Haaretz is sourced info, and is thus allowed in wikipedia. Stop deleting sourced material.</p>
<p>I did not remove any sourced material. The material you claim is sourced can't be found anywhere. When you find proof of the source, other than your word, then you can put it back in the wikipedia article.</p>
<p>I checked your latest edit. I reverted it with this edit summary: "Put back Solonium's fantastic casualties chart that Tewfik deleted. Removed yet again the unsourced material that Tewfik keeps reinserting in violation of wikipedia guidelines. See talk."</p>
<p>Deleting Solonium's casualties chart was pure vandalism on your part. It takes a lot of work to make such a chart. It is based on B'Tselem's casualty stats which this wikipedia page has been using a long time. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 07:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is clearly marked as to its source being B'Tselem. So it is not the official stats for Al-Aqsa Intifada. We can add other stats so that the readers have a choice of stats.

<dd>Hi Solonium,</dd>
<dd>There isn't a problem with citing the report, and there is actually already a paragraph about it in the "Casualties" section. The problem would be with dedicating space to replicating the linked chart, which would give undue weight to this controversial set of numbers, especially as it is now extremely new and so there are no specific critiques of it available yet. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 21:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I returned the chart, but I did not make it any more prominent than the other stats in the casualties section. I got rid of the bold text. All stats are controversial, Tewfik. Including the ones you put in the section. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> solves the problem of controversial info by putting in all significant viewpoints, and letting the readers decide. Anything else is favoring one particular viewpoint. I apologized for mistakenly deleting your preferred stats, Tewfik, once I noticed that you had finally sourced the stats. I would appreciate you returning the favor, leaving in all sourced stats, and following the wikipedia guidelines. Also, B'Tselem has been compiling stats a long time, and so they are not as you say "extremely new". I have seen that chart being updated for years. The fact that the stats are in chart form does not make them ineligible for wikipedia. In fact wikipedia readers, editors, and guidelines encourage charts, images, etc.. See the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_conflict_in_Iraq_since_2003_ffa1.html" title="Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003">Iraq War casualties page</a>. It has a couple charts.

<dd>I'm glad to see that you are finally reading through my edits and Talk. I pointed out exactly what I did four times in Talk, and most of my edits each incorporated different changes to your wholesale reversions, but in the interests of compromise, I will ignore your previous remarks calling my edits "lazy" and "mean-spirited," of course hoping that you recognise why that is inappropriate. However, while you've finally altered your reversion slightly, you are still reverting all of my noncontroversial edits (spelling, wfy, weasel-wording, my alteration to the note). Your version also keeps adding the Amira Hass editorial (in case my previous Talk wasn't sufficiently clear about what the problem is, there is no reason for us to give undue weight to an opinion piece in a section discussing the various numbers), and removing the Maariv numbers without so much as a citation request tag. As for the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Human_Rights_Monitoring_Group_1813.html" title="Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group">Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group</a> section, could you detail what problem you see, perhaps also making use of a {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}}? <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 18:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my last edit today of the casualty section I took special care not to revert the minor changes you made such as typos, spelling, clarification, etc.. It must be said though that you rarely took special care to avoid reverting my minor edits typos, spelling, clarification. That being said though, let us both start to use the talk page more so we can avoid these problems. I really think much of the problem is due to confusion.</dd>

<p>I have no "preferred stats" - you arrived at this article and began to remove sourced and mostly sourced (everything but 'title') uncontroversial information without so much as a citation request or any discussion with others, a point that I have repeatedly attempted to get across. I do not appreciate your claim that I "rarely took special care to avoid reverting [your] minor edits typos, spelling, clarification" when the edit history is quite clear and when I pointed out that you were mass reverting uncontroversial material multiple times - this is not a game of being right, lets please just follow the policies. And yes, Amira Hass's editorial is sourced, and would be a great inclusion on Amira Hass' views on the al-Aqsa Intifada, but it is not an objective piece which should be included alongside the work of statisticians. I have this time "mass reverted" as you are continually removing the same information, with the exception of the expansion to the "Intrafada" reference, a reference which I added after you simply removed the passage without so much as a citation request - that is something which needs to stop. Please, please use the proper channels and work together. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 10:36, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In your last comment you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have this time "mass reverted"</dd>
</dl>
<p>So you admit it. I have not purposely removed any sourced material on this page. I apologized when I did so by accident. I corrected some poorly sourced info (the Intrafada material). On the other hand you have repeatedly removed sourced material. The IBC chart, the Amira Hass info, etc.. Without apologies at all. In fact, you do it defiantly, and with prejudice, and while removing totally uncontroversial minor edits, too, as in your last revert. You just reverted updated Palestine Red Crescent Society stats. A source you approve. You just reverted the much clearer Intrafada info to a poorly sourced unclear version that you later tried to fix, but did not succeed at. That makes no sense at all. In your zeal to mass revert you are destroying collaboration on this page, and scaring off excellent editors such as the creator of the IBC chart. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> says: "This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary."</p>
<p>My latest edit summary: "Revert. I took incredible care to not change any of your minor edits. Whereas you reverted all of mine in one click, and added nothing new. See talk. Admins, please help."</p>
<p>I will probably be reporting you for blanking and reverting soon. Also for repeatedly reinserting unsourced material. I notice other people mentioning some of these problems on your talk pages.</p>

<p>Humus sapiens. You did the exact same thing as Tewfik. I make the same objections. Could you reply please to all my points in the above section? In a previous message concerning the B'Tselem chart you wrote:</p>
<p>"This statistics is highly controversial and POV. Instead, we should follow WP:NPOV."</p>
<p>You never explained why. Could you explain why? I note on your talk page that you are an admin. I point you to this page of casualty statistics: <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_conflict_in_Iraq_since_2003_ffa1.html" title="Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003">Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003</a>. All casualty stats are included there. That is the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> solution there. Why not here? Why do we favor some stats here by including them, and disfavor others by not including them here? NPOV page says:</p>
<p>"All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly, proportionately and without bias."</p>
<p>"None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being the truth, and all significant published points of view are to be presented, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. Readers are left to form their own opinions."</p>
<p>I would like some other admins to comment on this, too. Can you bring some of them here? --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How shall B'Tselem stats be put in article?</span></h2>
<p>Since some biased POV-pushing editors will not allow stats to be put in the article in chart form except in the infobox, how will the B'Tselem stats be put in the chart? Or will these censoring editors selectively put in some stats, but not others? They have continually blocked most of the B'Tselem stats for a long time now. Rather than put them in the article in the form they prefer, they just delete them. Wikipedia rules say editors should edit first, instead of deleting first.</p>
<p>Solonium, we may have to go to the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a> in order to stop this violation of the NPOV rules by these 2 editors. I suggest people read some of the previous incident discussion there to understand the POV posses that form up in order to violate wikipedia guidelines. Some people don't seem capable of setting aside their POVs and letting the NPOV rules here be respected.</p>
<p>We will have to form our own posse of NPOV-pushers. I suggest people sign up here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Arab-Israeli_conflict_784c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Arab-Israeli conflict">Wikipedia:WikiProject Arab-Israeli conflict</a>.</p>

<dd>Three of the last four editors involved (including the both of us in the four) have removed that passage... I appreciate your frustration at not being able to include what you feel is a relevant piece, but that does not give licence to name-calling and the intimidating headers which you keep adding (consider that I could have taken the position that they should be titled "<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a>'s removal of sourced information and addition of POV/undue weight", since those were the edits that I reverted - surely you can understand what is wrong with this method of communication).</dd>
<dd>As for the actual substance of the edits, as I said before, the Hass editorial has no place alongside the various sets of numbers, nor does any other opinion-piece. She is neither providing new numbers, nor is she at all qualified to provide an analysis of the numbers.</dd>
<dd>The B'Tselem numbers do have a place in the article, however there is no reason that they should get <i>three</i> places. They are currently employed in the conflictbox, and have a paragraph dedicated to their release and conclusions. Further presenting a large and formal reproduction of a chart easily retreivable by merely clicking on the link lends undue weight within the article to this one point of view over all others.</dd>
<dd>I hope that you'll take these points into consideration. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 23:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are the only editor removing the sourced Amira Hass quote. Previous editors removed the unsourced version. My frustration is in your continual removal of sourced info from 2 different articles on the Arab-Israel conflict in an obvious POV-favoring way. In both articles you did not answer my question about where to put the sourced info in the article. You said you did not like it being in certain places in both articles. But did not answer my question about where it should go. I will be reporting your actions to the appropriate incident boards.</p>
<p>As usual you ignored the substance of my comment concerning the B'Tselem numbers. I asked where the additional overall B'Tselem stats should go, and in what form. You obfuscated again, and talked about the main stat of total deaths, and the 2006 stats in the article. The chart has overall stats which are not in the article. I will be including this refusal to allow sourced info also in my report to the appropriate incident boards. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 00:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how you can see my specific replies as obfuscations, but I'm certainly attempting to be quite clear. The Amira Hass editorial should not appear alongside actual analysis and sets of numbers from experts, just like no other opinion piece should be mixed with the data. The B'Tselem numbers have an entire paragraph dedicated to the newest report alone, and there is no need to duplicate the linked chart in this article, which lends undue weight to this set of numbers above all others. If you really believe these concerns to be illegitimate, then by all means approach someone else, but please do not threaten or misrepresent either my actions or those of other editors on Talk. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 19:27, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am talking to you, not other editors. Haaretz reporter Amira Hass references her info by referring to her expert sources. Amira Hass references Shin Bet. Her info is as valid, or more valid, than the questionable organizations and their stats that you have allowed in the article. Such as the stats from the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism. Or the unsourced stats supposedly from Maariv. You allowed Haaretz reporter Zeev Schiff and his report on casualty stats in the article. But not Haaretz reporter Amira Hass.</p>
<p>Amira Hass references Shin Bet:</p>

<p>Wikipedia does not require that editors agree with POVs, only that they include all significant POVs. In the form of "X says Y". Amira Hass is a significant viewpoint. Click her name: <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amira_Hass_4c0a.html" title="Amira Hass">Amira Hass</a>.</p>
<p>You still haven't answered this question about the latest B'Tselem numbers: In what form will you allow the latest overall B'Tselem numbers in the article? I am not talking about the 2006 numbers. I am talking about the totals for the whole conflict. Why are you blocking these numbers? You are violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> by blocking sourced info from a particular viewpoint. Wikipedia asks people to discuss things with editors before taking disputes to incident boards. That is what I am doing. I am following Wikipedia procedure before going to an incident board. Probably this one:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>So if I take this info below out of chart form, and put it in prose form, will you block it? And if so, what will be your reason? You have already included longterm info from the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism. Also from Haaretz reporter Zeev Schiff. It is in list form. So lists are OK, but not charts? OK, then if I put the B'Tselem stats in list form you will not block it?</p>

<li>The <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabak.html" title="Shabak">Shin Bet</a> has the names of 2,124 Palestinian dead.</li>
<li>Out of the figure of 2,124 dead, 1,414 (or 66%) were said to be combatants (armed men and/or "terrorists"). The casualties are thus assigned to organizations:

<dd>Unfortunately it is hard to find a reliable source of statistics acceptable to all sides. Therefore we list several. Among them is B'Tselem, a controversial political advocacy group.

<dd>(Edit conflict) I'm puzzled as to what is unclear about this. Amira Hass's <i>editorial</i> does not belong alongside the statistics. The Ze'ev Schiff <i>report</i> on the Israeli statistics which she quotes <i>could</i> be included, and the 2004 version of that report <i>is</i> in fact included (though you seem to question the reliability of it despite Amira Hass's quoting). The B'Tselem numbers <i>are</i> included in both the conflictbox and in their own dedicated paragraph. However duplicating the linked chart on this page in addition to those lends undue weight. I am not sure what you meant by "I am talking to you, not other editors", but I still request that you both not misrepresent the actions of myself or other editors, and that you maintain a more calm and civil tone. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 22:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Amira Hass quote reports on the number of combatants versus civilians killed. From Shin Bet info. She is reporting. All casualty stats are controversial. WP:NPOV requires that all significant viewpoints be included. I edit several casualty pages. I know what I am talking about, because I have had numerous discussions about it on other talk pages. Sometimes we had to go to admins or an incident board to resolve things. People are understandably highly opinionated about casualty stats and conflict pages. I do my very best to put out balanced info, stats, and opinions on stats. From all sourced significant viewpoints. I am on a mission from God. Just kidding.&#160;:)</p>
<p>You two are currently blocking the most recent and comprehensive B'Tselem stats in any form, chart or otherwise. That has got to stop. Feel free to put the B'Tselem chart stats on the page in any form you want. But wikipedia guidelines require that those stats be in the article. Not just the total deaths. But the breakdown of those total deaths also. That kind of info is what encyclopedia readers are interested in. They should not just be getting comprehensive stats mainly from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabak.html" title="Shabak">Shabak</a> <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin_Bet_146e.html" title="Shin Bet">Shin Bet</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Policy_Institute_for_Counter-Terrorism_93c8.html" title="International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism">International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism</a>.</p>
<p>The article is not currently balanced as concerns casualties. And all casualties sections and articles have criticism too. So the Amira Hass info has to be in the article for that reason too. You can't have unsourced Maariv info, and then block sourced Haaretz criticism. WP:NPOV requires putting out fairly all significant viewpoints. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 01:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that the article, in its present form, does not appear to be balanced. If the details from the Schiff article to be included, then surely the B'Tselem information should be incorporated as well. Neither source appears to be definitive, and we should strive to attain some measure of balance between them.</p>
<p>I'd recommend including both charts in the footnotes section, or both in the main body of the article. Either outcome would be acceptable, as long as we're consistent.</p>
<p>A question for Timeshifter: are there any other sections of the article where you believe the Amira Hass quote would be appropriate? <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 06:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. If we could find good sources for the latest Shin Bet numbers in detail, then we could put them in the main casualties section. Then the Amira Hass analysis of those numbers could go in a subsection titled "analysis" or "controversies" or "criticisms" or ... Other analysis could go there too such as the Intrafada info. This way we could put the stats in the main section, and the differing analyses of those stats in the analysis subsection. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 07:26, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The numbers are an important aspect in this complex asymmetric conflict, but we see evidence that they are too often (mis)interpreted to lead the reader to one-sided conclusions.

<p>I have changed my mind. Since all the stats are controversial, and not neutral, then they should all go in the main casualties section, and not have some of them separated out into a subsection. See this excerpt below from a wikipedia guideline page section:</p>

<dd>Separating all the controversial aspects of a topic into a single section results in a very tortured form of writing, especially a back-and-forth dialogue between "proponents" and "opponents". It also creates a hierarchy of fact - the main passage is "true" and "undisputed", whereas the rest are "controversial" and therefore more likely to be false, an implication that may often be inappropriate. Since many of the topics in an encyclopedia will inevitably encounter controversy, editors should attempt to write in a manner that folds debates into the narrative rather than "distilling" them out into separate sections that ignore each other. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 01:35, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its very nice that a chart was put together, but anyone can access it on the B'Tselem website by following one of the two appearing references; including this third reproduction of that data, while a summary of the report and its conclusions already exists on this page would be giving it undue weight. I'm sure you would agree to the point if a second section was devoted to the Shabak numbers.

<dd>Another problem is that the Shabak breakdown of Palestinian deaths by group does not say whether these people were fighting at the time of their death.

<p>The only criticism which currently exists in the section comes from academic, expert sources.

I'm sure you would have a similar objection where someone to include some scathing editorial of B'Tselem's numbers etc. (in the examples you provided I saw either expert sources quoted or articles that elicited a specific response from the numbers' compilers; if indeed there are opinion pieces which I missed, then they should not be there) <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 17:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your argument, which is a legititmate one. I guess this should be moved to another article. However, i don't think that htis is OR. I sourced what I inserted.

<dd>Sourced information can still be OR when we draw original conclusions from it - its one of the trickier parts of the policy, but one we should all be aware of. I didn't mind your notes per se, but my point was that you left them during a period that I <i>wasn't</i> active, with the exception of the last which you left as soon as I had made my first edit (and on this Talk as well =D).

<dd>It can be made clear in the article that Amnesty International's criticism came before this Intifada. And it is not "a bit much" to ask you to explain your editing. Several times you have deleted sourced material I have put in a couple articles, and then disappeared for a few days, only to come back and delete it again. All while not explaining your edits.

<dd>In June of 2002, Israel's <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knesset.html" title="Knesset">Knesset</a> debated and passed a bill which allowed for indefinite detention of people suspected of being combatants against Israel - a bill which the Amnesty International called an attempt to undermine the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a>.</dd>

<p>The page in question has been deleted: <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accusations_against_Israel_of_war_crimes_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_d107.html" title="Accusations against Israel of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada">Accusations against Israel of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it was deleted in spite of no consensus to do so. See:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Accusations_against_Israel_of_war_crimes_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_c5be.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Accusations against Israel of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Accusations against Israel of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So who deleted it? I may file a complaint at the appropriate incident board as to the process used to delete it. I don't mind it being deleted if it followed wikipedia procedures, and it allowed for a merge.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that it was deleted unilaterally in spite of no consensus and no record of admin-only voting. And it was done in such a way that the material (in effect) was censored so that it could not be found and merged.</p>
<p>Wikipedia should not work unilaterally like that. I want to file a complaint against the wikipedia editor(s) or admin(s) that did this.</p>
<p>Material can not be merged if the material can no longer be found. Where is it? I found an old version here at Answers.com:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/accusations-against-israel-of-war-crimes-during-the-al-aqsa-intifada" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/accusations-against-israel-of-war-crimes-during-the-al-aqsa-intifada" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/accusations-against-israel-of-war-crimes-during-the-al-aqsa-intifada</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest people save that page, in case Answers.com follows wikipedia's lead in deleting it.</p>
<p>I want to see the latest version that was on wikipedia.

<dd>I think the spirit of Bless sins change was that it would be offensive and incorrect to introduce the article with a sentence similar to this in the first paragraph: "The al-Aqsa Intifada is the wave of violence that began in September 2000 between Arabs and Jews."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is more accurate to say "between Palestinians and Israelis." Actually the most accurate would be "between some Palestinians and some Israelis". Many other Palestinians and many other Israelis think some of their combatant compatriots are fanatic fundamentalists who want theocratic governments in their respective nations. I would like to see some sourced quotes on that. Because it is true. And it would provide some more balance to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For a long time the explanation for the name "Al-Aqsa" kept being deleted from the article. I could never understand that except in the context that some editors do not even want the Islamic point of view and roots of this conflict acknowledged. And the religious significance of Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount keeps getting downplayed in the article. As in he did not really know how inflammatory his visit would be. I would like to see more sourced quotes on that too. This article needs to respect <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and show all significant viewpoints and stop whitewashing and covering up the POVs of all the people involved in this conflict.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that their are many elements to this conflict. Religious, territorial, nationalism, infighting, brinkmanship, etc.. Combined with politics internal to Palestine and Israel. The most obvious angle left out is that Ariel Sharon and Hamas need each other since neither wanted Oslo to go anywhere. The extremists on each side wanted to scuttle the middle path. I would like to see some sourced info on that too. As in "The al-Aqsa Intifada is the wave of violence that escalated dramatically starting in September 2000 between the more-religious elements of Palestine and Israel who did not want the middle path of the Oslo process and the Road Map. All with the tacit approval of the fundamentalist-supported President George Bush who believed he was fulfilling the beliefs of the Rapture wackos in the Republican Party."</dd>

<p>Tiamut, your version was predicated on and filled with unsourced claims, and used pretty weak sources, most of them non-reliable. "The vast majority is non-violent"? Find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for that claim. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jayjg, your entirely partial intervention ignoring the discussion in progress just above on the issue of reliability is quite respectfully, and yet wholly unwelcome. I continue to work to understand what you (and Tewfik) mean by reliable sources, (in particular after your defence of the Mr. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pipes_f5d3.html" title="Daniel Pipes">Daniel Pipes</a> as a reliable source for the article on the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_people.html" title="Palestinian people">Palestinian people</a>, who Pipes argues do not exist). I guess that the non-violent Palestinian peace center who did a historical and present-day review of Palestinian resistance <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:lp_oquSksboJ:www.afsc.org/israel-palestine/documents/PalestinianNonviolentResistancetooccupaltion.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:lp_oquSksboJ:www.afsc.org/israel-palestine/documents/PalestinianNonviolentResistancetooccupaltion.pdf" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>doesn't make the grade for you. Or did you not see it since Tewfik reverted. I will work to find others. But for now, considering that the rest of the section lacks sources - I have placed fact needed citations where appropriate - I suggest you work on that and let me work on finding sources that pass your unbelievably POV way of evaluating credibility. In particular, can you find a source that support that the involvement of people in the activities of militant groups is greater than their involvement in non-violent activities? I don't think you will be able to, since general strikes are common and involve tens of thousands of people, whereas guerilla cells number much less and carry out faw fewer activities.

I already explained my objections to it above, but I'll restate the most important one: it doesn't support the claim that a majority of Palestinian activity was nonviolent.

<dd>From that wikipedia guideline is this: "Just as underlying facts must be sourced, claims of consensus must be sourced in the presence of differences of opinion. Claims that 'most' or 'all' scientists, scholars, ministers (or rabbis or imams etc.) of a religious denomination, voters, etc. hold a view require sourcing, particularly on matters that are subject to dispute. In the absence of a reliable source of consensus or majority view, opinions should be identified as those of the sources."</dd>

<dd>There are elements of both. And more. Is the Israeli response to peaceful demonstrations in Israel or the West Bank during the time of the intifada always warlike or always peaceful? Generalizations serve no useful purpose and are against wikipedia policy. There are many different groups involved. There are many levels of resistance. There are many levels of reaction and overreaction. There is no centralized control on either side. Israeli settlers do not coordinate all their actions with the IDF. Hamas and Fatah don't like each other very much at some points. Other times they work out agreements. There are many other groups involved besides them. Some peaceful demonstrations become violent. Some of the more radical elements who come to any demonstration worldwide will often become violent. Are the peaceful demonstrators lumped together with the more violent ones when the events are described later? Claims must be backed up. Details must be fleshed out. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 17:28, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please do not engage in revisionism. Every single reliable source characterizes AAI as a violent, non-peaceful movement, and so do its organizers and leaders. I have studied social movements that have peaceful and militant members, such as the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture_of_the_1960s.html" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">Counterculture of the 1960s</a>; the non-violent and militant elements are entirely distinct. This particular intifada may or may not be part of a broader social movement that includes non-violent participants, but the AAI is in and of itself defined by violence. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 20:30, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you have identified the problem. I fail to find death and human suffering "funny". Let's examine this "peace movement" in the interviews with the "Mothers of the Martyrs of the Aqsa Intifada" by Nahed Habiballah in <i>Arab Studies Quarterly</i>: Interviewer: Are you angry with anyone? Mother: The Jews, if I will get a chance to avenge my son, I would but there is no way that I will let my other son do that. Interviewer: Do you support peace with Israel? Mother: Not this kind of peace, they took all of our land and they want to give us half of it now, not even a half, maybe a quarter and they refuse to give us Jerusalem and this is the problem. If they really wanted peace, they would have never entered Al-Aqsa mosque, it is not theirs, why would they go there? Al-Aqsa is ours, it is the Muslims'. All our fighting and massacres are for the sake of Al-Aqsa." Mother: ...We hate the Israelis so much now; even when peace comes it will be hard to deal with them because they caused us so much pain..." Mother:...somebody from the Palestinian side should take all these young Palestinians and teach them and arrange them to attack not with stones but with something that would hurt the Israelis. Mother: If I have the chance to become a suicide bomber, I would. Mother: But it was in his blood, to fight for his country, for the Al-Aqsa mosque. We used to tell him that if he wanted to do something, he should do something big, he is going to die anyways so at least he should harm the Jews, like the martyrs who bomb themselves (suicide bombers). If one Israeli died in return for my son's death then that would have made it easier. Mother: We told him that it is in his blood to fight, so if he wants to fight he should become a suicide bomber. Mother: It would be better if our children could fight, kill and come back sate and sound to their families. Mother: He wanted to fight and hurt the Israeli soldiers. Mother: Again, if he died while hurting them then I would not be as hurt. I am sad because they are killing us, although they say that these martyrs go to heaven, still if lot every Palestinian that is killed there is a Jew that is killed in return, it would be better. Mother: Interviewer: Did he ever show any signs of anger towards the Israeli soldiers and the occupation? Mother: He would be happy whenever he heard about a suicide bombing. Frankly, he used to adore Hamas, he would become ecstatic when he would hear that Hamas had inflicted losses among Israeli lives. Mother: It comforts me because I know that my son is alive in the heavens and it allowed peace to enter my heart when she talked about the status of martyrs in the heaven and how they are able to absolve the rest of his family. It relaxes me because I know that my son is alive and he is beside his God. If it were a normal death, he would have never reached this higher status. He is a martyr, he is a young martyr which means that he does not have many sins, may he put a good word for us with God." —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 23:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe you did not understand the sarcasm in the comment in question. But what you wrote was great fucking stuff, and should be in the article. Since it is sourced. Your comments illustrate some of my previous comments about the religious fanatic wacko elements in this conflict. There are more rational peaceful elements, too. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 07:12, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's exactly the point I was going to make Abu Ali - that there is a context to the violent resistance AND it's a minority of the population that is involved. Those opposing the inclusion of this information have not provided a source that claims that the bulk of Palestinians are involved in militia activities and the way the article was written made it seem that was the case. It was (and still is in other areas) very POV. I would further add that "At 50% of Palestinians killed during the al-Aqsa Intifada 'did not take part in the hostilities and were killed by Israeli security forces' <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>," (something that should be noted in the Israeli section on tactics perhaps?) and "Finally, it must be stated that Palestinian resistance, which for the most part has been a nonviolent and popular movement, shall continue as long as the circumstances that contributed to its commencement remain in place." <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/baroud05172005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.counterpunch.org/baroud05172005.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 20:47, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"al-Aqsa Intifada" is an over-arching conflict name used as shorthand. There are many levels to this conflict. There are many levels to most conflicts. Some violent and some non-violent. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 21:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Al-Aqsa Intifada is characterized as a <i>violent</i> conflict, not as non-violent. You may want to consult some actual sources, like the <i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i>, which describes the second intifada: "...took the form of a militant but essentially unarmed civil insurrection...largely made up of confrontations at the military checkpoints that either mark the entrances of Palestinian towns or are used to control settlement roads (Netzarim Junction) and religious sites (Joseph's Tomb, Rachel's Tomb)... The main result of this new geography is that the Israeli army is better able to confine the insurgency to specific sites and to protect itself in secure strategic locations. This geography of the "battle front" has also made possible the greater militarization of the clashes.. Another difference from the first intifada is the existence of armed Palestinian security forces (with about 40,000 Palestinian police under arms). Among other things, this allows for greater justification for the use of Israeli military force...the majority of armed actions have been led by "Fatah tanzim," a murky designation that includes Fatah's street cadre (often with privately licensed weaponry) and by elements of the PA Preventive Security Force. Armed Palestinian action succeeded in clearing the Israeli military from only one site, Joseph's Tomb in Nablus...In most other cases where armed cadres got involved in clashes in the midst of civilian demonstrations, there were soon popular calls for their retrenchment, since the main result was that Israeli sharpshooters could exact a higher price...religion has played a major mobilizing and symbolic role in the current uprising, even while the participation of Hamas has been largely confined (at least to the time of writing) to raising Hamas flags at funeral processions. Instead, the clashes have been dominated by secular groups (mainly Fatah, but with a visible presence of the Popular Front and other leftist organizations). Nevertheless, with al-Aqsa as the main trigger for the uprising, religious fervor has been a salient dimension that at times has engulfed the entire conflict...Following the Palestinian assault on Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, Israelis burned mosques in Tiberias and Acre and attempted burnings in Jaffa; Palestinians then burned the Jericho synagogue. At the start of the uprising's third week, several imams used the Friday sermon--widely broadcast on Palestinian TV on 13 October--to emphasize the Muslim-Jewish dimension of the conflict. In Gaza and Nablus, Hamas elements attacked several cafés and stores selling alcoholic beverages...The religious dimension is what initially galvanized Palestinian Israelis and led to a wave of clashes inside Israel.... <b>(Information Minister Yasir `Abid Rabbuh observed) that the intifada should be transformed into a peaceful means of protest and that the use of gunfire should be abandoned in view of the disastrous retribution from the Israelis</b>..."<a href="http://www.palestine-studies.org/final/en/journals/content.php?aid=2755&amp;jid=1&amp;iid=118&amp;vid=XXX&amp;vol=134" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.palestine-studies.org/final/en/journals/content.php?aid=2755&amp;jid=1&amp;iid=118&amp;vid=XXX&amp;vol=134" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 03:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More great stuff. It shows both the violent and nonviolent elements of the resistance. Wikipedia is supposed to show the whole picture. Sourced. And not whitewashed. And no censorship of the more peaceful protests, funerals, strikes, etc.. No bullshit downplaying of any of the violent aspects either. From both sides. See also:</p>

<dd>You are correct that "Wikipedia is not censored", which is why no one is objecting to this material based on claims that it is pornographic or otherwise offensive. I think the primary objection is due to the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">undue weight</a> given to this theory that the Intifada is primarily known as a non-violent phenomenon. That there may be a non-violent component is reflected in the article, but barring <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">sourcing</a> showing that this conception of the Intifada is now held by many prominent sources, it would be improper for Wikipedia to present that view. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 08:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It only takes a relatively few suicide bombers to kill hundreds of Israeli civilians. And it only takes a relatively small number of trigger-happy Israeli military, settlers, tank crews, artillery crews, and pilots to kill thousands of Palestinian civilians. That does not mean that the majority of Palestinians or Israelis are violent. And the thousands of peaceful demonstrators and strikers (in Israel and Palestinian territories) far outnumber the violent combatants. So the correct thing to do is to describe specific events and not generalize in an attempt to propagandize for either side. We at wikipedia are far too sophisticated for such primitive bullshit propaganda from any side. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 09:54, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Timeshifter, I would like to thank you for your comments throughout this discussion. You are right on point. Tewfik, it's funny that you would claim that your objection is to the emphasis placed on non-violence, when you actually just deleted the entire paragraph in question when I first posted it, without any explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109958578" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109958578" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, thus accounting for the heading under which this discussion is taking place. The section was entirely POV in that it only described violent resistance and totally ignored the wider popular resistance in which most segments of the Palestinian population (from children to grandparents) take part. I will work on incorporating some of Viriditas' sources (thank you so much for finding that article in the JPS that characterizes the majority of resistance as "militant" but "unarmed" - I need to better flesh out the tactical distinction between passive non-violent resistance, active non-violent resistance, stone-throwing, armed resistance against military targets, armed action against civilian targets, etc, etc. So much food for thought on this page. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:00, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And yet again, Jayjg wikilawyers in an attempt to prevent the inclusion of information that challenges his POV. And yet again, he ignores that the sources do in fact say that the majority of resistance is non-violent. And not just mine, but also Viridatas' source, cited to prove that the formulation was wrong, characterizes the resistance as "militant" but largely non-weaponized. Also, the claim that Electronic Intifada does not meet WP:RS is totally false. Jayjg also knows this because he has previously tried to have it excluded, a fact noted at the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Zionism_1ce1.html" title="Talk:Anti-Zionism">Talk:Anti-Zionism</a> page.

<dd>See my user page for links to notice boards. Those notice boards link to other more specific notice boards. I suggest describing the incidents of nonviolent resistance, their number, etc.. That will best allow the readers to decide whether it is the "majority" of resistance. I suggest also putting some analysis from all sides about the percentage of violent versus nonviolent resistance. And noting carefully the source of that analysis. Also, putting some analysis of the analyzers themselves. And then link to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_coverage_of_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_4cba.html" title="Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, etc. for further info.

If you spent less time reading and citing policy and more reading and writing encyclopedic content, we could probably get a whole lot more done. And I compromise a lot Tewfik.

<dd>Thanks for that Timeshifter. But it seems some are not partaking in the tea party. Tewfik just reverted my edits that incorporated the new sources and added the "militant" but unarmed info saying it is was POV again. He also undid a number of other edits, deleting a sourcer of casualty figures for Palestinians. I reverted his edits again while retaining some wiki-linking and other minor additions. While I try very hard to retain parts of his edits that are sourced and not part of our dispute, he doesn't do the same with me. Everywhere I go, no matter how many hours of research I do, he reverts. I invite you to check out his and my user contributions to see what I mean. Note that I do not mass revert his additions to articles, but he always does mine, which is how we get into these edit wars. I was hoping his behaviour would change after this extended discussion, but he just jumps right back into the same pattern. I don't want to waste time reverting one another's work but instead want to build on one another's additions. A revert is just so rude I think. It's part of why we have 3RR, but 3RR doesn't mean make 3 reverts every 24 hours, it designates a maximum allowed. I'm at my wit's end really. How do I get this kind of behaviour reviewed? <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 11:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I did a lot of work yesterday converting links to reference links, and there is a lot more to do. Sometimes Tewfik is careful and does good edits. But many times he loses patience and goes against wikipedia guidelines. Sometimes I do too. Everybody needs to cool down. See this talk page please: <a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAlleged_human_rights_violations_by_Israel_during_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_ef10.html" title="Talk:Alleged human rights violations by Israel during Al-Aqsa Intifada">Talk:Alleged human rights violations by Israel during Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>‎ --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 19:00, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, one may need to try various links in order to find this "disappearing" article. I have a copy of the article here:</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_Archive._Old_page_070e.html" title="User:Timeshifter/Al-Aqsa Intifada Archive. Old page">User:Timeshifter/Al-Aqsa Intifada Archive. Old page</a></dd>
<dd>I will continue to convert the links to reference links there. That way the relevant sourced parts of the article can be copied to the appropriate wikipedia pages. ‎--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 23:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>‎ That is not an accurate reflection of what has gone on here. For example, I "full reverted" to reinclude all of the minor corrections etc. that you removed when you "mass reverted" my work. I am always careful to include any reasonable edits of yours. I'm really sorry that you choose to view this as an attack on your culture, or as somehow connected to me or others viewing you or Palestinians as 'violent and not human', when we are clearly discussing very specific points that have exactly nothing to do with that. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 17:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tiamut, El-Intifada is not a RS.

<dd>Hit there Humus! With respect, there is no consensus as to whether Electronic Intifada is a reliable source, but it has been used before many times. Sometimes RS is determined by what the source is being used for. In this case, I added this addition to the end of a sentence on casualities: "an average of 93 people per month - the highest monthly average since its invasion of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> in 2002 <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article5951.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article5951.shtml" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>." Can you explain how this is disputable? It is simple math based on the casulaty statistics available which are used from reputable sources (all cited) throughout the article at EI. How does this fail RS exactly? <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 12:34, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Electronic Intifida does not meet the requirements of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>; your views on "consensus" are irrelevant to that. It is a self-published source with no editorial oversight, intended to promote a partisan POV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:26, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
