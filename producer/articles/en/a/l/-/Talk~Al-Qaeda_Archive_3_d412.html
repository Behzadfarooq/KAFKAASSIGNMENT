<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pro Al-Qaeda Web sites</span></h2>
<p>Recent news reports have been claiming that the Internet is full of Web sites in support of Al Qaeda. For example, Arnaud de Borchgrave of the Washington Times claims (8/24/6): <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20060823-084117-7697r.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20060823-084117-7697r.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>Disillusioned Muslim youngsters are increasingly attached to the global Muslim community via the Internet -- and are angry at what they consider the anti-Muslim policies of the local government where they live. The estimated 5,000 pro-al Qaeda Web sites include recipes for mixing nail polish remover and hair bleach and detonating the explosive cocktail with the flash unit from a throwaway camera.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I find myself very skeptical of these claims. For example, typing "nail polish", "hair bleach" and "camera" as search terms in Google gets 1240 results, of which the vast majority appear not to be radical Muslim sites. I have seen too many reports of infringements on the free speech of ordinary American polemicists to believe that Al Qaeda enjoys free reign in Western countries or anywhere else. But then again... that search wouldn't bring up pages in Arabic. What's the truth here?Mike Serfas 03:11, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NB You CAN mix acitone and a Base to make an explosive, but you need MUCH higher concentrations than are avalable to the genral public. You also need lab with cooling equipment and a blast proof vacume cabenet (so not you average school stuff) to get anything near a good reactant leval, and even if you did no sain person would do this by had because it is still very volitial, and you risk killing yourself. This is just scair mongering which all seems to come from one "security expert" on ITV news saying "it might be some sort of new bomb, like a liquid explosive, which we cannot detect" in relation to questions as to why airports were closed after a bomb threat when there is suposed to be bomb detecting equipment in the airports.</dd>

<p>There is no such thing as a "binary bomb" where you mix two substances and they blow up. Houshold or otherwise. 62.232.65.170 15:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There *are* such things as binary explosives; these are explosive compounds which are highly unstable in their final form but (relatively) safe when separated into two precursor compounds. Thus, the safe way to handle them is to keep them separate until the last possible moment; they aren't mixed together to form the actual explosive until just before detonation. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJaceCady_b994.html" title="User:JaceCady">JaceCady</a> 20:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">growth or reduction of Al Qaeda?</span></h2>
<p>According to the recent White House report, Al Qaeda has been "signifcantly degraded" but the opposition Democrats are claiming something like more than a doubling in it's size since its dispersion from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Which is it?</p>
<p>A section on the grown or shrinkage of Al Queda might be helpful.</p>
<p>--213.42.21.76 10:30, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the gist is that the central command structure is pretty much wrecked, but Al Qaeda has more followers. There's a shift from Al Qaeda-the-organization to "Al Qaedaism." I don't have any sources on this, and I'm not sure how to make it encyclopedic. It's just the gist I'm getting. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 16:28, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Um ok. I think that is whats called a conspiracy theory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A conspiracy theory used to be about someone conspiring to do evil but now it is a convenient way of argumentum ad homenum (sorry if wrong spelling) which is latin for attacking the speaker not the argument. In other words, if any evidence or questions come up that go against the flow, call it a conspiracy theory to discredit the person delivering the message. So if there is no evidence they exist except for many false arrests in US, UK, Oz and Canada these last few years lets dismiss it and tell that person they are a conspiracy theorist. The real conspiracy theory would be that Al Qaeda does exist LOL</p>
<p>In response to the BBC's assertion that Al Quida was a term cooked up by the USA and then later adopted by the group, I would like to see a comment about possible uses of "Al Quida" by detainees before 9/11, specifically by Khalid Sheik Mohammed during his detention *where he was allegedly waterboarded. There seems to be some evidence that he used the term, though his testimony, considering the torture and lack of transparency, is questionable.</p>

<p>I suggest adding a section to the article about the existance of al-Qaeda. It is worth commenting on. We have sources which are pro and con. I'm not familiar with all of the ones listed, but I recommend someone who is to atleast flesh out a basic section discussing the evidence and lack thereof. --24.91.40.69 06:54, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
There is already a section - the lead paragraph ends with the words "does not exist". If wiki says it, it must be true. The conspiracy theory is actually the theory that says al-qaeda is a powerful group that runs everything that the US doesn't like. The theory expands into high-tech abilities that verge on the miraculous ( not only the ability to bring down skyscrapers with kerosene, but also the ability to bring down buildings across the street that they didn't even hit ( these guys must be strong ). Al-qaeda is just the latest boggieman for nitwits to believe in - there have been many in the past, there will be others in the future.</p>
<p>Kerosene? Wow, looked like a pair of passenger jets to me. WTC7? You mean the building that was smashed by falling debris from WTC1/2? Come on, don't be so pig-ignorant. Clearly Al-Queada does exist as a political/militant movement with some loose organisational ties, unified in their efforts under a common banner.</p>

<p>I just wanted to add one comment. The notion that Al Qaeda is somehow a Sunni organization is a factual mis-statement. It is a loose network of Islamic radicals with similar goals. A more accurate reference would be to Militant Islam. A review of the major known participants and 9-11 Hijackers shows a number of individuals who are not Sunni associated with Al Qaeda. Labeling this organization as Sunni is erroneous and does a great injustice to Sunni Muslims. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.242.136.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.242.136.2_4eed.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.242.136.2">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Can we please remove these lines (or at least stick them in a revised form later in the document) they lend a very non-POV air to the piece. "Al-Qaeda has been linked to multiple acts of terrorism against U.S. interests and is known for planning and executing the September 11 attacks on New York's World Trade Center and The Pentagon. In response, the United States launched a war against Afghanistan, whose government was providing safe haven to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda members."

<dd>Cerebral Warrior, please realise that this argument is the exact reason we have a policy of not using terms such as 'terrorist'. It is subjective to label an organisation, government or person as being terrorist - for example I think the US government is a terrorist organisation due to their tactics, also the UK government is also a terrorist organisation. However, I do not think that these should be included in any article and are purely my views. It is a common held view that Al-Qaeda is a terrorist group but that is not enough. It has to come from an official organisation such as the CIA, MI6 etc... - which is what we have at the moment. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 17:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>al-Qaeda admits to doing everythnig that would fit them under the term "terrorist" according to the majority of the world population, and world governments, as represented by the UN, US, UK, and NATO. They have told their followers to carry out terrorist acts, and people have commited terrorist acts in their name. The issue of if they are terrorist organization being POV is moot, terrorism to you may be a negative implication, but its simply a tactic, and some are proud to be terrorists. If they were not they would attempt to move away from what clasifys them as such, like Hamas and Hazbollah did. Those proud of the title stick to the same tactics such as Abu Sayyaf. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 20:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have told you the policy, it is quite simple. There are many people in Iraq who think that al-qaeda are not a terrorist organisation. This is enough to make the term subjective. It is a word that carries negative connotations. As I said before, asking for attribution and citation is normal and should be done in all cases. Also, NATO and UN do not represent every person on the earth - their view is also an opinion.</dd>
<dd>I have just had a quick chat on the <a href="../../../i/r/c/WP%7EIRC_f8e0.html" title="WP:IRC">IRC</a> channel about this and the overwhelming majority there see's the word as being subjective but thinks it should be included with citations and attribution.

I am not asking for the word to be removed completely, just that it is used in a NPOV manner.</dd>

<dd>I was asked to comment here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pierre Henry Bunel</span></h2>
<p>I was going to edit this portion of the article out, but I figured I should say something here first. I don't really think the entry about Pierre Henry Bunel belongs in this article; it makes sweeping claims about the al-qaeda organization (going as far as to say that OBL is an "American agent"), and its only source is a left-leaning Canadian website.<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrojan_traveler_abd3.html" title="User:Trojan traveler">Trojan traveler</a> 16:59, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The guy is right about what he is sayin. There is no such terrorist organisation called Al-qaeda, its a generic brand name. OBL was indeed an American agent, he was part of a CIA trained list of Mujahideen that operated through the Pakistan ISI. The claims are 100% correct. That is not the only source of this information. This is well documented territory. I think you should leave the editing to those who are fully aware of the background on this.</li>

<li>Wikipedia's policy clearly states that an organzation should not be labeled as terrorist; instead, it should specify who/what labeles the organzation as such.

<li>Wikipedia defines <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> as the <i>the calculated use of violence (or threat of violence) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature; this is done through intimindation or coercion or instilling fear.</i> This debate does not concern whether or not the ideology of a terrorist organistion is justifiale, it concerns the fact that these organisations do use fear as a tool to achieve their political goals. Unless someone can prove to me that Al-Qaeda actions are not 1) Carried out to attain political, ideological goals. and 2) To attain those goals by instilling fear in the population of an area, we shall continue calling terrorists terrorists. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerebral_Warrior_22cc.html" title="User:Cerebral Warrior">Cerebral Warrior</a> 03:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>By that definition, the US government has engaged in numerous acts of terrorism. Police forces do it everyday. As mentioned above, the bombing of Hiroshima (and by extention Nagasaki) were both acts of terrorism on a large scale. So was the fire-bombing of Dresden. My Lai, the massacre at Wounded Knee, the assassination of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Hampton_1251.html" title="Fred Hampton">Fred Hampton</a>, the bombing of the <a href="../../../m/o/v/MOVE_f7f9.html" title="MOVE">MOVE</a> complex, need I go on? Can I now go to the page on the US governemnt and say it's a terrorist organization? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would say that the above policy does apply here. My mind does boggle a bit at the thought of someone not thinking that Al Qaeda are a bunch of terrorists, but I'm sure there is someone who doesn't. Al Qaeda members themselves, for one. So, go ahead and use the term "terrorist," but back it up with citations. For example "Al-Qaeda is suspected of [...] the 2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks in Egypt. [...]The attack was the deadliest terrorist action in the history of Egypt." Just say "according to so-and-so, the attack was the deadliest..." A pain-in-the-ass, but necessary. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 03:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Can those who oppose calling Al-Qaeda terrorists get me a link that shows any state officially stating that they "do not consider Al-Qaeda terrorists"? How can you just assume that there are "people out there" who do not call these guys terrorists? Anyway, isn't there a policy against undue weight being given to unimportant POVs? <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerebral_Warrior_22cc.html" title="User:Cerebral Warrior">Cerebral Warrior</a> 04:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why does it need to be a state? Does a government have more legitimacy than others? And I'm guessing that the Taliban (which used to be a state) did not think so. So there you go. And again, unless al-Qaeda has self-identified as terrorists, we have to cite who (and even if they do self-label themselves that, we should <i>still</i> cite it). And there is a policy against undue weight, but we are not saying that we should spend a lot of time trying to say they <i>aren't</i> terrorists, we are saying we should say who calls them terrorists. That does not violate undue weight. No one has tried to say they aren't terrorists from what I can tell, we just want the label attributed to who gives it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You thinkt he Taliban didnt see them as terrorists, do you have proof they didn't? You keep equating that because they didnt think they were wrong, that they didnt think they were terrorists. People can support them and still think they are terrorists. SO I ask do you have a citation regarding the Taliban? Also I have provided proof that UN and NATO think they are, hence we have now covered over 50% of the worlds population. And yes governments do have more say they represent the population within them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 10:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do you have proof that the Taliban <i>did</i> see them as terrorists? And I'm still waiting for your proof that Al Qaeda considered themselves to be terrorists. And while governments do have <i>more</i> say, they do not have absolute say. At best, governments represent the majority. Just because, hypothetically, the US government releases a statement that "Democrats are stupid doodooheads" does not mean that we can call the Democrats stupid doodooheads in their article without attribution. Furthermore, just how many of those countries <i>actually</i> think that Al Qaeda is a terrorist group and how many are just saying what we tell them to? NATO, certianly, but with some of the Muslim majority countries, well, being bombed back to the stone age does tend to offend. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 14:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed. I've been saying this forever it seems like on this and numereous other pages. We can't label groups terrorists, we need to say <i>who</i> has called them that. Terrorist is an inherently pejorative term. I wouldn't go to a page on George W. Bush and say "George W. Bush is a jackass", even though I think it's true. I'd have to cite notable sources that say so. And yes, I do consider al-Qaeda a terrorist group. Still, it's not acceptable to label them as such without giving a source and attributing it to said source. BTW, that page on words to avoid is merely a guideline, not a policy. Still, it makes sense and should be followed for all the reasons outlined above and on the guideline page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>IF you look at the intro and that is with 5 minutes work I have added NATO, UN, Afghanistan and I am sure in a few minutes can find Iraq. That means more then 50% of the worlds governments call them terrorists, doesnt it get to the point where you should be saying only country X and the Taliban beleive they are not terrorists, and there is no proof presented so far that any country on the world believes they are not. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 10:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Members of al-Qaeda see themselves as the servants of God, and they are willing to use any tactics to carry out their god's will. Labeling them as terrorists is not subjective; it is labeling the tactics that they use to carry out their mission. It says nothing about the mission they are trying to carry out, it simply describes the tactics that they use to try and carry it out. It does not bring right and wrong into the equation, it simply describes the military tactics that they use. It is not a description of purpose, or a description of morality; it is a description of military tactics, period. <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a></b> 05:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'Terrorist' is a POV term (rightly or wrongly) and as such should always be accompanied by attribution and citation. There are people who think they are not terrorists - we do not have to show sources to prove this as this is not how our verifiability policy works. Instead, we have a simple policy that asks for a citation to show that every person (which is what is technically being claimed by using it as a blanket description) think they are. If people think it should be included without source/attribution please can they provide a good reason why we whould ignore the long standing and stable guideline <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a>? Otherwise I think discussion about the term would be better suited for that page really as the gripe is with that guideline and no its use on this page.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 06:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Who? Do you have some citations for that, that al-Qaeda think they arent terrorists? You can be a servant of god and still at terrorist.

<dd>Cerebral, your argument is flawed. Following your reasoning, I could insert "George Bush is unintelligent" into his article, and then ask you to give a quote saying he is intelligent before removing it. And as for saying that using terror as a tactic makes you a terrorist, read Ungovernable Force's comments again. The standard procedure is to use "militant islamist": It means the same thing, without being pejorative. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 07:09, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Its like stating labelnig a person Jewish is bad because person X thinks jews are evil. Your logic is highly flawed and instead of attempting to make all these straw man arguements before Halloween, you would be better served to present a source countering my point that over 50% of the world population see's AQ as terrorists and they have never denied it even though they have made over 50 statements to the world since they were created. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 11:57, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well it looks like we're going to be waiting a long time as consensus across the community seems to be already decided on the issue - hence the guideline. That is why I have asked you to provide reasons why we should simply ignore it - but you are failing to respond on that point. Instead you are persisting in requesting a source for something that doesn't need it as is shown by the various examples used above. As Yandman says, using your logic we could easily insert 'George bush is unintelligent' into his article and be able to leave it there unless a citation stating he was intelligent was provided. This would be a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. So, again, just in case you missed my requests, why should we ignore <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> which is a guideline and therefore reflects a consensus decision by the community?-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 10:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The value of ones intelligence can be gauged many ways, however the military tactic someone uses cannot. Your logic is further flawed cause I can simply cite his education to prove that statement wrong, further its a BLP violation, which calling AQ a terrorist organization isnt.

<dd>Erm.... you are conscious of the fact that he didn't get into Yale on the strength of his grades? And the point we've been trying to make is that military tactics always involve a certain degree of "instilling fear into their hearts before they taste our cold steel bla bla bla". All armies do this (as Ungovernable showed us: <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_massacre_fb94.html" title="My Lai massacre">My Lai massacre</a>). AL-Qaeda does this, as well as making attacks on military targets (warships, for example). Anyway, it's also a matter of style/tone. "terrorist" has certain connotations, so we avoid it. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 12:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Keep your assumptions to yourself about peoples educations. Further your arguement is flawed because there is also a certain conotation to militant islamist is there not?

<dd>Also there is a discussion about those being terrorist attacks, the difference is the state of war, or so people argue. I personally think they were terrorist attacks, bombs were dropped on civilians in one case that deciamted a non military population, in the other case civilians were just butchered. But the majority of the world has not called either of those terrorist attacks on the record, which is the difference, the majority of the world has called AQ a terrorist organization on the record. So at what point do you stop lsiting countries when its over 100? and noone disputes it including them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>At what point do you stop and realize that instead of naming every country that does, you should instead name the ones that do not see them as terrorists. By inclusion of NATO and UN, that brings the total nations to well over 100. Should I really list them all point by point? So the title would instead read Countries 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... 99 all see al-Qaeda as a terrorist oraganization, a charge they have never disputed nor any other nation has denied. That is just silly, but if its what is preffered I will break down the UN and NATO into the individual countries that have ever called AQ terrorists and create an intro 10 lines long of just the countries to show that noone thinks they are not terrorists. This NPOV issue is silly as noone is saynig they are not terrorists including themselves. The idea that terrorist label is negative is faulty because many people arguing it are not in favor of those tactics, however many people in middle eastern countries are in favor of them and take them to martyrdom etc. You are applying your western idealogy to a non-western culture and military. To simply label AQ as a militant islamist group is to equate them with MILF, LTTE, etc creating a slippery slope of comparison. So is AQ = MILF, AQ = PKK, AQ = Black Panthers (militants)? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I support describing the actions of Al-Qaeda terrorism, the group a terrorist organization, and the members terrorists. This is accurate, and consistent with the usage in most reliable sources.

<p>I think policy should be followed here and terrorist should not be used unless it is said who believes this. While in this case it may seem clear cut, it opens the gates to others than aren't so certain. If you use terrorist here you must look again at articles on other supposedly terrorist groups - how many people must think of them as terrorists before it can be accepted as fact beyond dispute? So, for the sake of consistency, and to make certain there is no subtle violation of NPOV, I think the 'designated as terrorist by...' approach is better. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 14:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

We should convey to our audience the full consequences of the act by describing what happened. We should use words which specifically describe the perpetrator such as "bomber", "attacker", "gunman", "kidnapper", "insurgent, and "militant".

<p>Calling someone a terrorist isn't POV. It is a word that denotes the person or group being described employs terror tactics. Crashing planes into buildings is a terror tactic. It has nothing to do with whether or not the people employing the tactics are fighting for a country, an ideal, or anything else. It has nothing to do with their purpose; it has to do with whether or not the tactics they employ causes terror in the people being attacked. They are not allowed to define whether or not they are terrorists. Terrorist has nothing to do with POV, it describes military tactics and nothing else, <i><b>nothing</b></i>. <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a></b> 23:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I mean, what is a terrorist organisation? One that is only involved with carrying out acts of terror, one that is predominately involved, one that is occasionally involved...?

The Twin Towers had no strategic value when it comes to war other than instilling terror in the citizens of America through their destruction, and that is why it was a terror tactic. By extension, because Al Qaeda was the organization that used the tactic, that makes them terrorists. I have sources for th terror 9-11 caused and the main purpose of the attcks being terror, if you would like them, but any chimp could find them. <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a></b> 22:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody is doubting the fact that 9-11 was a terrorist attack. But there is a difference between naming a specific action as terrorism and a whole organisation as terrorist. Would you say that any organisation that has ever been involved in an act of terror is a 'terrorist organisation'? Would terrorism have to be their main activity? Would they have to be directly involved in the attack or would peripheral involvement count (funding, supplying equipment, etc.)? Consistency would be hugely difficult over articles and necessarily POV because we'd have to set up a Wikipedia definition of a terrorist organisation. Is it not far simpler and less POV to let other organisations do the defining, and Wikipedia do the citing?<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To say that it is not a terrorist organization is to <b>completely</b> disregard their military strategy. That is acceptable under some circumstances, but because Al-Qaeda is a militant organization that one word is a dramatic fact for the article to loose. No, I would not call any group that has been involved in a terror attack terrorist, but terror is Al-Qaeda's biggest strategy and most effective weapon.

<dd>I don't know enough about Al-Qaeda to say whether the majority of Al-Qaeda attacks are terror attacks. But who's to say that the majority of attacks being of a terrorist nature should be the deciding factor? You say that you wouldn't call any group that has been involved in a terror attack terrorist, so you must be imposing some sort of system for classifying a group as terrorist or not. But I believe that sort of system is necessarily POV - there is not a universal definition of terrorism, let alone of what comprises a terrorist group. The article makes it clear that many countries and organisations view them as a terrorist group - it's not being ignored - but the article should refrain from making a personal judgement for the reasons above. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 09:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Remember that we have to use reliable, independent sources when we are making statements. The US is not an independent source here, neither is the UN: "In general, the most reliable sources are books and journals published by universities; mainstream newspapers; and magazines and journals that are published by known publishing houses".

When referred to in an article, 9/11 is "the 11 September suicide hijackings" (which, IMHO, is the perfect phrasing: it gives the facts without giving an opinion) or the "the 11 September attacks". Al-Qaeda is jut referred to as a " militant islamist organisation". I quoted the specific policy further up in the discussion. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 15:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, using 'terrorist' or 'freedom fighter' here on Wikipedia isn't useful and causes more problems than the (zero) problems that it solves.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Breakdown of the "Voting"</span></h3>
<p>In case anybody is interested, here's how the breakdown of the above "straw poll" looks:</p>
<p>In favor of abiding by <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> and only reporting what sources label Al Qaeda - not labeling Al Qaeda "terrorist" while in editorial voice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ungovernable Force</li>
<li>Crazyeddie</li>
<li>Hemlock Martinis</li>
<li>Localzuk</li>
<li>yandman</li>
<li>That Guy, From That Show!</li>
<li>Vindheim</li>
<li>Trebor</li>
<li>Derex</li>
<li>Weregerbil</li>
</ul>
<p>In favor of calling Al Qaeda "terrorist" while in editorial voice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cerebral Warrior</li>
<li>Nuclearzer0</li>
<li>THL</li>
<li>Tom Harrison</li>
</ul>
<p>That's 10 people in favor of abiding by <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a>, 4 people against. 10/14 is about 71%, well over the 2/3rds majority that convention defines as consensus. Could we please end this discussion now? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 00:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you guys kidding me? I'm pro-Chechen, but in case of a Chechen terrorism I write "terrorism" and "terrorists". There are even categories, like "Chechen terrorists". And I thought it's okay. But now, this is crazy. Osama is not a terrorist, somehow, but <a href="../../../a/s/l/Aslambek_Abdulkhadzhiev_9ba9.html" title="Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev">Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev</a> is?

<dd>It's sneaky: a terrorist category added to the article. It's (IMO) and end-run around the using the phrase 'terrorist' in the article...adding a terrorist category or infobox is a common tactic to try to fly 'under the radar' regarding Words To Avoid.</dd>

<dd><i>NOTE: I removed the category</i> . Also, regarding info-box issues, you may want to see what happened when I tried to fix a infobox that is (IMO) all-too-often used to dodge <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">'not terrorist organization in traditional sense'</span></h2>
<p>I removed this phrase because it is both liable to misrepresentation and because its actually wrong.</p>
<p>The idea that AQ is unusual in not be centrally directed and coordinated is completely mistaken. Most 'organizations' that use guerilla tactics are actually loosely bound collections of independent groups who operate under a common name. The original Spanish guerilla during the Napoleonic wars was decentralized with independent bands of partisans operating autonamously with no central coordination.</p>
<p>The same was true of the modern terrorist movements such as Action Directe and The Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof gang). The original leaders were quickly rounded up and imprisoned. Other groups with little direct connection to the original used the same name. In the case of the RAF they continuously changed the name they operated under 'XYZ Commando' where XYZ was a recently killed terrorist, so the press and authorities used the name RAF.</p>
<p>AQ is an ideologically driven terrorist movement. It uses exactly the form of organization that ideologically driven movements use. Centrally directed and organized terrorist movements are much more common irridentist movements with long histories. The Provisional IRA had few Republican rivals because its the end product of a 150 year plus movement.</p>
<p>Incidentally even the PLO was organized in the same manner as AQ. Arrafat was the leader of Fattah, one of the factions that came together to form the PLO. Not only did the various PLO factions continue to operate independently after nominally joining together but they also spent a good bit of time killing each other.</p>
<p>So no, this is not a new form of organization for terrorists unless you are a lazy journalist. --66.31.39.76 18:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm surprised to see no new information incorporated in this article as yet from the recent Newsnight interview. I added a stub, based on the pseudonym used.</p>
<p>The programme was specifically stated to be his story told from his perspective (therefore not NPOV) although Newsnight stated they were able to verify the key details. Are there any editors with background knowledge of this area that would be able to extract suitable information from this to present in a NPOV? I'm curious about how much of the info in that programme was genuinely new information that was not previously known about Al-Qaeda, or about the assertions that the information on which the USA justified the Iraq war would have been specifically presented to the interrogators acting on behalf of the USA for the purpose of making them go to war. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoive_433f.html" title="User:Stoive">Stoive</a> 05:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
