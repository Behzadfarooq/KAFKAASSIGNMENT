<hr />
<p>I hesitate to list anything as being of "GA" status or better unless it has actually already received that official designation, which is why I chose "B", which often just means that the article might be GA quality, but just hasn't been "officially" recognized as such yet. Having said that, the fact that the "Chemistry" section is only one sentence long is probably the primary single drawback the article has. It should either be expanded or removed and the content placed in another section. All sections of articles should probably be at least three sentences long. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Al-Kindi isn't persian .... and Al-Kindi is drived from Kinda a great arab tribe.</p>
<hr />
<p>since when Al-Kindi become a persian? he is from an arab tribe in yemen ... so please check this link before making any changes on the article: <a href="http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/kindi/default.htm--" class="external free" title="http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/kindi/default.htm--" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/kindi/default.htm--</a><a href="../../../2/1/2/User%7E212.138.64.176.html" title="User:212.138.64.176">212.138.64.176</a> 00:52, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Many Famous Arab Scientist and Thinkers are being falsely claimed persians!! If not stopped or at least hindered, the credibility of Wikipedia will heavelly suffer!! And this is not good neither for the arabs nor for the persians. Since both of them use this Free Encyclopedia for the promotion of their great cultures.</p>

<p>Have you actually read the text to which you link? Try reading the introduction by its translator. <i>It's a different al-Kindi...</i> Why are there so many anti-Islamic bigots on Wikipedia at the moment? They seem to crop up everywhere. A "myth of a great Islamic philosopher" indeed! Every book on the history of philosophy includes al-Kindi, and correctly describes him as an important Islamic philosopher. No-one considers al-Kindi to be one of the greatest Islamic philosophers, mind you, though he's in the top ten, perhaps the top six. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:18, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The line in the middle reads: "والحمد لله رب العالمين وصلى الله على نبيه محمد.." or "..And praise to Allah, and may peace be upon His prophet Muhammed". I suppose that should be conclusive.</dd>

<dd>Mel Etitis, I really appreciate your effort in maintaining the qualtity of this article. In this article, al-kindi, is mentionend as the "philosopher of the arab" (by arab is meant arab-speaking not arab ethnic, this should be mentioned in the article), but by whom? and when? I have other qoutes on al-kindi from german and english scientists on al-kindi, will you keep deleting them? <a href="../../../j/i/d/User%7EJidan_3a52.html" title="User:Jidan">Jidan</a> 20:28, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact the article says: "he was often referred to simply as 'the Arab philosopher'" (by which was meant, according to all my sources, ethnic Arab — another reason that calling him Persian is anomalous). That's the point, of course — he was often referred to in that way; I know of no reason to suppose that <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Nadim_68fe.html" title="Ibn al-Nadim">Ibn al-Nadim</a> was the first person so to refer to him. If he <i>was</i> the first, though, then that is better mentioned in the article. Generally speaking, it's <i>much</i> better to add important material to the article than to stick it into a quotations section. Would you mind placing the quotations you have in mind here, so that we can discuss how best to incorporate them into the article? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:48, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>The article states that he is "the greatest philosopher of Arab descent", yet the explanation for this value judgement only gets one short paragraph. More space is devoted to his accomplishments in medicine.</li>
<li>This article needs a more clear attribution of claims. In one passage, this article states that "al-Kindī was the first pharmacologist to determine and apply a correct dosage for most of the drugs available at the time" -- an important point, yet this statement needs an authority to confirm it. Although there are 2 sources cited at the bottom, it is not clear how their writings relate to the details given here; even to say "John Doe believed that X" -- then list the publicaiton where John Doe made this claim under "References" would be an improvement.</li>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>When I came across the al-Kindi article, I thought it would benefit from some attention.</p>
<p>My initial assessment of it was that what was already there was good. However, I considered two things:</p>
<p><b>1) What needs improving:</b> it needs referencing and in places correcting (if you read Richard Adamson, he says Kindi actually set out to merely introduce Greek thought to the Islamic world, but ended up reinterpretting alot of it in a very original manner - the article says he was unoriginal!).</p>
<p><b>2) What needs adding:</b> more work needs to be done on his contributions to Islamic Philosophy and his specific ideas in certain areas. It would also be good if we could do likewise with his contribution to the sciences.</p>
<p>This should hopefully get al-Kindi recognized as a "good article"!</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas, please feel free to post them up.</p>

<dd>Ok, lots added to both philosophy and scientific contributions, references from no less than three seperate academic books (although if anyone could add some more it would be great!), I think this article is on track to becoming a "good article". After I add the sub-section on optics to the section "Contributions" I think I might try to get it put forward. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexander.Hainy_b3e1.html" title="User:Alexander.Hainy">Alexander.Hainy</a> 10:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the article has wondeful potential to become a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article</a> and maybe even a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a>, especially because of the significance of this personality in the light of Islamic philosophy. there are some things needing improvement if the article is to attain GA status.</p>
<ul>
<li>per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, the introduction should be comprehensive enough to quickly overview and "sum up" the article as well as the topics discussed therein.. take a look at some <a href="../../../f/a/-/Category%7EFA-Class_biography_articles_b2a1.html" title="Category:FA-Class biography articles">FA-class biography articles</a> to see prime examples of how such is achieved.</li>
<li>when introducing academics, include something very brief about who the academic is. for example, "According to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Corbin_a7ff.html" title="Henry Corbin">Henry Corbin</a>, professor in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_studies.html" title="Islamic studies">Islamic studies</a>, Al-Kindi was born in <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a> ..." or something like that, from then on he can be referred to simply as Corbin where mention of him is appropriate. the point of this is for ease of reading, you ideally don't want readers having to open a new window to find out who Corbin is (making things more arduous than necessary) when you can succinctly give the reader the essential information within the article.
<ul>
<li>as a sub-point to this, if you are making statements of fact upon which there is no academic dispute, you can get rid of mentioning the academic altogether and (for example) simply say "Al-Kindi was born in <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a> ...". attribution becomes important when elements of individual opinions (i.e. which may be disputed) are involved. this doesn't seem to be much of a concern in the article however.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>from what i could gather in my quick overview, the article says very little about the criticism he must have received, especially from traditionists of his time, as well as the asha'rites and hanbalites of later times. i only managed to find one line which discussed opposition (i.e. that of Ghazzali and his response to the philosophers), although i am sure academics must have covered opposition to him in more depth than just this.</li>
<li>please be sure to comb through the article with the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">manual of style</a>, its <a href="../../../b/i/o/MoS%7EBIO_c605.html" title="MoS:BIO">biography supplement</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/e/t/WP%7EBETTER_1a15.html" title="WP:BETTER">guide on writing better articles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>i haven't gone into too much depth over content issues as i've only briefly scanned over the article, but it's been given B-class status (upon the threshold of GA i would imagine), and i would definitely recommend submitting it for a formal <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">peer review</a> and perhaps re-enlisting it as a GA candidate afterwards. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alexander, there are some suggestions from the current peer review you haven't implemented yet. A quick look shows that you have not changed the varying spellings of the subject's name to the correct spelling. Also, you have the links and the other names like al-Farabi, which is spelled differently in the article. Perhaps you should check if you have applied all the suggestions in the current PR first.

<p>"Misspelling"? Throughout this Talk page lately, there's been a curious unargued agreement that a certain spelling of "al-Kindī" and other names, which ignores normal Wikipedia practice (to use the most common accurate form of a name) and, in calling one of the most common forms "wrong" and "misspelt" (as below) and therefore changeable without explanation, also goes against Wikiquette.</p>
<p>In what sense are these forms wrong? They're used in most of the modern sources at which I've looked. Debates at related pages have been resolved in favour of this sort of transliteration; I haven't checked yet, but I expect that consensus has been overturned by this new and (to my mind, at least) unwelcome approach. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 21:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mel Etitis, I didn't understand your last comment well, but I think we have an issue with the naming of the article. Perhaps it's just a misunderstanding. All guidelines, discussions, and consensus are in favor of using a common, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Arabic%29_1a3c.html#Primary_transliteration" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Arabic)">primary transliteration</a> for an article's name. <b>Al-Kindi</b> is, in this case, the more common and used name. A <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> search yields <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Al-Kind%C4%AB&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Al-Kind%C4%AB&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2" rel="nofollow">433 results</a> for <b>Al-Kindī</b> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0oGklXEWrNFu9cAIQtXNyoA?p=Al-Kindi&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2&amp;x=wrt" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0oGklXEWrNFu9cAIQtXNyoA?p=Al-Kindi&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">212,000</a> results for <b>Al-Kindi</b>, where it also recognizes him and provides search filters.

<dd>Yahoo or Google searches show what's most common on the Internet; the use of diacritics and other symbols is much less common on the Internet than in published sources, in which "al-Kindī" is much the more common transliteration. Little or no discussion was offered on this, above — the claim was simply made that "al-Kindi" is standard. Just pulling recent general reference books books off my shelf, the following use "al-Kindī" (I didn't find one that used "al-Kindi", except for a book dating from the 1970s):

<dd>You said it yourself, "the use of diacritics and other symbols is much less common on the Internet". As much as the references you provided are significant, the 800-something books in an Amazon book search and the Yahoo search results do have their significance too. You can't treat Wikipedia the same way printed references are treated; for example, any English user will probably search for al-Kindi, not al-Kindī when he looks for information online. This issue has been discussed deeply in many talk pages. As an example, see the recent debate in <a href="../../../s/h/i/Talk%7EShia_Islam_9621.html#Poll_for_clarification" title="Talk:Shia Islam">Shia Islam talk page</a>. I, myself voted 'support' for the strict transliteration and 'weak support' for the standard English transliteration, but I now know it is, although inaccurate, the preferred transliteration.</dd>

<dd>Mel, I agree with your points, believe me (see my votes/opinions in the Shia Islam debate), but I am only working according to the consensus. Personally, I would definitely love to name every article accurately, but then again this isn't <i>my</i> encyclopedia.&#160;:) Remember there are thousands of articles with Arabic names that are rendered somehow inaccurately, like <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> (Ṣaddām Ḥusayn). Perhaps a poll should be started to gain consensus for naming this article, what do you say?&#160;:) ← <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum"><font color="DimGray"><i><b>A</b></i><small>NAS</small></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/a/User_talk%7EAnas_Salloum_76de.html" title="User talk:Anas Salloum"><font size="-3"><font color="DodgerBlue">Talk?</font></font></a></sup> <small>15:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>The policy has always been that we use the most common and readily understandable form (as used in English-language publications). That's overwhelmingly "Saddam Hussain", not Ṣaddām Ḥusayn, but in cases like this one, where the person is referred to almost solely in academic or semi-academic works, the most common academic or semi-academic form is used. In other words, we don't have, and have never claimed to have, a consistent method of transliteration; it depends upon the individual case.</p>
<p>A poll is a last (and much deprecated) resort. A formal discussion of a renaming proposal would be fine, though. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 15:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Change</b>. I've given above a list of (recent) publications, none of them very specialised, which use the "al-Kindī" form. I found one older text that used "al-Kindi", and some references to mediæval texts that followed theoir usage of "Alkindi". "Al-Kindī" is the most common form in printed texts; as it's a name that's almost only found in academic or semi-acadmic texts, the most common usage in those is what's required. (Usage on the Internet is misleading; our preferred usage of "Pelé", for example (as listed at the naming conventions page) would have to be changed if we went by a Google search.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:34, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> While there are sources that use "Al-Kindī", they are only a minority. Al-Kindi <i>is</i> a primary transliteration. It is used more commonly <i>both</i> in published <i>and</i> online sources. A large results margin (see above discussion) found using Yahoo search goes in favor of the transliteration Al-Kindi. Also a Google Book search yields <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=Al-Kindi&amp;btnG=Search+Books" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=Al-Kindi&amp;btnG=Search+Books" rel="nofollow">798 results</a> for books using "Al-Kindi" and only <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=Al-Kind%C4%AB&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=Al-Kind%C4%AB&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">61 results</a> for "Al-Kindī". Encyclopedia Britannica uses <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045485/Yaqub-ibn-Ishaq-as-Sabah-al-Kindi" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045485/Yaqub-ibn-Ishaq-as-Sabah-al-Kindi" rel="nofollow">al-Kindi</a>. The guidelines state that a primary transliteration, one used by 75% or more of the references, should be used if available. Al-Kindi is clearly the primary transliteration since it is much more widely used everywhere. While I would love to go with a more accurate title, it simply wouldn't satisfy the consensus. ← <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum"><font color="DimGray"><i><b>A</b></i><small>NAS</small></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/a/User_talk%7EAnas_Salloum_76de.html" title="User talk:Anas Salloum"><font size="-3"><font color="DodgerBlue">Talk?</font></font></a></sup> <small>19:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</small>

<dd>No, no. I mean, my support is based rather on WP:AMOS arguments. Still, I am opened to both solutions. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 13:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Move</b> Use of overdashes is widely used in scholarly, and even quality popular literature (in the case of al-Khwārizmī definitely more than 75%) and is therefore the primary transliteration. Web pages are not a reliable source to find out common usage, due to technical restrictions which prevent(ed) people from using diacritics. —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R. Koot">Ruud</a></i> 09:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>On the whole, I prefer <i>Al-Kindi</i> without diacritic, in the title. The three books Mel cites from the Google books use macrons for all Arabic names, without discrimination; this is not Wikipedia style. (One of them references Al-Kindi only by full name and only in footnotes, which are often more pedantic than main text; our article titles should be less pedantic than main text.) I would read <a href="../../../a/m/o/WP%7EAMOS_486c.html" title="WP:AMOS">WP:AMOS</a> as recommending the simple form when it is clear what that simple form is, as here. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 22:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. In a field more familiar to me, footnotes will often include untranslated Greek, when the text always translates; or Greek in the Greek alphabet, where the main text transliterates. Don't Arabists work the same way? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 00:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've no idea; I'll ask (my College has two Arabists, whom I should see at lunch today). It's not really relevant to this question, though; I've never seen a text in any subject area in which a <i>name</i> is printed differently in the text and the footnotes. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
