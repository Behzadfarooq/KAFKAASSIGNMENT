<p>In <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>, <i>Razi</i> means "from the city of <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_%28city%29.html" title="Ray (city)">Rayy</a> (also spelled Ray, Rey, or Rai, old Persian Ragha, Latin Rhagae -formerly one of the great cities of the World)", an ancient town on the southern slopes of the Elburz Range that skirts the south of the Caspian Sea, situated near <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>. In this city (like <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avicenna.html" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>) he accomplished most of his work.</p>
<p>In his early life he could have been a jeweller (Baihaqi), a money-changer (<a href="../../../c/f/2E/Cf..html" title="Cf.">Cf.</a> Ibn abi Usaibi'ah) but more likely a lute-player who changed his interest in music to alchemy (cf. ibn Juljul, Sa'id, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Khallikan_1b74.html" title="Ibn Khallikan">ibn Khallikan</a>, Usaibi'ah, al-Safadi). At the age of thirty (Safadi says after forty) he stopped his study of alchemy because its experiments caused an eye-disease (Cf. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Biruni_98a7.html" title="Al-Biruni">al-Biruni</a>), obliging him to search for physicians and medicine to cure it. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Biruni_98a7.html" title="Al-Biruni">al-Biruni</a>, Baihaqi and others, say this was the reason why he began his medical studies. He was very studious working night and day. His teacher was 'Ali ibn Rabban al-Tabari (<i>Cf.</i> al-Qifti, Usaibi'ah), a physician and philosopher born in Merv about 192 (808 C.E.) (d. approx. 240 (855 C.E.)). Al-Razi studied medicine and probably also philosophy with ibn Rabban al-Tabari. Therefore his interest in spiritual philosophy can be traced to this master, whose father was a Rabbinist versed in the Scriptures. According to Prof. Hamed Abdel-reheem Ead, Professor of Chemistry at the Faculty of Science, University of Cairo (<i>Cf</i>. the Alchemy Website): " (...) Al-Razi took up the study of medicine after his first visit to Baghdad, when he was at least 30 years old, under the well-known physician <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Sahl_Rabban_al-Tabari_2525.html" title="Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari">Ali ibn Sahl</a> (a Jewish convert to Islam, belonging to the famous medical school of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabaristan.html" title="Tabaristan">Tabaristan</a> or <a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrcania.html" title="Hyrcania">Hyrcania</a>). He showed such a skill in the subject that he quickly surpassed his master, and wrote no fewer than a hundred medical books. He also composed 33 treatises on natural science (not including alchemy), mathematics and astronomy (...)."</p>
<p>Al-Razi became famous in his native city as a physician. He became Director of the hospital of Rayy (<i>Cf.</i> ibn Juljul, al-Qifti, ibn abi Usaibi'ah), during the reign of Mansur ibn Ishaq ibn Ahmad ibn Asad who was Governor of Rayy from 290-296 (902-908 C.E.) on behalf of his cousin Ahmad ibn Isma'il ibn Ahmad, second Samanian ruler. Razi dedicated his <i>al-Tibb al-'Mansuri</i>to Mansur ibn Ishaq ibn Ahmad, which was verified in a handwritten manuscript of his book. This was refuted by ibn al-Nadim', but al-Qifti and ibn abi Usaibi'ah confirmed that the named Mansur was indeed Mansur ibn Isma'il who died in 365 (975 C.E.). al-Razi moved from Rayy to Baghdad during Caliph Muktafi's reign (approx. 289-295 (901-907 C.E.)) where he again held a position as Chief Director of a hospital.</p>
<p>After al-Muktafi's death in 295 (907 C.E.) al-Razi allegedly returned to Rayy where he gathered many students around him. As <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Nadim_68fe.html" title="Ibn al-Nadim">Ibn al-Nadim</a> relates in <i><a href="../../../f/i/h/Fihrist.html" title="Fihrist">Fihrist</a></i>, al-Razi was then a <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaikh.html" title="Shaikh">Shaikh</a></i> (title given to one entitled to teach) "with a big head similar to a sack", surrounded by several circles of students. When someone arrived with a scientific question, this question was passed on to students of the 'first circle'. if they did not know the answer, it was passed on to those of the 'second circle'... and so on and on, until at last, when all others had failed to supply an answer, it came to al-Razi himself. We know of at least one of these students who became a physician. Al-Razi was a very generous man, with a humane behavior towards his patients, and acting charitable to the poor. He used to give them full treatment without charging any fee, nor demanding any other payment. When he was not occupied with pupils or patients he was always writing and studying.</p>
<p>This fact might have been the cause for the gradual weakening of his sight which finally resulted in becoming blind in both eyes. Some say the cause of his blindness was that he used to eat too many broad beans (<i>baqilah</i>). His eye affliction started with cataracts and ended in total blindness. The rumor goes that he refused to be treated for cataract, declaring that he "had seen so much of the world that he was tired of it." However, this seems to be an anecdote more than a historical fact. One of his pupils from Tabaristan came to look after him, but, according to al-Biruni, he refused to be treated proclaiming it was useless as his hour of death was approaching. Some days later he died in Rayy, on the 5th of Sha'ban 313 (27th of October, 925 C.E.).</p>

<p>Razi studied medicine under <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Sahl_Rabban_al-Tabari_2525.html" title="Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari">Ali ibn Rabban al-Tabari</a>, however, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Nadim_68fe.html" title="Ibn al-Nadim">Ibn al-Nadim</a> indicates that he studied philosophy under al-Balkhi, who had travelled much and possessed great knowledge of philosophy and ancient sciences. Some even say that al-Razi attributed some of al-Balkhi's books on philosophy to himself. We know nothing about this man called al-Balkhi, not even his full name.</p>
<p>Razi's opponents, on the contrary, are well-known. They are the following:</p>
<p>1. Abu al-Qasim al-Balki, chief of the <i>Mu'tazilah</i> of Baghdad (d. 319 AH/931 CE), a contemporary of al-Razi who wrote many refutations about al-Razi's books, especially in his <i>Ilm al-Ilahi</i>. His disagreements with al-Razi entailed his thoughts on the concept of 'Time'.</p>
<p>2. Shuhaid ibn al-Husain al-Balkhi, with whom al-Razi had many controversies; one of these was on the concept of 'Pleasure', expounded in his <i>Tafdll Ladhdhat al-Nafs</i> which abu Sulaiman al-Mantiqi al-Sijistani quotes in his work <i>Siwan al-Hikmah</i>. Al-Balkhi died prior to 329/940.</p>
<p>3. Abu Hatim al-Razi became the most important of all his opponents (d. 322 AH/933-934 CE) and was one of the greatest Isma'ili missionaries. He published his controversies with al-Razi in his book <i>A'lam al-Nubuwwah</i>. Because of this book, al-Razi's thoughts on Prophets and Religion are preserved for us.</p>
<p>4. Ibn al-Tammar (seemingly being abu Bakr Husain al-Tammar, says Kraus) was a physician and he too had some disputes with al-Razi, which is documented by abu Hatim al-Razi in <i>A'lam al-Nubuwwah</i>. Ibn al-Tammar disagreed with al-Razi's book <i>al-Tibb al-Ruhani</i> but al-Razi counteracted this. In fact, al-Razi wrote two antitheses:</p>
<p>(a) First refutation of al-Tammar's disagreement with <i>Misma'i</i> concerning 'Matter'.</p>
<p>(b) Second refutation of al-Tammar's opinion of 'the Atmosphere of subterranean habitations'.</p>
<p>5.Following are authors as described by al-Razi in his writings:</p>
<p>(a) al-Misma'i, a <i>Mutakallim</i>, who opposed 'materialists', counteracted byan al-Razi's treatise.</p>
<p>(b) Jarir, a physician who had a theory about 'The eating of black mulberries after consuming water-melon'.</p>
<p>(c) al-Hasan ibn Mubarik al-Ummi, to whom al-Razi wrote two epistles with commentaries.</p>
<p>(d) al-Kayyal, a <i>Mutakallim</i>: al-Razi wrote a book on about his <i>Theory of the Imam</i>.</p>
<p>(e) Mansur ibn Talhah, being the author of the book "<i>Being</i>", which was criticized by al-Razi.</p>
<p>(f) Muhammad ibn al-Laith al-Rasa'ili whose opposition against alchemists was disputed by al-Razi.</p>
<p>6. Ahmad ibn al-Tayyib al-Sarakhasi (d. 286 AH/899 CE), was an older contemporary of al-Razi. Al-Razi disagreed with him on the question of 'bitter taste'. He moreover opposed his teacher Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi, regarding his writings, in which he discredited alchemists.</p>

<p>As chief physician of the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> hospital, Razi formulated the first known description of <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Smallpox appears when blood 'boils' and is infected, resulting in vapours being expelled. Thus juvenile blood (which looks like wet extracts appearing on the skin) is being transformed into richer blood, having the color of mature wine. At this stage, smallpox shows up essentially as 'bubbles found in wine' - (as blisters) - ... this disease can also occur at other times - (meaning: not only during childhood) -. The best thing to do during this first stage is to keep away from it, otherwise this disease might turn into an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a>."</dd>

<p>This diagnosis is acknowledged by the <i><a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_6bc1.html" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a></i> (1911), which states: "The most trustworthy statements as to the early existence of the disease are found in an account by the 9th-century Persian physician Rhazes, by whom its symptoms were clearly described, its pathology explained by a humoral or fermentation theory, and directions given for its treatment."</p>
<p>Razi's book: <i>al-Judari wa al-Hasbah</i> was the first book describing smallpox, and was translated more than a dozen times into <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and other European languages. Its lack of dogmatism and its <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocrates.html" title="Hippocrates">Hippocratic</a> reliance on clinical observation shows Razi's medical methods. We quote:</p>
<p>"The eruption of smallpox is preceded by a continued fever, pain in the back, itching in the nose and nightmares during sleep. These are the more acute symptoms of its approach together with a noticeable pain in the back accompanied by fever and an itching felt by the patient all over his body. A swelling of the face appears, which comes and goes, and one notices an overall inflammatory color noticeable as a strong redness on both cheeks and around both eyes. One experiences a heaviness of the whole body and great restlessness, which expresses itself as a lot of stretching and yawning. There is a pain in the throat and chest and one finds it difficult to breath and cough. Additional symtomps are: dryness of breath, thick spittle, hoarseness of the voice, pain and heaviness of the head, restlessness, nausea and anxiety. (Note the difference: restlessness, nausea and anxiety occur more frequently with 'measles' than with smallpox. At the other hand, pain in the back is more apparent with smallpox than with measles). Altogether one experiences heat over the whole body, one has an inflamed colon and one shows an overall shining redness, with a very pronounced redness of the gums."</p>
<p>Razi was the first physician to diagnose smallpox and <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measles.html" title="Measles">measles</a> and the first one to distinguish the difference between them.</p>

<p>Razi is also known for having discovered "allergic asthma," and was the first physician ever to write articles on <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allergy.html" title="Allergy">allergy</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunology.html" title="Immunology">immunology</a>.

In this article he dicusses seasonal 'rhinitis', which is the same as allergic asthma or <a href="../../../h/a/y/Hay_fever.html" title="Hay fever">hay fever</a>.

<p>Rhazes contributed in many ways to the early practice of <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmacy.html" title="Pharmacy">pharmacy</a> by compiling texts, in which he introduces the use of '<a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28element%29.html" title="Mercury (element)">mercurial</a> ointments' and his development of apparatus such as mortars, flasks, spatulas and phials, which were used in pharmacies until the early twentieth century.</p>

<p>On a professional level, Razi introduced many practical, progressive, medical and psychological ideas. He attacked <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatan.html" title="Charlatan">charlatans</a> and fake doctors who roamed the cities and countryside selling their <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostrum.html" title="Nostrum">nostrums</a> and 'cures'. At the same time, he warned that even highly educated doctors did not have the answers to all medical problems and could not cure all sicknesses or heal every disease, which was humanly speaking impossible. To become more useful in their services and truer to their calling, Razi advised practitioners to keep up with advanced knowledge by continually studying medical books and exposing themselves to new information. He made a distinction between curable and incurable diseases. Pertaining to the latter, he commented that in the case of advanced cases of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprosy.html" title="Leprosy">leprosy</a> the physician should not be blamed when he could not cure them. To add a humorous note, Razi felt great pity for physicians who took care for the well being of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princes.html" title="Princes">princes</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a>, and women, because they did not obey the doctor's orders to restrict their diet or get medical treatment, thus making it most difficult being their physician.</p>

<dd>The <i>al-Hawi</i> is not a formal medical encyclopaedia, but a posthumous compilation of Razi's working notebooks, which included knowledge gathered from other books as well as original observations on diseases and therapies, based on his own clinical experience. It is significant since it contains a celebrated monograph on smallpox, the earliest one known. It was translated into Latin in 1279 by <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faraj_ben_Salim_2dea.html" title="Faraj ben Salim">Faraj ben Salim</a>, a physician of Sicilian-Jewish origin employed by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_of_Anjou_1933.html" title="Charles of Anjou">Charles of Anjou</a>, and after which it had a considerable influence in Europe.</dd>

<dd>Razi was possibly the first Persian doctor to deliberately write a home Medical Manual (remedial) directed at the general public. He dedicated it to the poor, the traveler, and the ordinary citizen who could consult it for treatment of common ailments when a doctor was not available. This book, of course, is of special interest to the history of pharmacy since similar books were very popular until the 20th century. Razi described in its 36 chapters, diets and drug components that can be found in either an apothecary, a market place, in well-equipped kitchens, or and in military camps. Thus, every intelligent person could follow its instructions and prepare the proper recipes with good results.</dd>

<dd>Some of the illnesses treated were headaches, colds, coughing, melancholy and diseases of the eye, ear, and stomach. For example, he prescribed for a feverish headache: " 2 parts of <i>duhn</i> (oily extract) of <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose.html" title="Rose">rose</a>, to be mixed with 1 part of vinegar, in which a piece of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linen.html" title="Linen">linen</a> cloth is dipped and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compressed.html" title="Compressed">compressed</a> on the forehead".

<dl>
<dd>Rhazes's independent mind is strikingly revealed in this book and G. Stolyarov II quotes:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In the manner of numerous Greek thinkers, including <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, Rhazes rejected the mind-body dichotomy and pioneered the concept of mental health and self-esteem as being essential to a patient's welfare. This "sound mind, healthy body" connection prompted him to frequently communicate with his patients on a friendly level, encouraging them to heed his advice as a path to their recovery and bolstering their fortitude and determination to resist the illness and resulting in a speedy convalescence."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In his book <i>Doubts about <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen.html" title="Galen">Galen</a></i>, Razi rejects several claims made by the Greek physician, as far as the alleged superiority of the Greek language and many of his <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmology.html" title="Cosmology">cosmological</a> and medical views. He links medicine with philosophy, and states that sound practice demands independent thinking. He reports that Galen's descriptions do not agree with his own clinical observations regarding the run of a fever. And in some cases he finds that his clinical experience exceeds <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen.html" title="Galen">Galen</a>'s.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>He criticized moreover Galen's theory that the body possessed four separate "humors" (liquid substances), whose balance are the key to health and a natural body-temperature. A sure way to upset such a system was to insert a liquid with a different temperature into the body resulting in an increase or decrease of bodily heat, which resembled the temperature of that particular fluid. Razi noted particularry that a warm drink would heat up the body to a degree much higher than its own natural temperature. Thus the drink would trigger a response from the body, rather than transferring only its own warmth or coldness to it. (<i>Cf.</i> I. E. Goodman)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This line of criticism essentially had the potentiality to destroy completely Galen's Theory of Humours including Aristotle's theory of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Elements_1ca9.html" title="Four Elements">Four Elements</a>, on which it was grounded. Razi's own alchemical experiments suggested other qualities of matter, such as "oiliness" and "sulphurousness", or <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflammability.html" title="Inflammability">inflammability</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salinity.html" title="Salinity">salinity</a>, which were not readily explained by the traditional fire, water, earth, and air division of elements.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Razi's challenge to the current fundaments of medical theory were quite controversial. Many accused him of ignorance and arrogance, even though he repeatedly expressed his praise and gratitude to Galen for his commendable contributions and labors. saying:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I prayed to God to direct and lead me to the truth in writing this book. It grieves me to oppose and criticize the man <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen.html" title="Galen">Galen</a> from whose sea of knowledge I have drawn much. Indeed, he is the Master and I am the disciple. Although this reverence and appreciation will and should not prevent me from doubting, as I did, what is erroneous in his theories. I imagine and feel deeply in my heart that Galen has chosen me to undertake this task, and if he were alive, he would have congratulated me on what I am doing. I say this because Galen's aim was to seek and find the truth and bring light out of darkness. I wish indeed he were alive to read what I have published."</dd>

</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Razi believed that contemporary scientists and scholars are by far better equipped, more knowledgeable, and more competent than the ancient ones, due to the accumulated knowledge at their disposal. Razi's attempt to overthrow blind acceptance of the unchallenged authority of ancient Sages, encouraged and stimulated research and advances in the arts, technology, and sciences.</dd>

<p>Razi's interest in alchemy and his strong belief in the possibility of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmutation.html" title="Transmutation">transmutation</a> of lesser metals to <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">silver</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> was attested half a century after his death by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_an-Nadim_d676.html" title="Ibn an-Nadim">Ibn an-Nadim</a>'s book (<i>The Philosophers Stone</i>-Lapis Philosophorum in Latin). Nadim attributed a series of twelve books to al-Razi, plus an additional seven, including his refutation to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Kindi_85de.html" title="Al-Kindi">al-Kindi</a>'s denial of the validity of alchemy. Al-Kindi (801-873 CE) had been appointed by the Abbasid Caliph Ma'mum founder of Baghdad, to 'the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Wisdom_b9d2.html" title="House of Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>' in that city, he was a philosopher and an opponent of alchemy.<br />
Finally we will mention Razi's two best-known alchemical texts, which largely superseded his earlier ones: <i>al-Asrar</i> ("The Secrets"), and <i>Sirr al-Asrar</i> ("The Secret of Secrets"), which incorporates much of the previous work.</p>
<p>Apparently Razi's contemporaries believed that he had obtained the secret of turning <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a> into <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a>. Biographer Khosro Moetazed reports in <i>Mohammad Zakaria Razi</i> that a certain General Simjur confronted Razi in public, and asked whether that was the underlying reason for his willingness to treat patients without a fee. "It appeared to those present that Razi was reluctant to answer; he looked sideways at the general and replied":</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I understand alchemy and I have been working on the characteristic properties of metals for an extended time. However, it still has not turned out to be evident to me, how one can transmute gold from copper.

<p>Razi developed several chemical instruments that remain in use to this day. He is known to have perfected methods of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distillation.html" title="Distillation">distillation</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid-liquid_extraction.html" title="Liquid-liquid extraction">extraction</a>, which have led to his discovery of <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfuric_acid.html" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> (by dry distillation of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitriol.html" title="Vitriol">vitriol</a>, (<i>al-zajat</i>) and <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>. These discoveries paved the way for other Islamic alchemists, as did the discovery of various other <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mineral_acid.html" title="Mineral acid">mineral acids</a> by <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Musa_Jabir_Ibn_Hayyan_ac80.html" title="Abu Musa Jabir Ibn Hayyan">Jabir Ibn Hayyam</a> (known as Geber in Europe).</p>
<p>Razi dismissed the idea of potions and dispensed with magic, meaning the reliance on symbols as causes. Although Razi does not reject the idea that miracles exist, in the sense of unexplained phenomena in nature, his alchemical stockroom was enriched with products of Persian mining and manufacturing, even with <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonium_Chloride_b3b1.html" title="Ammonium Chloride">sal ammoniac</a> a Chinese discovery. He relied predominantly on the concept of 'dominant' forms or essences, which is the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoplatonism.html" title="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonic</a> conception of causality rather than an intellectual approach or a mechanical one. Razi's alchemy brings forward such empiric qualities as salinity and inflammability -the latter associated to 'oiliness' and 'sulphurousness'. These properties are not readily explained by the traditional composition of the elements such as&#160;: fire, water, earth and air, as al-óhazali and others after him were quick to note, influenced by critical thoughts such as Razi had.</p>

<p>al-Razi's achievements are of exceptional importance in the history of chemistry, since in his books we find for the first time a systematic classification of carefully observed and verified facts regarding chemical substances, reactions and apparatus, described in a language almost entirely free from mysticism and ambiguity. Razi's scheme of classification of the substances used in chemistry shows sound research on his part.</p>

<ol>

<dd>This last category contains additionally a description of other methods and applications used in transmutation:<br />
* The added mixture and use of solvent vehicles.<br />
* The amount of heat (fire) used, 'bodies and stones', <i>('al-ajsad' and 'al-ahjar)</i> that can or cannot be transmuted into corporal substances such of metals and Id salts <i>('al-amlah')</i>.<br />
* The use of a liquid mordant which quickly and permanently colors lesser metals for more lucrative sale and profit.</dd>
<dd>Similar to the commentary on the 8th century text on amalgams ascribed to Al- Hayan (Jabir), Razi gives methods and procedures of coloring a silver object to imitate gold (gold leafing) and the reverse technique of removing its color back to silver. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilding.html" title="Gilding">Gilding</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvering.html" title="Silvering">silvering</a> of other metals (alum, calcium salts, iron, copper, and tutty) are also described, as well as how colors will last for years without tarnishing or changing. Behind these procedures one does not find a deceptive motive rather a technical and economic deliberation. This becomes evident from the author's quotation of market prices and the expressed triumph of artisan, craftsman or alchemist declaring the results of their efforts "to make it look exactly like gold!". However, another motive was involved, namely, to manufacture something resembling gold to be sold quickly so to help a good friend who happened to be in need of money fast. Could it be Razi's alchemical technique of silvering and gilding metals which convinced many Muslim biographers that he was first a jeweler before he turned to the study of alchemy?</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Razi_12b4.html" title="Edit section: On existence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">On existence</span></h3>
<p>Razi believed that a competent physician must also be a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a> well versed in the fundamental questions regarding existence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He proclaimed the absolutism of <a href="../../../e/u/c/Euclidean.html" title="Euclidean">Euclidean</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanics.html" title="Mechanics">mechanical</a> time as the natural foundation of the world in which men lived, but resolved the dilemma of existent infinities by synthesizing this outlook with the atomic theory of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democritus.html" title="Democritus">Democritus</a>, which recognized that matter existed in the form of indivisible and fathomable <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quanta.html" title="Quanta">quanta</a>. The continuity of space, however, holds due to the existence of <a href="../../../v/o/i/Void.html" title="Void">void</a>, or a region lacking matter... This is remarkably close to the systems yielded by the discoveries of such later European scientists as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dalton_b7e4.html" title="John Dalton">John Dalton</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Planck_ebd9.html" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a>, as well as the observational and theoretical works of modern astronomer Halton Arp and Objectivist philosopher <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Miller_9421.html" title="Michael Miller">Michael Miller</a>. Progress, in the view of all these men, is not to be obstructed by a jumble of haphazard and contradictory relativistic assertions which result in metaphysical hodge-podge instead of a sturdy intellectual base. Even in regard to the task of the philosopher, Rhazes considered it to be progressing beyond the level of one's teachers, expanding the accuracy and scope of one's doctrine, and individually elevating oneself onto a higher intellectual plane." (G. Stolyarov II)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Razi is known to have been a free-thinking <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> philosopher, since he was well-trained in ancient <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> sciences although his approach to chemistry was rather naturalistic. Moreover he was well versed in the theory of music, as so many other Islamic scientists of that time.</p>
<p><a name="Metaphysics" id="Metaphysics"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Razi_12b4.html" title="Edit section: Metaphysics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Metaphysics</span></h3>
<p>His ideas on metaphysics were also based on the works of the great Greeks:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The metaphysical <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> of al-Razi, insofar as it can be reconstructed, derives from his concept of the five eternal <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principles.html" title="Principles">principles</a>. God, for him, does not 'create' the world from nothing but rather arranges a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a> out of pre-existing principles. His account of the soul features a mythic origin of the world in which God out of pity fashions a physical playground for the soul in response to its own desires; the soul, once fallen into the new realm God has made for it, requires God's further gift of intellect in order to find its way once more to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Freedom (philosophy)">freedom</a>. In this scheme, intellect does not appear as a separate principle but is rather a later grace of God to the soul; the soul becomes intelligent, possessed of reason and therefore able to discern the relative value of the other four principles. Whereas the five principles are eternal, intellect as such is apparently not. Such a doctrine of intellect is sharply at odds with that of all of Razi's philosophical contemporaries, who are in general either adherents of some form of Neoplatonism or of Aristotelianism. The remaining three principles, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a>, matter and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>, serve as the non-animate components of the natural world. Space is defined by the relationship between the individual particles of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter.html" title="Matter">matter</a>, or <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atoms.html" title="Atoms">atoms</a>, and the void that surrounds them. The greater the density of material atoms, the heavier and more solid the resulting object; conversely, the larger the portion of void, the lighter and less solid. Time and matter have both an absolute, unqualified form and a limited form. Thus there is an absolute matter - pure extent - that does not depend in any way on place, just as there is a time, in this sense, that is not defined or limited by <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_%28physics%29.html" title="Motion (physics)">motion</a>. The absolute time of al-Razi is, like <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter.html" title="Matter">matter</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite.html" title="Infinite">infinite</a>; it thus transcends the time which Aristotle confined to the measurement of motion. Razi, in the cases of both time and matter, knew well how he differed from Aristotle and also fully accepted and intended the consequences inherent in his anti-Peripatetic positions." (Paul E. Walker)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"(...) In short, while I am writing the present book, I have written so far around 200 books and articles on different aspects of science, philosophy, theology, and [[<i>hekmat</i>]] (wisdom). (...) I never entered the service of any king as a military man or a man of office, and if I ever did have a conversation with a king, it never went beyond my medical responsibility and advice. (...) Those who have seen me know, that I did not into excess with eating, drinking or acting the wrong way. As to my interest in science, people know perfectly well and must have witnessed how I have devoted all my life to science since my youth. My patience and diligence in the pursuit of science has been such that on one special issue specifically I have written 20,000 pages (in small print), moreover I spent fifteen years of my life -night and day- writing the big collection entitled <b>Al Hawi</b>. It was during this time that I lost my eyesight, my hand became paralyzed, with the result that I am now deprived of reading and writing. Nonetheless, I've never given up, but kept on reading and writing with the help of others. I could make concessions with my opponents and admit some shortcomings, but I am most curious what they have to say about my scientific achievement. If they consider my approach incorrect, they could present their views and state their points clearly, so that I may study them, and if I determined their views to be right, I would admit it. However, if I disagreed, I would discuss the matter to prove my standpoint. If this is not the case, and they merely disagree with my approach and way of life, I would appreciate they only use my written knowledge and stop interfering with my behaviour."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"In the "<i>Philosophical Biography</i>", as seen above, he defended his personal and philosophical life style. In this work he laid out a framework based on the idea that there is life after death full of happiness, not suffering. Rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, utilise his intellect and apply justice in his life.<br />
According to Al-Razi: "This is what our merciful Creator wants. The One to whom we pray for reward and whose punishment we fear."<br />
In brief, man should be kind, gentle and just. Al-Razi believed that there is a close relationship between spiritual integrity and physical health. He did not implicate that the soul could avoid distress due to his fear of death. He simply states that this psychological state cannot be avoided completely unless the individual is convinced that, after death, the soul will lead a better life. This requires a thorough study of esoteric doctrines and/or religions. He focuses on the opinion of some people who think that the soul perishes when the body dies. Death is inevitable, therefore one should not pre-occupy the mind with it, because any person who continuously thinks about death will become distressed and think as if he is dying when he continuously ponders on that subject. Therefore, he should forget about it in order to avoid upsetting himself. When contemplating his destiny after death, a benevolent and good man who acts according to the ordinances of the Islamic <i>Shari`ah</i>, has after all nothing to fear because it indicates that he will have comfort and permanent bliss in the Hereafter. The one who doubts the <i>Shari`ah</i>, may contemplate it, and if he diligently does this, he will not deviate from the right path. If he falls short, Allah will excuse him and forgive his sins because it is not demanded of him to do something which he cannot achieve." (Dr. Muhammad Abdul-Hadi Abu Reidah)</dd>
