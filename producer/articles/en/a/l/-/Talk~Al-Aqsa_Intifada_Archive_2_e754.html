<dl>
<dd>Please be more specific. It is not understood what do you want to "clean-up" or rewrite. POV is hotly debated in Talk page but IMHO it is pretty NPOV as well. But since the topic is contraversial, there will always be NPOV dispute, and hence proper notice was added. The article give important and broad information about the al-Aqsa intifada - with chronology of main events, statical summaries and overview of what happens there. I think there is no other place on the web with such a detailed and organized article over the second intifada. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 23:40, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please, seeing the form of the article makes me wish Alberuni were back... its just a piece of propaganda. Read how it starts! MathKnight, you are simply playing innocent. <a href="../../../u/f/f/User%7EUffish_567f.html" title="User:Uffish">Uffish</a> 22:51, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Parts of it are fine, others are POV. And Alberuni is back, though editing only rarely under a sockpuppet userid. That said, he was banned for good reason; his kind of disruption does not help Wikipedia at all, and the fix for POV is not more POV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:19, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Especially fierce battles took place at the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenin.html" title="Jenin">Jenin</a> refugee camp. 32 Palestinian militants, 22 Palestinian civilians, and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting, while many buildings were reduced to rubble and hundreds of Palestinian explosives were detonated."</p>
<p>Why is the Israeli detonation of Palestinian explosives mixed in with the casualties to make the casualties look less important? This would be like writing, "Palestinian militants killed 22 Israelis and the bus and several cars nearby were severely damaged"</p>

<b>Palestian</b> offical accused that hundreds of Palestinians were massacred in Jenin by the IDF, citing figures of 500 up to 3,000. <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20052002-032952-3644r" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20052002-032952-3644r" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>" Palestian? Illiteracy. Misquote of article trying to blame the "Palestians". The article actually states: "Israel's own actions led credence to the myth. The Israeli army barred the international media from Jenin as its forces drove into the city. The only sources that the media then had for what was going on there were from the Palestinians themselves. And in the inevitable confusion of battle, what the great 19th century military theoretician Carl von Clausewitz called "the fog of war" applied. At the time, both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities appeared unclear what was actually happening on the ground."</p>
<p>"However, these allegations were later found to be false, as inquiry by both '<i>Human</i> rights group and UN commission found that no massacre took place in Jenin." Illiteracy. The allegations were not false. Israel massacred 56 people inculding two dozen civilians. Human rights groups cited Israeli war crimes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you calling the killing of gunmen during combat a massacre, then you realy doesn't understand what that word means. You are the ONLY one insisting on a massacre in Jenin.

<p>These illiterate and factually incorrect edits were reverted dozens of times by Zionist editors who would rather promote their fellow hasbara propagandists' pro-Israel POV than bother to read and edit accurately.

<p>Haaretz gets its info from the IDF. Don't claim that it is independent.

<dd>Gentlemen, at the risk of stepping into the middle of a firefight, might I suggest you two step away from this for a day or so? This fight fundamentally isn't worth the energies you two seem to be putting into it. These words will not fundamentally change the nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As it is, and as a newcomer, the article seems as close to NPOV as it will ever get. So, I'm suggesting you guys just back away, let it go, catch up on reading, whatever. Let tempers calm and energies focus on other things. Or not, and duke out your own private <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermopylae.html" title="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> as you will. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFive_c4cf.html" title="User:Five">Five</a> 05:18, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a neutral 3rd party here is my take: factually, the killing of the 2 Isreali reservists could be described as a "lynching". The use of this term by itself would not necessarily demonstrate a POV-bias in my opinion, as the actions of the Palestinian mob pretty well fit the definition of a lynching. However, the entire paragraph describing the "lynching" almost certainly does exhibit a POV-bias, as it describes in greusome detail the brutality of the killing. Sure, the description may be factually accurate, but it comes accross as gratuitous in the context of the larger article. To then call it a lynching on top of that is simply redundant. Here is my proposed compromise: Either remove the explicit description of the killing and simply say they were lynched by the mob, or keep the description and remove the clause describing it as a lynching. I think that would at least reduce the percieved POV-bias as well as the redundancy. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 23:18, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise suggestions</span></h2>
<p>I believe that there is an element of truth to both arguments in this debate. 1) There does seem to be some POV bias in the way the killing of the 2 Israelis is described. 2) The term "lynching", however, is not innaccurate in this instance (although perhaps redundant). In an effort to reach a compromise between the 2 entrenched parties, I offer 2 alternate versions of the sentences in question. The first version uses the term lynching but removes the gratuitous description of the killing. The second version retains the description of the killing (edited down a bit for brevity) and removes the redundant lynching description. Either of these versions should be sufficiently NPOV to resolve this dispute, IMO. It will require a willingness to compromise by both parties however. As to the POV-bias in articles describing the killing of Palestinians, I would suggest bringing those concerns up in those articles rather than here. Since there is no unified editorial voice in Wikipedia, you'll have to challenge them one at a time. Complaining of a systematic policy of bias won't accomplish anything here. Anyway, here are my two compromise proposals. Feel free to comment...</p>
<p>An agitated Palestinian mob stormed the police station and lynched the two soldiers. The killings were captured on video and broadcast on TV, outraging Israeli public opinion.</p>
<p>An agitated Palestinian mob stormed the police station, beat the soldiers to death, and threw their mutilated bodies into the street. The killings were captured on video and broadcast on TV, outraging Israeli public opinion.</p>
<p>These versions explain the events without either whitewashing the brutality of the killings or being unnecessarily gratuitous or belaboring. Whether the word "lynch" is used specifically seems irrelevent to me.</p>
<p>Here is the current version of the passage for reference:</p>
<p>An agitated Palestinian mob stormed the police station, beat the soldiers to death, threw them out the window, stabbed them, dragged them on the road and mutilated their bodies. The killings, described as a lynching by international press, were captured on video and broadcast on TV, outraging Israeli public opinion.</p>

<dd>I think his point is that calling them a lynching and then describing the act is redundant. Judge 'em as a lynching, which is abhorrent in and of itself, or describe the act. That's all I think he's saying, and not that calling the actions a lynching is unwarranted. (Side note: Jayjg, I tried to fixed your links. They weren't turning into links properly.

<p>The term "<a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a>" is a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_term.html" title="Loaded term">loaded term</a>. It is used to label a particular killing as <b>unjustified</b>. It thus takes a moral position.</p>
<p>Wikipedia articles do not take moral positions, for one very important reason: that is, none of us contributors can agree on moral issues; and the battles over WHICH MORAL POSITION any given article should take would be endless.</p>
<p>It's so much easier, therefore, to say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>two reservists were killed by Arabs in the wake of blah, blah, blah.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to add commentary to this, I suggest we QUOTE SOMEBODY OTHER THEN OUR OWN SELVES. Like,</p>
<ul>
<li>the Jerusalem post called the killings "the worst lynching since the 1930s in the US";</li>
<li>the Palestine News-Free Press praised the killings as "the right lynching at the right time".</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't get all hung up on whet TERMS to use, when describing a killing. Was it murder? Was it "extra-judicial"? Forget interpretations, because you are not writing an editorial for your hometown newspaper; you are writing an encyclopedia article which transcends time and place.</p>
<p>Stick to the undisputed facts. The men entered the area. They died there. (We all agree on this) Somebody killed them (i.e., it wasn't an accident). The killers were "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Arab_c9fa.html" title="Palestinian Arab">Palestinian Arabs</a>. (If we agree on the identity of the killers, fine. If not, we describe the dispute as "X says the killers were Arabs, while Y says the killers were Israelis or Chechnyans or Little Green Men from Mars").</p>

<p>the reference to al-durrah wasn't gratuitous. i'm not sure if it was also in any news links.</p>
<p>the reference is quite appropriate. the situations aren't so dissimilar as to merit repeated deletions. we could list all of the palestinian children killed as a result of a horrific military occupation, but one name (that also featured footage of a child being slaughtered by stray idf bullets) gets the point across sufficiently to people unfamiliar with the subject. we could also list references to all the families killed by suicide bombers, but, again, one (maybe two) illustrative references is sufficient.</p>
<p>embarrassed by the fact that either a) the idf shoots mercilessly at children or b) simply can't control the direction of their bullets?</p>

<dd>do i need to find some journalist to make that association for me? if that's the case, then why don't we just make a newsbot to write these articles? most of history is editorial, or haven't you studied any? if you just list facts, then you get no substance, no understanding of the circumstances; you have to make associations between facts and incidents to help people understand them. the key on this site (or what the <b>administrators</b> claim to strive for) is making objective associations: NPOV; associations that do not reflect a biased point of view and will not unduly sway opinion on a controversial issue. the incidents b/t iman and muhammad are not similar; the only similarity to the events is israeli soldiers unnecessarily killing palestinian children. the association i made was to the type of criticism the IDF received as a result of the public broadcast of the footage of the events. if you pay any attention to the hebrew press, you'd have read about it, and if you read just one of the ext articles linked and the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Durrah_f90d.html" title="Muhammad al-Durrah">Muhammad al-Durrah</a> article, it becomes clear to any sane, objective viewer.</dd>
<dd>and as to the muhammad al-durrah controversy, every respectable and legitimate news agency has dismissed the argument that he was killed by palestinians for publicity, including amnesty international who would have jumped on that kind of thing immediately if there was credible evidence to support it. they could accept that it was an accident, but the argument that it was staged by palestinians is absurd. it now exists only to confuse the issue.</dd>

<dd>First victim of what? Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name "al-Aqsa". The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the "Palestine Facts" source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).

The name "al-Aqsa intifada" was coined by the Palestinian and it one of the most used names for the 2000-2004 violence, but it is not the only name.

<dd>Your argument is circular; you state that the Second Intifada began after Sharon's visit, and therefore any killings before it were not part of the Intifada. However, it is the start of the Intifada which is itself being debated. As well, though it criticized Sharon's visit, the Mitchell Report was quite clear that Sharon's visit was not the cause of the Intifada, vis "The Sharon visit did not cause the "Al-Aqsa Initifada."" Also, please note that I have not written these articles, that using language like "your Israeli propaganda" is inflammatory. Finally, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>; if you do, I'm sure we can work out a reasonable resolution. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:00, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have difficulty understanding some of your objections. The information about the stone throwing on the 28th is actually an indication that the intifada was not planned (as the pro-Israel side claims), but rather spontaneous (as the pro-Palestinian side claims). As well, it indicates a buildup, and I don't see how it can contradict information about what happened on the 29th. Also, I don't believe Yossi Tabaji is mentioned in the article; where do you see his name? As for Biri, he is mentioned because Israelis consider him the first victim of the Intifada. al Durrah is also mentioned, as the most prominent Arab victim. In contrast, the names of the most prominent Israeli victims, the two reservists lynched in Ramallah, whose deaths probably had as strong an effect on the Israeli populace as al Durrah's had on the Palestinian populace, are not mentioned. Anyway, which parts do you think shouldn't be in there? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 21:47, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The two anon edits to the 2000 section from June 21 contain inflammatory rhetoric and do so while adding information about Israeli behavior while removing information about Palestinian behavior, all of which seem to advance a particular characterisation while removing support for other views. Take the following additions: "though much evidence was later found showing that it was not Israeli fire that killed him" and "A famous picture of a bloodthirsty Palestinian holding up his blood-stained hands in glee and triumph became a famous image of the Palestinian war of terrorism." This matched by the following deletion: "Because the soldiers were dressed in civilian clothes and one was reportedly wearing a Palestinian headdress, they were suspected of belonging to an undercover Israeli assassination squad." Before and after there are elements of apologism in the accounts of both sides, but the fundamental problem I sense is that these changes seem calculated to shift content from "he said, she said" to a condemnation of "Palestinian terrorism." <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 11:40, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh my god, are you saying that the Palestinian actions are not terror actions? This means that the bombings in London and the NY twin towers attack were not terror attacks either. Well, your worng. London attacks and twin towers attach were illegal actions of the people who acted. As such, Palastinian civilians who act against civilians of another country are also terror attacks. This is a FACT that these actions are terror attacks. Otherwire, we can just delete the word terror out of our vercabulary. From the Israeli point of view, it is the Israeli army who is responding to these Palastinian attack. Israel, like any other state, has the right to defend herself. Now, Israel hs not been convicted of illegal military attacks - and this is why their action are NOT terror attacks. This, unfortunatly to the Palastinians, leave only one side which uses terror for whatever reason. Do you see the diference between Israel's behavior and the Palastinian's behavior? Terror actions and Military actions. That's there all there is too it. John

<dd>Two things. One, there is enough circumstantial evidence to point towards Israel directly targeting noncombatants. Accounts from the ICRC of the IDF shelling hospitals and the demolition of homes in the Occupied Territories are two examples that spring to mind. None of these claims can be easily confirmed, though, due to Israel's reticence towards allowing outside observers into the West Bank and Gaza. Two, use of the word "bloodthirsty" is far, far, far from NPOV. Trying to characterize the Palestinians are the evil side is also far, far, far from NPOV. While it may be true that the Palestinians are the ones blowing themselves up in marketplaces, the people of Israel don't have to contend with their homes being run over by an armored bulldozer, don't have to worry about their land being seized to create armed settlements of Palestinians, and don't have to contend with two to six hours of effort to cross a checkpoint to get to work. There are many forms of terror, and not all of them involve asymmetric warfare. The point's not to judge either side, just present the facts in as open, honest, and accurate way possible. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFive_c4cf.html" title="User:Five">Five</a> 23:27, 13 Aug 2005</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American Aid to Israel</span></h2>
<p>Jayjg, I disagree with your contention that mentioning the amounts of US foreign aid to Israel has little to do with the Intifada. It's that aid which makes the US an interested party in the ongoing conflict. I can see your point, in so much as removing the total amount of aid to Israel, but when we're talking military aid that hovers around 10.4% of Israel's GDP, and with all aid totalling around 13.4% of Israel's GDP, it's impossible to deny that American aid isn't a major strategic consideration for Israelis. With respect, I'm reverting with the removal of the total aid figure. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFive_c4cf.html" title="User:Five">Five</a>, 21:00, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where do you get these figures from? Military aid constitutes perhaps 1.5% of Israel's 2004 GDP of $US 129 billion, not 10.4% of Israel's GDP. American aid is certainly a higher percentage of the Palestinian GDP than of Israel's. Moreover, the American aid has no impact at all on its ability to respond to the Intifada. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:50, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My apologies. I make a computational error, calculating the total aid sent over the course of the Intifada by one year's GDP. Math has never been my best subject. You might be technically accurate, in that the money has no direct impact on Israel's ability to respond to the Intifada, but without continued sale of arms to Israel, everthing from Hellfire rockets to M-16s to F-16s, Israel's ability to continue operations in the Occupied Territories would be hampered until Israel found a replacement. 13 billion is a big, big number, and the US's continuing support of Israel is major strategic asset to Israel and should be mentioned given that it's what entangles America in this conflict. Also, while the numbers listed here on the Talk page were way, way off, the ones on the site were dead-on, generated in a spreadsheet and coming from the citation in my edit. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFive_c4cf.html" title="User:Five">Five</a>, 22:28, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>13 billion is a big, bug number when compared, say, to the amount of money I make. It's a tiny number compared to, say, worldwide spending on military arms. Compared to Israel's GDP it's a small amount. The U.S. is the largest arms seller in the world, but there are plenty of competitors in that market. The U.S. military aid comes with strings attached; Israel has to get the military equipment from the United States. If Israel didn't get the money from the U.S., it would simply buy the stuff from all the other eager sellers of equipment, or manufacture them itself. As well, F-16s are important in defending Israel against neighbouring countries, but irrelevant to the Intifada, since they are of no use in it. Finally, it is likely only American influence that has stopped Israel from responding more strongly to the Intifada, and has led to the current Disengagement - that influence cuts both ways. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:40, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Put it this way. In FY99, according to the wiki article about it, the IDF's budget is 8.7 billion dollars. According to the citation I posted a month ago, which is right here &gt; <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/U.S._Assistance_to_Israel1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/U.S._Assistance_to_Israel1.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, US military aid was 1.08 billion dollars in the same fiscal year. You can palm off overall US aid as a drop in the bucket, but the military aid is significant. Without those subsidies, an extra billion dollars would be put on Israel's tax base. Also, there's other intangibles, but those aren't worth going into. Either way, when 12.5% of your military expenditures are paid for, relieving significant fiscal pressure from your tax base (roughly 142 dollars per Israeli citizen, in quick-and-dirty numbers), maintainence of that relationship is a major tactical and strategic concern. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFive_c4cf.html" title="User:Five">Five</a>, 23:05, 6 September 2005</dd>

<p>Don't mean to pry in on a debate, and I know I can't inject OR into anything or else I'd write up a description of the F-16 bombings we've been through.

<dd>Leaving aside that only four of the links work (which in itself disqualifies the template), it is something that belongs in Israeli textbooks, not a worldwide encyclopedia, because it is grossly one-sided. For example, if you include the "lynching in Ramallah", you'd need to include Mohammad Al-Durra and Iman Al-Homs, as well as the killing of foreign nationals of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Solidarity_Movement_2eb9.html" title="International Solidarity Movement">International Solidarity Movement</a>, as these are equally noteworthy (regardless of how legitimate each incident is perceived to be). If you include "Shooting missiles on Sderot", then the opposing POV would be the Israeli missile strikes that destroyed many buildings (e.g. most PA police stations) and people during the first few years of the Intifada. Gilo is on West Bank land that was annexed after '67, so listing it on the "Israeli front" is POV. "Terror attacks" would open up a discussion about Israeli terror tactics, which most Palestinians believe is a daily occurrence since terrorizing doesn't always have to include death. Israeli closures, checkpoints, and the lack of freedom of movement needs to be in the template as well, since these tactics inflamed the situation exponentially. The West Bank wall is a major Intifada event that's not in the template. I could go on and on. Basically, the template just opens up a new can of worms, not to mention, again, that most of the links are broken. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 13:57, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<p><i>Others, however, have claimed that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority planned the intifada</i></p>
<p>followed by a <i>very</i> long quote from a guy who dissaproves of the cost of peace, apparently - now obviously a lot of people will share his views, not least on <a href="http://www.ziopedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ziopedia.org" rel="nofollow">Ziopedia</a>, but the whole passage isn't really evidence but 'begging the question'. Palestinians don't have a similar paragraph begging that the visit was unnecessary, very ill-timed and deliberately inflamatory regardless of the 'innofensiveness' of not praying etc (after all, other israeli politicians managed to stay away from the place. Perhaps they just weren't seeking to advance their careers by taking an even more far-right stance). In other words, there aren't several paragraphs arguing that 'Israelis planned the intifada', which seems an equally plausible conspiracy when you consider they're better at killing arabs than arabs are at killing jews. And, uh, you can't start an intifada by throwing stones in a mosque if your target doesn't turn up - weren't politicians on both sides begging Sharon not to visit? no mention of this either apparently.</p>
<p>Then there is no mention of the retaliation the Israelis carried out after the crack-team of elite youths with stones, presided over by their palestinian dignitaries, got pissed and thew shit. Weren't some palestinians killed? I wouldn't know but that's just because I read wikipedia too much.</p>
<p>So here's a radical suggestion, and one editors would no doubt find highly inconvenient and an infringement on their wikifreedom. But here's the suggestion anyway: every time you copy and paste half a book of very uncompromising rhetoric supporting your POV into an article like this, research the opinions of your opponents and set aside a sentence or two for them. They aren't proportionally represented here, god knows whether this is because their computers have been bulldozed or they're simply driven away by the shoddy state of all the articles on the middle east. They're reliant on those with all the power to be a bit more magnanimous. --212.85.15.87 11:19, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, sorry about my English. If the paletinians use stone why do you think that Israel shoud endanger its soldiers? Shoud they throw stones back like the paletinians? second israel uses weapons against the armed not against children... however if u really insist upon it u can find exception deeds. And u said "youths with stones", shoud youths carry stone. Another very important thing, Israel DOES NOT kill innocent intentionally in contrast with the palestininans terrorist. How many Israeli terrosit do we see? &amp; how many palestinians?</dd>

<dd>One could always argue that the soldiers shouldn't be there in the first place, then they wouldn't get stoned. Anyway, your point is well taken, but it is one sided, and on Wikipedia we must describe both sides in a neutral fashion. I think there are many sources (including Israeli sources) that say that Israel <i>does</i> kill innocent Palestinians. I also think 212.85.15.87 above is trying to say that you cannot cut and paste a one-sided article without pasting an article from the other side. In fact, cutting and pasting articles is normally forbidden, it is a copyright violation.

<p>Now that independent French reporters have seen the complete al-Durrah tape, it is clear that it was created as a propaganda movie. French Channel 2 no longer defends it.

<p>As a forensic journalist and a graduate of the most respected film school in the world, I could tell from the very first that the shot was too <i>neat</i>.

<dd>I disagree. And it is POV to assert that "hatred" is the appropriate term; just as the assertion that "terrorist" is more accurate than "militant". If the curriculi teach that Israel is an occupier, that is not hatred. None of the articles that are included in the list of references use the word hatred in reference to teaching students or curriculum (not even the biased ones). Teaching that "occupation" should be "resisted", for example, is not hatred. It is incorrect and POV to characterize the Palestinian anger at Israel as simply racist "hatred". <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 09:24, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we do that, I will provide additional facts to the links section qualifying why such passages appear in the Pal textbooks. Why are these in the 2nd intifada page?

<dd>For years and months before Lokiloki and I joined this project, editors worked hard to achieve compromises and keep the number of ext. links in controversial articles about the same for the sides. Today. Lokiloki made several attempts to remove the links that don't serve his/her political agenda. Failing that, s/he added anti-Israel links into Non-Categorized and about doubled Pro-Pal section: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=45085031&amp;oldid=45081738" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Intifada&amp;diff=45085031&amp;oldid=45081738" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 10:35, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hm. After my edits, there are 18 pro-Israel links, and 17 pro-Palestinian links. Before my edits, there were many more pro-Israel links. So I really don't see how my providing more external links to balance the pro-Israel links is problematic.</p>
<p>I believe the links I added in Non-Cat were neutral: if you feel not, please let me know which aren't, or move them to Pro-Is or Pro-Pal. I removed links that didn't work and which I couldn't immediately find links for. I indeed added many more Pro-Pal links, given the large number of Pro-Is links (including the ones about the bias taught to Pals). I do not feel that adding links is somehow insulting the work of prior editors.</p>

<dd>Oh, I see. The section "Claims of biased Palestinian education and child suicide bombers" is counted as Pro Israel. And I thought (silly!) that it is not good for Palestinian children to become suicide bombers. Thank you very much Lokiloki for making it clear that suicide bombers are pro-Palestinian.

<p>That is a sub-topic that falls underneath the pro-Israel side if you look at the editing. I did not add it underneath the pro-Israel side, though it clearly does belong as whoever the original editor has indicated. They are Israeli CLAIMS of Palestinian BIAS and indoctrination of "child suicide bombers". Such can accurately be placed, as they were before I even touched this, under the pro-Israel side. Or would you prefer we split everything out, so we can have a section on, say, "Israeli checkpoint abuses", and "Israeli destruction of Pal property", and "Israeli settler terrorism", etc etc?</p>
<p>I take your sarcasm as personal attacks and I request that you cease such personal attacks forthwith.</p>

<dd>Not, this not about your person but rather about the content.</dd>
<dd>So the Palestinian "child suicide bombers" are just a claim, IOW, a fantasy?</dd>
<dd>I was saying all along that <i>Anti-Israel</i> is not necessarily <i>Pro-Palestinian</i> and vice-versa.

<p>User:Labaneh Loki your are wrong. Bias connotates a willing point of view. "Etbach El Yahud" (Butcher the Jews) is not a bias, it's a call for Murder. Furthermore, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascist.html" title="Islamofascist">Islamofascist</a> points of view are forced upon Palestinians by violence if they do not adhere to it. Anyone with a different point of view is considered a traitor and is executed, usually without trial, leaving little room for bias. Unadulterated hatred is not biased it is abhorrent and calling it anything but would be a farse. If you need categorical proof, I'm sure we can dig up a few Palestinians to agree, but I'd rather just get this moving because we all know they teach hatred and that as a Palestinian sympathizer, you are merely looking for a euphemism to support their cause...ahem.</p>

<p>This must be a joke, they get that much a month! Weapons alone are 10billion+ USD a year. Honest correction is needed.</p>
<p>Also the article pretends it is I don't know what huge crime against humanity that palestinians are importing small arms via seaships which the zionists pirate often. The palestinians have the natural right to conduct armed struggle against israeli occupation of arab lands and the establishment of their own state via national liberation war. Therefore they import arms, that is natural. Sorrowfully without modern RPG and shoulder SAM they are unable to effectively counter the jewish fighting machinery on land and in the air. I hope one day the world will donate as much arms to the palestinians as the jews get and then see the fight decide on the battlefield. The arabs will fight fiercely they did with Commander Lawrence. Sorrowfully the whole world, even Europe since the Merkel zionism takeover is at the feet of zionists and thrown many weapon stocks at them so they can suppress the palestinians with firebomber. The great assymetry is the cause of suicide bombings, arabs have no weapon left but self-sacrifice. 195.70.32.136 20:21, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your condemnations are misplaced. In fact, Hamas/PIJ/etc. target innocent Israeli civilians, including children - in buses, cafes or discos, the more the merrier. The IDF does not target innocent Palestinian civilians.

<p>From Tactics, Israel --</p>
<p>Families have provided timely information to Israeli forces regarding suicide bombing activities in order to prevent the demolition of their houses, although families doing so risk being executed or otherwise punished for collaboration, either by the Palestinian Authority or extra-judicially by Palestinian militants.</p>
<p>This must be cited explicitly. Firstly, this passage implies that it is a regular occurance that Palestinians inform the IDF, and it also implies that Palestinians are routinely executed by the PA for doing this. It's irresponsible to put something like this up without sourceing the information. Another thing is I would like to hear some arguement for why this is even relevant to the topic of Israeli tactics. Bulldozing homes definately is, but what Palestinians do to 'collaborators' has only auxillary significance for Israeli tactics. If proper sources can be found this will have to be incorporated into Palestinian tactics.</p>
