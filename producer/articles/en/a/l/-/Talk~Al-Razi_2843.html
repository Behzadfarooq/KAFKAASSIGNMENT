<p>Quick note for the author of this page (and others) - great work, but it's not the done thing on the wikipedia to place one's name in an article text. This is because an article might get edited and/or expanded by anybody after you have worked on it, meaning it really would be "by" you any more. If you want people to know what you're responsible for, I'd suggest making a user account - then you can put a list of your pages on your user page if you like. Anyway, keep up the good work. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<p>To all:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried to reformat the article according to the Wikipedia standards, chiefly by adding one "=" to the level of all sections.</li>
<li>However, I used "*" instead of "====" for the sub-sub-sections (commentaries on individual books), because the document's structure seemed clearer that way. On my browser "====" looks just like "===". (Of course that may be a fluke of my browser/fonts combination.) The drawback is that editing an individual book commentary is not possible. Perhaps the old format was better after all...</li>
<li>The commentary on Razi's <b>medical</b> work is quite extensive, perhaps even too detailed for an encyclopedia article. On the other hand, the commentary on his <b>chemical</b> work, which was perhaps even more important, is too skimpy. Perhaps someone with more knowledge of chemistry would be willing to provide the details of his discovery of sulphuric acid and alcohol? (Based on half-remembered sources, I guess that the former was by distillation of vitriol; but that is little more than a guess.)</li>
<li>Ditto for the =Biography= section (currently one small paragraph...)</li>
<li>The Arabic /Persian title of Al-Hawi in the list of medical books looks strange. Could it be vandalism?</li>
<li>The full list of book titles could perhaps be moved to a separate article, "list of al-Razi's books". That would avoid the huge gaps between sections and make the text flow more naturally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed "Iranian" to "Persian". As far as I know, "Iran" is a modern name. (Cf. <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> — usually said to be "Roman" not "Italian").</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Iranian is an old name, although the country was usually called "Persia" in English before 1935. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 23:27, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Restored the sentence about alcohol. From the sources I have seen, Al-Razi is indeed credited with the discovery of alcohol (meaning <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol.html" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> - as opposed to alcoholic beverages, which of course were pre-historical). Or, at least, he was the first who described its preparation (which presumably is what counts). Is that claim contested? BTW, as far as I know "alcohol" derives from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> for "spirit".</li>
<li>Merged the footnotes into the text (footnote 3 apparently was not anchored anywhere).</li>

<dd>It would probably be best to state exactly what Al-Razi was credited doing first. It wouldn't have been discovering alcohol or even the preparation of alcohol, since ancient distillers must have done that, too. Was he the first to identify ethanol as the intoxicating component of alcoholic beverages, or the first to describe how to prepare pure ethanol? It's probably necessary to specify ethanol, since <i>alcohol</i> is ambiguous in English. (By the way, Merriam-Webster Online says the word is derived from Arabic <i>al-kuhul</i>, "the powdered antimony". Seems like there's an etymological link missing, or at least an interesting story.) In any case, on en:wikipedia, it shouldn't have the connotation in English that he first did something that has obviously been done for millenia. I'd supply a better phrasing myself, but I don't know exactly what Al-Razi did. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 23:54, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What "ancient distillers" are those? I have never heard of distilled beverages in ancient Greece or Rome, or anywhere else before the era of the Islamic alchemists. (They had wine and beer, of course.) <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a> 03:13, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems that <a href="../../../g/e/b/Geber.html" title="Geber">Geber</a> already knew about alcohol (at least as a flammable gas that escaped from bottles of boiling wine). So presumably Al-Razi was the first to condense the product? <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a> 06:15, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I am hoist by my own petard! "Distillers" was probably the wrong word. I was responding to your statement that Al-Razi "was the first who described [alcohol's] preparation". My thought was that, unless people before the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_century.html" title="10th century">10th century</a> C.E. found their ethanol-based beverages lying around in puddles, many people must have been preparing it for millenia. ☺ But distallation is a more specific means of ethanol preparation. Is <i>this</i> what Al-Razi discovered and/or invented? If so, that would eliminate the ambiguity. (BTW, I replaced your bullet above with an indent colon, because bullets screw up talk page formatting in this wonderful new style the Wiki Powers That Be have forced upon us. Please pardon the edit.) -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 17:35, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, it would be interesting to know if al-Razi had any idea of the antiseptic qualities of alcohol. If so, and if we can find a reliable source, we should make not of it both in this article and the article on <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Lister_6c4a.html" title="Joseph Lister">Joseph Lister</a>. --<a href="../../../d/w/s/User%7EDws_d2a3.html" title="User:Dws">dws</a> 4/25/2005</p>

<p>There is something fishy about the sulfuric acid story. This article claims that Al-Razi discovered H2SO4, and then <a href="../../../g/e/b/Geber.html" title="Geber">Geber</a> used it to discover HCl, HNO3, and aqua regia. However, according to the dates in Wikipedia, Geber died about 50 years before Al-Razi was born. What is the real story?<br />

<dl>
<dd>Seems to me that that part of the article is incorrectly stating that Razi's work "paved the way for Geber". <a href="../../../g/e/b/Geber.html" title="Geber">Geber</a>'s article also indicates that Geber's discoveries "paved the way for Razi"!! Obviously Razi could not have paved the way for Geber (unless the author of the article meant <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-Geber_1148.html" title="Pseudo-Geber">Pseudo-Geber</a>) so it seems that the "Razi paved the way for Geber" part must be removed. <a href="../../../k/1/_/User%7EK1_d397.html" title="User:K1">--K1</a> 10:25, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I just added that part in the Geber article, after reading a document on the net about the discovery of alcohol that seems authoritative and has detailed quotes of observations by Geber and other Arab alchemists. I will take out that line about Geber, but now I am unsure about whether he indeed was the frist to prepare ethanol, or whether credit should go to someone else, possibly just after Geber's . (The one above does not even mention Al-Razi, but perhaps it was due to nationalistic prejudice.)</p>
<p>The H2SO4 problem is even more urgent, since Geber is supposed to have used the stuff to make other acids. However, perhaps Geber did not use H2SO4, but distilled a mixture of salt and viriol, which I suppose would have generated HCl directly. Ditto for HNO3. Then perhaps Al-Razi distilled vitriol alone and got H2SO4.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Geber does not seem relevant, he was too late. Surely the distillation of spirits was already well known by then, even in Europe. (BTW, it seems that by the 16th century the distillation of ethanol was a very popular research topic of European alchemists. I wonder why... 8-)</p>

<dd>The most sought after of all the compositions by al-Razi (Rhazes to Europeans) was his Comprehensive Book on Medicine (Kitab al-Hawi fi al-tibb). It was not a formal medical encyclopedia, but rather was assembled <i>posthumously</i> from Razi's working files of readings and personal observations. [My emphasis.]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Razi's "manuscript" was not assembled until after his death. Yet a "Muslim priest" orders that he be beaten over the head with it? What is wrong with this picture?? It's also suspicious that the Muslim priest is not named, thereby making the story all the more difficult to verify.</p>
<p>Do we have a reference for the head beating story?</p>

<p>We NEED a reference for this head-beating story. I have performed a quick Google search for a reference. The whole first page of references to that story are all different versions of this Wikipedia article—never a good sign. I have already quoted the dubious material in full above. I therefore see fit to delete it from the article in the absence of any voiced dissent.</p>

<p>A citing of the head beating story appears in "A Prelude to Medical History" by Felix Marti-Ibañez on p. 112. The book was published in back 1961. This obviously predates the Wikipedia article a bit, but unfortunately the book doesn't give a source for the story. Hope this helps in some way.</p>

<p>I am new to Wikimedia but I was searching for Al-Razi (for my study on Hermetism/Alchemy) and was very impressed with the immense research of this scholar. Not all of us have the perfect Oxford English level of the English language and I therefore volunteer to do some editing over the coming months. I first checked with the Sandbox to familiarize myself with some basic editing modes and that took some time. I am a student of English and reasonably familiar with alchemical works of the past, because of my recent study of Alchemy. So I hope I can be of some help. I will do my utmost not to change in any way the content or meaning of the article, but will only change structure of sentences and replace verbs with synonyms wherever applicable or needed.

<dd><b>Hermeticism</b></dd>
<dd>Alchemy's source can be traced to the <i>Hermetica</i>, writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, Hermes Thrice-Great who is identified with the Egyptian god Thoth, inventor of alchemy and god of Wisdom. It was in ancient Egypt that the <i>Hermetica</i> emerged and reached the state now visible in various treatises of Arabian alchemists and philosophers. Hermeticism encompasses the Art of alchemy (both 'technical' and 'philosophical' alchemy) as well as astrology and talismanic magic. As in so may other respects, Moslems and other non-Europeans of late antiquity and the early middle ages outdid their Western contemporaries in preserving and extending the Hermetic tradition. Alchemical works began to enter Islamic lands from Alexandria as early as the 7th century, even prior to Jabir al-Hayan (known as Geberu). Many Arabian alchemists emerged since and most of them were physicians, just as al-Razi. Their alchemistical experiments lead to the discovery of many medicinal and chemical inventions which laid the foundation for future developments in both sciences.</dd>

<p>Why <b>Al-Razi</b>? The name must be <b>Razi</b>. --131.227.231.149 00:26, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, we have several options:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Abu Bakr Muhammad Zakariyah al-Razi" (full Arabic name)</dd>
<dd>"Zakariyah al-Razi" (common Arabic name)</dd>
<dd>"Al-Razi" (Arabic name as might be used in English)</dd>
<dd>"Rhazes" or "Rasis" Latinized names (there may be more), widely used in historical European documents, still used by some</dd>
<dd>"Razi" (above proposal)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally I would be against "Razi" since I don't think it has been widely used in the West (but I may be wrong). Moreover, since it means "of Rayy", it is even less appropriate linguistically than "al-Razi" ("the one from Rayy"). Methinks that in this case "Zakariyah al-Razi" may be the best option, and consistent with the treatment of other historical figures that are known mostly by their surname, e.g. Newton (<a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>).</dd>
<dd>A year ago someone decided that Jabir should be renamed <a href="../../../g/e/b/Geber.html" title="Geber">Geber</a>, so for consistency we should rename Al-Razi as "Rhazes" or "Rasis". But that is problematic because there are various options, and it seems like going backwards.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The point is that he is a Persian, and he is not called by the name of "Al-Razi" in Iran, in the West he may have been called Al-Razi by some but I believe Razi is the correct and the name that should be used. -- <b>- K a s h</b> <sup>Talk | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Khashayar_Karimi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Khashayar_Karimi" rel="nofollow">email</a></sup> 15:06, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Al-Razi" is a fairly generic name, and simply dedicating the whole page to Abu Bakr Muhammad Zakariyah al-Razi is akin to exclusively giving the article "Smith" to Adam Smith. There is another, equally important person with the name Al-Razi: Abu Hatim Al-Razi, a somewhat fundamentalist theologian, who actively engaged in dialogues with Rhazes (the al-Razi of this article.)</p>
<p>Also, Rayy was and is an intellectually fertile region of Iran, thus, its possible that there are more <i>al-Razi</i>s, or that more may be produced.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As long as there is only one other "Al-Razi", it can be accomodated by a "for ... see" note at the top of this article (I don't like such notes, but I seem to be a minority of one... 8-() If there are more, they may go to "Al-Razi (disambiguation)". I don't think that "Al-Razi" should be a disambiguation page, because Rhazes is obviously far more important than all the other Al-Razis put together. But it may be indelicate to say so, and other people may even think otherwise.</dd>

<p>I had originally read about al-Razi on a website which mentioned his condemnation of Islam, his rejection of religious faith, his denouncement of people who were known as prophets, and his criticism of the Qur'an. I mean, he did write books called "The Prophet's Fraudulent Tricks" and "On the Refutation of Revealed Religions". Coming to this page, however, it seems that one would be rather hard-pressed to find any strong expression of this. For instance, the article mentions A'lam al-Nubuwwah, which is a book of response to a lost book of al-Razi's, which had made some controversial claims. The article also quotes him on his view of prophetically-revealed religions, which is not a favorable one. Here is a summary of al-Razi's views in his lost book, as it is expressed in the response:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1)All men are by norted mixture of "absurd and inconsistent fables," which has ridiculously been judged inimitable, when, in fact, its language, style, and its much vaunted "eloquence" are far from being faultless. Custom, tradition, and intellectual laziness lead men to follow their religious leaders blindly. Religions have been the sole cause of the bloody wars that have ravaged mankind. Religions have also been resolutely hostile to philosophical speculation and to scientific research. The so-called holy scriptures are worthless and have done more harm than good, whereas the "writings of the ancients like Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, and Hippocrates have rendered much greater service to humanity."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) "The people who gather round the religious leaders are either feeble-minded, or they are women and adolescents. Religion stifles truth and fosters enmity. If a book in itself constitutes a demonstration that it is true revelation, the treatises of geometry, astronomy, medicine and logic can justify such a claim much better than the Qur'an [the transcendent literary beauty of which, denied by Razi, was thought by orthodox Muslims to prove the truth of Muhammad’s mission]."</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Al-Razi was more a deist than an actual Muslim, probably comparable to calling some of the Founding Fathers Christians. However, the article seems to attribute some parts of his philosophy to the very religion he is opposed to, without warrant:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is quite evident that most of his thoughts were derived from the Islam</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Really, is it? Because it seems to echo a more independent, general monotheism to me. Obviously, we all bear a little bit of baggage from the realm of thought we were born into, but I don't believe it's fair to attribute his opinions so assuredly to Islamic thought, especially with the statement that "most" of his ideas came from "the Islam".</p>
<p>Hopefully, I'll be able to use a few of the sources, both online and print, to help add a more reasonable representation of al-Razi's stance on religion and prophecy. I'm rather lazy, so it might be ages until I get around to it.--<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.Logan_5bcc.html" title="User:C.Logan">C.Logan</a> 19:38, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
