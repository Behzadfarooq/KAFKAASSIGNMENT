<li>Keep. I haven't studied the problem in depth, but the etymologies proposed there seemed about as plausible as any; sources are given for each.

<dd>Don't bother, Wikipedia admins., I've removed it myself. I teach Spanish history and I added my piece in order to expand on an point that, as presented here, simply repeats a popular notion that is not supported by serious historical scholarship. I realize now that Wikipedia is not for me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would be perhaps more polite and less startling if you asked contributors to submit pieces for publishing consideration beforehand, perhaps - and that you organize some sort of peer review for these. That a young, lying, and unqualified punk such as Harris here is allowed to instantly "adjudge" a piece of writing on a subject he knows nothing about as "nonsense" does not do your site much credit.</dd>

<li>Pre-publishing peer review was tried on <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a>. It didn't work. That's why Wikipedia doesn't operate that way. Secondly, your personal attacks on a (possibly) mistaken user cast far greater doubt on your qualifications than anything <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a> has said. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 19:02, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Cyrius, I'm afraid you're preaching to the choir -- User:Casta is well out the door. He shouldn't have gotten so pissed off, true enough, and easy for me to say. However the larger context is that a person whose competence we have no reason to doubt has been driven off. Dare I say it, <i>we must be able to keep people who know what they're doing</i>. As always my opinion is worth what you paid for it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 00:17, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>"Questioned" is not an accurate description of what happened.

<li><b>Comment</b> Article deletion is not really that different from any other edit. Deleted articles can be restored, as this one has. We do warn everyone that they shouldn't submit anything unless they are willing to have it be mercilessly edited. Deletion is just a particularly merciless form of editing.

<p>A claim has often been made that the period of Al-Andalus there was great tolerance etc.... What often ommitted from the picture is the preceeding brutal slaughter and ethnic cleansing of native spaniards by the invading Muslim armies and the reduction of surviving Christians and Jews to a sub-class in society called <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmis.html" title="Dhimmis">Dhimmis</a> during the same period. Those are facts that put this article into perspective instead of propagating the wishful bed time story told to Muslim children called Al-Andalus. . --Mrabir 12:08, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Er.. source this <i>"Slaughter and ethnic cleansing of native spaniards"</i>, and add it. Thats what this Wikipedia thing is all about. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup></li>
<li>The claim is mostly for the lower class. While there were certainly atrocities committed during this time period, its important to note that relative to the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoth.html" title="Visigoth">Visigoth</a> period beforehand and the post-Reconqusita period (especially after the introduction of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquistion_50ec.html" title="Spanish Inquistion">Spanish Inquistion</a> which even targeted their own) for a majority of the population, including Christian population, it was better overall. Again that doesn't mean under Islamic rule they were treated good, but compared to what was before and what came after, for the peasants and other lower class atleast that is what is being claimed.
<ul>
<li>Ummm, yes. This is the myth. Christians=Bad/Muslims=Good. You retell the myth so enjoyably, and without citing a single fact or statistic. Bravo. Zuzim 19:39, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>How is that even remotely relevant to the discussion? <b>NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!!</b> Complete Non Sequitur. Come back with something 1. Factual 2. Relevant.
<ul>
<li>Actually, it is relevent because it explains the perception. The fact is, the Christians expelled Jews in 1492 and expelled Muslims later. But both were expelled, while there were undeniably Jews and Christians, albiet in Dhimitude, in Islamic Spain. So if you're going to say Christians = Bad, Muslims = Good as a myth, no, you're not going to get very far, the best you'd get is Christians = Bad, Muslims = Bad. Yet this is irrelevent and opinion anyway. Still, the "reality" of al Andalus is more respectable than the offshoot of the Austrian Empire to most, 1500s. As that's all Spain was at that point, literally.<a href="../../../j/m/w/User%7EJmw0000_7b19.html" title="User:Jmw0000">J. M.</a> 14:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Throughout the period of Islamic rule al-Andalus was a remarkable example and outstanding model of tolerance. It emerged at the time of the conquest, when the Muslim conquerors undertook to preserve the freedoms of their subjects, protect their fortunes and their property, respect their churches and ensure their defence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The agreement concluded between 'Abdul'azîz ibn Mûsà ibn Nusair and Theodomir is a case in point. Similarly, the story told by historians of Ardabat and Maimûn al-'Âbid is about the practical application of written agreements. It demonstrates in the clearest possible way of the generosity of the conquerors' conduct and policy towards the vanquished in the age of the Governors (the wulâh), which resulted in a perfectly harmonious cohabitation and a model of peaceful coexistence between the different races and religions.</p>
<p>One of the consequences was that the Arabic language and literature became widespread among Christians and Jews, starting at the time of the Umayyad emirate and intensifying under the Caliphate. This rapid process of arabization, which took place a century or a little more after the arrival of the Muslims in the Iberian peninsula, provoked lamentations from some churchmen, the most famous of whom was Alvaro, a priest at Cordoba.</p>
<p>This situation probably arose not only as a result of the climate of tolerance, referred to above, but out of the ambitions of Christians and Jews at that time to occupy state positions and accede to posts in government service. In this connection, it is known that the Umayyads of al-Andalus, following the example of their predecessors from the East, employed many Christians in their various offices, some of which achieved the highest rank under the princes and caliphs. Examples of this are Gomes Rabî', who was close to al-Hakam ar-Rabdî, and Gomes ibn Antûn, first secretary to Abd-al-Rahman an-Nâsir al-Ausat, whose writing style, quality of correspondence, savoir-faire, and accurate accounting were praised by the great historian Ibn Hayyân. One further example is Bishop Rabî' ibn Zaid (Recesmundus), who worked with 'Abd-al-Rahman an-Nâsir and was entrusted with various missions and several embassies during his reign." - <a href="http://www.unesco.org/culture/al-andalus/html_eng/benchrifa.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.unesco.org/culture/al-andalus/html_eng/benchrifa.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.unesco.org/culture/al-andalus/html_eng/benchrifa.shtml</a></p>

<p>Could this section not be condensed a bit?</p>
<p>"It has been pointed out by historians that although Muslims typically view the period of the Emirate and the Caliphate as tolerant towards the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> populations living on the conquered land, that those same populations were reduced to a sub-class status called <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmis</a> and were only 'tolerated' as long as they obeyed the stringent <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmi</a> rules imposed by the Muslims. <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmis.html" title="Dhimmis">Dhimmis</a> ie non-Muslims could not build new churches or synagogues nor repair old ones; they had to observe their faiths indoors, never in public, they could not do anything that could be interpreted as a challenge the superiority of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>; they could not take Arabic names; they were required to wear a dhimmi belt called the zunnar; they could not employ Muslims&#160;; they had to show loyalty to Muslims; they could not sell goods not approved by Muslims. They had to pay an poll tax (jizya). <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmis.html" title="Dhimmis">Dhimmis</a> were also forbidden from holding public office.(This next sentence is in remark to the previous sentence, which I will leave in tact) To say that the <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmis.html" title="Dhimmis">Dhimmis</a> were barred from political office is a rather incorrect statement, there are many examples of <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmi</a> holding office especially during the time of the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> empire, and their control over <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>. However in reference to political power than <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> could attain within andalusia, please look at <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasdai_ibn_Shaprut_f7c5.html" title="Hasdai ibn Shaprut">Hasdai ibn Shaprut</a> a prominent Jew who controlled the customs, among other duties, in Cordoba."</p>
<p>It would be simpler just to link to the article <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> or at the very least remove the 7 wiki links to the same article in one paragraph. This reads more like a rant than an academic discussion of the social status of non-Muslim "Peoples of the Book" in Islamic Spain. There's nothing particularly unique about this status in relation to this article and a sentence or two explaining that there <i>were</i> class differences due to religion as a result of Islamic law being enacted should suffice -- if it's even necessary. I'm not an expert on Islamic Spain but I do know something about the history of Islam in Europe in general and the truth is certainly not as clear cut as the author wants to make it seem. Certainly by our modern secular standards this sort of behavior is regressive and opressive, but do we really need to compare this with the treatment on non-Catholics in post-Reconquista Spain?! (As but one example.) The truth is that the middle ages right up until the Reformation and even on into the the Enlightenment were not exactly shining examples of religious tolerance and sanity. I think one could easily make the case that regardless of the unequal treatment that the dhimmi recieved it was no worse than the treatment of Jews (or so-called "heretical" Christians) anywhere else. Hell, England disbarred Catholics from public office into the modern era -- as the second author notes, there was no such rule in Islam in general or in Al-Andalus in particular. Indeed many of the most prominent members of the intellectual and cultural elite in both Islamic Spain and the Ottoman Empire were Jews and Christians. I've read quite a bit on the topic and at the very least <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> seems to think that the Islamic dominance of Spain was the catalyst for one of the great periods in Jewish culture, philosophy and art. At any rate I digress.</p>
<p>I guess I'm just a bit surprised at the controversy in this article. It seems like an interesting topic and one that would be relatively easy to research given that both sides were literate and the vanguard of their respective cultures. I'm disappointed that people can't do better than this, but hey... that's life for you sometimes. (Hehe...

<ul>
<li><i>"... given that both sides were literate and the vanguard of their respective cultures"</i>. Gabe, take your time to explore the scarce and fragmentary written sources from the two sides (Muslims and Christians) and you will see that they seem to describe rather opposite worlds. Would this be because their worlds were in fact rather different or because those sources where written several centuries after the facts had taken place? On top of this, today, we rely on non independent researchers and translators, and most of the times our original sources came from clerics or poets not interested in reflecting pure facts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Tolerance” denotes a fairly relative concept, so that even Taliban would be considered as tolerant for certain standards; mainly if their history were to be written two centuries later for Muslim clerics and from scratch, from oral tradition rather than from written sources. As per the tolerance of Muslim in Al-Andalus, the question is: what did Muslims tolerate the former inhabitants (either Jews or Christians)? Some remarks above are clear enough: <i>“they tolerate them to stay in Al-Andalus as dhimmis”</i>, because they needed them to stay for economical reasons; nothing more and perhaps nothing less. Let us keep in mind that in 711, barely some 20.000 troops crossed the Gibraltar strait, and in the following two centuries only a few thousands of the so called Syrians and Berebers joined the invaders. Hence, the demography worked against the new rulers, who did not overtake the original inhabitants, in terms of religion predominance, until well into the 11th century. Therefore, here, the word <i>“tolerance”</i> denotes something that needs further clarification. I would prefer to say: <i>“in Al-Andalus, Muslims were as tolerant as Islam allowed and the context forced them to be”</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On the other side, (<i>"I guess I'm just a bit surprised at the controversy in this article"</i>), I am not surprised at all at the controversy in this article. The underlying (though to some extent unconcious) reason of the controversy should not be overlooked, and <i>“Golden Ages”</i> could be here the key expression, with rather different meaning for different people. There is a strong movement underway towards a new Al-Andalus, which needs ideological and psychological support, (for a clue, see the article by <i>Lawrence Wright -The New Yorker, Aug. 2, 2004</i>)</li>

<dd>While I largely agree with you about "campaigns of extermination", there were undoubtedly large numbers of Christian deaths, both in cities that resisted the initial invasion and during the repeated raids into the remaining or reconquered Christian areas through to the end of the Umayyad period. But it's equally clear that Iberian communities who chose to accept Islamic rule and dhimmi status were allowed not only to keep their religion but most or all of their property. It looks as if it might be worth adding something on this to the article - but I'm away from my sources at the moment. <a href="../../../p/w/i/User%7EPWilkinson_b9a3.html" title="User:PWilkinson">PWilkinson</a> 18:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The status of dhimmis under the Caliphate of Cordoba was undoubtedly distinctly worse than that of Muslims in contemporary Europe or America. And it was equally undoubtedly distinctly better than that of religious minorities in almost any Christian European state before about 1650 (the Spanish Christian states up to about 1350 being the major exception - and whose method of handling religious minorities do you think they were copying?). <a href="../../../p/w/i/User%7EPWilkinson_b9a3.html" title="User:PWilkinson">PWilkinson</a> 18:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If, however, the text that Aesid has been deleting is not felt to be appropriate to Wikipedia, it would be better to revert to the version just prior to my edit of 22 May - which at least put the text that Aesid prefers in a more logical place in the article. <a href="../../../p/w/i/User%7EPWilkinson_b9a3.html" title="User:PWilkinson">PWilkinson</a> 19:12, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To begin with, Tom included information that was entirely unsourced (e.g. "outside Mosques, insulting Muhammad"), that is not found in the actual article on the topic. Second, his description is over-lenghty, as it is now just about as long as the description in the main article on the topic (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrs_of_C%C3%B3rdoba_bbe5.html" title="Martyrs of Córdoba">Martyrs of Córdoba</a>) itself; in fact, the single sentence that used to be here before Tom started inserting stuff<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Andalus&amp;diff=17924673&amp;oldid=17924437" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Andalus&amp;diff=17924673&amp;oldid=17924437" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which he marked as a minor edit with no comment, was probably fine. Next, I found Tom's version repetitive ("an unusual drama", "what made it so unusual"). Finally, Tom presented no rationale for this inclusion; rather, he simply insulted me. I'm not particularly well-disposed to unsupported, over-lengthy, repetitive edits from editors who insult, and then justify their insults, rather than using the Talk: pages for their proper purpose. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:28, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The paragraph is still needlessly wordy, and I can't imagine why an apologist for Islamist positions like IPT would insist on keeping the nearly inflamatory language he's inserted: to the casual reader, it sounds like "what was unusual about these Christian martyrs is that they actually did something offensive to the sensitivites of muslims other than merely existing. Most Christian martyrs were killed simply for being Christians. These guys had the chutzpa (;-p) to stand *side mosques insulting Mohammad." That's my 2¢. I'm the last person you'll find apologizing for Islam, but IPT's insertion, as usual, is just plain bad. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:55, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could be wrong, but it seems to me this was the pivotal incident in the region's (and perhaps the continent's) relations between Christians and Muslims. I don't know what it does for anyone's apologetics, or whose chutzpah we're discussing, but as a reader I would want to know about this event. I'd also want to understand the degree to which these Christians went out of their way to undertake acts they knew carried the death penalty. (As opposed to, you know, their being hunted down, yanked from their homes, and executed for being Christians, which seems to be a scenario that haunts the popular imagination these days.) <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 00:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see "publicly blaspheming Islam outside Mosques" has already been sourced. You probably read about them "insulting Muhammad" right in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrs_of_C%C3%B3rdoba_bbe5.html" title="Martyrs of Córdoba">Martyrs of Córdoba</a>. See the bullet point "Peter, Wallabonsus, Sabinian, Wistremundus, Habentius and Jeremiah": "For publicly denouncing Mohammed they were martyred under Abderrahman in Cordoba." Or maybe under Isaac: "During a public debate in Cordoba he denounced Mohammed and was martyred." Geez, doesn't anybody check before accusing someone else of an unsourced edit?

<dd>There certainly were unsourced elements to the edit, along with all of its other issues, and the edit made it seem like that's what they all did, as opposed to 3 or 4 of them.

<dd>This amazing, continuous display of suicidal civil disobedience happens over a period of <i>years</i> in the 850s. Game is over in 1031. Seems like the beginning of the end to me. You remember that scene in <i>Godfather II</i> when Al Pacino watches a Cuban kill himself as part of a pro-Castro guerilla attack? You remember his instant conclusion? "We can't win." From that moment on, he knows his job is to get the hell out of Havana.

<dd>So far as I can judge (and I'm going on impressions rather than anything I've currently got fully sourced), the whole episode had no visible significance on the subsequent history of al-Andalus. There were some effects on the Christian kingdoms to the north: both the Franks and the Asturians seem a few years later to have successfully sent agents to Cordoba to get relics of some of the Martyrs: in particular, the Asturians eventually reburied Eligius (in Oviedo?). But the Martyrs were then almost forgotten until the 16th century when someone looking for examples of Christian witness in the Moorish centuries came across and publicised Eligius's writings. The importance of the Martyrs since has been as a Catholic and Orthodox saintly cult and because the works of Eligius are some of the fullest sources for ninth-century al-Andalus that were both written there and contemporary with the events that they describe: the earliest Arabic Andalusi historical works we have are a century later and not really interested in Muslim-dhimmi relations.</dd>
<dd>However, the 850s did mark the beginning of a sharp decline in the Emirate of Cordoba that lasted about 60 years. But the evidence from later historians is that this was a matter of local Muslim elites (some descended from the Arab and Berber 8th century invaders but some, certainly, descendants of Spanish converts from Christianity) through much of al-Andalus declaring effective independence from Cordoba. As a result, when the Emirate (and then Caliphate) revived under Abd-ar-Rahman III, he and his successors generally preferred using slave soldiers and mercenaries to Muslim Andalusi troops. Most of the mercenaries were Berbers but some were unconverted Christians from the northern kingdoms - and they didn't convert. The unwisdom of this course of action would become clear as the Caliphate collapsed between 1008 and 1013... <a href="../../../p/w/i/User%7EPWilkinson_b9a3.html" title="User:PWilkinson">PWilkinson</a> 18:12, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<i>"The Caliphate was a refuge of tolerance for the religious minorities persecuted in other lands, such as Jews and Sufis who immigrated to it".</i></p>
<p>I would say that was fairly accurate. Islamic regions <i>were</i> extremely tolerant, certainly far more than Christian ones which were chasing people and forcing them to eat pork to prove they weren't Jews or Muslims, before burning them at the stake. The christians destroyed Mosques and Synagogues (although they did convert <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithraeum.html" title="Mithraeum">Mithraeum</a>, and temples of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artemis.html" title="Artemis">Artemis</a>, but that was only in the beginning), but the Muslims just converted them - <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagia_Sophia_1968.html" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> being a prime example. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 22:48, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have reservations about Irishpunktom's latest revision. Replacing "Caliphate" with "Muslim rule" elides significant differences in the treatment of dhimmis under the Umayyad Emirate and Caliphate versus the later Almoravids and Almohads, and implies that it was pretty much sunshine and happy days for Christians and Jews throughout the entire period of Muslim rule, which I find misleading.

<dl>
<dd>The only phrase that seems to be disputed is the one that unqualifiedly calls the Calphate's rule "tolerant." None of the sources cited for this appear encyclopedic. However, it is widely accepted that the Caliphate's rule was tolerant in comparison to Christian rule. There were periods of persecution under the Caliphate, but such persecution was generally less systematic and much more sporadic than persecution under Christian rule. The article should be edited to reflect that. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 23:03, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did another rewrite, for flow, and also where I tried to clarify the history of the scholarly debate, and the way it has been used to apply to contemporary political situations. I also included historical information, because the period of tolerance was bounded, and assertions that Jews did not leave Al-Andalus were not correct by 1050 or so, when people began to flee to Toledo. <b>And now I note that Irishpunktom deleted the whole thing without comment.

</dl>
<ol>
<li>Who is Mark Cohen</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Mark Cohen is a Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, he is a well-regarded scholar whose interest is Jews in Muslim lands in the Middle Ages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Why is his book "Under Cross and Crescent" landmark?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to edit it, I actually just pulled in from the reviews in a couple of scholarly journals (see the Journal of Religion review), which called it the landmark study on the subject, since Cohen compares and contrasts Northern Europe and Muslim Spain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How could Heinrich Graetz be bolstering a story in the 20th Century when he died in 1891?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Huh? The "Golden Age" story started in the 19th century, not the 20th, the point was to show that the debate has lasted a long time, and that it was partially political in origin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Why are you quotng a load of scholars but neither Modern Muslim Scholars, or Muslim Historians from the era (Said Al Andalusi for example)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't trying to exclude anyone. I left all of the existing references, I simply added Cohen's discussion of the nature of the debate, which is well supported. Its not like I am quoting some right-wing scholar. Please feel free to add in additional references, as you would like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Grrr, have to go, I'll add more later. I would also advise against making such sweeping changes to an article which has taken so much to get to where it is now. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 19:28, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See my answers above. I didn't realize that I would be adding to the controversy here, and I am still not sure what the concern is. I am not trying to represent the "Jews were persecuted" POV nor the "Golden Age" POV, but the section before I came was a random list of arguments that included a massive list of internal links to book reviews for María Rosa Menocal, which was baffling. Explaining why this is controversal is important, and, even more important, is the actual history of the nature of tolerance in the Caliphate, which you also deleted, are you disputing any of the points in the historical section I added?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have to say that your blanket reverts are pretty upsetting, since they are not (I think) changing NPOV, and you have given no objection other than wondering who Mark Cohen is and why I didn't add in additional scholars. You did not challenge the history section, but deleted it. You did not point out factual errors in any area. Plus, the current section is unreadable, and the random list of links is only marginally connected. The closest to relevant are two reviews of books (one of which dismisses the argument of the book), but there is also a Jewish travel itinerary, an article on Moorish music, and my favorite, an article on the use of basil by the "Bulchand Charitable Trust Clinic," really, click on the link labelled 9.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think I have a good history on Wikipedia of making solid edits with considerable sourced backing, and your slash-and-burn approach really is counterproductive.</dd>

<p>I like the rewrite. It is pretty clear. However, I would like to suggest two possible changes that you can consider.</p>
<p>"The Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in other parts of Christian Europe...." I think that this paragraph seems to fit better in the "Rise and Fall of Tollerence" section. Also, if you know of any quotes from more mainstream authors, I think they should be included.--24.15.4.5 20:26, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there more information on this? Sometimes people do just flee in fear of persecution without actually having been persecuted. The thing is, the meaning was changed entirely. "In the face of the conquering Almohades " implies they fled the actual conquest as it was happening, while "fled persecution by the Almohades" implies actual post-conquest persecution. Did he or someone else write about the persecution? What kind of persecution? Are there any sources? In previous versions, the article stated that even Muslim philosophers were persecuted (<a href="../../../a/v/e/Averroes.html" title="Averroes">Averroes</a>). Is this true? In the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> article, the biography makes no mention of persecution, and just says: "the family fled to Morocco after the fall of Córdoba to the Almohads." --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 07:53, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aladdin, I would agree that a brief mention would suffice - except that the treatment of non-Muslims ends up being one of the most continually discussed aspects of Al-Andalus, and it turns out not to be a simple matter that can be addressed with a single NPOV paragraph. Thus, I am not sure why the article has an NPOV tag, but it shouldn't be because a particular section is long! My suggestion is to increase the length of other sections, not cut down the section on non-Muslims. When the article gets to be too long, we can always spin it off, as you suggest.</dd>
<dd>As for the Almohads, plenty of Jews wrote about the persecution (it should be noted that they started as a very fundamentalist sect, persecution was common in the first years of their rule, but they liberalized later). Maimon, Maimonodes's father, was a dayan who wrote a letter about being pressured or forced to accept Islam <i>after</i> the Almohad invasion (which is why they fled). Joseph ben Judah Ibn ‘Aknin (who fled to Christian Spain) wrote a still existant manuscript in which he says that the Jews of several towns of North Africa were depopulated of Jews by the Almohads, and Abraham ibn Ezra wrote a long eulogy to communities destroyed by the Almohads. The Averroes issue was my mistake - he was briefly declared to be too liberal, his books were burned, and he was exiled - but then he was re-accepted, and was generally supported by the Almohades throughout their liberalizing period.</dd>

<p>I am not advocating spinning it off, I am saying there is an existing <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> article, and all the controversy associated with it. A brief outline of treatment of non-Muslims in Al-Andalus from opposing views and then a a link to the Dhimmi article should allow us, I would think, to get past the Neutrality tug of war in the Al Andalus article. Thank you for the clarification about the Almohades. Perhaps the Maimonodes biography should contain a brief mention about being pressured to convert etc before going into exile. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 11:07, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have tried to avoid the Dhimmi article because it is so polarized. In fact, I avoided use of the term in the content I added (using "non-Muslim") for exactly that reason. I hope people find the current language balanced, and, in fact, I am going to try to remove the NPOV tag (since both Jayjg and IrishPunkTom seem satisfied). If you want to make changes, I am happy to help, but I was hoping that we could make the article a bit more NPOV and self-contained rather than referring to a lightning rod article for context. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 13:15, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if this answers your question, but you can see in the history of portugal article that, before the Christian "Reconquista", you cannot speak of Portugal as an independent country (or even a political entity). Hence the non-differentiation.</p>

<p>Someone should really examine this statement and modify it to confirm to the NPOV: "For example, forty-eight Christians of Córdoba were decapitated for religious offences against Islam. They became known as the Martyrs of Córdoba. Many of the Christians executed deliberately courted martyrdom by publicly declaiming against Islam inside mosques, insulting Muhammad and making declarations of Christian religious beliefs considered blasphemous in Islam. These deaths played out, not in a single spasm of religious unrest, but over an extended period of time; dissenters who were fully aware of the fates of their predecessors chose what amounted to suicide as a form of protest against the Islamic state."</p>

Due to this action, they became apostate, and they were executed like all muslims apostated in Middle Ages. If they had been christians all time, they never had been killed.</dd>

<p>The entire "martyrs of Córdoba" should also be examined in the light that Eulogius, Alverus et. al.,actively sought and campagined for their martyerdom. If all one reads are the commentaries and saints lives' written by those who venerated them, then yes, the image that immerges is one of outright repression. One may find such an account in <i>Medieval Iberia: Readings from Christain, Muslim and Jewish Sources</i>, ed. Olivia Remie Constable (Philadelphia, 1997), <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8122-1569-9</a>. Conversely, <i>Saracens</i> by John V. Tolan examines the martyrs from the other side, namely he discusses the great lenghts that these people went to in order to achieve their status as martyrs, such as seeking multiple audiences with imans and members of the court to publically blaspheme against the Prophet Mohammed. Also, it is interesting to note that during this time, there are indications that Hispano-Romans are adapting rather well to Muslim-styled life by their willing adoptation of dress, language and manners but still maintaining their religion (Spanish: <i>mozárabes</i>). It is therefore unlikely that willing assimilation would occur and even more so, be permitted in a society that is actively persecuting members of a different religion.</p>
<hr />
<p>In regards to the status of Jews and Christians under Muslim rule during the Middle Ages on the Iberian Peninsula, the relationship between them and the various rulers fluxuated. One must keep in mind the the Umayyads fell from power in 1031 and the power vaccum created the first Ta'ifa period where multiple Muslim kingdoms existed in Al-Andalus. The next ruler of a unified al-Andalus was from the Almohavid dynasty of North Africa that held to strict and literal interpretations of the Qur'an. Such a belief affected not only how Jews and Christians were treated, but also religious scholars, philosophers, and other members of the intelligensia. If one was not of the same mindset as the ruling dynasty, then daily life could have been more difficult than it had been previously. A similar situation arose when the Almoravids--again, another dynasty that held a literal interpretation to the Qur'an-- took control in the late 12th century, but ceased to be a major issue during the Nasri kingdom of Granada. Lastly, it is important to remember that Jews and Muslims living under Christian rule in the north had to pay extra taxes to their rulers, could not employ Christians nor purchase Christian slaves, and faced trade restrictions yet all this was seen as normal and generally did not hamper daily life to the extent that alternatives were divised. For further reading on the treatment of Muslims under Christian rule, see <i>Islamic Spain:1250-1500</i> by L.P. Harvey, (Chicago, 1990), and <i>A Forgotten Community: The Mudéjar Aljama of Xàtiva, 1240-1327</i> by Isabel O'Connor (Leiden, 2003).</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, I agree that there should be a sizable section of the article reserved for a discussion of literature produced within al-Andalus and how it relates to the emergence of Aristotle as the poster child for the intelligensia of Latin Europe, as well as the relationship between Arabic, Hebrew and Latin speaking scholars and how they jointly translated Muslim and Greek works. If there is a seperate article on the Toledo Translation School, a link should be made. Also, the article needs to be more current in regards to the scholarly literature available on al-Andalus and read less like Menendez Pelayo or E. Lévi-Provençal's histories. Much has been written concerning aristocratic, middle and lower class women, the connections between Andalusian Jewish communities and others along the Mediterranean, political and cultural relationships between Cairo, Baghdad, Aachen, and Constantinople and the constantly changing relationships with Christian kingdoms in the northern part of the peninsula and I feel that it is time to include it within the article.</p>

<p>I'm interested in how many arab-berbers actually emigrated to Spain over the 800 years of Islamic rule. Also, a timeline depicting the percentage of the population that was muslim, christian, jewish etc. and how this changed throughout the 800 year rule would be very helpful as well. Could someone see if they can get information on these?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently the Berbers who inmigrated to the Iberian Peninsula during the 800 years that existed Al-Andalus never surpassed a few thousands; they were slighly more numerous than other foreign groups like Yemenis and Syrians but certainly very less than the Andalusis that took the other way, inmigrating into Africa (<a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangiers.html" title="Tangiers">Tangiers</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetouan.html" title="Tetouan">Tetouan</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oran.html" title="Oran">Oran</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunis.html" title="Tunis">Tunis</a> and even <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timbuktu.html" title="Timbuktu">Timbuktu</a> received Andalusi inmigration waves in different times). As for population percentages, it is a bit difficult to know exact numbers, but according to some historians like Joseph Pérez the process of islamization was very slow at the start and almost 3/4 parts of the population of Al-Andalus up to the year 900 was still Christian. Then, the process accelerated and become the inverse due to several factors: increasing intolerance (specially during the Almohad rule), Christian advance in the north -and consequently reduction of the land ruled by the Muslims-, conversion or migration to the north in order to avoid increasing religious taxes, et cetera. Jews are a bigger problem. The scholars don't agree even today about how many Jews lived in Spain in 1491, so you can imagine what we knew about Jewish numbers before the first clear persecutions in the Christian kingdoms (14th century) or during the "Golden Age of Judaism in Spain", just before the arrive of the Almohads. From what I'd read their number wasn't never great, no more than a few hundred thousands.--Menah the Great 00:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. In my opinion, this article has several problems. Let´s start by talkig about the images used. Now, if you´re going to talk about Al-Andalus you should use images from the high point of this society, which is the period of the Caliphate of Córdoba, not an image from the Alhambra palace, which really is the decadent period of Al-Andalus. That image of the Jewish cantor also doesn´t make much sense here because its from the 14th century - not the time of the "Jewish Golden Age" in Al-Andalus.</p>
<p>It seems to me people started to politicize this article talking about "tolerance" or lack of it. Let´s have in mind that people in the Middle Ages did not think like us, nor did they share our modern political concepts. I´ve tried to write a bit about society in Al-Andalus, maybe somebody could check my writing since I´m not a native English speaker. I´ll try to write more soon. --<a href="../../../j/l/c/User%7EJLCA_e2fd.html" title="User:JLCA">JLCA</a> 14:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"...To Cordoba belong all the beauty and ornaments that delight the eye or dazzle the sight. Her long line of Sultans form her crown of glory; her necklace is strung with the pearls which her poets have gathered from the ocean of language; her dress is of the banners of learning, well-knit together by her men of science; and the masters of every art and industry are the hem of her garments.</p>
<p>"Art, literature and science prospered as they then prospered nowhere else in Europe...</p>
<p>"Mathematics, astronomy, botany, history, philosophy and jurisprudence were to be mastered in Spain, and Spain alone. Whatever makes a kingdom great and prosperous, whatever tends to refinement and civilization, was found in Muslim Spain...</p>
<p>"With Granada fell all Spain's greatness. For a brief while, indeed, the reflection of the Moorish splendour cast a borrowed light upon the history of the land which it had once warmed with its sunny radiance. The great epoch of Isabella, Charles V and Philip II, of Columbus, Cortes and Pizarro, shed a last halo about the dying monuments of a mighty state. When followed the abomination of dissolution, the rule of inquisition and the blackness of darkness in which Spain has been plunged ever since. "In the land where science was once supreme, the Spanish doctors became noted for nothing but their ignorance and incapacity. The arts of Toledo and Almeria faded into insignificance.</p>
<p>"The land deprived of skillful irrigation of the Moors, grew impoverished and neglected, the richest and most fertile valleys languished and were deserted, and most of the populous cities which had filled every district in Andalusia, fell into ruinous decay; and beggars, friars, and bandits took the place of scholars, merchants and knights. So low fell Spain when she had driven away the Moors. Such is the melancholy contrast offered by her history."</p>
<p>Conde as quoted in Prescott, Philip II of Spain, Vol. III.</p>
<p>"And so vanquished for ever from the Spanish territory this brave, intelligent and enlightened people, who with their resolution and labour inspired life into the land, which the vain pride of the Goths condemned to sterility, and endowed it with prosperity and abundance and with innumerable canals, this people whose admirable courage was likewise, in happiness and adversity, a strong rampart to the throne of the Caliphs, whose genius, progress and study raised in its cities an internal edifice of light which sent its rays into Europe and inspired it with the passion of study, and whose magnanimous spirit tinted all its acts with an unrivalled colour of grandeur and nobility, and endowed it in the eyes of posterity with a sort of extraordinary greatness and charming colour of heroism which invokes the magical ages of Homer and which presents them to us in the garb of Greek half-gods.</p>
<p>"The Arabs suddenly appeared in Spain like a star which crosses through the air with its light, spreads its flames on the Horizon and then vanishes rapidly into naught. They appeared in Spain to fill her suddenly with their activity and the fruit of their genius, and endowed her with a glorious glamour which enveloped her from the Pyrenees to Gibraltar and from the oceans to the Barcelona. But a burning love for liberty and independance, a fickle character disposed to frivolty and merriness, neglect of old virtues, an unfortunate disposition of revolution, provoked always by an inflamed imagination, violent passions and ambitions, a spirit to dominate, and other factors of decay, worked in the course of time, to demolish this grand edifice raised by men like Tariq, 'Abdul Rahman al-Nasir, Muhammad ibn al-Ahmer, and led the Arabs to internal dissention, which sapped their power and pushed them to the abyss of naught.</p>
<p>"Millions of Moors quitted Spain carrying their property and arts - the patrimony of a state. What have the Spaniards created in their place? We could say nothing, but an eternal sorrow fills this land in which the gayest natures breathed before. Indeed there are some ruined monuments which still look upon these gloomy districts, but a real cry resounds from the depths of these monuments and ruins: honour and glory to the conquered Moor and decay and misery to the victorious Spaniard!"</p>
<p>Gustav Lebon</p>
<p>"For five to six hundred years general books in Arabic language and particularly on various disciplines have been almost the only source of learning and teaching in the European universities. And we can safely assert that in certain disciplines like medicine the impressions of the Arabs are still at work in Europe. The medical writings of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) have been explained about the close of the last century in Monabiliah."</p>
<p>"Roger Bacon, Leonard, Erno Al Felquni, Raymond Lot, San Thoma, and Azfonish X Qashqani have solely depended on Arabic Books."</p>
<p>Renan</p>
<p>"Albert, the Great, is indebted to Ibn Sina and San Thoma owes it all to Ibn Rushd (Averroes)."</p>
<p>Homeld on Science</p>
<p>"It was the Arabs who for the first time invented the method of chemical preparation of medicines, and it was from this source that sound advice and the procedure of experiments came to us, which were taken up by the School of Saliram and from there after a long time spread to southern Europe. The medicine and the natural elements on which medication entirely depends became the cause of study of plants' Chemistry. In this way both these studies went on simultaneously in two different ways and thus the door on a new era of the study of this science was opened by the Arabs. Suffice it for the proof of the vast Arab knowledge of the plant kingdom that they made addition of two thousand herbs to those of Zulefuredas. There were many herbs in their pharmacy that the Greeks had not even dreamt of."</p>
<p>Sideo</p>
<p>"During the middle ages, the Arabs alone were the standard-bearers of a civilisation."</p>
<p>"When the Arabs gained expertise in Astronomy, they paid special attention to Mathematical sciences and gained a high degree of excellence and they were really our teachers in this field....When we take stock of all that got transferred from Arabic to Latin, we find that a great doorway was made in the name of Gerbert Sylvester II, through which during the period between 970-980 AD, all those sciences he had acquired in Andalusia had entered Europe."</p>
<p>..."Our searching gaze rests on the Malikite Law, since we have had contacts with Africa, and France had ordered its competent learned men to translate into French the short compendium on Fiqh (jurisprudence) compiled by Ishaq bin Yaqub (d. 1242 AD, his book titled "Kitab-e-Khalil")</p>
<p>..."For full six hundred years his (Ibn Sina, Avicenna) works held sway over the educational institutions of Europe. His book Al-Qanun (Canon) was translated in five volumes and had repeated reprints, since the instruction in the universities of France and Italy totally depended on it."</p>
<p>Martin Hume in 'Spanish People'</p>
<p>"The Sultan Abd-er-Rahman was one of the Heaven-sent rulers of men. Prompt yet cautious in council and in war, unscrupulous, overbearing and proud, he was as ready to wreak terrible vengeance, as he was politic to forgive when it suited him. Berber and Yamanite alike acknowledged that at last they had found their master....He ruled until his death, in 788, with the tempered severity, wisdom, and justice which made his domain the best organized in Europe, and his capital the most splendid in the world."</p>
<p>S.P. Scott in 'The History of the Moorish Empire in Europe.'</p>
<p>"Yet there were knowledge and learning everywhere except in Catholic Europe. At a time when even kings could not read or write, a Moorish king had a private library of six hundred thousand books. At a time when ninety-nine percent of the Christian people were wholly illiterate, the Moorish city of Cordova had eight hundred public schools, and there was not a village within the limits of the empire where the blessings of education could not be enjoyed by the children of the most indigent peasant, ...and it was difficult to encounter even a Moorish peasant who could not read and write."</p>
<p>Thomson in 'The Muslims in Andalusia.'</p>
<p>Europe was darkened at sunset, Cordova shone with public lamps; Europe was dirty, Cordova built a thousand baths; ..., Cordova changed its undergarments daily; Europe lay in mud, Cordovas streets were paved; Europes palaces had smoke-holes in the ceiling, Cordovas arabesques were exquisite; Europes nobility could not sign its name, Cordovas children went to school; Europes monks could not read the baptismal service, Cordovas teachers created a library of Alexandrian dimensions. (800-1000 C.E.)</p>
<p>Dozy in 'The Moslems in Spain.'</p>
<p>Cruel and fanatical, the Leonese rarely gave quarter; when they captured a town they usually put all the inhabitants to the sword. Tolerance such as that accorded by the Muslims to the Christians could not be expected of them.</p>
<p>H. Kamen, 'The Spanish Inquisition.'</p>
<p>"As a result of his (Cardinal Ximenes' coercive) endeavours, it is reported that on l8th December 1499 about three thousand Moors were baptized by him and a leading mosque in Granada was converted into a church. 'Converts' were encouraged to surrender their Islamic books, several thousands of which were destroyed by Ximenes in a public bonfire. A few rare books on medicine were kept aside for the University of Alcala...(Ximenes) claimed...the Moors had forfeited all their rights under the terms of capitulation (of Granada). They should therefore be given the choice between baptism and expulsion...At Andarax the principal mosque, in which the women and children had taken refuge, was blown up with gun-powder...all books in Arabic, especially the Qur'an, were collected to be burnt...Cardinal Ximenes:...was reported during his conversion campaign among the Granada Moors in 1500 to have burnt in the public square of Vivarrambla over 1,005,000 volumes including unique works of Moorish culture."</p>
<p>H.C. Lea, 'The Moriscos of Spain.'</p>
<p>"...that cemeteries could be established near the churches changed from mosques, but old Christians were not to be debarred from burial there if they wished....it continued until 1591 when it was ordered that they should be buried inside of the churches, which was so abhorrent to them that they vainly offered more than thirty thousand ducats if king or pope would allow them to be interred elsewhere, even though in dunghills.</p>
<p>"... tailors were not to make garments nor silver-smiths jewels after their (Moorish) fashion; their baths were prohibited; all births were to be watched by Christian midwives to see that no Moorish rites were performed; disarmament was to be enforced by a rigid inspection of licences; their doors were to be kept open on feast-days, Fridays, Saturdays, and during weddings, to see that Moorish rites were abandoned and Christian ones observed...no Moorish names were to be used and they were not to keep 'gacis' or unbaptised Moors either free or as slaves."</p>

<p>I am trying to use this page and others to help with some historical research. I appreciate that this is not what wikipedia is for&#160;;-) but feel I should point out that amid all the arguments about tolerance or lack of it, there is still quite a lot of historical information missing. Right at the start there is a jump from talking about Al-Andalus to talking about Granada. This won't help newcomers to the subject at all. Then there is the question of whether Granada became a client state - of Castile? Aragon? Portugal? - from 1236. This isn't at all the impression that you get from looking at the pages relating to those Christian kingdoms and their various rulers. There seems to have been a great deal of conflict across the peninsula in the following decades. It isn't clear either from the article who the Marinids were and what their significance was. Sorry to be negative, but it's a question of getting the article back on track. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 22:34, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you are probably aware mentions to an Al Andalus "re-reconquista" by muslims are not uncommon in fundamentalists´ agenda (in particular in Al Quaeda´s tapes). I would like to know more about how seriously we should take this, it gives me the creeps. I am not sure but i think either the Coran or some scholars argue that a land once muslim must always be muslim. Anyway, I think perhaps a mention in the article wouldn´t be out of the question.--217.130.121.152 12:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sure this is not in the Qur'an, although people can take texts out of context and distort them to imply what they want. It may be that some scholar has argued it, but perhaps it is just Al Qaida. Can you find a mention of this view in a reputable newspaper, which would constitute an encyclopedic source? <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 19:44, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the tapes are public knowledge, googling al qaeda+al andalus returns a lot of related results. About the doctrine behind that idea I cannot find something specific but I haven´t tried seriously. I looked in some sites but they looked either islamophobic or pro-islamic divulgation sites so I gave up. Besides I find it difficult to follow the arguments with constant references to the Quran and use of arabic terms. Someone here should be more comfortable with them. Anyway, provisionally I am gonna classify the whole matter as a "crazy-terrorist-delusional-fantasy" in my mind.</p>

<dd>That's a good idea but it requires at least one compromised editor. Personally rather than "Islam in Spain", I'd work in "Muslim community in Spain", what should adress mostly the issue of immigrants of North African and other Muslim origins in Spain, their social and legal situation, demographics, and, of course, the aspect of religion, which is virtually exclusive of this community of mostly recent immigration. It would surely give a better (more complete and coherent) article. The historical reference should be very brief and directing to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Andalus_24f6.html" title="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>.</dd>

Over time Castille came to dominate most of Iberia (but not Portugal, except for a small period between 1580 and 1640) and the use of the castillian word "España" (which is the castillian version of latin Hispania) started as a political strategy to curb autonomy or independence from centralist Madrid (for the same reason Castillian language started to be known as Spanish, implying the irrelevance of other Iberian languages - this was still a problem in the Spain of the 20th century, with the active repression of languages other than Castillian). Furthermore, if you call Spain to the Iberian peninsula, this not only is simply not true, but is felt as profoundly offensive at least by the Portuguese.

<dd>Great. Well, IMO, as there's much to relate it is preferable to have 2 or 3 articles as per above.

<p>Regarding the following: "Within two decades a majority of the inhabitants of Andalus, especially most of the Unitarian Christians and the oppressed class, accepted Islam freely in recognition of the peace, security and the freedom of religion and expression under the Muslim rule. (Gothic Princess Sara). By 770 C.E. people of all races from North Africa and Arabia migrated to Andalusia (Spain and Portugal). They intermarried with various nationalities including the native Spanish-Muslim population, with the result that Spain became a fairly homogeneous country within a few generations." All the books I have read on the subject show this assertion - that Andalusia became mostly Muslim within two decades, and that there was homogeneity within a few generations - to be false. To quote but one scholar, "By about 800 only some 8% of the indigenous population of al-Andalus had become Muslims. This had rised to about 12.5% by the middle of the ninth century. Thereafter the figure increased by leaps and bounds.... By about the year 1000 the proportion stood at something like 75%, after which the [conversion] curve flattened out." - Richard Fletcher, "Moorish Spain," p37-38. Similarly, Bernard Reilly writes that "...a very sizeable Christian majority remained within the area of Spanish Islam until well into the 10th Century." ("The Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain", p19). These assertions are based on the work of Richard Bulliet in "Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period" (1979), which is seen as the authority on the subject by scholars in the field (Thomas Glick and Bernard Reilly to name two others). So the picture of a majority of Andalusian Christians converting to Islam within TWO DECADES is patently absurd. Twenty years is not a very long time for something so major to take effect, and the gradual conversion, as posited by Bulliet and others, is much more realistic.

<p>It is reasonable to suppose then that the corresponding Gothic designation "Landahlauts" (allotted, inherited, drawn land), in its phonetic form — "landalos" — became easily and spontaneously, to Arabic ears, "Al-Andalus". Maybe. But it's not totaly true&#160;: <i>landahlauts</i> was pronounced <b>landaχlɔts</b>.

<dl>
<dd>You mean [landaxlauts], with velar instead of uvular fricative. Anyway, this objection is not necessarily correct, because languages lose and gain sounds over time. Latin at the time of the Visigoth conquest (and Latin was the living language of Hispania then) didn't have [x], and in Spanish, [ʃ] as in Portuguese 'x' or English 'sh' did not become [x] until after the time of Columbus. So Halm's idea is quite plausible phonetically.</dd>
<dd>But more importantly, Halm's proposal, although ingenious, is totally unsubstantiated by direct evidence. The person who wrote this Etymology section wrote carelessly, confusing fact with conjecture, messing up citation formats. I have just rewritten the entire section. We have no proof that the Visigoths ever used the word 'landahlauts'. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 03:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Within just the last week, I have wanted to link this article to a concise description of Visigothic Spain. My internal link has twice been undone by "The Ogre", who raises false justifications, some of them baseless obsessions. It is a weak argument to say that the History of Spain has too broad a scope to be a good choice. There are many subdivisions in the History of Spain article. In particular, for now (i.e., until somebody were to edit it) there is a section entitled "Visigothic Hispania". "The Ogre's" approach of linking *separately* to "Visigoths" and "Hispania" is obviously a bad idea for the user becaues either you have to synthesize separate articles or you have to duplicate information between two articles. Even "The Ogre's" second argument, that you *have* to always choose to link to the article of narrower scope, is a weak argument. The Ogre has a disturbing insistence on the false idea that the political entities in Iberia before 1000 A.D. were not Spain. Despite "The Ogre", Spanish history starts at least with the Roman occupation. "The Ogre" inadvertently revealed himself to be a Spanish speaker (by using a Spanish verb in place of an English one), so it is especially annoying for this reasoning to be coming out of him. One last point, a practical point. The article on the Visigoths happens to be very badly written. It is clumsy, inaccurate, overlong. Also, even if it were well writen, it gives too much detail for what I'm after in the Al-Andalus article. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 00:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Postscript</i>: "The Ogre's" point about "History of Spain" being very broad in scope does have some merit to it. But, in that article, at just the third screenload down, one can see the Table of Contents, with "Visigothic Hispania" being item 3. I think that's sufficient orientation. If somebody cleans up the Visigoths article and provides a concise first or second paragraph to summarize their place in *Spanish* history, then I might be glad to link to that instead. In editing Al-Andalus, I *was* going to write, "Visigothic Spain" until I saw it was being call "V. Hispania" in History of Spain. Strange: the History of Spain says "Roman Spain". Anyway: hey Ogre! When somebody says, "Roman Spain", don't worry, there's no confusion of modern Spain with ancient Iberia!

<p>I'm sorry, <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a>, but there is confusion! An encyclopedia should correct long standing errors, such as calling Spain to Iberia or Hispania. The word "Spain" in modern English (and its counterparts in other languages) means the country of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> (and it links there!), not all of the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_peninsula.html" title="Iberian peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispania.html" title="Hispania">Hispania</a> (as the respective articles show). The fact is that <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castile_%28historical_region%29.html" title="Castile (historical region)">Castilian</a> expansionism over the centuries (ask not only the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a>, but also the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galicia_%28Spain%29_67cb.html" title="Galicia (Spain)">Galicians</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_e62e.html" title="Basque Country">Basques</a> or the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalans</a>...) tried to monopolize the definition of Iberia in a way that satisfied its imperial interests. In fact, even if Spain was used in ancient times to refer to the whole of Iberia, today it is not. In this sense, given that the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Spain_033d.html" title="History of Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a> only emerges with the union of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Castile_44a2.html" title="Kingdom of Castile">Castile</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Aragon_5f9e.html" title="Kingdom of Aragon">Aragon</a> in <a href="../../../1/4/9/1492.html" title="1492">1492</a> (and this is disputed since <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Navarre_4da2.html" title="Kingdom of Navarre">Navarre</a> was only incoporated in <a href="../../../1/5/1/1512.html" title="1512">1512</a>; for a presentation of this issue, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Spanish_monarchs_3582.html#Kings.2C_Queens_of_Spain" title="List of Spanish monarchs">Kings and Queens of Spain</a>), one can almost say that there was never a Spain, in the modern sense, before that! It was Iberia that began being conquered by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Republic_9497.html" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a>, a conquest finalized by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, who called it <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispania.html" title="Hispania">Hispania</a>.

This conquest and subsequent occupation led to a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> reaction know as the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconquista.html" title="Reconquista">Reconquista</a> from which several Christian kingdoms emerged (such as <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Asturias_50c4.html" title="Kingdom of Asturias">Asturias</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n_c15b.html" title="Kingdom of León">León</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Castile_44a2.html" title="Kingdom of Castile">Castile</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Navarre_4da2.html" title="Kingdom of Navarre">Navarre</a>, etc.). Over time Castile came to dominate most of Iberia (but not Portugal, <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_Union_cb15.html" title="Iberian Union">except for a small period between 1580 and 1640</a>) and the use of the castilian word "España" (which is the castilian derivative of the latin Hispania) started as a political strategy to curb autonomy or independence from centralist <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> (for the same reason <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castilian_language.html" title="Castilian language">Castilian language</a> started to be known as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a>, implying the irrelevance of other <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_languages.html" title="Iberian languages">Iberian languages</a> - this was still a problem in the Spain of the 20th century, with the active repression of languages and identities other than Castilian, see <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_of_Spain_a08a.html" title="Languages of Spain">Languages of Spain</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalities_in_Spain_1589.html" title="Nationalities in Spain">Nationalities in Spain</a>). Furthermore, if you call Spain to the Iberian peninsula or Hispania, this not only is simply not true, but is felt as profoundly offensive at least by the Portuguese. For all these reasons and more, this article should not emply that Spain is Iberia or Hispania, and that there is an exclusive direct descent from ancient Hispania to modern Spain. Please my friend, acknowledge my good faith and desire for exactness! I have nothing against Spain! quite the opposite. And you should notice that I am a member both of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Portugal_dae6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Portugal">WikiProject Portugal</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spain_e988.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spain">WikiProject Spain</a>! For all these reasons I believe the link Visigothic Hispania (how about creating a new article just dealing with that?) <b>should not direct</b> to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Spain_033d.html" title="History of Spain">History of Spain</a>, not only this is too broad a scope, but it is wrong, since it implies Spain is Hispania, excluding Portugal. Furthermore, why should there be a link when there is already a box of the "History of Spain"? And even more when in that box the link regarding the period of "Visigothic Hispania" is directly to the article <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoths.html" title="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> (as a sub-entry to the Spanish history stub <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain_in_the_Middle_Ages_18e5.html" title="Spain in the Middle Ages">Medieval Spain</a>)?

<dd>In my view a link back to the history of Spain toward the beginning of this article is entirely appropriate and useful for the reader. So that the reference isn't too restricted, the opening paragraph could refer to "Visigothic Spain and Portugal" with links to the history articles of each of these nations so that the reader can follow up with one (or both) if further information on the Visigoths in Spain or Portugal is desired. I think that's the simple and best solution, at least until there is an article devoted to the Visigoths in Iberia generally.<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorlyon_f981.html" title="User:Corlyon">Corlyon</a> 19:30, 1 April 2007 (UTC)Corlyon

<dd>I insist: Ogre, in his/her zeal to correct the world's misunderstandings of Spanish and Iberian history, just mucks up the historical facts. Hispania and Iberia essentially mean the same thing strictly *historically*, because "Iberia" is from Ancient Greek and "Hispania" is from Latin. (*Geographically*, they are not equally acceptable because "Iberia" is accepted as having a contemporary reference, while "Hispania" is not.) Furthermore, Portugal the *political* entity *did not yet exist* during the Visigothic period (and did not *come* into existence for another 250 years or so)! PLUS, the Visigoth kingdom included modern Portugal! Corlyon's well meaning suggestion of "Visigothic Spain and Portugal" is therefore historically unjustified *in the present context* (it would only be justified in a discussion limited to *Portuguese* history). Indeed, Ogre's concerns seem to be perfectly addressed by saying "Visigothic Hispania" in preference to "Visigothic Spain": what the Visigoths invaded and governed starting in the 420s WAS Hispania, and with the exception of Galicia (which has never been Portuguese culturally or politically!), the Visigoths soon conquered all of Hispania. (They got Galicia too after another century or so.) So perhaps the rest of you can understand my impatience with Ogre's attempts to "set us straight".</dd>
<dd>Seems like Ogre is obsessed with the repercussions of Castilian imperialism and chauvinism, to the extent of overstating his/her (let's say "their") case. I find Ogre to be a prisoner of their biases. I would like to interpose some personal history. I visited Spain for a month -- the whole of the visit was in Barcelona. I practiced reading newspapers in the Catalan language and my stay happened to coincide with the Catalan National Day. I have also dabbled in the Basque language and I'm a student of the dialectology of the Spanish language. During the 1994 World Cup, I read Brazilian newspapers. So I am sophisticated as to all the cultural and historical differences Ogre is concerned about. Ogre reasons falsely that if you refer readers to an article about "Spain" for a discussion of Visigothic Hispania, then you are equating modern Spain with Iberia.</dd>
<dd>I concede to Ogre that ideally, the information I wish to direct readers to should be located in an article on Visigoths or Hispania, or both. But the brief and well written writeup I wanted, I found it in "History of Spain" under the already existing heading of "Visigothic Hispania". If someone perversely had placed this paragraph in the article on Led Zeppelin, I might well have linked to Led Zeppelin! In that event, I would also have placed comments in the respective Discussion pages imploring that somebody move "Visigothic Hispania" from Led Zeppelin to Visigoths and Hispania. Lastly, I still feel that Ogre screwed up by making the phrase "Visigothic Hispania" link to TWO articles (each word linked to an article). I think THAT is "confusing". If you insist on keeping the readers away from History_of_Spain, then pick *one* alternative. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 06:06, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Hurmata. I do not see how do I muck up the historical facts - people that confuse Spain and Hispania (or Iberia - yes! Historically the same thing, but not in the modern geographical sense, I agree) are the one who are mucking up historical facts! And I agree with your reasoning that "Visigothic Spain and Portugal" is historically unjustified in the present context, not only because Portugal did not yet exist during the Visigothic period as a political entity, but also because <b>Spain did not yet exist during the Visigothic period as a political entity!</b> What existed was Hispania - Visigothic Hispania. Let us remeber that this is just a discussion about a link. I disagree with your choice to redirect it to the History of Spain article, though I do give some credit to your idea of not having it linked to two different articles. The best choice would be indeed to have an article called Visighotic Hispania. Why don't we work on it? Meanwhile I'm redirecting the link not just to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Spain_033d.html" title="History of Spain">History of Spain</a> but more specifically to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Spain_033d.html#Visigothic_Hispania_.285th.E2.80.938th_centuries.29" title="History of Spain">History of Spain#Visigothic Hispania</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ogre_8ae7.html" title="User:The Ogre">The Ogre</a> 13:13, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We need for "somebodies" with existing expertise to clean up several articles in this field. I found an account of the Muslim invasion of Iberia which confused the invaders Tarif and Tariq (I thought I saw that in "Visigoths"). The article History_of_Portugal is awful because it is crudely reverential as opposed to encylopedic, and because it is thin as to factual depth.</p>
