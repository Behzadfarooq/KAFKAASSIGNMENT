<p>was he a Arab??</p>
<p>He was muslim! Nationalism is a modern concept introduced to the islamic world by colonial powers.</p>
<p>Irrelevant, more quotations might be useful</p>
<hr />
<p>Not my speciality, but my grasp of the history shows that since the C7th, when arab forces conquered Persia, there have been important questions over ethnicity within the Islamic world. I'd accept that Islam has generally been able to reach across national and racial divides, and that most Muslims accept the idea of a broad community of Islam, but the idea that race and nationality either don't matter within the Umma, or that dividions along these lines are all due to the perfidious colonials is ahistorical.---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 09:54, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Postscript</b>: wrt to above question: he was Persian. An afterthought on what I have written: I don't mean to say that muslims have no legitimate grievances against their colonisers, rather that, while divide and rule was an explicit, destructive strategy of European colonisers, its effectiveness depended upon there being divisions to exploit. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 10:06, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think some people?! have this tendency to make all the great Muslim minds "Persian" when one cannot really tell with certainty. This is really very disturbing. -Serkan</p>
<p>I think it's disturbing to see the same thing from the Arab and Turks as well.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 00:49, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There needs to be some sort of consensus among all editors of Muslim scientists, as there are constant revert wars between Turks, Arabs, and Persians on whichever article you look at.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 01:02, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the only way is to acknowledge everyone and be <b>inclusive</b>. Thus Rumi can be identified as both Turkish <i>and</i> Persian. Or Ibn Rushd can be mentioned to be both Arab <i>and</i> Spanish. Or Zinuddin Zidan is both French <i>and</i> Arab. Only then can we avoid this stupid racial shit, and get to the more important stuff.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 07:49, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although Islam is inclusive in theory, the reality is more complex. Read for instance this essay: <a href="http://www.muslimwakeup.com/main/archives/2003/12/002110print.php" class="external text" title="http://www.muslimwakeup.com/main/archives/2003/12/002110print.php" rel="nofollow">Blasphemy Before God: The Darkness of Racism In Muslim Culture</a>.</p>
<p>This article is unsatisfactory IMHO. It appears to be confusing and contradictory. Was Ghazali an Asharite or wasn't he? I have heard him quoted as saying that "the study of science and philosophy was harmful because it would shake man's faith in God and undermine the Muslim religion." Did he shut the door on Islamic science or not? I'm no clearer on this question after having read the article. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgerLangkjer_d7bc.html" title="User:BirgerLangkjer">BirgerLangkjer</a> 11:42, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is copied verbatim from <a href="http://www.ghazali.org/articles/gz1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ghazali.org/articles/gz1.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As an example, two paragraphs from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Al-Ghazali is one of the greatest Islamic theologians and mystical thinkers. He learned various branches of traditional Islamic religious sciences in his home town of Tus, Gorgan and Nishapur in the northern part of Iran. He was also involved in Sufi practices from an early age. Being recognized by Nizam al-Mulk, the vizir of the Seljuq sultans, he was appointed head of the Nizamiyyah College at Baghdad in AH 484/1091 CE. As the intellectual head of the Islamic community, he was busy lecturing on Islamic jurisprudence at the College, and also refuting heresies and responding to questions from all segments of the community. Four years later, however, al-Ghazali fell into a serious spiritual crisis and finally left Baghdad, renouncing his career and the world. After wandering in Syria and Palestine for about two years and finishing the pilgrimage to Mecca, he returned to Tus, where he was engaged in writing, Sufi practices and teaching his disciples until his death. In the meantime he resumed teaching for a few years at the Nizamiyyah College in Nishapur.</dd>
<dd>Al-Ghazali explained in his autobiography why he renounced his brilliant career and turned to Sufism. It was, he says, due to his realization that there was no way to certain knowledge or the conviction of revelatory truth except through Sufism. (This means either that the traditional form of Islamic faith was in a very critical condition at the time, or he simply did not agree with the standard day to day grind of "ordinary" Islam.) This realization is possibly related to his criticism of Islamic philosophy. In fact, his refutation of philosophy is not a mere criticism from a certain (orthodox) theological viewpoint. First of all, his attitude towards philosophy was ambivalent; it was both an object of criticism and an object of learning (for example, logic and the natural sciences). He mastered philosophy and then criticized it in order to Islamicize it. The importance of his criticism lies in his philosophical demonstration that the philosophers' metaphysical arguments cannot stand the test of reason. However, he was also forced to admit that the certainty of revelatory truth, for which he was so desperately searching, cannot be obtained by reason. It was only later that he finally attained to that truth in fana' which in Sufism refers to the state of losing one's self and ego. Through his own religious experience, he worked to revive the faith of Islam by reconstructing the religious sciences upon the basis of Sufism, and to give a theoretical foundation to the latter under the influence of philosophy. Thus Sufism came to be generally recognized in the Islamic community. Though Islamic philosophy did not long survive al-Ghazali's criticism, he contributed greatly to the subsequent philosophization of Islamic theology and Sufism.</dd>

Just look at the number of muslim nobel prize winners. --80.56.36.253 13:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Such prominent Muslim scientists as there are nowadays mostly work in Western institutions in Western countries. Prominent scientist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Weinberg_4602.html" title="Steven Weinberg">Steven Weinberg</a> freely grants the existence of the Arabian Golden Age, and the presence of brilliant Muslims among his colleagues. But, he says, in forty years he has never seen a scientific paper worth reading from a Muslim country.</li>

<li><i>But I couldn't really find a good explanation about his role in the decline of civilisation that has been lasting till today.</i> Look at the "Legacy" section in the wiki article on al-Ghazali' <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers_1824.html" title="The Incoherence of the Philosophers">The Incoherence of the Philosophers</a> to see one hypothesis.</li>

<dd>I think what <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_c824.html" title="Neil deGrasse Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> has stated is completely incorrect. Have you ever read in any of Ghazali's works where he has declined the science and civilisation? I am sure, you have not. Here's the online edition of his book <b>Book of Knowledge</b> in his work <b>Ihya'ul Uludmuddin</b> (The Revival of Religious Sciences): <a href="http://www.ghazali.org/works/bk1-sec-1.htm#bk1-intro" class="external text" title="http://www.ghazali.org/works/bk1-sec-1.htm#bk1-intro" rel="nofollow">LINK</a></dd>
<dd>Ghazali has dedicated a complete book on Sciences and Knowledge, and he has never declined science or civilisation.</dd>
<dd>In his book <b>Kimyaye Sa'aadat (Alchemy of Happiness)</b>, he writes, using a strong language, about the scholars and some Sufis of that period who used to prohibit people from learning modern sciences: <i>...and those who call themselves as Shaikh or Peer, and tell people not to learn knowledge because it will become a veil between them and their lord, are fully in ignorance. They have not yet found the truth. Any modern science that the society needs is an obligation upon an individual to learn.</i> (I hope there wasn't any mistake in translation).</dd>
<dd>I suggest to go directly to the original source instead of listening from a person reporting.<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriana310_7edf.html" title="User:Ariana310">Ariana310</a> 13:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
