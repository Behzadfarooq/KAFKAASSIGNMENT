<p>The first company was founded in 1946 under the name <i>Abdulatif and Abdulkadir Al-Muhaidib Company</i>. Its main interest was selling <a href="../../../w/h/o/Wholesale.html" title="Wholesale">wholesale</a> <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building_materials.html" title="Building materials">building materials</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foodstuffs.html" title="Foodstuffs">foodstuffs</a>. In 1959 the company name was changed to <i>Al-Muhaidib and Al-Nafea Company</i>, and in 1979 it was changed again to <i>A.K Al-Muhaidib &amp; Sons Group of Companies</i>.</p>
<p>A.K. Al-Muhaidib &amp; Sons group of companies began its life in the food products industry in 1959, marketing and distributing rice. Although this sector has remained the fastest-growing within the group, allowing the company to expand its portfolio to include other grains and eventually leading to the establishment of a retail outlet chain, Giant Stores, the group relates its overall success to diversification. By maintaining a presence in various independent economic sectors, the company is assured that industries on the rise will carry any sector that may not be doing so robustly.</p>
<p>The group’s other main interest, building materials, has thrived along with Saudi Arabia’s economic and industrial development. An eye for the right opportunity and the right partner with which to do business are central to the group’s success, and this is down to careful selection of managers. Indeed, human resources are a priority at Al-Muhaidib, a fact that is reflected in the low staff turnover.</p>
<p>Sulaiman Al-Muhaidib, the group’s chairman, is keen to acquire more partners from the U.S. “With the growth of opportunities here, the Saudis are calling out to the Americans. Every Saudi would like to work with Americans because they think big,” he says. Today the group stands as one of the leading companies in Saudi Arabia and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.</p>
