<p>The key piece of physical evidence linking the al-Shifa facility to production of chemical weapons was the discovery of EMPTA in a soil sample taken from the plant during a CIA clandestine operation. EMPTA, or <a href="../../../o/-/e/O-Ethyl_methylphosphonothioic_acid_ae4c.html" title="O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid">O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid</a>, is classified as a Schedule 2B compound according to the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_Weapons_Convention_30b4.html" title="Chemical Weapons Convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> and is a <a href="../../../v/x/_/VX_%28nerve_agent%29_d753.html" title="VX (nerve agent)">VX</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Precursor" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Precursor">precursor</a>. Although several theoretical uses for EMPTA were postulated as well as several patented process using EMPTA, such as the manufacture of plastic, no known industrial uses of EMPTA were ever documented nor any products that contained EMPTA. It is, however, not banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention as originally claimed by the US government. Moreover, it does not necessarily follow from the presence of EMPTA near (but outside) the boundary of Al-Shifa that this was produced in the factory: EMPTA could have been "stored in or transported near al-Shifa, instead of being produced by it," <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol06/61/barlet61.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol06/61/barlet61.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> according to a report by Michael Barletta.</p>

<p>Under-Secretary of State <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_R._Pickering_a231.html" title="Thomas R.

The National Democratic Alliance [NDA], a Sudanese opposition in Cairo led by Mubarak Al-Mahdi, also insisted that the plant was producing ingredients for chemical weapons. <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2098102/" class="external autonumber" title="http://slate.msn.com/id/2098102/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Former Clinton administration counter terrorism advisor <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_A._Clarke_bb3c.html" title="Richard A.

<p>Officials later acknowledged, however, "that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s."<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/international/africa/20khartoum.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/international/africa/20khartoum.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>However, a Clinton State Department official had stated that a money manager for Bin Laden had claimed that Bin Laden had, indeed, invested in Al Shifa. And that the Al Shifa manager even lived in the same Sudan house Bin Laden himself had previously lived in. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9809/01/sudan.plant/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9809/01/sudan.plant/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak."<a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/sudbous.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/sudbous.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> The Chairman of El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, who is critical of the Sudanese government, more recently told reporters, "I had inventories of every chemical and records of every employee's history. There were no such [nerve gas] chemicals being made here."<a href="http://www.christiansciencemonitor.com/2004/0126/p01s05-woaf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christiansciencemonitor.com/2004/0126/p01s05-woaf.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Nontheless, Clinton's Secretary of State William Cohen, testified to the 9/11 Commission in 2004, characterizing Al Shifa as a "WMD-related facility", which played a "chemical weapons role" such as to pose a risk that it, with the help of the Iraqi chemical weapons program connections he also testified to, might help Al Qaeda get chemical weapons technology. <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing8/cohen_statement.pdf#search='cohen%20prepared%20testimony'" class="external text" title="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing8/cohen_statement.pdf#search='cohen%20prepared%20testimony'" rel="nofollow">Page 9</a></p>
<p>Sudan has since invited the U.S. to conduct chemical tests at the site for evidence to support its claim that the plant might have been a chemical weapons factory; so far, the U.S. has refused the invitation to investigate. Nevertheless, the U.S. has refused to officially apologize for the attacks, suggesting that some privately still suspect that chemical weapons activity existed there.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/international/africa/20khartoum.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/international/africa/20khartoum.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khartoum.html" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> attack was noted for its outstanding precision, as successive missiles all but levelled the al-Shifa works with minimal damage to surrounding areas, although one person was killed and ten wounded in the attack.</p>
<p>Directly after the strike the Sudanese government demanded that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Security_Council_459a.html" title="United Nations Security Council">Security Council</a> conduct an investigation of the site to determine if it had been used to produce chemical weapons or precursors. Such an investigation was from the start opposed by the US. Nor has USA ever let an independent laboratory analyze the sample allegedly containing EMPTA. Michael Barletta concludes that there is no evidence the al-Shifa factory was ever involved in production of chemical weapons, and it is known that many of the initial US allegations were wrong<a href="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol06/61/barlet61.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol06/61/barlet61.pdf" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>The factory was a principal source of <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>'s anti-<a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and veterinary drugs.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Watch_35a7.html" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> reported that the bombing had the unintended effect of stopping relief efforts aimed at supplying food to areas of Sudan gripped by famine: "many relief efforts have been postponed indefinitely, including a crucial one run by the U.S.-based <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Rescue_Committee_dca1.html" title="International Rescue Committee">International Rescue Committee</a> where more than fifty southerners are dying daily"<a href="http://www.hrw.org/press98/sept/sudan915.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrw.org/press98/sept/sudan915.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. In Summer 2001, <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werner_Daum_7671.html" title="Werner Daum">Werner Daum</a> (Germany's ambassador to Sudan 1996–2000) wrote an article <a href="http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/print.php?article=909" class="external autonumber" title="http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/print.php?article=909" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> in which he estimated that the attack "probably led to tens of thousands of deaths" of Sudanese civilians. The regional director of the <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near_East_Foundation_0c24.html" title="Near East Foundation">Near East Foundation</a>, who has direct field experience in the Sudan, published in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a> another article with the same estimate. These estimates were disputed by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Casey_496f.html" title="Leo Casey">Leo Casey</a>, who claims the figures were "fabricated out of whole cloth".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The strikes were criticized by many as being motivated at least in part by a desire to deflect attention from <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">President Clinton</a>'s ongoing domestic troubles in the <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewinsky_scandal.html" title="Lewinsky scandal">Lewinsky scandal</a>, coming only three days after <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Clinton</a> admitted to his affair with Lewinsky. Nonetheless, opponents to this '<a href="../../../w/a/g/Wag_the_Dog_d9dc.html" title="Wag the Dog">Wag the Dog</a>' theory raise the fact that concurrent strikes against al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan disprove this theory, given that an additional strike would do nothing to divert attention that the Afghanistan strike might have already achieved. The 9/11 Commission Report also evaluated the Wag the Dog theory, and found no reason to believe it, nor disbelieve the testimony and assertions of former President Clinton, former Vice President Gore, CIA Chief Tenet, nor former security advisors Berger and Clarke that the destruction of Al Shifa was still, as of 2004, a justifible national security target. <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec4.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Page 118</a></p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Departement, under President George W. Bush, produced an alleged al-Qaeda defector as a witness on February 13, 2001, in its ongoing case against Usama Bin Laden. The witness, Jamal Ahmad al-Fadl, testified that Al Qaeda operatives he was involved with had been engaged in manufacturing chemical weapons in Khartoum, Sudan, around 1993 or 1994. <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/reports/pdfs/binladen/130201.pdf" class="external text" title="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/reports/pdfs/binladen/130201.pdf" rel="nofollow">Page 524</a></p>
<p>According to <i>The Guardian</i>, "The factory's owner, Salah Idris, vigorously denied that he or the factory had any link with such weapons or any terrorist group. He is now suing the US government for £35 million after hiring experts to show that the plant made only medicines. Despite growing support for Idris's case in the US and Britain, Washington refuses to retract any of its claims and is contesting the lawsuit."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Sudanese government wants the plant preserved in its destroyed condition as a reminder of the American attack and also offered an open door to the U.S. for chemical testing at the site, however, the U.S. refused the invitation. Sudan has asked the U.S. for an apology for the attack but the U.S. has refused on the grounds it has not ruled out the possibility the plant had some connection to chemical weapons development. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/international/africa/20khartoum.html?8hpib" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/international/africa/20khartoum.html?8hpib" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>The bombing of the al-Shifa factory resurfaced in the news in April, 2006 due to the firing of former CIA analyst <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_O%27Neil_McCarthy_49aa.html" title="Mary O'Neil McCarthy">Mary O'Neil McCarthy</a>. McCarthy was against the bombing of the factory in 1998, a fact that was published in the <i>New York Times</i> soon after her arrest. However, despite the claims by the government of Sudan that the factory produced only pharmaceuticals, McCarthy came to the view the plant was used in chemical weapons development. Thomas Joscelyn quotes Daniel Benjamin, a former NSC staffer:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The report of the 9/11 Commission notes that the National Security staff reviewed the intelligence in April 2000 and concluded that the CIA's assessment of its intelligence on bin Laden and al-Shifa had been valid; the memo to Clinton on this was cosigned by Richard Clarke and Mary McCarthy, the NSC senior director for intelligence programs, who opposed the bombing of al-Shifa in 1998. The report also notes that in their testimony before the commission, Al Gore, Sandy Berger, George Tenet, and Richard Clarke all stood by the decision to bomb al-Shifa.</i> <a href="http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/145uivdz.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/145uivdz.asp" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>

<p>In his book 9-11 , <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> argues that the bombing of Al-Shifa was a piece of terrorism by the United States Government that probably resulted in the deaths of "several tens of thousands" of Sudanese people from diseases such as malaria and TB because they were deprived of the medicines manufactured at the plant.</p>
<p>But in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission, former Secretary of Defense Cohen defends, in 2004, along with other cited Clinton security cabinet members in their separate 9/11 Commission testimony, the necessity of destroying Al Shifa.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time, the intelligence community at the highest level repeatedly assured us that "it never gets better than this" in terms of confidence in an intelligence conclusion regarding a hard target. There was a good reason for this confidence, including multiple, reinforcing elements of information ranging from links that the organization that built the facility had both with Bin Laden and with the leadership of the Iraqi chemical weapons program; extraordinary security when the facility was constructed; physical evidence from the site; and other information from HUMINT and technical sources. Given what we knew regarding terrorists’ interest in acquiring and using chemical weapons against Americans, and given the intelligence assessment provided us regarding the al-Shifa facility, I continue to believe that destroying it was the right decision.</p>
