<p>U.S. President Bush signed Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001. Executive Order 13224 gives the U.S. Government a legal tool to impede terrorist funding and is part of the U.S. commitment to lead the international effort to bring a halt to terrorist activity. The Order provides a means by which to disrupt the financial support network for terrorists and terrorist organizations by authorizing the U.S. government to designate and block the assets of foreign individuals and entities that commit, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 pursuant to the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c)(UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.</p>

<p>"The Israeli Air Force struck Al Manar on Thursday, July 13, 2006 after initializing its massive attack on Lebanon which apparently had been planned well in advance and was presented to the public[3] as retaliation to the actions initiated by Hezbollah operatives when they captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack on Israel's northern border with Lebanon." in the 15:34, 18 July 2006 revision strikes me as being POV, repetitive (in that most of the sentence refers to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_crisis_3a7f.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon crisis">2006 Israel-Lebanon crisis</a> and badly substantiated (the citation is either a newspaper column or a blog entry ...

<p>How can this article say bombing a news site is in contravention of international law and then in the next paragraph reveal that the organization Al Manar is designated as terrorist. Is it illegal to bomb terrorist communications centers under international law?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you claiming that they designated themselves as terrorists, or that somebody else did so prior to bombing them? <a href="../../../j/i/h/User%7EJiHymas%40himivest.com_3d63.html" title="User:JiHymas@himivest.com">JiHymas@himivest.com</a> 03:20, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Simple answer is this has not been to court so so it may be illegal or not to attack Al Manar. This is due to the ownership and funding of Al Manar by Hezbollah. Its illegal to bomb civilian journalist, it is legal to bomb terrorists so we have to say it may be illegal or ok to bomb them, and both sides have thier view on this.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 10:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC) Also Journalists have be charged with <b>War Crimes</b> for fanning the flames of hate.

<p>The claim that Al-Manar started the 4,000 Jews in WTC story is rather hard for me to believe, because when 11th September 2001 occurred, I heard this story from many different outlets, and I do not think that speculation, or even this highly-controversial fact, should appear on wikipedia without being sourced.</p>

<dd>I origanally had the Slate source as the main source for the 4000 jews story but it got changed. The Slate piece is very well researched and up to wikipedia standards as a source. Note that the slate article was writen on oct5 2001 before the Islamweb site. I hate to wikilawyer but wikipedia can't trump an outside reputable source, but i'm adding Snopes.com the urban legend site, its nowhere near as good an article though <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/israel.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/israel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/rumors/israel.htm</a> i'll also have a look to see if Memri has anything on this, but i think the claim is justified.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 10:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I cannot consider the Slate piece well researched: their basis for pointing the finger at al-Manar was a google search to see who mentioned the newspaper first ... in other words, either al-Manar simply made up their citation or they were not the first. <a href="../../../j/i/h/User%7EJiHymas%40himivest.com_3d63.html" title="User:JiHymas@himivest.com">JiHymas@himivest.com</a> 14:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The citation given for the ban in Canada is an on-line interview. I haven't found anything on a Canadian government site that would indicate that the Canadian government has, in fact, banned the broadcasts. I suspect that the "ban" may simply be due to the US ban making it impossible (or, at least, difficult) for Canadian retailers to get the sattelite feed.

<dd>Here's what i understand is going on with whether Al-Manar can broadcast in Canada. They can broadcast any time they want,if they can get some company to broadcast them in canada. The problem they have is that any company broadcasting Al-Manar would be covered by Canadian Anti-Hate Speach Laws. These have power to level Multi-Million dollar fines per each individual offence, and broadcast companies have lots of assets. No one will touch them or Al-Jeezerah with a ten foot barge pole with the chance of there entire buisiness being taken from them. This is a de-facto ban brought about by the strengh of Canada's anti-hate speach, so how on earth do we write this up in the article?<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 11:23, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what's happened with Al-Jazeerah, certainly. They've got a license with conditions ... the conditions would make it both expensive and risky for a company to carry it. So Al-J is in a twilight zone, sort-of allowed. Al-M, however, has never even applied for a license and it wouldn't make sense for them to do so ... firstly, there are the problems with satellites (I don't know whether it would be technically possible for them to use the "Anik" satellites, which are Canadian, but they certainly can't use the American ones! Secondly, Hezbollah is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada ... I don't know, frankly, whether this would be considered to include Al-Manar. And finally, as you say, they would have huge problems with anti-hate laws, which would have the practical effect of making them an even less attractive business than Al-J. All that being said, however, I think the article is fine as it stands: <i>This had the effect of making Al-Manar unavailable in Canada, which some have interpreted as a "ban".[15]. While Al-Manar is not approved for distribution in Canada[16], there is no record of application for approval having been made.[17]</i> Dry &amp; factual. <a href="../../../j/i/h/User%7EJiHymas%40himivest.com_3d63.html" title="User:JiHymas@himivest.com">JiHymas@himivest.com</a> 12:41, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok every nation in the EU has signed a piece of "federal" law called the "Television without Frontiers" (TVWF) Directive (89/552/EEC), thats now all 25 Members but fewer originally signed this document. This said member governments have to protect the whole of the EU and the rest of the World from televised hate speach created, broadcast from or by an organisation under the jurisdiction of that member government. In the case of Al-Manar it was France that had to impliment the (TVWF) Directive under its laws with its legal institutions, and it did and banned Al-Manar.</p>
<p>This means Al-Manar has Definately been banned in France, by its highest court the “Conseil d'Etat”, conferming a ruleing by the Quango on censorship the “Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel”.</p>
<p>Given that the EU say "During this French procedure the European Commission worked very closely together with the French authorities and supported the strict and effective application of European law. The Commission welcomed the fact that measures have been taken to ensure respect of the material rules of the Directive, in line with the division of responsibilities between the Commission and the national authorities on such matters." They think that Al-Manar should be de-facto banned all over the EU but it would have to be tried on a country by country basis if they tried to broadcast from/with a TV company from another EU country. It's all about the the division of responsibilities between the Commission and the national authorities that is the thin line between an EU and a USE (United States of Europe).

<p><i>Where are you, oh Arab and Islamic peoples? What are you doing? How will you act? That is up to you. As far as we are concerned, when we began the resistance in 1982, we did not look beyond our borders at all. We looked only to Allah. We relied only upon our people and our mujahideen. Today, we are the same. But what I wanted to tell you at this sensitive moment, and following many military successes in recent days, and following many surprises - and more surprises are yet to come, Allah willing - is that Hizbullah is not waging the battle of Hizbullah or of Lebanon. We are waging the battle of the nation, whether we like it or not, whether the Lebanese like it or not. Lebanon and the resistance of Lebanon are waging the battle of the nation. Where does the nation stand with regard to this battle?

<p>Hypnosadist, 'ha-aretz' in Hebrew, can litterally mean, "the land", but it can have a second connotation of 'Israel'. In the same way in Arabic, 'Ummah' can mean a nation or The Islamic Nation, contingent on the context. In this context, he's clearly talking about the Islamic Nation that he's called out to in the beginning and end of the paragraph.</p>

<dd>As a matter of factual accuracy Shibaa Farms used to be Syrian land, Hezbollah did cross the BLUE LINE (border recognised by the UN) between Lebanon and Isreal in order to start the war in lebanon.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 11:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When did Shaba farms become Lebanese??? I'm still wondering today.Labaneh 02:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>It never did, thats my point! It was Syrian land that was occupied by Isreal. They are not claiming that land but hezbollah and now lately the Lebonise government have as a justification for restarting a war that was over nearly six years. It helps Syria to stay quiet and let it be used that way as its a few square kilometres of arid rocky dirt that they could not care less about.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 15:35, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Historically the land there was part of Syria. According to Herodotus, a Greek name for a place called Cappadocia. The region in particular while being a domain of Syria was called Palestine, again by Herodotus and to the north of there Phoenicia. The territory now called Lebanon was conceeded to Richard the Lion Hearted by the Muslim Emperor Salah Ud-Din in 1192. Thus the question is not when did Shebaa Farms become Lebanon, 1192, but when did it become Israel, never, at least not as long as Lebanon continues to contest it which it does.</p>

<p>Granted I have not spent hours looking, but I am a native Swede and have searched the Swedish Google for news clippings, goverment announcements or any information related to Sweden banning the Al-Manar station. I have only found demands for such from the right-wing parties of Sweden and petitions from them in parliment. But nothing that states that it was passed or completed?

The neocon Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) took credit for persuading world leaders in Germany, Sweden, Australia and France to outlaw Al Manar. The Netherlands and the EU followed suit, and Spain was coerced into removing Al Manar from Latin American programming.

<p>Hi Mceder, we will have to come to a more detailed introduction due to the "Television without Frontiers" (TVWF) Directive (89/552/EEC) as this is a law that sanctions governments for failure to protect all people from hate-speach broadcasts within the power of those governments. We need to say which countries have banned it actively, and any who have said that its ok to broadcast in their country. And clarify the Spanish ruling that covers South America as well. Linking all these into the TVWF directive.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 22:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no ban on Al Manar, I contacted the EEC in Brussels who told me that they have not heard of such a ban. Resturants in Edgeware Road London regularary show Al Manar TV and it is the same in Paris.</p>
<p>I am a new reader of this page I think it is a part of a network by supporters of Israel to discredit this TV station.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Al-Manar is available in Europe via satellite from Nilesat and Arabsat, but not via any satellite run by a company subject to EU jurisdiction - or, at least, such is my understanding.

<p>This campaign usually follows Israel and USA foreign policy. The Jewish Wikipedia lobby demonize Iran Syria and Hezbollah while justifying the actions of Israel foreign policy. Removal of any adverse editorial on the founders of Israel demonizing the leadership of Arab countries etc.</p>
<p>There is also subtle distortion of facts particularity in regards to the Palestinian conflict. In order to counter this organized and as such formidable onslaught on the neutrality of wikipedia Volunteers are keeping a record of hundreds of such pages and a report will be published later.</p>
<p>It is essential that wikipedia reflects a true world view</p>

<dd>Most of the third country programmes use satellite capacities provided either by Eutelsat or by Astra.

<dd>What was the Al-Manar case, and what has the Commission done to resolve it?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In 1991, shortly after Hezbollah actively entered the Lebanese political scene, Al Manar was launched as a small terrestrial station. Although legally registered as the Lebanese Media Group Company in 1997, Al Manar has belonged to Hezbollah culturally and politically from its inception. Today, the terrestrial station can reach Lebanon in its entirety and broadcasts programming eighteen hours daily.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, Al Manar's satellite station, launched in 2000, transmits twenty-four hours a day, reaching the entire Arab world and the rest of the globe through several major satellite providers. One of the satellite providers which have transmitted Al Manar has been the French satellite Hot Bird 4, owned by the Eutelsat Satellite organisation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Al Manar has several times been accused of broadcasting programming that preaches hatred and violence. In December 2004, the US Department of State put Al-Manar on the Terrorist Exclusion List due to the channel's "incitement of terrorist activity".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On 13 December 2004, the French “Conseil d'Etat”, the highest administrative Court in France, ordered the French-based Eutelsat Company to shut down Al Manar broadcasts following accusations that its programmes were anti-Semitic and could incite hatred. The “Conseil d’Etat” order was based on a decision by the French regulatory authority the “Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel”. On 14 December Al-Manar obliged voluntarily, in order to avoid that other Arab programmes of the same multiplex would have been shut down.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The TVWF Directive assigns responsibility for ensuring that its rules are respected to the Member State that has jurisdiction. In this case the French authorities were responsible for prohibiting the broadcasts of Al Manar because Al Manar was transmitted via the French satellite system within the satellite organisation Eutelsat.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>During this French procedure the European Commission worked very closely together with the French authorities and supported the strict and effective application of European law.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Commission welcomed the fact that measures have been taken to ensure respect of the material rules of the Directive, in line with the division of responsibilities between the Commission and the national authorities on such matters.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>From BBC News - Seems clear to me. "The Council of State ordered France-based satellite company Eutelsat to stop transmitting Lebanese station al-Manar within 48 hours."</li>
<li>From a European Union Staff Working Document, Council of the European Union. Seems to at least support the claim, but perhaps a reference from the Spanish authority who banned them would be better. "The Spanish authorities banned the retransmission of Al Manar by Hispasat on Wednesday, 30 June 2005 (which effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in South America)."</li>
<li>From The World Today/Australia ABC News. This one is vague, very vague, and should be replaced with a better source. One part of the article states that TARB (a rebroadcaster / ethnic cable company based in Sydney) "doesn't understand why it's been banned in Australia" - in relation to showing Al Manar. It also mentions that Australia banned Hezbollah. But I can not say it clearly states, from the authority in question, that Al Manar is banned.</li>
<li>From Reuters. First line says it all: "The United States on Friday designated al-Manar television -- the mouthpiece of Lebanon's Hizbollah anti-Israel guerrillas -- a terrorist organization, prompting an end to its U.S. satellite transmissions."</li>
<li>From Washington Times. "Hezbollah's TV loses U.S. feed"</li>
<li>From IslamOnline. The fact that a former US based freelance journalist have interpreted this as a ban, is in my opinon, not noteworthy at all. It does not conclude that Canada, as a country, had any desire to ban Al Manar. This should be removed.</li>
<li>Again, the reference support this statement, but it is a moot statement. There are other channels that are not approved for distribution in Canada because they have not applied for such an approval.</li>
<li>See above. This should be removed in my opinion.</li>
<li>From AlJazeera. It does back this statement up: "We saw that Al-Manar was being transmitted by New Sky Satellite (NSS). We assessed that Al-Manar does not have a Dutch licence ... and NSS will now take Al-Manar from its satellite," Jan van Cuilenburg, head of the Dutch Media Authority, told Reuters."</li>
<li>From Haaretz. The article headline is "EU blocks Hezbollah TV broadcasts in Europe" which is misleading. It restates that the French court blocked Al Manar, and that the Dutch stopped the broadcasts due to licensing issues. I can not find supporting information that the Dutch did this because Al Manar is Al Manar, even though it is "suggested" so in many articles.</li>
<li>These two references does cite opinions from individuals that this is considered a ban. Noteworthy?</li>
<li>Same as above.. From a European Union Staff Working Document, Council of the European Union. Seems to at least support the claim, but perhaps a reference from the Spanish authority who banned them would be better. "The Spanish authorities banned the retransmission of Al Manar by Hispasat on Wednesday, 30 June 2005 (which effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in South America)."</li>
<li>It sure seems that Centre For Research on Globalization (Glovalresearch.ca) agrees... For whatever that is worth.</li>

<li>2&#160;: Canada: The idea that Canada has banned al-Manar is pervasive - see the "Fact Tag for Broadcast Ban in Canada" discussion above.

<li>The idea of it being pervasive is no ground to include it in this section, as I do not see it backed up by a reference. If we want to list channels that can be expensive and risky for a satellite TV org to broadcast, let's make such a list(and that is a very valid point, a self censorship in part due to risk factors by business men, not involving beliefs on them being terroristic in nature or not) but including it in the Banning of Al-Manar broadcast is going way beyond what it is. <a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">Mceder</a> 15:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This talk page shows how pervasive the idea is, but your point is well taken.

<li>6&#160;: With all respect, I think Mceder and hypnosadist are taking this kerfuffle way too seriously. These are probably 12-year old kids from the US mid-west kicking up a big fuss because it's funny to watch grown-ups jump around. The attack on the veracity of the article is so utterly incompetent that there is an equal chance in my mind of the perpetrators (if they are adults with an actual agenda) being "Serious but Stupid al-Manar supporters" or "Provacateurs from the other side".</li>

<p>Maybe the term "Banned" needs to be elaborated upon in the article. Al-Manar is banned in the United States but <a href="http://www.c-span.org/videoarchives.asp?CatCodePairs=,&amp;ArchiveDays=100" class="external text" title="http://www.c-span.org/videoarchives.asp?CatCodePairs=,&amp;ArchiveDays=100" rel="nofollow">C-Span</a> ran 40-minutes of Al-Manar the other day. So it is not completely prohibited.</p>
<p>Also, in this satellite/internet age its not really possible to ban a station. Can't you just point your dish to an Arab owned satellite or open a internet video stream? So, words like "effectively prevents its reception" or the impression that you get that you cannot watch Al-Manar in Europe seems incorrect. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirYoda_fe04.html" title="User:SirYoda">SirYoda</a> 05:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is what i am tring to say, there are so many ways around these rules that you can't stop the hate speach. We need to come up with a form of words for the whole of europe.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 11:09, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you can point your dish at Arabsat or Nilesat and get al-Manar, provided you have a line of sight, of course. That's why the "Network" box still includes "Europe" on "availability". See, for example, <a href="http://www.stopterroristmedia.org/News/DocumentPrint.aspx?DocumentID=11089" class="external free" title="http://www.stopterroristmedia.org/News/DocumentPrint.aspx?DocumentID=11089" rel="nofollow">http://www.stopterroristmedia.org/News/DocumentPrint.aspx?DocumentID=11089</a> I would think that "banned" does not include "reporting on", which is presumably how C-Span justified its broadcast (this is a good thing, as otherwise I, personally, might get an unwelcome visit from the Mounties for my efforts here &amp; with Hezbollah!). You can certainly "get around" these rules. But how many people do? I would think that major effect is on advertising ... funding! funding! funding! That's the key! <a href="../../../j/i/h/User%7EJiHymas%40himivest.com_3d63.html" title="User:JiHymas@himivest.com">JiHymas@himivest.com</a> 15:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is "Al-Amar" and who is "Trish Schuh"? And a trivial thing shouldn't we be consistant a say "Al-Manar" not "Al Manar"? And one more thing the first line sounds dedundant with wording basically saying "broadcaster banned because of their broadcasts". I would change it to an actual reason. Were they banned because it is a terrorist media outlet or because of hate speech? And one more thing for the words "effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian Peninsula" I would remove the word "effectively" since I am pretty sure that Spain would have line of sight to Arab satelites. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirYoda_fe04.html" title="User:SirYoda">SirYoda</a> 21:54, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Al-Manar is banned in europe under hate speach laws, i think the USA banned it because of its link to hezbollah but it would be good to get this confermed.

<dd>Trish Schuh is an otherwise unnoteworthy writer for Global Research (an 'anti-globalization' pressure group). Her article was once used as the primary source of discussion of this topic; at one point in the history of this article, somebody changed (wording approximate) 'There have been claims...' to 'It has been claimed by Trish Schuh...' I don't have strong feelings about this statement either way. We do have references to the Lebanese ambassador and al-Manar itself screaming 'Politics!', so we wouldn't really be losing anything by its deletion. As far as the reason for the US ban is concerned, I think that is dealt with adequately in the Washington Times article ("The United States placed Al-Manar on its list of terrorist organizations Friday, dismissing freedom-of-speech objections and accusing Al-Manar of inciting violence in the Middle East. 'We don't see why here or anywhere else a terrorist organization should be allowed to spread its hatred and incitement through the television airwaves,' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.) Again, I have no strong feelings either way about including this information explicitly in the article). But what about <b>Australia</b>? I think Australia should be mentioned somewhere, seeing that the regulator there has made broadcasting al-Manar sufficiently risky that nobody in their right mind would take on the task.
<ul>
<li>The ABA reviewed a significant amount of Al Manar programming during its investigation. The ABA is concerned that some material was of a type that could breach the provisions of the codes of practice for subscription narrowcast television. The codes say that narowcasters will present accurate and fair news and current affairs programs and will not broadcast programs that are likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against or gratuitously vilify any person or group on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion. ... The ABA's investigation into the TARBS service began on 23 October 2003. The ABA recently decided not to finalise the investigation, noting that TARBS has gone into receivership. TARBS ceased to provide the Al Manar service on 5 November 2003.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Note the dates on the press release vs. the action! It was considered a hot issue 11 months after everything was settled! I suggest we add a sentence like:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Transmission of al-Manar in Australia was halted voluntarily by the transmitting company November 5, 2003, shortly after a regulatory investigation regarding possible hate-speech laws commenced.(ref = press release above).</li>

<ul>
<li>TARBS voluntarily stoped broadcasting al-manar on November 5, 2003, 15 days into an investigation by the ABA on accusations of "broadcast programs that are likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against or gratuitously vilify any person or group on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion". The report for this investigation was never finalised as TARBS had gone into receivership by that time. Al-Manar is not licenced for broadcast in Australia at the moment.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 23:36, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>In the lead, "ties to Hezbollah" seems weak somehow. Doesn't Hezbollah own and operate the station? "ties to", to my ear, suggests a looser association. The Web site for Al-Manar is down, but it would be great if someone who has expertise on this could state what the connection is exactly in a very explicit way.</li>
<li>The bombing of the station, IMO, should come later in the article, after other controversies such as whether or not the station promotes hate speech, which are more central.</li>
<li>The "ban" section might be stronger if there were some summary of what the issue is that has led to the bans up front rather than just stating that there are bans. Also, there is a sep section on the French ban, below, and the Hezbollah reaction to this ban which should probably be incorporated into this one.</li>

<dd>Hi Elizmr, i'll take your points one at a time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>1) "ties to Hezbollah"is weak but thats as much info as we have, the problem is it is not owned or operated by Hezbollah <b>Offically</b>. Its just all the directors of the company are senior hezbollah members, as are the share holders as i understand the facts. But finding sources on this has been difficult, any help by you to make the connection very explicit would be great.</p>
<p>2)Yes you are probably right, but it was concrete info early on in the life of this article and has stayed up top since then.</p>
<p>3)Al-Manar is banned for diffent reasons in different places, in the above discusion we are rewriting this section. But to give the short version europe banned it for reasons of the Hate Speach, the USA which has "freedom of speach" has banned them because of there connection to Hezbollah and hence being terrorists themselves, just like Israels ban.</p>

<dd>Re, #1, Ah, I see. #2--any comments from others about moving bombing down below "bans?" and #3--I see the complications. Maybe the first sentence should be more fleshed out in terms of France and the USA. Can't see in the refs why Spain banned, just that it did. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 14:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes this station is notable for the involvement of Hezbollah, and its banning by various countries on the grounds of hate speach. Other wise its just another minor TV station, its crimes make it notable.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 13:22, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't think it should lead the article. The article is about a TV station and currently there is not enough information to even decide whether its a minor station or not. By leading it with the terrorism angle the rest of the article focuses on terrorism which is valid topic but the title of the article should almost be the "Al-Manar controversy". We should lead with a paragraph of the basics for a TV station as if its <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>. (Viwership, tv programs, number of employees, budget, etc.) We need to understand whether this station is significant to care whether bombing it off the air matters, banning it matters, etc. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirYoda_fe04.html" title="User:SirYoda">SirYoda</a> 21:18, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Acutally, SirYoda, I've been thinking about this alot. The station is a self-proclaimed non-neutral news organization with a clear agenda. They are quite honest about this. consequently, they were labeled terrorist by the US. I'm not sure that that is not fair game for the lead. The station is not like CNN or Al-jazeera and doesn't warrant the same kind of article that those stations do. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 04:59, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your points, we have been trying find more information on Al-Manar. But the major notable facts about this TV station are that is its Hezbollah's propaganda station and that because of that and/or the hate speach it producees to achieve this end its banned in most of the world, with only 2 satalites broadcasting it. This (the most notable facts) should be in the intro.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 10:59, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reorged the lead and shortened the piece about the terrorist desig and bans to reflect the above disc. Wikipedia does say that the lead of articles should reflect the content of the article, so in that sense I guess this information is fair game. I didn't do any more on this at this point to allow others more time to comment. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 00:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, there is not much generic TV material yet to do what I was thinking. Just curious but is anybody working on this article Shi'ite or ever watched this tv station? Just googling around, perhaps <a href="http://www.shiachat.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=50328" class="external text" title="http://www.shiachat.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=50328" rel="nofollow">people just watch it for Arabic language Shia programs</a>.

<dd>I am not a shiite, no, but yes I've seen some of the material from this station. I haven't found that it runs programming that is not politically motivated in some way. I am a spanish speaker for example, but wouldn't want to watch bullfights if they were the only thing I could find on the air in spanish for example because I find them violent and disgusting. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 22:40, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>U.S. President Bush signed Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001. Executive Order 13224 gives the U.S. Government a legal tool to impede terrorist funding and is part of the U.S. commitment to lead the international effort to bring a halt to terrorist activity. The Order provides a means by which to disrupt the financial support network for terrorists and terrorist organizations by authorizing the U.S. government to designate and block the assets of foreign individuals and entities that commit, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 pursuant to the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c)(UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code. geraldshields11</p>
