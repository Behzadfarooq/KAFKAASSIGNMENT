<p>In regards to the <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Ryman_4a9f.html" title="Kevin Ryman">Kevin Ryman</a> article, if you really wish to leave the "Desperate Times" information in, so be it, even though there are virtually no differences in gameplay between survivors other than a few lines of text which only serve to lengthen the article more than necessary. At least rewrite it so that it sounds better and check your spelling and punctuation. If it's going to be done, it has to be done properly, no compromise there. You are, however, going to have to explain and provide evidence regarding any relationship between Kevin and Cindy, there is a strict policy against the seemingly endless supply of original research provided by editors. Unless you can provide a link, website or in-game file that states otherwise, it must be removed. Also, full names are necessary, as this is an encyclopedia that is, more often than, used by people who are not familiar with the <i>Resident Evil</i> franchise. You mus provide a full name, which may then be followed up by using only the first name. I don't want this to become another administrative nightmare cluttered by red-tape and pointless back-and-forth arguments so I'd like us to reach a compromise on this issue before it gets out of hand. You can reply here, I will monitor your userpage for a response so that we may come to an agreement on what is relevant to the article.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all: I'm sorry that this turned out into an argument.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let see, about the "Desperate Times" situation, I added it just like it was added some information of "Below Freezing Point" and "Decisions decisions" in Yoko's Article, or about "Flashback" in Alyssa's. Now, as you requested, I'll edit it and try to make it better, also making it more personal and related to the character and his role in the scenario. I'm also planing to make the same with the Scenario Information of other characters, and adding others, like "Wild Things" in Cindy's and "Outbreak" in Mark's, where the characters have unquestionable rol.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, about the relationship between Kevin and Cindy, that's not really my doing. The whole thing started with what appeared to be the doing of someone who is a real fan of the Kevin/Cindy pairing, who started adding a lot of subjetive information (Mostly fanfiction-like) about it in Kevin's and Cindy's article (specially in this last one, check the article's history and you'll see things I deleted about it), and even some things in George and Yoko articles (Like trying to fight the hints that lead the Kevin/Yoko and George/Cindy pairings). Most of what he did was for instant-deletion, and someone else would have done if it wasn't me, but, since a bit of the information seemed to be possibly, I decided to leave a small coment about the possibility of Kevin having a crush on her, but not really wanting to make it official (In part, I left it because I thought that, if I deleted all of it, the one who made it would make it again, something that I've seen happening sometime). Anyway, I'm not going replace that Trivia point again (I really don't care). I'll leave to your judgment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About the full names, I won't delete them again. It's just that I find them a little unsuitable in the middle of the text like that, and I really haven't seen very much full names (Even if the link to the article it's added) in other articles about videogame's characters.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hope this serves as enough explaining. I'm sorry for wasting your time like this, and thanks for . I'll eventually make the remaining contributions to the other characters of RE Outbreak.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and forgive me if my spelling and grammar are not perfect, but I don't really handle the English perfectly. (I'm from Argentina, and still have one year and half of enlish study). See you around. (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexlayer_975c.html" title="User:Alexlayer">Alexlayer</a> 05:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For a second language, your English is excellent. It was mostly smaller errors to do with pronounciation of words after vowls and such, nothing major, which can be easily repaired so no need to worry about that so much. If you would perhaps like me to re-write the section for you, I will do so at your request. About the trivia, I had a sneaking suspicion that it was not your doing as I've seen your posts on multiple occasions and, although I can't remember each and every addition, I do know that I have never really felt the need to reverse or correct something you have added and that said additions are more than acceptable. However, when you kept returning the point, I figured that maybe you had wrote it without signing in, as some users have done that from time-to-time. In any case, trivia is already huge, and if a person is unable to provide some sort of evidence to back-up their personal theories, then they must be deleted. I'm not so sure about the Tom Cruise/Christian Slater addition, myself, but that's about as far as I'm willing to go with unsupported trivia points.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With the full names. I know it sounds very formal and awkward, unfortunately that is necessary. People who are unfamiliar with the Outbreak series, especially those who are familiar with <i>Resident Evil</i> on a whole will often come across these pages when browsing RE articles. In almost all encyclopedias, this is standard practice. If somebody were to add "George Washington's friend Tom wrote much of the "Declaration of Independance" upon the creation of the United States", ofcourse an American might know who Tom is, but to an Argentinian like yourself or an Australian like myself, it might not be immediately obvious that this sentence refers to Thomas Jefferson. This is why it is annoying, but necessary, to add full names when first introducing characters.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad that we could approach this rationally, some users have a tendency to simply type insults and vandalise userpages rather than use commonsense like yourself. Have a good day. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 15:49, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've already rewrote the Desperate Times information, passing some points of the trivia to it. As you said, some characters trivia is doubtlessly huge, and I'm planing to make something about it. I also make some adjustments to the Outbreak information of Yoko, and I still have some things to do with other characters. Hopefully, after all this, there'll be hardly some more editions to make.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexlayer_1fd9.html" title="Edit section: Siegfried Schtauffen">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../s/i/e/Siegfried_Schtauffen_50a0.html" title="Siegfried Schtauffen">Siegfried Schtauffen</a></span></h2>
<p>Greetings. I'd want to explain to you in detail the reasons behind the revert on said Soul series' character page, Siegfried Schtauffen, point by point:</p>
<p>1. Copy-paste from official sites IS wrong in Wikipedia for two reasons: - Its copyright violation, unless its cited which that cannot be. Other characters, like Olcadan, Tira and Cassandra used to have copy-paste from their SCIII profile. Why do you think they don't anymore? Why the Bonus characters page was deleted, among other things? Because of copy-paste. "Small adaptation" doesn't work, the article should be written from scratch, based on official sources. - Wikipedia is not a fansite nor a website of the page. Recycling the same information, seen in thousand other places, is not encyclopediac. Articles here are to give an insight into the character, not necesary to repeat official profiles that can be found everywhere.</p>
<p>As a side note, I've read the whole profile and I feel that both that and Nightmare should be cleaned up greatly, as 80% are almost identical. Nightmare should tell about Nightmare, and Siegfried about Siegfried. A note leading to the other page indicating that to seek further information on events pertaining the other should be add. So I'm planning on a full rewrite this time.</p>
<p>2. The story-telling is not resolved. The article is written in such a form that it looks like a novel or a tale. Articles on Wikipedia are made formally, with clear statement. Having biographies wrote with the idea of "telling a tale" should be reverted at sight.</p>
<p>3. There's way too many overabundance of analysis and description on the profiles, wich is not encyclopedic: Some examples:</p>
<p>After some time, the azure knight returned to his old stronghold, Ostrheinsburg Castle. This land, <i>which had once tasted the blood of many</i> (unnecesary comment), was a fitting stage for the restoration of the evil sword's true power.</p>
<p>The two of them faced off in the ruins of the chapel, <i>and the place became alive with flying sparks and blood</i> (too descriptive and story-telling), but at the end of the fierce battle Nightmare stood victorious. The evil incarnate stepped forward to finish Raphael off, <i>as he muttered something incoherently.</i> (Nothing to do with Nightmare. That should be stated in Raphael's page).</p>
<p>The battle waging deep within his mind caused the azure knight to stand motionless. <i>Beside him, the wounded body of the fallen Raphael trembled. Only Rapahel's great will enabled his gravely injured body to move. Drawing on his last strength, Raphael unleashed a desperate final blow upon his enemy</i> (Description of events not pertaining the article's character. Once again, all that should only be mentioned, and the full description should go to Raphael).</p>
<p>And all the dialogues? Totally unencyclopedic. All that should be removed and re-writen. Why do you think no other character has copy-pasted their profiles? Because all are written in a manner not suitable for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I know you had tried hard to expand and keep the articles, but things like this would only lead to revert wars and possibly the deletion of the article. I'll fix things after getting your response. Thanks for reading and hope you understood.</p>
<p>Good bye. 201.255.24.79 00:21, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well... I guess I really got a lot more to learn about Wikipedia. Thanks for explaining me this, and sorry for borrowing your time. For now, I've alredy reverted my last editions in Siegfried's Article (Except by a little thing that I just don't agree with).</dd>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I notice you created the article <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_in_Devil_May_Cry_70f5.html" title="Women in Devil May Cry">Women in Devil May Cry</a> and seem to have a passion for the Devil May Cry series of games. I'm currently working on expanding both the Women in Devil May Cry article (now renamed) and the article on Devil May Cry 2. I'd like to invite you to join me in improving these articles.</p>
<p>Cheers, <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 18:26, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, count me in. Actually, I haven't been able to visit this page lately, so I couldn't say my part in the discussion about the fate of this article, but I'm actually happy that it was renamed like that, since that was somehow my idea when I started the article, to make one about the female characters and one about the antagonists, since, until now, save for Dante and Sparda, DMC series has only male antagonist and female co-protagonist and supportive characters.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'll do my best for the articles! (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexlayer_975c.html" title="User:Alexlayer">Alexlayer</a> 19:37, 4 January 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>Since you've got an interest in the Devil May Cry articles, I figured you'd like to drop by and give me your comments about my rewrite.

<p>Hey there. I was very interested by the Kyrie and Nero information you added to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Devil_May_Cry_9655.html" title="Characters in Devil May Cry">Characters in Devil May Cry</a>, but I'd really like to know where you got that from. For my part, I'm trying to be stricter on what information is added (as I've been following this more in depth lately), and if a new fact doesn't have a cite, I don't want it in there. But that info sounded pretty plausible, and you're not the type to add in message board discussions or your own speculations. So where'd you hear it? We'll cite it and put it back in. Thanks! --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoradis_4577.html" title="User:Boradis">Boradis</a> 19:16, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Check on DMC4's official site <a href="http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil4/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil4/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, they recently released the english part of the site, and so for the Character Section. The information is taken directly from the official site. I did mention it in the update (In Kyrie's update, the message was "Acording information to DMC4's official site"), but don't worry, I understand your actions. Now that the things are clear, I'm going to put that information again. If you feel like sourcing it, please do.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for tracking down this information, but you missed a couple of crucial steps. Firstly, Wikipedia can't simply reproduce the text from another site. It's <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>, which is dishonest (it presents the work of others as our own) and opens Wikipedia up to the threat of lawsuits (see: <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_Wikipedia%7Eplagiarism_0745.html" title="User:Andries/Wikipedia:plagiarism">User:Andries/Wikipedia:plagiarism</a> for an explanation). Secondly, that text was full of a tendency you still have, which is to use "<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">peacock terms</a>". Wikipedia is not supposed to be an exciting read, it simply presents the facts in a no-nonsense manner. And finally I sourced it for you, but that shouldn't be the responsibility of others. Please learn how to do it yourself, read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. It's not hard, takes only a moment to do, and makes all of the information reliable. Wouldn't it be nice if all the "Devil May Cry" pages were seen as high-quality pages on Wikipedia? If we all follow these guidelines, they can be. That's my hope. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoradis_4577.html" title="User:Boradis">Boradis</a> 06:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there I recently suggested the creation of a new WikiProject based on Devil May Cry, and I was wondering if you might be interested in supporting us, if you are please sing the <i>Interested Wikipedians</i> section on the Devil May Cry entry <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Council_Proposals_02b6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals"><b>here</b></a>, thanks for your time. -<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">Dark Dragon Flame</a> 08:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I pretty much agree with what you say, and for myself I've tried to steer clear of removing people's work if it's accurate, done in good faith, and procedures are followed correctly, like you have on the images. That said, more isn't always better, and we kind of discussed this during the transition from Women in DMC to Characters in DMC. I'd like it to be a Featured Article, or at least a Good Article, and the way to get there is to follow the example of pages that are or have been so honored. And where does the page differ from say the Featured version of Link? Firstly, there are very, very few cites for the facts presented. Second, it's still kind of messy, with lots of subsections. And lastly, the Link page has just a few images. I think that Dante's page basically should have a lead image, and perhaps one small image of his appearance in the core four games -- and that's still more pictures than Link has. What the Dante page needs is the <i>correct</i> amount of everything. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoradis_4577.html" title="User:Boradis">Boradis</a> 18:58, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
