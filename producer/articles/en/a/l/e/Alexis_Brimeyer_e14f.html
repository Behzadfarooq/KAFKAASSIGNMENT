<p><b>Alexis Brimeyer</b> (1946-1995) was a false <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretender.html" title="Pretender">pretender</a> who claimed connection to various European thrones. He used fraudulent combined titles like <b>Prince d'Anjou Durazzo Durassow Romanoff Dolgorouki de Bourbon-Conde</b>. He also sold bogus titles of nobility through "orders" he and his associates had created.</p>
<p>Brimeyer was born <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> in Costermansville (now <a href="../../../b/u/k/Bukavu.html" title="Bukavu">Bukavu</a>), <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zaire.html" title="Zaire">Zaire</a>. His Belgian mother Beatrice divorced his father Victor Brimeyer two months later and remarried 1950 in England with Ferdinand Fabry.</p>
<p>Brimeyer's first attempt to ennoble himself came when he named himself <i>Brimeyer de la Calchuyére</i> in the 1950s. This came to nothing. In 1955 he took a name <i>His Serene Highness Prince Khevenhuller-Abensberg</i> but real princess Khevenhuller threatened to sue him; he backpedaled and apologized. He also wrote to number of aristocrats trying to get them to adopt him. In 1969 he received a passport of the principality of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> with a name <i>His Highness Prince Alexis Romanov <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolgorouki.html" title="Dolgorouki">Dolgorouki</a></i>. When he contracted Brussels orthodox priest Jean Maljinowski to be baptized, the priest got suspicious because this supposed prince did not speak a word of Russian.</p>
<p>Brimeyer commissioned two death certificates that were published in <i><a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Soir_84ed.html" title="Le Soir">Le Soir</a></i>. Through them, he claimed that Nikolai Dolgorouki, his supposed father, had used a <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">false name</a> of Nicholas di Fonzo to escape the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a> and lived under that name. Note that <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">Bolsheviks</a> executed real Nikolai Dolgorouki after the Revolution.</p>
<p>Princess Khevenhuller-Abensberg, Maria Dolgoroukoff and Prince Alexander Pavlovich Dolgorouki sued Brimeyer. They charged that Brimeyer was using their noble titles with malicious intent. Prosecutor presented large number of fraudulent documents, including letter where emperor Charles V supposedly ennobles Brimeyers. Court noted that his claim of marriage between his "grandfather" prince Dolgorouki and his "grandmother", supposedly survived Maria Nikolayevaco, was false. <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> Brimeyer was sentenced to jail for 18 months but by then he had fled to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> from where he sent a letter to the prosecutor. In it he claimed descent from such luminaries as <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_emperors.html" title="Byzantine emperors">emperors of Byzantium</a>.</p>
<p>In Greece Brimeyer presented himself in the police station, said that his passport had been stolen and requested temporary documents. He registered himself as <b>Alexis Romanov Dolgorouki</b> and for the next ten years he used those documents to "prove" his status.</p>
<p>1979 Brimeyer was living in Spain and contacted the <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadet_branch.html" title="Cadet branch">cadet line</a> of the Anjou Durassos. He convinced some of them to give their support and recognize him as the head of the royal house of Anjou-Durazzo. 1982 he published a book "<i>I, Alexis, Great Grandson of the Tsar</i>" by "H.R.H. Prince Alexis d'Anjou Romanov-Dolgorouki, Duke of Durazzo". The book included a "will" where Vassili d'Anjou Durassow supposedly recognized him as his only son. Thus he claimed connection to the house of <a href="../../../a/n/j/Anjou.html" title="Anjou">Anjou</a> and the throne of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>.</p>
<p>Brimeyer claimed Victor Brimeyer was not his father. He claimed that after his mother divorced Brimeyer she married Vassili d'Anjou Durassow on 15 April 1947 and that he was born exactly two years after his real birth date. Note that Durassow never actually married and was possibly homosexual. This supposed marriage was then annulled and she married Prince Igor Dolgorouki on 6 September 1948. Note that she married Farby two years later. Brimeyer claimed that the couple had been elected as royal rulers of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and had resigned 1939.</p>
<p>In August 1984 Brimeyer's mother, now styled <i>Princess Olga Beatrice Nikolaevna Romanovskaia Dolgoroukaia, Princess of the Ukraine, Countess di Fonzo</i> married Major General Bruce-Alfonso de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (another pretender, real name Bruce Chalmers). After the wedding the supposed prince adopted Brimeyer. This gave Brimeyer an excuse to add a title <i>Bourbon-Conde</i> and a supposed link to throne of <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navarre.html" title="Navarre">Navarre</a>. Note that the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Henry_II%2C_Prince_of_Cond%C3%A9_6cc5.html" title="Louis Henry II, Prince of Condé">last known member of the house of Conde</a> hanged himself <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a>.</p>
<p>Next Brimeyer begun to claim that his father was the son of prince Dolgorouki. He again claimed that prince Dolgorouki had married Grand Duchess <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Maria_Nikolaevna_of_Russia_8bbb.html" title="Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia">Maria Nicolaevna</a>, who had supposedly escaped her execution in <a href="../../../e/k/a/Ekaterinburg.html" title="Ekaterinburg">Ekaterinburg</a> and that his mother was their only daughter. He also claimed that his alleged grandfather had been elected King of Ukraine and somehow convinced some orthodox priests that he was the heir of a throne that does not actually exist. Thus he claimed connection to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanov.html" title="Romanov">Romanovs</a> and the throne of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>.</p>
<p>Brimeyer sent numerous letters to king <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Carlos_of_Spain_871d.html" title="Juan Carlos of Spain">Juan Carlos</a> and demanded recognition. In some stage he had married and sired a son. He also managed to convince the British <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Arms_83ac.html" title="College of Arms">College of Arms</a> to include himself in some of the documents.</p>
<p>In 1992 two <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a>-nationalists including <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojislav_%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj_a9fd.html" title="Vojislav Šešelj">Vojislav Šešelj</a> visited Brimeyer in Spain, supposedly to offer him the throne of Serbia. Brimeyer told the journalists that he had been in touch with <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a> who was supposedly in favor of restoring the Serbian monarchy, in the form of Greater Serbia including most of former <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. At that sage he used a title <i>Prince Alexis II Nemanitch Romanov Dolgorouki</i>, Grand Master of the (fraudulent) Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He had convinced his Serbian nationalist supporters that he was descended, in a very convoluted manner, from Hrebeljanovic Nemanitch.</p>
<p>Brimeyer claimed to have accepted the throne of Serbia. There at least appeared to be some support. The European Monarchist Association published a communiqué where it stated Brimeyer's real identity. The scheme appears to have collapsed.</p>
<p>Alexis Brimeyer died of <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> in Madrid in March <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. Some of his supporters have continued to run his affairs for some time afterwards.</p>
