<p><i>Roanoke Times</i> (July 1, 2005): "Roanoke College political science professor Bill Hill looked up 19th century politician John Taylor of Caroline County, political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville and the Federalist Papers. 'In each case, the program responded with information that was accurate and pertinent, if brief," he wrote. "I thought the coverage of De Tocqueville, however, was too superficial.'</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A feature of the Wikipedia that Hill likes are the links to original sources. It's pretty handy when reading about De Tocqueville to be able to click a link and read the man's own words. But Hill also noted a link that led to a 'very brief and shallow essay' about states' rights."</p>
<p><br />
Hi, I don't know a lot about Tocqueville but elsewhere I read quotations like "A 'debased' taste for equality, a love of snuffling in shit, and a hatred of those who seek to escape the gutter: these define the democrat". In case this is true, perhaps the article gives a somewhat too liberal view of him? (just wondering...) -Abaris</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've read a good chunk of Tocqueville, and while he had mixed feelings about democracy, I've never seen anything like that. Do you have an actual citation? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:23, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>De Tocqueville's <i><a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_in_America_8781.html" title="Democracy in America">Democracy in America</a></i> was published in 1835 and 1840, I can learn at Wikipedia with a click. Does "snuffling in shit" sound like a metaphor that could be published in 1835 - 1840 by a responsible writer with a wide circulation? I ask myself. Having answered that to my satisfaction, I cut and paste the misquotation at <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a> , and return to the Internet to see the context of the misquotations. They are at www.vanguardnewsnetwork.com/ I find. "Uncensored views for Whites" it says. I scan the topic headings and get the context. My next job is to assess the purpose such misquotations were serving. Discrediting democracy, it would seem. Thus, in the end, I even have a clear sense of the cultural background and education level of "Abaris", who inquired above. One enlightenment unfolds from another. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 20:00, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Tocqueville does talk about a 'debased taste for equality', although the context of the quote casts the sentiment in a different light:</dd>
<dd>"There is indeed a manly and legitimate passion for equality which rouses in all men a desire to be strong and respected. This passion tends to elevate the little man to the rank of the great. But the human heart also nourishes a debased taste for equality, which leads the weak to want to drag the strong down to their level and which induces men to prefer equality in servitude to inequality in freedom." (p669, Lawrence translation, paperback)</dd>
<dd>I can attest from my own study that the rest of the quote Abaris made reference to is not contained in Democracy in America. Tocque35 05:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Where do I start? For one thing, Tocqueville's work here sounds like a bland encomium to American democracy. "He championed freedom and liberty" is both simplistic and strongly biased. The article seeks to convert him posthumously to American-style conservatism, progressivism, and classical liberalism; why stop there, when communitarians and others call him one of their own?</p>
<dl>
<dd>well, he DID champion freedom and liberty, although to say so is redundant, since the word he originally used, 'liberte', means both. A better expression might be 'he championed both freedom and equality', though, again, his views were never quite that simple. I'm curious, though: where's the bias, exactly? Conservative buzzword it might be, but freedom is hardly a uniquely american value. I've changed the sentence in the article to something less controversial and more accurate. Tocque35 05:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Among other omissions, this entry doesn't describe Tocqueville's writings on the French Revolution; generally speaking it is very America-centric. (Can't anyone read the French article?) Also, "The Dark Face of Tocqueville" definitely introduces a biased POV.--<a href="../../../w/a/d/User%7EWadeMcR_bfdc.html" title="User:WadeMcR">WadeMcR</a> 01:14, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some of these quotations seem a little too much like current day politics. I'm suspicious if they're actually in his works.

The article says that de Tocqueville "championed" both liberty and democracy. I find this a poor summary of his thesis; I see him critiquing it more than championing it. From the cover of my de Tocqueville book: "Tocqueville discusses the advantages and dangers of majority rule--which he thought could be as tyrannical as the rule of the aristocracy." Richard D. Heffner <i>Italic</i> text<i>Democracy in America</i>Italic <i>text</i> (New York: Penguin Group , 1984). <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.191.212.100 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.191.212.100_9c2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.191.212.100">contribs</a>) 16 Nov 2005.</small></p>
<p>Did Tocqueville not coin the phrase 'Tyranny of the majority' thereby proposing liberal or constitutional, rather than total, democracy?208.114.132.151 23:06, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I vote for these 3 then:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money."</li>
<li>"Americans are so enamoured of equality they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom."</li>
<li>"Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word, equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude."</li>

<p>Hi - the quotes on the main page are highly dubious. I fixed one that was definitely reversed from its actual meaning, but many of the rest of these look suspicious as well. Somebody should consider deleting all the quotations and re-posting only validated quotes with sources. (anon 20 Aug 2005)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think all the quotes should be removed (Wikiquote exists for that). Quotes should be included within the article text, not just a list. <a href="../../../g/f/l/User%7EGflores_bda8.html" title="User:Gflores">Gflores</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/f/l/User_talk%7EGflores_1e9f.html" title="User talk:Gflores">Talk</a></sup> 22:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A quote from the current Wikipedia entry on A. de Tocqueville related to his purported beliefs, ideas and actions vis-a-vis Blacks and American Indians: "He accurately predicted that democracy would increase and eventually extend its rights and privileges to women, Natives, and Africans. He is thus also a political progressive, concerned with improving the lives of all citizens."</p>
<p>Exactly where is this information found? I found de Tocqueville's expressed ideas on Blacks and American Indians to be both revelatory and appalling. He says slavery is bad but freeing Blacks is worse. In 1, 2 or 3 different chapters or sections of DEMOCRACY in AMERICA de Tocqueville states that American Indians could be counted on to disappear, and that Blacks were the biggest threat to America's white population. The title of one particularly pertinent chapter starts with "The Future of the Three Races" [then something like 'which populate the United States']. Later I will add more specifics. I welcome other interested scholars to add to this discussion. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.48.204.252 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.48.204.252.html" title="User talk:68.48.204.252">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.48.204.252_0a37.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.48.204.252">contribs</a>) 28 Oct 2005.</small></p>
<p>On this topic, User:Bwyche added the following, all in the lead section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cited admiringly as well is chapter 18 of Democracy of America, "The Present and Probably Future Condition of the Three Races that Inhabit the Territory of the United States". In spite of the inattention to this chapter and to those who cite it, views cited from this chapter include the following: Tocqueville stated that among the "widely differing families of men, the first which attracts attention, the superior in intelligence, in power and in enjoyment, is the white or European, the man pre-eminent; and in subordinate grades, the negro and the Indian ...Both of them occupy an inferior rank in the country they inhabit...." at the beginning of this chapter. To him those of European descent or those in the "Anglo-American Union" or the "Democratic Republic" of the United States were democratic with slavery in their midst while native Americans and those of African descent were those who were "undemocratic. He stated further that Native Americans would become extinct because they were too proud to assimilate. Reasons were also given to explain why persons of African descent had marks of slavery,and Europeans who had been enslaved did not have the marks of slavery. Persons of African descent according to Tocqueville were those who were inferior when it came to their facial and physical features, intelligence, marriages, their families, or husband- wife and parent-child relations in particular. Persons of African descent would never become become social or intellectual equals of those of European descent. Nor will they be accepted as such, despite all their efforts to assimilate. Removal of this population from America was thereby the best solution to problems of race relations in America for both Americans of African and European descent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cut this. Someone is welcome to return something about this to the article, but "cited admiringly" is ridiculous and this does not belong (at least not at this length) in the lead. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:25, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>testimonials of Tocqueville's alledged racism take up waaaayyyyy too much of the entry as it exists now. I plan on making a few changes to that soon. To anyone who's curious 'was he or wasn't he?', I suggest a reading of the chapter in DA "on the three races" (I 2.10).

<p>As I mentioned above, this article says hardly anything about Tocqueville's writings on the French Revolution, which he considered his most important work. Neither does it adequately cover his more theoretical views on the state and social change.</p>
<p>Also: the stuff about his championing "freedom and liberty" has got to go.--<a href="../../../w/a/d/User%7EWadeMcR_bfdc.html" title="User:WadeMcR">WadeMcR</a> 03:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wade, I strongly disagree. Tocqueville was indeed a strong champion of liberty and freedom. In fact, it was core to his work to distinguish freedom from equality, and show show the differences and tensions between them. He invariably came down on the side of liberty versus equality. A few quotes.</p>
<p>"I proclaimed my high opinion of liberty when it was in fashion, and one can hardly think badly of me for maintaining it when it is no longer in style." - Preface to the Old Regime and the Revolution</p>
<p>"That which, in all times, has so strongly attached certain men's hearts to freedom, are its own attractions, its own peculiar charm, independent of its benefits; it is the pleasure of being able to speak, acts, and breathe without constraint, under the government of God and the laws alone. Whoever seeks anything from freedom but itself is made for slavery." - Old Regime and the Revolution III:3</p>
<p>"Democratic institutions awaken and flatter the passion for equality without ever being able to satisfy it entirely. Every day this complete equality eludes the hands of the people at the moment when they believe they have siezed it, and it flees, as Pascal said, in an eternal flight; the people become heated in the search for this good, all the more precious as it is near enough to be known, far enough not to be tasted. The chance of succeeding stirs them, the uncertainty of success irritates them; they are agitated, they are wearied, they are embittered. All that surpasses them, in whatever place, then appears to them as an obstacle to their desires, and there is no superiority so legitimate that the sight of it does not tire their eyes." - Democracy in America I 2.5</p>
<p>"One must recognize that equality, which introduces great goods into the world, nevertheless suggests to men very dangerous instincts" - Democracy in America, II 1.5</p>
<p>"The evils that freedom brings are sometime immediate; they are visible to all, and all more or less feel them. The evils that extreme equality can produce become manifest only little by little; they insinuate themselves gradually into the social body; one sees them only now and then, and at the moment when they have become most violent, habit has already made them no longer felt.</p>
<p>The goods that freedom brings show themselves only in the long term, and it is always easy to fail to recognize the cause that gives birth to them.</p>
<p>The advantages of equality make themselves felt from now on, and each day one sees them flow from their source." - Democracy in America II 2.1</p>
<p>"I think that democratic peoples have a natural taste for freedom; left to themselves they seek it, they love it, and they will see themselves parted from it only with sorrow. But for equality they have an ardent, insatiable, eternal, invincible passion; they want equality in freedom, and, if they cannot get it, they still want it in slavery. They will tolerate poverty, enslavement, barbarism, but they will not tolerate aristocracy." - Democracy in America, II 2.1</p>
<p>"Liberty alone can effectively combat the natural vices of these kinds of societies and prevent them from sliding down the slippery slop where they find themselves. Only freedom can bring citizens out of the isolation in which the very independence of their circumstances has led them to live, can daily force them to mingle, to join together through the need to communicate with one another, persuade each other, and satisfy each other in the conduct of their common affairs. Only freedom can tear people from the worship of Mammon and the petty daily concerns of their personal affairs and teach them to always see and feel the nation above and beside them; only freedom can substitute higher and stronger passions for the love of material well-being, given rise to greater ambitions than the acquisition of a fortune, and create the atmsophere which allows one to see and judge human vices and virtues." - Preface to The Old Regime and the Revolution.</p>
<p>No matter how you slice it, Tocqueville was a huge fan and yes, champion of liberty. However, he was also someone who keenly sensed the loss that came from the destruction of the aristocracy in terms of a certain loftiness of the human spirit and disdain for purely material pleasures. I can certainly be argued that he would like to see some type of an aristocratic element be present in democratic societies, in order to guard against many of the weaknesses of that form of government. But he certainly didn't want to rewind the clock to the Middle Ages. Tocqueville was realistic about freedom and democracy. But that doesn't mean he was not a champion of liberty. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.72.99.234 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.72.99.234.html" title="User talk:68.72.99.234">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.72.99.234_1a54.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.72.99.234">contribs</a>) 1 July 2006.</small></p>

<p>They are back. The list is growing. It includes not one but two anti-Islamic quotes (apparently someone either thinks there is not enough Muslim-bashing on the web or that our readers are too dense to understand that Tocqueville was anti-Islamic on the basis of one unambiguous denunciation. Similarly, aphoristic "A weak government is threatened most when it begins to reform" is supplemented by a long quotation expressing the same sentiment. I'm inclined to get rid of all of them here, leaving it to WikiQuote; I'd have no problem with two or three, especially if they are either representative of his style and either epitomize the views for which he is most known or cover topics otherwise neglected in our article, but the current long list is a liability. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i've read de tocqueville's democracy in america several times over the years. i think this wikipedia article distorts what he has to say.</p>
<p>while it's true many of de tocqueville's opinions about minorities are appalling, and justly deserve condemnation, he is also still the most accurate observer of the general american character. his overall descriptions of the american people could have been written last week.</p>
<p>he is overall an admirer of america and its promise. he more often reminds american readers of what our best potential is, and when you read de tocqueville, as an american, you are moved to ask yourself: why don't we live up to all the things he perceived in us? how have we fallen into some of the snares he so astutely foresaw?</p>
<p>the wikipedia article captures none of this important information, which is what makes de tocqueville of enduring value to americans today, and one of the most important books on our democracy and history. - <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.86.224.5 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.86.224.5_1418.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.86.224.5">contribs</a>) 22 July 2006.</small></p>

<p>I've done a light general edit of the recent additions. It is a bit much of an opinionated essay for Wikipedia.

<p>All in all it helps balancing the article &amp; I guess we can wait see what is really contested about it. Perhaps the author could trim as best as he could ('time is money', as Tocqueville already perceived!:), in particular the introduction on Plato &amp; co (maybe by moving it to <i><a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_in_America_8781.html" title="Democracy in America">Democracy in America</a></i>?). The only real issue I see is characterizing <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_More_90f1.html" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a> as a supporter of communism (more or less the debate which is lifted; some would already argue with Plato). This has been strongly contested by various authors.

<p>The article is not intended to be opinionated and is not opinionated. It offers many pointed opinions, but they are all Tocqueville's opinions. If his central argument and observations, if the very essence of his storied text should not be offered, then nothing should really be written on the topic save some publishing information about the text. The way Tocqueville's observations are characterized is in complete agreement with countless leading scholars on the topic. And I suppose the information leading up to Tocqueville's argument could be shortened, but it speaks to the most crucial of contexts. Tocqueville, as his correspondence clearly proves, was joining a conversation which many thinkers had entered long before him. I understand the concern, but the place of More's <i>Utopia</i> is rather important to Tocqueville's work. The inherent argument in <i>Utopia</i> speaks directly to the consequences of communal property holding for political and social values. Scholarly consensus certainly concedes that. Now do not confuse that with any argument that More himself supported "communism." We first of all need to be very careful about using that word because using it would be anachronistic and would make limited sense. The article seems to merely suggest that <i>Utopia</i> advances an argument about property-holding and its relationship to virtue and political rule. We need only glance at the vast scholarship on the topic to see the consensus surrounding that. People can always claim that interpretations of texts are not neutral. But if the information offered in this article does not satisfy the need for neutrality, then the site should make no effort to condense or explain any aspect of any thinker's textual arguments anywhere. The amount of leading scholarship which would solidly support every claim made in this article is enormous. The arguments of all the thinkers as well as the analytical thread which necessarily ties them together is very easy to substantiate. We could offer countless references and have quotations proving rather convincingly every textual claim. Or we could refrain and embrace a rather succint (remember the text in question is both hundreds of pages long and centrally located in the modern Western political tradition) treatment of the subject in question. The purpose, as seems obvious, of a section on <i>Democracy in America,</i> would be to summarize Tocqueville's central argument. This article clearly seems to do that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.91.250.146 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.91.250.146_fbed.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.91.250.146">contribs</a>) 15 August 2006.</small></p>

<p>Thank you for proving the point so precisely. I wonder if you even read the above post. Obviously there will be interpretation of Tocqueville's views and the impact of his work. If the above quotes you so "remarkably" found signify a problem then there is no chance of providing any information on the text beyond its publishing information. Virtually every scholar would completely agree with the mild, and essential, interpretation implicit in the passages you found. They pose no problem to the neutrality of the piece. I will say again, if you want the scholarly consensus cited, that is easy, but it would require space doubling that of the entry. A few authorities could be cited, but then the reader might incorrectly think that the interpretation is that of the author cited, rather than appreciate that most scholars would share the interpretation and this author is merely one of many, many who could have been cited. That is the issue. It seems that that is not what is intended for the site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 38.98.105.25 (<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User_talk%7E38.98.105.25.html" title="User talk:38.98.105.25">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.98.105.25_6499.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.98.105.25">contribs</a>) 23 August 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Adding footnotes does enlarge the piece, but the enlargement is almost entirely in the notes section. I don't think that's a problem.

<dd>As I said, "it is a good and thoughtful essay". I'm certainly not going to remove it, but someone else is liable to do so, and they will be within their rights under the current consensus on what constitutes opinion/original research. I personally don't particularly like the way Wikipedia is headed in this respect—I think that what started as a reasonable policy has become a fetish, ignoring the existence of clearly <i>informed</i> opinion—but the consensus and effective policy has become clear, and it seems to me that we should either work to change the consensus or abide by it. What we shouldn't do (in my opinion, at least) is fail to note where we are going against it. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright. A sound response. As I mentioned, it is easy to cite countless scholars, I can think of many off the top of my head, I am just concerned about demanding notes for rather straight-forward interpretations. Also, citing too much is a problem but, as I said, citing only one authority might tell the reader that this otherwise clear point is more the argument of a single author. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 38.98.105.25 (<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User_talk%7E38.98.105.25.html" title="User talk:38.98.105.25">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.98.105.25_6499.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.98.105.25">contribs</a>) 25 August 2006.</small></p>

<p>I had never heard of Alexis de Tocqueville before hearing of the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_de_Tocqueville_Institution_4111.html" title="Alexis de Tocqueville Institution">Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</a>, and when I eventually had a look at this page, it still wasn't clear to me (at all) who Alexis de Tocqueville was. The intro mumbles something about him writing two books in which he "explored the myriad and profound effects of the rising equality of social conditions on both the individual and the state in western societies", but it does not immediately explain which ideas he defended, or why these books are considered notorious. It would be of great help to a person not immediately familiar with the subject if such a summary were added to the article. <a href="../../../y/o/e/User%7EYoe_00a6.html" title="User:Yoe">Yoe</a> 14:38, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All things considered, I think Wikipedia would be doing its readers a service by simply removing this article after the first short paragraph. Everything else in it is highly tendentious. It also sins greatly by omission, by not devoting a word of discussion to The Old Regime. The article is worse than useless - it actively misleads its readers as to what T was about.</p>

<p>Ok, I can see there's a lot of discussion covering this article, much of it contentious. I don't want to enter into the arguments, but I've tried to clean the article up according to Wikipedia's standards. First, the biography had what appeared to be translations from French that were ore grammatically difficult than necessary. The big problem, however, is in the Democracy in America section, where it appears someone has pasted their own essay about Tocqueville above the original paragraphttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alexis_de_Tocqueville&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17h on the book. Much of it was accurate and relevant, but I had to remove a great deal that wasn't (discussing Plato, More, etc), and trim down to specific cases and examples. I haven't provided citations yet, but I think most of the information is well-supported and fairly apparent based on a reading of the book.</p>
<p>As to those above who say the article is American-centric ("sins greatly by omission, by not devoting a word of discussion to The Old Regime"): this is the English Wikipedia, and Democracy in America is a major work in Political Science, especially in the US. If you have information about his other works in France, go ahead and add it! Don't just complain, this is what Wikipedia is about. I hope that my edits don't inflame anyone here, I'm just trying to remove the cruft and generally clean the article. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackson_f3e0.html" title="User:Jackson">Jackson</a> 09:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some passages I find problematic (I think they are yours):
<ul>
<li>"French historian of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olivier_LeCour_Grandmaison_863a.html" title="Olivier LeCour Grandmaison">Olivier LeCour Grandmaison</a> has underlined how, at his point of view, Tocqueville openly talked of '<a href="../../../e/x/t/Extermination.html" title="Extermination">extermination</a>' in the colonization of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Removal_9d32.html" title="Indian Removal">Indian Removal</a> period." "…at his point of view" makes no sense at all. And if Tocqueville talked of it "openly", then point of view should not enter the matter at all.</li>
<li>"As Tocqueville predicted, formal freedom and equality and segregation would become this population's reality after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> and during <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> - as would the bumpy road to true integration of African-Americans." I don't believe Tocqueville ever predicted "true integration", bumpily achieved or otherwise.</li>
<li>"still he violently stood against his methods and aims": how was this violence instantiated? I'm not aware of Tocqueville ever engaging in violence. If the word is only metaphorical, I suggest using a less weighted word in a matter where others <i>were</i> using violence.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Also, the punctuation in the following is confusing
<dl>
<dd>They blame also the writer for the following</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>“[The number] of unacceptable excesses from a historian.</i>” The latter, up in arms <i>“against chronological and disciplinary imprisonment”…”retains from his readings only what confirms his theories and feeds his stereotypes</i>. […] They write that, <i>when reading him, one cannot help asking the question&#160;: can a collection of absurdities serve as a work of historical thought and synthesis</i>&#160;?” In addition, they blame him for “[his] <i>denunciation through the media [which] does not succeed in anchoring to the science of convictions and to make of OLCG a plausible historian</i>”.
<ul>
<li>Why the italics?</li>
<li>I notice that, against prevailing Wikipedia style (although within the range of what is permitted) you are using "curly" quotation marks, but you are using them oddly: I simply cannot tell in the above where the quotations open and close. At onw point you have a right doublequote, and ellipsis, and another right doublequote. That makes no sense at all. And you have a phrase "They write that" which appears to be inside quotation marks. Could you look at this again and work out what you actually mean to do? I don't dare touch it. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:19, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Also, what is going on with the bolded "When only the second paragraph is retained while the first is neither quoted nor mentioned, this entails a complete and deliberate distortion of Tocqueville’s views and issues as expressed in his writings." Whose opinion is this? If it is a citable author's, then attribute it. If not, then lose it. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:44, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What does "colons" mean in the following sentence from the "Colonization" section: <i>Years before the Crémieux decrees and the 1881 Indigenous Code that would separate European Jews colons, given French citizenship, and Muslims, Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria … .</i>? This horribly run-on sentence is completely mangled.72.73.219.126 02:17, 3 February 2007 (UTC)Prplxed</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's an equally confusing statement in the opposition to war section:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tocqueville, who did advocate <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> between Europeans and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a>, judged otherwise the Berbers. In an August 22, 1837 proposal, cited by Jean-Louis Benoît, Tocqueville thus distinguished the Berbers from the Arabs. He considered that these last ones should have a self-government (a bit on the model of British <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indirect_rule.html" title="Indirect rule">indirect rule</a>, thus going against the French <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assimiliationist.html" title="Assimiliationist">assimiliationist</a> stance)."</p>

<dd>The section from which that excerpt originated should be completely rewritten.

<p>How could the editors of this section go on and on about the various differences Tocqueville noted between America and Europe, without mentioning religion, one of Tocqueville's primary explanations for the cause of these differences? Currently the article rambles about how Tocqueville strove to find out why the common man in America enjoyed high levels of dignity, possesses much "natural" power, and never deferred to so-called "elites"; why America never embraced socialism; and why America "was set apart by its peculiar democratic mores". The article, as it currently stands, implies that Tocqueville believed that these differences were ONLY due to economic factors (property ownership, vast available land, and industriousness). While Tocqueville may have attributed the differences between America and Europe to some economic factors, he often stated that the differences were also heavily due to the religious and spiritual practices prevalent among Americans. I can quickly cite a couple examples of this, stated by Tocqueville himself:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Religion in American takes no direct part in the government of society, but it must be regarded as the first of their political institutions; for if it does not impart a taste for freedom, it facilitates the use of it. Indeed, it is in this same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States themselves look upon religious belief. I do not know whether all Americans have a sincere faith in their religion for who can search the human heart?— but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable to the maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is not peculiar to a class of citizens or to a party, but it belongs to the whole nation and to every rank of society." --Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (New York: Vintage Books, 1945), Vol. 1, p. 316</li>
<li>"Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot. Religion is much more necessary in the republic . . . than in the monarchy . . . it is more needed in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible that society should escape destruction if the moral tie is not strengthened in proportion as the political tie is relaxed? And what can be done with a people who are their own masters if they are not submissive to the Deity?" --Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (New York: Vintage Books, 1945), Vol. 1, p. 318</li>
</ul>

<dd>Please, work on getting this into the article. I doubt there is any active bias here, just omission. This is not a particularly good article; it needs a lot of work; this is just one example of the work to be done. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:04, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
