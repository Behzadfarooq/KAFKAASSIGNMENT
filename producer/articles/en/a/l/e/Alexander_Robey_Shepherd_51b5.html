<p>Born in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._%28southwest%29_4e6a.html" title="Washington, D.C. (southwest)">southwest Washington</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, 1835, Shepherd dropped out of school at 13 and took a job as a plumber's assistant. Eventually, he worked his way up to becoming the owner of the plumbing firm. He then invested the profits from that firm in real estate development, which made him a wealthy socialite and influential citizen of the city.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> (One of his luxurious properties was Shepherd's Row, a set of <a href="../../../r/o/w/Rowhouse.html" title="Rowhouse">rowhouses</a> on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_Avenue_41e3.html" title="Connecticut Avenue">Connecticut Avenue</a> designed by <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Cluss_f095.html" title="Adolf Cluss">Adolf Cluss</a>; Cluss would later be the star witness at Shepherd's congressional investigation hearings.)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Shepherd's influence in the city and position in local government (particularly, his sterling reputation with the newly enfranchised black population) allowed him to build a Republican <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_machine.html" title="Political machine">political machine</a> in Washington, which he then allied with the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Republican_1533.html" title="Radical Republican">Radical Republican</a> contingent that dominated American politics after the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Civil_War_d4a5.html" title="U.S. Civil War">U.S. Civil War</a> — ensuring that he had the support of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Government_99e0.html" title="U.S. Government">federal government</a> as well as that of Washington at large.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, war and mismanagement had caused the finances and infrastructure of the city to deteriorate so badly that the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_Washington%2C_D.C._418d.html" title="Mayor of Washington, D.C.">Mayor of Washington</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/y/Sayles_J._Bowen_c424.html" title="Sayles J. Bowen">Sayles J. Bowen</a>, had his furniture seized in an attempt to pay the city's debts; <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrats</a> and Republicans were in a rare agreement that a drastic change was needed from Bowen's regime.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> As a solution, Shepherd and his allies began agitation for the abolition of the elected governments of Washington City and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgetown%2C_Washington%2C_D.C._d129.html" title="Georgetown, Washington, D.C.">Georgetown</a>, as well as the appointed justices of the peace for <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_County%2C_D.C._948e.html" title="Washington County, D.C.">Washington County</a>, to be replaced with a unified territorial government that would administer the entire District of Columbia. The Shepherd machine was easily able to sway popular support in favor of the notion.</p>
<p>In the following year, 1871, Shepherd was able to convince <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Congress_7589.html" title="U.S. Congress">Congress</a> to pass a <a href="http://weblinks.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?DB=DC%2DST%2DTOC%3BSTADCTOC&amp;DocName=DCHIACTOF1871CREATINGLEGISLATIVEASSEMBLY&amp;FindType=W&amp;AP=&amp;fn=_top&amp;trailtype=26&amp;vr=2.0&amp;rs=WEBL6.02&amp;spa=DCC-1000" class="external text" title="http://weblinks.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?DB=DC%2DST%2DTOC%3BSTADCTOC&amp;DocName=DCHIACTOF1871CREATINGLEGISLATIVEASSEMBLY&amp;FindType=W&amp;AP=&amp;fn=_top&amp;trailtype=26&amp;vr=2.0&amp;rs=WEBL6.02&amp;spa=DCC-1000" rel="nofollow">bill</a> that established the territorial government he desired. The Territory Act of 1871 merged the various governments in the District of Columbia into a single eleven-member legislature, including two representatives for Georgetown and two for the County of Washington, to be presided over by a territorial governor; the legislature and governor would all be appointed by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a>. The two front-runners for the governorship were initially Shepherd, from Washington, and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Jason A. Magruder, from Georgetown; although popular support was behind Shepherd, <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">President Grant</a> feared that either appointment would cause a sectional divide that might make governorship of the full district impossible. Thus Grant's inaugural appointment to the governorship was his friend, the financier <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_D._Cooke_47d4.html" title="Henry D. Cooke">Henry D. Cooke</a>, "a gentleman of unimpeachable integrity"<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> — and, secretly, a close political ally of Shepherd's.</p>
<p>Shepherd was appointed vice-chair of the city's five-man Board of Public Works. The most powerful public entity in the District of Columbia, the Board of Public Works, was actually an independent entity from the territorial government, reporting directly to Congress, but kept within the territory's sphere of influence by making the governor its chairman. Cooke, however, rarely attended the Board's meetings (probably at Shepherd's urging), allowing Vice-Chair Shepherd to preside.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> He asserted himself as a leader to such an extent that he often did not bother to consult the other members of the Board before making decisions and taking sweeping action. His abilities as a political operator, according to D.C. journalist Sam Smith, were formidable:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Boss Shepherd's persuasive skills were such that upon being called to account by the president of a railroad whose tracks on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Mall_f1e8.html" title="National Mall">Mall</a> had been torn up one night by 200 of Shepherd's men, he left the meeting with an offer to become the line's vice president.

<p>The war-torn condition of Washington City in the late <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860s.html" title="1860s">1860s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a> — when it was little more than a hamlet of dirt roads, wooden sidewalks and open sewers, surrounded by farmland and large country estates — was such that Congress had for several years discussed relocating the seat of the Federal government westward to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a> — which would have led to ruin for the District of Columbia. Shepherd believed that if the government was to remain in Washington, the city's infrastructure and facilities must be modernized and revitalized. He filled in the long-dormant <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_Avenue_57f4.html" title="Constitution Avenue">Washington Canal</a> and placed 157 miles of paved roads and sidewalks, 123 miles of sewers, 39 miles of gas mains, and 30 miles of water mains. Under his direction the city also planted 60,000 trees, built the city's first public transportation system in the form of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_streetcars.html" title="Washington streetcars">horse-drawn streetcars</a>, installed streetlights, and had the railroad companies refit their tracks to fit new citywide grading standards for the District.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Robey_Shepherd_51b5.html" title="Edit section: Governorship and fall from power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Governorship and fall from power</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, Washington writer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Clemmer_Ames_333a.html" title="Mary Clemmer Ames">Mary Clemmer Ames</a> wrote that "the majority of people believe that Governor Cooke would retain his position only until the fusion of irritated factions [i.e., whites and blacks; Washington, Georgetown, and Washington County] was effected, and that in the event of his resignation, Mr. Shepherd would be appointed his successor. Whether Governor Cooke retires before the end of his term or not, it is the universal belief that Mr. Shepherd will be the second governor of the District of Columbia."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Sure enough, that September, Cooke resigned as Governor of the District and Shepherd, having befriended Grant, was promoted by the President to the governorship.</p>
<p>Once in office, Governor Shepherd engaged in a series of social reforms and campaigns that were progressive even by Radical Republican standards: he "integrated public schools, supported the vote for women, sought representation for D.C. in Congress and a Federal payment to the city."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Generally, however, his gubernatorial term was "principally occupied in avoiding embarrassments in the conduct of the District's official business due to the inadequacy of the revenue which had been entailed by the demands for funds to meet the cost of executing street improvements."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>But despite the lack of finances, the massive public works project continued (and intensified) during Shepherd's term as governor of the District of Columbia. Although the Territorial Act of 1871 had given the governor power to issue construction bonds in the city, to the consternation of white landowners, Shepherd nonetheless put it to a referendum to demonstrate his widespread popular support in the city thanks to the black voters who backed him. (The referendum passed overwhelmingly — partly because Shepherd brought in blacks from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George%27s_County_2cc6.html" title="Prince George's County">Prince George's County</a> to vote.)<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the cost of the modifications was excessive. Initially, Shepherd had estimated them at a $6.25 million budget, but by <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, costs had ballooned to $9 million, despite a national <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panic_of_1873.html" title="Panic of 1873">panic</a> that had befallen the nation the year before. District residents gathered 1,200 signatures to petition an audit from Congress; when the audit was conducted, the legislature discovered that the city was in arrears by $13 million and declared bankruptcy<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> on its behalf. Shepherd was investigated for financial misappropriation and mishandling, during which time it was discovered that the project and its funding had been carried to absurd extremes. Shepherd had raised taxes to such a degree that citizens had to sell their own property to pay them. Street grading, too, had been executed such that some homes' front yards were as much as 15 feet lower than the front door. In addition, Congress discovered that Shepherd had given preference to neighborhoods and areas of the District in which he or his political cronies held financial interests.</p>
<p>Although none of his actions were found to have violated any laws, Shepherd was summarily fired and the territorial government was abolished in favor of a three-member Board of Commissioners, which remained in charge of the District for over a century. Although President Grant nominated Shepherd to the first Board of Commissioners, the appointment was rejected by the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_2092.html" title="U.S. Senate">Senate</a>.</p>
<p>The civic improvements, however, had sufficiently modernized the city that relocation of the capital was never again discussed as a serious option. It also created a decades-long real estate boom in Washington (until about the turn of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_9dae.html" title="20th Century">20th Century</a>), with wealthy Americans coming from all over the United States to build large and expensive mansions, some for year-round residency and some for winter vacation only (leading Washington to be called "the winter <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport%2C_Rhode_Island_c6b0.html" title="Newport, Rhode Island">Newport</a>").<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Shepherd remained in Washington for a further two years, still a real-estate magnate and a celebrated and influential member of Washington society In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>, however, he declared personal bankruptcy and, once his accounts were settled, moved with his family to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batopilas.html" title="Batopilas">Batopilas</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, where he made a fortune in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_mining.html" title="Silver mining">silver mining</a> and instituted many of the same reforms he had championed in the District of Columbia.</p>

The statue of Shepherd that had long stood on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Avenue_cad4.html" title="Pennsylvania Avenue">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._%28northwest%29_20e4.html" title="Washington, D.C. (northwest)">NW</a>, in front of the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Wilson_Building_626c.html" title="John A. Wilson Building">John A. Wilson Building</a> (which serves as Washington, D.C.'s City Hall) has served as a symbol of his fluctuating reputation. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, the statue was removed from its perch on D.C.'s primary thoroughfare and banished into city storage. It reappeared in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> near the obscure D.C. Public Works building in the blighted <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anacostia.html" title="Anacostia">Anacostia</a> section.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, in the <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century.html" title="21st century">21st century</a>, Washington historian Nelson Rimensnyder began strenuously arguing for the restoration of Shepherd's reputation, calling him an "urban visionary" who singlehandedly transformed Washington into a major American city and championed aggressive social reform. Largely as a result of Rimensnyder's (and others') efforts, the Shepherd statue was returned to its place in front of the Wilson Building in January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The D.C. neighborhood of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepherd_Park_671f.html" title="Shepherd Park">Shepherd Park</a>, where Shepherd once lived, is named for him, as is Alexander Shepherd Elementary School in that neighborhood.</p>
