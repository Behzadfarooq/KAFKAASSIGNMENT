<p>Hi, Alex. Could you possibly use the Show preview button instead of making so many minor changes? You're taking up a lot of the space in the Recent changes page. Your work is very much appreciated, though. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 03:43, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Associated Press photos are NOT fair use, they are copyrighted. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">Talk</a> 05:41, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>We're all struggling with "fair use", especially with current events articles. Ideally I think it would be good to cordon them off into a separate section in the database, so that everything could be downloaded under GFDL without them. That would present a lot of coding challenges though I think (removing the preformatting from the articles etc.)</p>
<p>At any rate, there are fair use images all over the 'pedia already, there's no real way to go back from that now, and I tend to think Rick may have been mistaken in his judgment (as I implied above). - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a>|<a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHephaestos_50c2.html" title="User talk:Hephaestos">§</a> 06:36, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>AP would disagree with you. Album covers, etc. are fair use, but a photo taken by an AP photographer is their property. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">Talk</a> 14:56, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is hardly the actual photo though, it's low-resolution and noticeably compressed (see the red areas around his jacket).... This is not the same as the 300dpi resolution version that the AP took for the papers, this is a reduced version for online distribution... and Wikipedia is well within its rights to use the image. Newspapers do just fine simply by adding a photo credit; Why couldn't we? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington">Alexwcovington</a> 15:30, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Best I can think of at the moment would be to list it on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair_use</a> and see what other people think about the matter. (I'm not aware of the AP challenging the fair use doctrine on Wikipedia, or anywhere else for that matter, but I might just be "out of the loop".) - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a>|<a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHephaestos_50c2.html" title="User talk:Hephaestos">§</a> 20:32, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

Hi sorry you are annoyed I moved it to match the full and correct name of the party I hate redirects sorry but you know what is great about wikipedia anyone can edit and what is bad about wikipedia is anyone can edit.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> dude check out what the party calls it self and think of this as well no party is going to use the word non partisan in its title the party is call the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Dakota_Democratic-NPL_Party_c5a6.html" title="North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party">North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party</a> not the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Nonpartisan_League_4a8e.html" title="Democratic-Nonpartisan League">Democratic-Nonpartisan League</a> party or what ever you have put it under <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> I don't think we need to identical pages. I think the page should be under the official name of the party. I didn't make up the title I just moved to give people the actual name of the party</p>

<p>Hi! I've noticed that you appear to be the person who has done the vast majority of work on the above tribes. I was considering splitting the articles into tribes but leaving the article on the nation to include the history of that organization after it's founding in the late 19th century. There is a plethora of information on the individual tribes on the Nation's website and I have a few resources including the <i>Handbook of American Indians</i> and Gloria Jahoda's <i>Trail of Tears: The Story of the American Indian Removals</i> which includes a chapter on the smallpox epidemic and Four Bears. In addition, <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i> has an article in this month's edition that discusses the epidemic and provides some of the story from the white man's point of view which is absent from Jahoda's version. Since you have done the vast majority of work, I thought I'd ask you before I made any changes. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead">Ganymead</a> 02:12, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

There is still work that needs to be done on the Mandan, as well as adding some of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Catlin_485e.html" title="George Catlin">George Catlin</a>'s paintings.

Alex, I would love to help out with your proposed WikiProject. My only concern is finding other interested Wikipedians. It seems like you and I are the two most active editors of ND articles. The population of North Dakota is so small that there just might not be enough people out there who would want to devote time to a project like this. I'm not very familiar with WikiProjects...do we need to have a certain number of interested users before we start <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_North_Dakota_a16b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject North Dakota">Wikipedia: WikiProject North Dakota</a> or could we just start it and hope that others will join the cause?</p>
<p>Do you think it would be smart to add a <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ND_Wikiproject_proposal_a39f.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington/ND Wikiproject proposal">"WikiProject North Dakota" proposal link</a> to the talk pages of some of the ND articles? That way, maybe we could find some users out there who would be interested in the project and get them to look at your proposal and (hopefully) sign up. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">MatthewUND</a> 05:41, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been arguing with an anonymous editor for the past two months or so over at Template talk:Saturn Footer about whether to have an exhaustive listing of moons in the footer or just the "highlights". Actually, it hasn't so much been an argument as it's been a slow-motion revert war - he's refusing to say anything about his position because "It takes too long and I can't be bothered." Now he's going around to all the articles that used this footer and changing them to use <a href="../../../s/a/t/Template%7ESaturn_Full_Footer_16fd.html" title="Template:Saturn Full Footer">Template:Saturn Full Footer</a>, which is kind of defeats the purpose of splitting off a different version in the first place.

<li>Although you recanted your statement, I still had time to read it. As I stated on the CFD, I have not been disruptive, rude or demeaning to anyone on Wiki. My comment was just to lighten the mood on Cfd, as it can be a tedious process when working with so many categorization schemes. It had nothing to do with my vote in general, and I usually always comment on my vote when I feel there is more to be said about the discussion. I realize that it may seem personal to some people, especially if you have any invested interest in the category in question, if I had meant it to be a sly comment, I would have not included the (&#160;;) ) smiley. I did not mean for the vote to not be taken seriously as per the coment I made. I am now going to read the message you left me earlier and go back through your proposals, I just wanted to get this part over with first.

<p>Hi, I do not personally hold anything against you for the comment, and understand that it was a defensive gesture, as was the reasoning for its removal. I hope that I did not offend you further by responding to it.</p>
<p>As for the current Cfd, I just added a comment about the reasoning behind my decision. It was more on keeping a standard structure in the current schema of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_the_United_States_eb2d.html" title="Category:Cities in the United States">Category:Cities in the United States</a>. The "Major" part is ambiguous, and could lead people to add/remove cities to it in the future, for what the y "feel" is major. I have no objection to the design of the template, and feel it does a good job at dividing the sections. Just don't feel that a sub-cat is warranted at this time, for just large and small cities. I am not an expert, just trying to keep a uniform and disambiguous category structure.</p>
<p>Thank you for your responses and understanding. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who"><font color="#FF0033">&lt;&gt;</font>Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 06:26, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Towns in [state] and Villages in [state].</i></p>
<p>Ahh, I did miss seeing that in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_the_United_States_eb2d.html" title="Category:Cities in the United States">Category:Cities in the United States</a>, I had to go back and look, and I do recall a previous Cfr on villages. I see your reasoning in the subdivisions. I would suggest renaming it "Large cities" and will adjust my comments on the Cfr. This way it will accomplish the same thing and get rid of the disambiguaty. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who"><font color="#FF0033">&lt;&gt;</font>Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 06:33, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Alex, I have chosen to change my vote on CFD. What you have done with the category tonight is great work. My main reason for initially voting for deletion was because I thought that keeping the category would probably result in eventually loosing the "Metropolitan..." category. I really think that having categories for metro areas is important...especially in ND where the three largest cities are metro areas with either two or three large towns spanning one or two states. For example, it's nice to have one category where you can find articles relating to Fargo, Moorhead, and West Fargo instead of just a Fargo category. I am more than satisfied with your efforts to properly categorize and arrange things here and I am off to change my vote... --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">MatthewUND</a> 06:40, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I commented on the vote page. I think having "major" cities (or some such distinction) is beneficial, although I would make that a subcategory of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_North_Dakota_14c3.html" title="Category:Cities in North Dakota">Category:Cities in North Dakota</a>. The category system is, IMO, one of the most frustrating parts of Wikipedia because it requires such a high degree of standardization to be effective. Don't get discouraged. --<a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <a href="../../../l/3/3/User_talk%7EL33tminion_b015.html" title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 16:00, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I understand your point, but I believe the limit of 2450 is too arbitrary and that's not really what categorization is for. It would be (imho) more useful to create a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_North_Dakota_5da5.html" title="List of cities in North Dakota">List of cities in North Dakota</a> ordered by city size.

<p>Would you mind giving this case a second look? I agree that it's strange that the article has been around for so long, but there is no statute of limitations on AfD precisely because of the possibility that material like this will go more or less unnoticed for so long. I don't think that he was notable in 2004, nor do I believe that he's done much to be considered that much more notable today. And it's a bit disturbing that most of the voters in the AfD seem to be people who've done either no editing before, or almost exclusively editing on his or his friends' pages. Which makes me think that it's more like a small group of friends not quite notable to be here who are putting themselves on here and supporting each other for the hell of it. If he's really on his way to bigger and better things, surely there's no harm in waiting until something clearly notable occurs before giving a marginal writer (as of 2006) an entry on an encyclopedia? Anyway, that's my two cents. I'd be very grateful if you gave it a second glance anyway.

<p>Dear Alexwcovington,<br />
I wanted to give you a heads-up that I contemplate to propose the article you created, Gibson Research Corporation, for deletion in a couple of days. A year and a half after its creation, there is still no original content and it is highly unlikely there ever will be:</p>
<p>We already have a complete Steve Gibson article and grc is basically just a corporate wrapper around him, so there's really no point to keep both. Of course, I'd welcome any comment you might have on the talk page of the article. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinistry_of_Truth_1471.html" title="User:Ministry of Truth">Ministry of Truth</a> 14:49, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I reverted your removal of the ND motto in the state's infobox. After seeing a couple of states with them inculded and the parameter being available, I added them to all of the states. We should discuss whether or not the info boxes should include mottos and whatnot. Either way, consistency among the infoboxes on the US states is the key.

<p>I'm sorry if you feel that I was out of line and harrassing User:Idontsteal. It's just tough to assume good faith on someone who's adding things about nuclear missle silos, protecting the city from lasers, and no US presidents giving a speech in front of it. I kept reverting because the Chia pet claim still seems teenage prank-ish, like the other edits.

<p>I have made a few slight changes to your edits of my contributions in order to satisfy myself and I feel that some of the edits that were made to my contribution were misleading (eg, its not call the Jamestown Arts Center, it's simply the Arts Center). The Chia pet claim is true and I would encourage any doubters to follow up on my claim with a phone call before they boister their egos by deleting factual information. I look foward to working with everyone, and thank you for leaving my factual post up.</p>

<p>If you would have taken time to look at the webpage, you would have more than likely noticed that it is indeed the Arts Center, however I can see how you would think otherwise, you had me guessing as well. I don't appreciate your sarcastic attitude, or the English lesson, however I am sure I deserved it. In any case, I think we've created a better, more information page on the World's Largest Buffalo.
