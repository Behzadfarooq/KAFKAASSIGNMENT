<p>Please consider merging your recent edits to many Premiership football club articles to what already exists in those articles. Your addition of the club's history in the Premiership often repeats what others have already included, and thus reduces that article's quality. In addition, please stop adding your speculation as to each team's chances of a trophy or their possible league position - Wikipedia <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_Wikipedia_is_not_3a16.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="What Wikipedia is not">is not a crystal ball</a>. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 17:49, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Please STOP</b> adding extra information into football club's articles about their Premiership experiences. In nearly <i>all</i> cases their history in the Premiership is already documented and you are only duplicating what is in the article already - only your version is separate and unwikified. You are severely reducing the quality of these articles. Please consider adding to and improving what already exists in each article rather than dumping text in addditionally without any thought. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 01:39, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see you re-adding this content again. Your "life in the Premiership" additions were merged into the main History sections of the articles concerned several weeks ago. Please stop adding them in again - all the relevant information is already there and all you're doing is adding unnecessary repetition and creating extra work for other editors to remove your work. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 21:12, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alex,</p>
<p>I have deleted your recent entries of 'Great Managers' and 'Great Players' - I am afraid they are just not appropriate. There is alredy a notable players section and a list of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Aston_Villa_7576.html" title="Aston Villa">Aston Villa</a> managers and your comments are far too opinionated for an wikipedia article.</p>
<p>I would also reiterate the remarks of previous users regarding your slapdash treatment of Premiership football articles. PLEASE STOP DOING THIS!</p>

<dd>And now likewise for Birmingham, Blackburn, Chelsea, Fulham, Manchester City, Middlesborough, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, West Ham United and, of course, Wigan Athletic. Aside from the problems of the information not being well integrated into the articles and often finding itself duplicating existing prose, I have to ask, where did the text come from? Specifically, what is the copyright status of it? An editor has worked your information into the Sunderland article and that's great, as long as it's legal. <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeila_89c3.html" title="User:Veila">Veila</a> 11:06, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alex. Good job on covering the seasons of English football, but please use the format '1983-84 in English football' rather than just '1983-84'. Also, it would be good if you wikified. <a href="../../../e/i/x/User%7EEixo_d259.html" title="User:Eixo">Eixo</a> 22:31, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What they said! The articles are good, but an article called "1993-94" is not very intuitive, and I honestly couldn't tell what sport it was. Please create them with descriptive titles like <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993-94_in_English_football_f7a6.html" title="1993-94 in English football">1993-94 in English football</a>. Unfortunately I see there is already a page by this title, and without researching the sports involved I can't tell what the difference between 1993-94 and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993-94_in_English_football_f7a6.html" title="1993-94 in English football">1993-94 in English football</a> is.

<p>Hello AlexWilkes. Thank-you for your contributions to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I notice you have been creating some football-related articles, for example <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976-77_in_English_football_3507.html" title="1976-77 in English football">1976-77 in English football</a>.</p>
<p>In those articles, you have been using headers which are surrounded by single equals signs, for example:</p>
<pre>
 = First Division =
</pre>
<p>This practice is not normally followed; rather it is usual to introduce your highest-level sections using two equals signs, for example:</p>
<pre>
 == First Division ==
</pre>
<p>See <a href="../../../s/e/c/Wikipedia%7ESection_0446.html#Creation_of_sections" title="Wikipedia:Section">Wikipedia:Section#Creation of sections</a> which in particular says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please <i>do not</i> use only one equals sign on a side (=text here=); this causes a title the size of the page name; which is taken care of automatically.</dd>

<p>Hi Alex, you may want to add a <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">stub</a> tag to the articles you're adding. At present they are likely too short with no indication of why they are important.

<p>I've reverted your changes to the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_F.C._c6c0.html" title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea F.C.</a> page.

<p>I see you're making this kind of edit again; again I must ask you: please don't just tack it on to the end of existing content as you did with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Arsenal_F.C._6260.html" title="History of Arsenal F.C.">History of Arsenal F.C.</a> - there was an already extensive account of the period between 1993 and the present day, and you just wasted your time duplicating it. I note that you have at least made the effort with some other club article to integrate your additions with the existing text, which is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>Also, please be more sensible with headings (it is not necessary to give every season its own subsection), and keep heading titles <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and judgement-free (e.g. you should not label seasons as "disappointing" or "unremarkable"). Additionally, please avoid <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">speculation</a> in articles (e.g. a team's chances in Europe this season) - you should know by now that Wikipedia discourages such behaviour.</p>
<p>I really am getting sick of you making the same mistakes again and again despite much polite advice from other Wikipedians on how to do things correctly.

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:CNV00006.JPG. Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated.

<p>I have to agree with all the above contributors. Please <b>stop</b> adding so many subheadings and splitting articles into one-paragraph sections. By separating out related paragraphs into different sections, it makes a long article hard to read and damages the flow of the prose. In addition, your section titles are often of a POV and unencylopaedic tone, misusing simplistic terms such as "glory" and "disappointment". Please read the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">Manual of Style</a> and other relevant policies - you have had enough objections here to indicate that your contributions are not helpful. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 11:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've reverted the edits you've made to the article on Manchester United's treble winning season. The edits are completely pointless. They are supposed to be divided by trophy, therefore the section about the FA Cup should just be called that, not "Triumph in the cup" or whatever you put. Keep things short and concise. Also, your title of "United beat Arsenal to the title" is incredibely POV.

Please do your best to <b>always fill in the summary field</b>. This is considered an important guideline in Wikipedia. Even a short summary is better than no summary. An edit summary is even more important if you delete any text; otherwise, people may think you're being sneaky.

<p>Alex - a number of Wikipedians believe the articles you are creating are of a poor quality and limited scope, and should be deleted.

<p>Hi Alex, I've nominated these articles for deletion. Please don't take it personally, it is just a usual process that when Wikipedians are not sure whether articles merit inclusion to have a discussion about whether or not to keep them. I think it's great that you've put so much effort in them, but next time when you set out to create a large number of new articles it's probably best to post a message on the WikiProject Football talk page to see what other users feel.

<p>Did you by any chance add the year of Ellie Beavens birth? Where on earth did you find it? I've been looking for ages. Good spot! <a href="../../../c/l/s/User%7ECls14_45fd.html" title="User:Cls14">Cls14</a> 11:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for starting an article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkie_%28taxi_driver%29_5649.html" title="David Wilkie (taxi driver)">David Wilkie</a>. I've expanded it a bit, but also arranged for it to be moved to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkie_%28taxi_driver%29_5649.html" title="David Wilkie (taxi driver)">David Wilkie (taxi driver)</a>. Just wanted to let you know. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 00:50, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, AlexWilkes! You have recently wrote a description... well, more like a list of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini_MPV_9205.html" title="Mini MPV">mini MPVs</a> in that article. I must say that most of them are <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_MPV_69e5.html" title="Compact MPV">compact MPVs</a>, that means one segment bigger. I didn't move the text to the compact MPV's article because there was already a similar section, and a full list is referenced in See also (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recent_automobile_models_by_type.html" title="List of recent automobile models by type">list of recent automobile models by type</a>). I hope you keep adding information on those articles. Good luck! -- <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENaBUru38_399f.html" title="User:NaBUru38">NaBUru38</a> 01:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
