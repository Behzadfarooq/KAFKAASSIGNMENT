<p>The bombs, secretly developed by the United States (with assistance from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>) under the codename <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_Project_aaa1.html" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>, were the second and third atomic devices to be detonated, and are the only ones ever used as <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons</a>, rather than for testing purposes. The first nuclear test explosion, designated "<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_site.html" title="Trinity site">Trinity</a>" (and nicknamed "The Gadget" in part since it was not a deliverable weapon) was conducted in a desert in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, 1945.

Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, and followed over 3½ years of direct involvement of the US in World War II, during which time the United States had suffered about a million casualties. Truman's officially stated intention in ordering the bombings was to bring about a quick resolution of the war by inflicting destruction, and instilling fear of further destruction, that was sufficient to cause Japan to surrender.</p>
<p>After the Hiroshima atomic attack (and before the Nagasaki atomic attack), President Truman issued the following statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum.

<p>At the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of considerable military significance. It contained the headquarters of the Fifth Division and Field Marshal <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hata_Shunroku_ab54.html" title="Hata Shunroku">Hata</a>'s 2nd General Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan. The city was a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops. It was chosen as a target because it had not suffered damage from previous bombing raids, allowing an ideal environment to measure the damage caused by the atomic bomb. The city was mobilized for "all-out" war, with thousands of conscripted women, children and Koreans working in military offices, military factories and building demolition and with women and children training to resist any invading force.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp.318"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp.318" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp.318" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_refbot.319"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_refbot.319" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_refbot.319" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp.320"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp.320" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp.320" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.yale.edu.321"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.yale.edu.321" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.yale.edu.321" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The center of the city contained a number of reinforced concrete buildings as well as lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small wooden workshops set among Japanese houses; a few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were of wooden construction with tile roofs. Many of the industrial buildings also were of wood frame construction. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.</p>
<p>The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 380,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At the time of the attack the population was approximately 255,000. This figure is based on the registered population, used by the Japanese in computing ration quantities, and the estimates of additional workers and troops who were brought into the city may not be highly accurate.</p>

<p>Hiroshima was the primary target of the first U.S. nuclear attack mission, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. The weather was good, and the crew and equipment functioned properly. Navy Captain <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Sterling_Parsons_7a86.html" title="William Sterling Parsons">William Parsons</a> armed the bomb during the flight, since it had been left unarmed to minimize the risks during takeoff. In every detail, the attack was carried out exactly as planned, and the bomb, with a 60 kg (130 pounds) core of <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium-235.html" title="Uranium-235">uranium-235</a>, performed precisely as expected.</p>
<p>About an hour before the bombing, the Japanese early warning radar net detected the approach of some American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. The alert had been given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. The planes approached the coast at a very high altitude. At nearly 08:00, the radar operator in Hiroshima determined that the number of planes coming in was very small — probably not more than three — and the air raid alert was lifted. The normal radio broadcast warning was given to the people that it might be advisable to go to shelter if <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29.html" title="B-29">B-29s</a> were actually sighted, but no raid was expected beyond some sort of reconnaissance. At 08:15, the B-29 <i><a href="../../../e/n/o/Enola_Gay_1d9d.html" title="Enola Gay">Enola Gay</a></i>, piloted and commanded by Colonel <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Tibbets_0167.html" title="Paul Tibbets">Paul Tibbets</a>, dropped the nuclear bomb called "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Boy_994b.html" title="Little Boy">Little Boy</a>" over the central part of the city.

Hiroshima, in the aftermath of the bombing.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> control operator of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_Broadcasting_Corporation_8e06.html" title="Japanese Broadcasting Corporation">Japanese Broadcasting Corporation</a> noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air. He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed. About twenty minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima. From some small railway stops within ten miles (16 km) of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima. All these reports were transmitted to the Headquarters of the Japanese General Staff.</p>
<p>Military headquarters repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the men at Headquarters; they knew that no large enemy raid could have occurred, and they knew that no sizeable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer of the Japanese General Staff was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was generally felt at Headquarters that nothing serious had taken place, that it was all a terrible rumor starting from a few sparks of truth.</p>
<p>The staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest. After flying for about three hours, while still nearly 100 miles (160 km) from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud of smoke from the bomb. In the bright afternoon, the remains of Hiroshima were burning.</p>

Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest building to have withstood the bomb blast.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima were of a far stronger construction than is required by normal standards in the USA, because of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> danger in Japan. This exceptionally strong construction undoubtedly accounted for the fact that the framework of some of the buildings that were fairly close to the center of damage in the city did not collapse. Another is that the blast was more downward than sideways; this has much to do with the survival of the <i>Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall</i> (pictured), designed and built by the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech</a> architect <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Letzel_8da0.html" title="Jan Letzel">Jan Letzel</a>, which was only a few meters from <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_zero.html" title="Ground zero">ground zero</a>.

<p>The city of <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagasaki.html" title="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> had been one of the largest <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_port.html" title="Sea port">sea ports</a> in southern Japan and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordnance.html" title="Ordnance">ordnance</a>, ships, military equipment, and other war materials.</p>
<p>In contrast to many modern aspects of Nagasaki, the residences almost without exception were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of wood or wood-frame buildings, with wood walls (with or without plaster), and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also housed in buildings of wood or other materials not strong enough to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley.</p>
<p>Nagasaki had never been subjected to large-scale bombing prior to the explosion of a nuclear weapon there. On August 1, 1945, however, a number of high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. A few of these bombs hit in the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city. Several of the bombs hit the <i><a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi.html" title="Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a> Steel and Arms Works</i> and six bombs landed at the <i>Nagasaki Medical School and Hospital</i>, with three direct hits on buildings there. While the damage from these few bombs were relatively small, it created considerable concern in Nagasaki and a number of people - principally school children - were evacuated to rural areas for safety, thus reducing the population in the city at the time of the nuclear attack.</p>

<p>On the morning of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">August 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the crew of the American <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29_Superfortress_ad11.html" title="B-29 Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> "<a href="../../../b/o/c/Bockscar.html" title="Bockscar">Bockscar</a>," flown by Major <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_W._Sweeney_7647.html" title="Charles W. Sweeney">Charles W. Sweeney</a> and carrying the nuclear bomb nicknamed "<a href="../../../f/a/t/Fat_Man_555c.html" title="Fat Man">Fat Man</a>," found their primary target, <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokura.html" title="Kokura">Kokura</a>, to be obscured by cloud. After three runs over the city and having fuel running low due to a fuel-transfer problem, they headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki. At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the "all clear" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53 the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, at 11:00, the observation B-29 ("<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Artiste_b5c9.html" title="The Great Artiste">The Great Artiste</a>" flown by Capt. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_C._Bock_bdaf.html" title="Frederick C.

These instruments also contained messages to Prof. Ryukochi Sagane, a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_physicist.html" title="Nuclear physicist">nuclear physicist</a> who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a>, urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>. The letter was not found until after the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>At 11:02, a last minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed Bockscar's bombardier, Capt. Kermit Beahan, to visually sight the target as ordered. The weapon, containing a core of 8 kg of <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium-239</a>, was dropped over the city's industrial valley. It exploded 1,540 feet (469 m) above the ground almost midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works, in the south, and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works (Torpedo Works), in the north, the two principal targets of the city. Some 75,000 of Nagasaki's 240,000 residents were killed, followed by the death of at least as many from resulting sickness and injury. However another report issues a different residential number, speaking of Nagasaki's population which dropped in one split-second from 422,000 to 383,000, thus 39,000 were killed, over 25,000 were injured. Including those who died from radioactive materials causing cancer, the total number of residents killed is believed to be at least 100,000.</p>

<p>Supporters of the bombing concede that although the civilian leadership in Japan was cautiously and discreetly sending out diplomatic communiqu?s as far back as <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, following the Allied invasion of <a href="../../../l/u/z/Luzon.html" title="Luzon">Luzon</a> in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, Japanese military officials were unanimously opposed to any negotiations before the use of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>While some members of the civilian leadership did use covert diplomatic channels to begin negotiation for peace, on their own it could not negotiate surrender or even a cease-fire. Japan, as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_Monarchy_5599.html" title="Constitutional Monarchy">Constitutional Monarchy</a>, could only enter into a peace agreement with the unanimous support of the Japanese cabinet, and this cabinet was dominated by militarists from the Japanese Imperial Army and the Japanese Imperial Navy, all of whom were initially opposed to any peace deal. A political stalemate developed between the military and civilian leaders of Japan with the military increasingly determined to fight despite the costs and odds.</p>
<p>Historian <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Davis_Hanson_b671.html" title="Victor Davis Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a> points to the increased Japanese resistance, futile as it was in retrospect, as the war came to its inevitable conclusion. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Okinawa_c899.html" title="Battle of Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a> showed this determination to fight on at all costs. More than 110,000 Japanese and 12,000 American troops were killed in the bloodiest battle of the Pacific theater, just 8 weeks before Japan's final surrender. When the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> and carried out <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_August_Storm_df9e.html" title="Operation August Storm">Operation August Storm</a>, the Japanese Imperial Army ordered its ill-supplied and weakened forces in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> to fight to the last man, an order which it carried out. Major General Masakazu Amanu, chief of the operations section at Japanese Imperial Headquarters, stated that he was absolutely convinced his defensive preparations, begun in early 1944, could repel any Allied invasion of the home islands with minimum losses. The Japanese would not give up easily because of their strong tradition of pride and honor: many followed the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushido.html" title="Bushido">Samurai code</a> and would fight until the very last man was dead.</p>
<p>After the realization that the destruction of Hiroshima was from a nuclear weapon, the civilian leadership gained more and more traction in its argument that Japan had to concede defeat and accept the terms of the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yalta_Proclamation_f925.html" title="Yalta Proclamation">Yalta Proclamation</a>.</p>
<p>According to some Japanese historians, Japanese civilian leaders who favored surrender saw their salvation in the atomic bombing. The Japanese military was steadfastly refusing to give up, so the peace faction seized on the bombing as a new argument to force surrender. <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koichi_Kido_3e9e.html" title="Koichi Kido">Koichi Kido</a>, one of emperor Hirohito's closest advisors, stated: "<i>We of the peace party were assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war.</i>" <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hisatsune_Sakomizu_b3be.html" title="Hisatsune Sakomizu">Hisatsune Sakomizu</a>, the chief Cabinet secretary in 1945. called the bombing "<i>a golden opportunity given by heaven for Japan to end the war.</i>" According to these historians and others, the pro-peace civilian leadership was able to use the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to convince the military that no amount of courage, skill and fearless combat could help Japan against the power of atomic weapons. <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akio_Morita_00a4.html" title="Akio Morita">Akio Morita</a>, founder of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> and Japanese Naval officer during the war, also concludes that it was the atomic bomb and not conventional bombings from B-29s that convinced the Japanese military to agree to peace.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bombing also point out that waiting for the Japanese to surrender was not a cost-free option. The conventional bombardment was killing tens of thousands each week in Japan, directly and indirectly. The submarine blockade and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Forces_8bec.html" title="United States Army Air Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>'s <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_mine.html" title="Naval mine">mining</a> operation, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Starvation_3463.html" title="Operation Starvation">Operation Starvation</a>, had effectively cut off Japan's imports. A complementary operation against Japan's railways was about to begin, isolating the cities of southern Honshu from the food grown elsewhere in the Home Islands. This, combined with the delay in relief supplies from the Allies, could have resulted in a far greater death toll, due to famine and malnutrition, than actually occurred. "Immediately after the defeat, some estimated that 10 million people were likely to starve to death", noted historian Daikichi Irokawa. Meanwhile, in addition to the Soviet attacks, offensives were scheduled in southern China, and Malaysia. As a result of the war, noncombatants were dying throughout Asia at a rate of about 200,000 per month.</p>
<p>The Americans anticipated losing many soldiers in the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html" title="Operation Downfall">planned invasion of Japan</a>, although the actual number of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html#Estimated_casualties_for_Downfall" title="Operation Downfall">expected fatalities and wounded</a> is subject to some debate and depends on the persistence and reliability of Japanese resistance and whether the Americans would have invaded only Kyushu in November 1945 or if a follow up landing near Tokyo, projected for March of 1946, would have been needed. Years after the war, Secretary of State <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Byrnes_69c0.html" title="James Byrnes">James Byrnes</a> claimed that 500,000 American lives would have been lost - and that number has since been repeated "authoritatively", but in the summer of 1945 US military planners projected 20,000-110,000 combat deaths from the initial November 1945 invasion, with about three to four times that number wounded.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the atomic bomb hastened the end of the Second World War in Asia liberating hundreds of thousands of Western citizens (including about 200,000 Dutch) and 400,000 Indonesians ("<i>Romushas</i>") from Japanese concentration camps. In addition, Japanese atrocities against millions of Chinese were ended.</p>
<p>Supporters also point to an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. The order dealt with the disposal and execution of all Allied POW's, numbering over 100,000, if an invasion of the Japanese mainland took place.</p>
<p>In response to the argument that the large-scale killing of civilians was immoral and a war crime, supporters of the bombings have argued that the Japanese government waged <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>, ordering many civilians (including women and children) to work in factories and military offices and to fight against any invading force. Father John A. Siemes, professor of modern philosophy at Tokyo's Catholic University, and an eyewitness to the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"We have discussed among ourselves the ethics of the use of the bomb. Some consider it in the same category as poison gas and were against its use on a civil population. Others were of the view that in total war, as carried on in Japan, there was no difference between civilians and soldiers, and that the bomb itself was an effective force tending to end the bloodshed, warning Japan to surrender and thus to avoid total destruction. It seems logical to me that he who supports total war in principle cannot complain of war against civilians." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.yale.edu.326"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.yale.edu.326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_www.yale.edu.326" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></sup></span></dd>

</dl>
<p>Their use has been called barbaric as several hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed, and the choice of areas heavily populated by civilians.

<p>It has been argued that the use of atomic weapons against <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian.html" title="Civilian">civilian</a> populations on a large scale is a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_against_humanity.html" title="Crime against humanity">crime against humanity</a> and a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crime</a>.

<dd>Eisenhower wrote in his memoir <i>The White House Years</i>:
<dl>
<dd>"In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act? During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment, was I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Eisenhower"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_Eisenhower" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_Eisenhower" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></sup></span> <sup>(pg. 312-313)</sup>"</dd>

<p>Others contend that Japan had been trying to surrender for at least two months, but the US refused by insisting on an unconditional surrender. In fact, while several diplomats favored surrender, the leaders of the Japanese military were committed to fighting a 'Decisive Battle' <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html" title="Operation Downfall">on Kyushu</a>, hoping that they could negotiate better terms for an armistice afterward — all of which the Americans knew from reading <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Magic (cryptography)">decrypted Japanese communications</a>. The Japanese government never did decide <i>what</i> terms, beyond preservation of an imperial system, they would have accepted to end the war; as late as August 9, the Supreme Council was still split, with the hardliners insisting Japan should demobilize its own forces, no war crimes trials, and no occupation. Only the direct intervention of the Emperor ended the dispute, and even after that a military coup was attempted to prevent the surrender (although it was easily suppressed).</p>
<p>Some have argued that the Soviet Union's switch from wary neutral to enemy on August 8, 1945 might have been enough to convince the Japanese military of the need to accept the terms of the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potsdam_Declaration_2eae.html" title="Potsdam Declaration">Potsdam Declaration</a> (plus some provision for the emperor). As it happened, the decision to surrender was made before the scale of the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_August_Storm_df9e.html" title="Operation August Storm">Soviet attack</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakhalin.html" title="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> Island, and the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuril_Islands_c249.html" title="Kuril Islands">Kuril Islands</a> was known, but had the war continued, the Soviets would have been able to invade <a href="../../../h/o/k/Hokkaido.html" title="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> well before the Allied invasion of Kyushu.</p>

<p>Other Japanese sources have stated that the atomic bombings themselves were not the principal reason for capitulation. Instead, they contend, it was not the American atomic attacks on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">August 9</a>, but the swift and devastating Soviet victories on the mainland in the week following Stalin's <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a> declaration of war that forced the Japanese message of surrender on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. Certainly the fact of both enemies weighed into the decision, but it was more the fear of Soviet occupation that hastened imperialistic Japan's acceptance of defeat.</p>
<p>Many critics believe that the U.S. had ulterior motives in dropping the bombs, including justifying the $2 billion investment in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_Project_aaa1.html" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>, testing the effects of nuclear weapons, exacting revenge for the attacks on <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_865a.html" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, and demonstrating U.S. capabilities to the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Scientists who had worked on the project later noted that they were pressured to finish the bomb by a set schedule, one which was timed to coincide with the Russian entrance into the Pacific theater, and one which additionally implied that the war would be potentially over very soon.</p>
<p>Some believe more effort to reduce casualties should have been made. Further, some claim this could have been done without affecting the stated purposes of the bombing. "No evidence has ever been uncovered that leaflets warning of atomic attack were dropped on Hiroshima. Indeed, the decision of the Interim Committee was <i>that we could not give the Japanese any warning.</i>" <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_refbot.331"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_refbot.331" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_temp_7a23.html#endnote_refbot.331" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></sup></span> However, after the Hiroshima bombing, Truman announced "If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air the likes of which has never been seen on this earth."

<p>The decision to bomb Nagasaki only a few days after Hiroshima raises separate issues. Some people hold that most of the arguments for the use of the atomic bomb do not justify dropping the second one on Nagasaki.

<dd>TO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE:</dd>
<dd>America asks that you take immediate heed of what we say on this leaflet.</dd>
<dd>We are in possession of the most destructive explosive ever devised by man. A single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent in explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29s can carry on a single mission. This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure you it is grimly accurate.</dd>
<dd>We have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still have any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one atomic bomb fell on that city.</dd>
<dd>Before using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which they are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition the Emperor to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen consequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these consequences and begin the work of building a new, better and peace-loving Japan.</dd>
<dd>You should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war.</dd>

<p>The literature about the bombings, the making of the decision to use the bombs, the surrender of Japan, and the inter-relation of the latter two, is extremely extensive. The following volumes include many of the best ones. It should be noted that some (especially among the ones that debate whether the bombings were justified) were written from a particular point of view, and may contain claims that are disputed.</p>
