<p><b>Alex</b> is a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_strip.html" title="Cartoon strip">cartoon strip</a> by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Peattie_6dc7.html" title="Charles Peattie">Charles Peattie</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Taylor_3bcd.html" title="Russell Taylor">Russell Taylor</a>. It first appeared in the short-lived <i><a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Daily_News_7291.html" title="London Daily News">London Daily News</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. It moved to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> later that year and then to the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>The strip with its storylines-with-a-twist proved so popular that, in the course of its transfer to the <i>Telegraph</i>, it was preceded by a nationwide <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_%28advertising%29.html" title="Billboard (advertising)">billboard</a> campaign.</p>
<p>The strip occurs in 'real-time', ie time passes and characters age and develop as in real life. Alex and Penny married in the strip's early days and had a son called Christopher; they are now middle-aged and Christopher is a teenager.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Edit section: The Jokes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Jokes</span></h2>
<p>The jokes in the strip revolve around Alex's <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">yuppie</a> values, obsession with appearances, and schemes to stay one up in the world of international finance. Peattie and Taylor are reputed to work closely with a variety of London financial contacts to ensure that their strips accurately reflect the recent scandals and rumours which pass around the City. Much gossip has circulated as to the likely inspiration for some of the characters.</p>
<p>The most common kind of joke features a conversation between the characters, where in the final frame it becomes apparent that the context of the conversation was not what the reader had supposed, usually reflecting on the protagonists' unusual personalities. For instance, in a restaurant, an embarrassed Alex apologises to the <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27.html" title="Maître d'">maître d'</a> after his dinner guest answers a call on his mobile. The maître d's claim that the restaurant's policy on phones is very relaxed these days does not alleviate Alex' embarrassment since it was due to the phone being an old-fashioned one and not the latest <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_the_art.html" title="State of the art">state of the art</a>.</p>
<p>Another kind of strip which appears occasionally consists of only two large frames, showing two different characters, or the same character in two different situations, giving a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monologue.html" title="Monologue">monologue</a> composed of almost exactly the same words, but which, in the different situations, have very different meanings.</p>
<p>The strip has sometimes taken on storylines which feature fantasy characters and situations. These storylines are usually published at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> time. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, for example, Alex' colleague Clive made a pact with the Devil and found himself working in <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investment_Bank_34cb.html" title="Investment Bank">Investment Bank</a> Hell. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> he and Alex went to <a href="../../../l/a/p/Lapland.html" title="Lapland">Lapland</a> where they bought up <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Christmas_15a9.html" title="Father Christmas">Father Christmas</a>' business, outsourcing the toy-making department away from the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves.html" title="Elves">elves</a> and over to Asia where <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> would not be paid extra for working over the Christmas holidays. However it turns out that Alex had dreamed this whole scenario up after he had fallen asleep whilst watching England's disastrous handling of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_Ashes_series_36a9.html" title="2006-07 Ashes series">2006-07 Ashes</a> <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> series.</p>
<p>The complexities of the jokes has meant that the strip has often had to take time off (i.e., not appear for two or more weeks) while the writers come up with new material.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Edit section: List of characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">List of characters</span></h2>
<p><b>Alex Masterley</b> is the protagonist of the comic strip. He is an experienced investment banker working in London's <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docklands.html" title="Docklands">Docklands</a>. Alex is totally obsessed with personal status, with his work coming second and his family a distant third. His commitment to status requires him to have all of the latest professional gadgets, including a <a href="../../../b/l/a/BlackBerry_9813.html" title="BlackBerry">BlackBerry</a> and a <a href="../../../3/g/_/3G_bf4c.html" title="3G">3G</a> mobile phone. Alex usually works for <b>Rupert Sterling</b> at Megabank, but has, in the past, worked for <b>Mr Hardcastle</b> as his Head of Corporate Strategy.</p>
<p><b>Penny Masterley</b> is Alex's long-suffering wife. They married very early in the strip's history, and have one son, <b>Christopher</b>. Penny enjoys the affluent lifestyle that Alex provides, but has little patience for Alex's obsessions with status and his work. The two spend very little time together, and are not very close. Alex has cheated on Penny a number of times, including a protracted affair with his secretary, <b>Wendy</b> in 1991, and a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-night_stand.html" title="One-night stand">one-night stand</a> with a co-worker while travelling on business in 1998. Penny came very close to divorcing Alex after the affair with his secretary, and has considered leaving him on other occasions. In 2005 Alex started an affair with a client, <b>Carolyn</b>, which is currently continuing.</p>
<p><b>Christopher Masterley</b> is Alex's teenage son. Christopher was born early in the strip's run, and has grown normally over the years. Christopher is very much his father's son, and shares his concern for status and his nose for business. Alex mostly sees Christopher as a symbol of his success, and often makes him a victim of his quest for status. Though initially educated at a top <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html#England_and_Wales" title="Public school">Public School</a>, Christopher was withdrawn during the city slump in 2001, when Alex was out of work.</p>
<p><b>Clive Reed</b> is Alex's co-worker, and even once his boss. He is married to <b>Bridget</b>. Clive is Alex's inferior in every way. He is less socially skilled, and frequently commits embarrassing gaffes in public. He is less professionally skilled, and often makes bad financial investments or fails to manage his subordinates. Alex enjoys Clive's company because it provides many opportunities to show his superiority. Clive is also a dreadful wimp, and readily retreats from any situation of conflict or difficulty. In spite of this, Clive is something of a <a href="../../../w/o/m/Womanizer.html" title="Womanizer">womaniser</a>, and has enjoyed a moderate amount of success. In particular, Clive had a long and guilt-ridden affair with <b>Ruth</b> while he was engaged to Bridget. The liaison produced a son in 1993. Clive also enjoys just enough professional success to maintain his career and his affluent lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>Bridget Reed</b> is Clive's wife. For many years, Bridget was Clive's live-in girlfriend and fiancée. The two married some time between 1993 and 1997. Although Bridget is in a similar situation to <b>Penny</b>, she has even less patience with her husband, and a much more sadistic temperament. She takes delight in any opportunity to expose Clive for the wimp and loser that he is. This, together with the affluent lifestyle that Clive somehow manages to provide, seems to be her main reasons for staying with him.</p>
<p><b>Rupert Sterling</b> is Alex and Clive's boss, a senior director in a merchant bank. He and Alex are on the same wavelength as regards status and appearances. This has not stopped Rupert from sacking Alex on a number of occasions, though he had always returned. Rupert was once tried and jailed for financial fraud; this did not affect his life style too much: his wife would arrive on visiting day only to be told that her husband was in a meeting.</p>
<p><b>Greg Masterley</b> is Alex' brother and a reporter. Unlike his sibling Greg tends to be rather stingy when it comes to money: Greg will use a foreign coin in order to jam a pavement parking meter and thus park his car for next to nothing, whereas Alex will probably fail to pay the meter in order to show that he can afford the fine.</p>
<p><b>Mr Hardcastle</b> is the stereotypical Northern boss of a manufacturing company. Hardcastle employs Megabank for a lot of his financial work. Bluff and down-to-earth, it is surprising that he puts up with Alex's expensive and flash City ways. Perhaps he is secretly in awe of him, or perhaps Alex's competitors are worse? Alex worked for him during the City slump in around 2002, though he found every excuse from getting away from Hardcastle's northern-based offices to enjoy the pleasures of London and <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascot_Racecourse_1c85.html" title="Ascot Racecourse">Ascot</a>.</p>
<p><b>Christian</b> is a European junior working his way through the ranks. Sophisticated, from a rich French family, he disdains the 'Anglo' culture and in return is often the butt of Alex's jokes.</p>
<p><b>Jane</b> was Alex's head of department in 1996. A decisive and masterful figure she aroused an apparently genuine passion in Alex: "no wonder I worship her". They had a brief affair which was terminated when she had to resign for undisclosed reasons "after a full and frank discussion with the board". Her last act was to send a late night email to all her staff thanking them for showing her "kindness, warmth, respect, personal support, encouragement, loyalty, hospitality and friendship." All of which was now completely down the drain since someone else would be determining their bonuses.</p>
<p><b>Ruth</b> Clive's American lover, not seen much lately. An investment banker &amp; frequent character in early years.</p>
<p><b>Wendy Tanner</b> was Alex' secretary and had an affair with him. When his wife Penny found out they almost divorced, but later made up. Alex decided that there was no future with Wendy and felt it unwise to continue any longer since her probationary period was due to end and it is hard to sack clerical staff once they become full time.</p>
<p><b>Cyrus</b> is Alex' new god-fearing American head of department who arrived on the scene soon after the Megabank merger and the apparent promotion of Rupert to senior banker status. Cyrus is an unabashed workaholic who bows his head during Thanksgiving dinner grace in order to use his Blackberry for work, probably checking up on someone from the office.</p>
<p>plus a cast of match sellers, policemen, and all the characters you would expect to find in a cosmopolitan world financial centre.</p>
