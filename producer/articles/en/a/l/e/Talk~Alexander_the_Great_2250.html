<p>The first sentance of the "Fall of the Persian Empire" section is a fragment. Also, the section instantly begins with Alexander marching into Persia. The section doesn't give any background information and/or intro to the invasion. I'm not an expert on Alexander the Great, but I just wanted to point that out so accurate information could be entered. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupernaturalWarfare_88d6.html" title="User:SupernaturalWarfare">Brian</a> 16:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Has anyone every discussed Alexander and his place in Dante's Inferno? Though many people both ancient and modern are very awed at his accomplishments he gets placed in a pool of boiling blood and gets shot at by centaurs. Dante cites the reason because of his excess of blood letting but I don't see a reference in the actual article, just a question. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Maverick62289 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maverick62289_c878.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maverick62289">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>mmm... I think its better to leave that out. If every refrence to Alexander the Great in the last 2350 odd years were put in this article it would be long indeed. What Dante thought of Alexander might be more relevant to an article on Dante than an article on Alexander. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebike_fdf7.html" title="User:Thebike">Thebike</a> 21:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think the article on Alexander is complete without referring to the Bibilical prophesies of the book of Daniel, chapter 8. The passage is quite clear and I don't know of anyone that disputes it is directly referring to Alexander's destruction of the Media-Persian empire - regardless of whether they believe it was written as prophesy or history. The writing in Daniel points to being written in 600BC or before, and even those who believe it was postdated would put it within 100 to 200 years of Alexanders reign.</p>
<p>Regardless of ones viewpoint on the Bible, the historical relevance of books, particularly ones such as Daniel, is unquestioned. The fact that Alexander is referred to specifically in the Bible is rare for anyone outside the history of ancient Israel.</p>
<p>This is particularly true if the portion on the Quran's (very sketchy) references to Alexander are retained in the article. At best this is hearsay on the Daniel legend written nearly a century after the fact, and therefore offers little historical merit.</p>
<p>In Alexander (disambiguation), it is written as Alexander the Great (336-323BC) it should be 356-323BC</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, this is an excellent point. But there's not enough said about Alexander in the Bible to create a sub-topic. Perhaps it would be best as a trivia point or as something noted in some other related section. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 15:21, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Calling it "Alexander the Great" seems to be very biased. Not everyone thinks he was "Great", no even "good".

No. Kings and monarchs are usually known by their name and reign number, in the order of "Name # of <i>X country</i>". Why should Alexander's article be title differently? Just because some see him as "great" does not mean it is a general consensus, nor that we should present such a biased view as part of an article's title.--The Gonz 08:47, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Neither Frederick nor Alfonso conquered more than 90% of the world known to their civilizations in their lifetime. Alexander the Great is called such by numerous references in history, and the most recent biography calls him likewise. Alexander the Great was also reverenced as a god...present tense: i.e., during his own lifetime. That most recent biography (circa 2004 or so) also rather quietly states that <i>Julius Caeser</i>, of Kaiser/Czar name-taking fame, lamented that at the age Alexander the Great <i>died</i> at, he himself had achieved no notable successes at that time in his life...and that Alexander's name, when checking records, seems to be known to over 75% of the world that has writing, a mark surpassed perhaps only by Jesus Christ.

<dd>....First of all, to say that the term 'known world' is 'POV' is absolutely silly, and a misunderstanding of the POV policy. 'Known world' means whatever it means within the context it is used. When we say Alexander conquered most of the 'known world' of COURSE we mean the world known to the Greeks, and nobody who stops and thinks for a moment would think otherwise. There is no such thing as an 'Ancient Greek POV'. <b>Especially</b> in an Ancient Greece article. In response to Warbola, the 'known world' for the Greeks at the time very much did include those areas around the Indus river (not sure where you get the idea that this is 'absurd', since it was Alexander's plan all along to conquer these areas...). Can we please read some sources before throwing around statements like 'This is POV' or 'this is totally absurd'? --<a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 04:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alexander was careful to differentiate the difference between Greek and Macedonian, and further differentiated among different types of Greeks. Arrian writes that Alexander was lenient with Thebans in later years given that their city had been destroyed. Curtius (and, to a lesser extent, Arrian) cite Alexander as having made different appeals to his troops based on whether they were of Greek or Macedonian origin. Furthermore, per my recollection Thucydides did not consider the Macedonians to be Hellenes at all. So clarifying "non-Macedonian, non-Greek" in context makes perfect sense.71.131.214.215 06:24, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I just wanted to make a clarification. Alexander is not mentioned in the Arthashastra. Actually, Alexander is not mentioned anywhere in an ancient Indian source. He only comes into parlance after the Turkish Invasions (Sikandar). In fact, the only Greek ruler to campaign in India who was mentioned in an ancient Indian source is Menander. Nevertheless, with respect to furthering this effort, there does exist a pali transliteration of Alexandria (presumably Alexandria-Kapisa or Eschate), which is Alasanda. I just wanted to point that out. I can provide sources to note these points as well.</p>

<dd>I think that a link to <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudo.html" title="Shudo">Shudo</a> would be a bit outside the remit of an article on Alexander the Great, but I have linked the phrase "love of beautiful youths" to the article on <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">pederasty in ancient Greece</a>, which provides information about the context of pederasty in Alexander's time and culture. There has been controversy on this page in the past about categorizing Alexander's sexuality; however, this should be non-controversial, because the link is not saying that Alexander's relationships with Hephaestion and Bagoas were necessarily pederastic or sexual — merely pointing out the context. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 20:18, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That very same word, "peder", is also very often used in Croatia, Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia (don't know about Slovenia, but I'd say in Slovenia too) as "politically incorect" word for male gay/homomosexual, something like fag in english.

<p>With the recent attempts to put Alexander's name in Macedonian into the lead, I'm wondering if we should move or delete the list of Alexander's names in different languages. To me, it doesn't seem like the first paragraph should be telling us what Alexander is called in Aramaic. The list could either be moved to a section of the article, or just be removed. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 20:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having Alexander's name in the languages that were spoken by the people of his Empire, is relevant enough. But having his names in languages other than them, is simply unhistorical... Under the pretext of including "Macedonian" we should include Bulgarian (well, it is the same, but some, pity, will disagree...), Romanian, Roma, Turkish, Uzbek, Tourkmen, and a gazillion more... Not to mention that i have suspicions about the reasons to insert the name in the language of FYROM (everyone can guess what i suspect). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 20:38, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Although I do appreciate the efforts of the creator of this map to posit Alexander's empire in context, I do want to note that the eastern borders of Alexander, as represented here, are inaccurate. All other maps show Alexander's eastern limit as the Beas in the North and Sindh in the South. This map shows his borders inaccurately extending well into India to include Indian Punjab, Rajasthan, and Kutch. Please let me know if you have any questions. I would appreciate it if these changes could be.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Devanampriya</p>
<dl>
<dd>This map is precisely sourced from The Loeb Classical Library, Arrian, "Anabasis of Alexander", Harvard University Press. It indeed shows the easternmost expansion of Alexander to the Beas (Hyphasis). The eastern expansion in the south follows the ancient course of the Indus, which went farther east than today (same source, and al.). <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 06:55, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It is not properly executed as there are plenty of Alexander maps that counter that. Also, I don't believe I denied expansion to the beas, but you are off the mark with Rajasthan. Since you are precisely sourcing from this book, could you post a relevant quote? I believe instead of engaging in pointless debate, it would only make sense to observe the conventions recognized by the vast majority of maps. Moreover, it is internally inconsistent, thereby confusing the reader. Let us avoid original research and stick to the recognized authorities. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevanampriya_2a4e.html" title="User:Devanampriya">Devanampriya</a> 20:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again unwarranted accusations I am afraid. I suggest you buy the book and check the map, it is exactly as the one I drew. Then we can discuss. If Harvard University Press is not a recognized authority, then I don't known what is. You can also check more closely the other map in the article: <a href="../../../m/a/c/Image%7EMacedonEmpire.jpg_7332.html" title="Image:MacedonEmpire.jpg">Image:MacedonEmpire.jpg</a>, it is near identical. <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 21:04, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>PHG, if our past discussions demonstrate anything, we must exercise caution regardless of the source. Please do not hide behind the respectable name of Harvard University Press, which after all, published and did not author the book. Tarn was published by cambridge, and i believe we've already gone over his infallibility. Regardless, the request was for a direct quote stating that the Indus river's path was hundreds of miles off course, cutting into Rajasthan. In fact, there is a strong possibility that this was mistaken for the Sarasvati, which recent satellite imagery confirmed its path through Rajasthan. Hence my request for the quote. Again, this contradicts the two other maps on the page. And the two maps are not near identical, let alone identical. You may want to take a look at a modern map to confirm this. This question/s are warranted, so let's not cut off the discussion.</p>

<p>This article certainly contains many interesting facts about Alexander, and its length ensures that most people would learn something by reading it.</p>
<p>However, according to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">GA criterias</a>, everything that is challenged or likely to be challenged must be referenced, in an unambiguous style such as inline references. The article fails this criteria in several places. I have collected some unsourced and possibly questionable statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Alexander hurled his goblet at Attalus shouting "What am I, a bastard then?"</i></li>
<li><i>Alexander remarked "Here is the man planning on conquering from Greece to Asia, and he cannot even move from one table to another."</i></li>
<li><i>(it is believed he was treating the wounded and burying the dead, both of his own troops and of the enemy).</i> -- what does "believed refer to, who believed this?</li>
<li><i>The assassin was supposedly a former lover of the king, the disgruntled young nobleman Pausanias of Orestis, who held a grudge against Philip because the king had ignored a complaint he had expressed.</i> -- In particular, the word "supposedly" adds an element of ambiguation. Who was it that supposed?</li>
<li><i>Philip's murder was once thought to have been planned with the knowledge and involvement of Alexander or Olympias.</i> -- what does "once thought " mean exactly? Was it thought 2,000 years ago, or 1,000 years ago, or 50 years ago? Please use an inline reference.</li>
<li><i>In R. Lane Fox's opinion, the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world, such long-acting poisons were probably not available.</i> -- where can I verify this?</li>
<li><i>Some believe that Alexander said, "Kratisto" (that is, "To the strongest!") or "Krat'eroi" (to the stronger).</i> -- "some believe" needs referencing; who believed?

<p>The article stated the following: "Alexander, after the meeting with his officer Coenus, was convinced that it was better to return. Alexander was forced to turn south. Along the way his army ran into the Malli clans (in modern day Multan). The Malli were the most warlike clans in India during that period. Alexander's army challenged the Malli, and the ensuing battle led them to the Malli citadel, which the Malli successfully defended against him[10]. Alexander himself was wounded in the attack by a Malli arrow. Eventually, the Malli and Alexander made a truce and his army moved on, severely weakened by this battle[11]."</p>
<p>Neither source supports the above text, with the former (from the Baldwin Project) indicating both the taking of the citadel and a massacre of all Mallians within, and the latter stating that surviving Mallians surrendered to Alexander's forces. This is far from a successful defense and a simply truce.</p>
<p>Given this, I have changed the text to read thus: "Alexander, after the meeting with his officer Coenus, was convinced that it was better to return. Alexander was forced to turn south. Along the way his army ran into the Malli clans (in modern day Multan). The Malli were the most warlike clans in India during that period. Alexander's army challenged the Malli, and the ensuing battle led them to the Malli citadel. During the assault, Alexander himself was wounded seriously by a Malli arrow. His forces, believing their king dead, took the citadel and unleashed their fury on the Malli who had taken refuge within it [10]. Following this, the surviving Malli surrendered to Alexander's forces, and his beleaguered army moved on [11]."</p>
<p>I'm a new user, and I apologize if I have unwittingly broken any conventions with my first interaction here. I have enjoyed studying Alexandros for years, and am looking forward to debating and discussing his life and works objectively and lucidly with y'all. I think it goes without saying that his was a very interesting life, whose details and facts were left in woefully short supply for us.</p>

<p>There is definitely no true source in Arabic that calls Alexander the Great as "Dhul-Qarnayn" (the two-horned one). This statement is false. Dhul-Qarnayn is a great prophet in islam who roamed the earth to spread goodness and diminish evil-doers. There is no actual or historical connection between the two. Alexander the Great is called "Aliskander Almakadoni" which simply means (Alexander of Macedonia). Can somebody change it please beacause i don't know how.</p>

Taking this into consideration this removes Alexander as a candidate for Dhul-Qarnayn as it is well known that Alexander was a man who followed the Hellenistic traditions of Greece making him a polytheist not a monotheist." Thus Alexander the great is not Dhul-Qarnayn in Islam because of a simple and fundimental reason which is Dhul-Qarnayn believes in God(Allah) only. And even if muslims call him so that does not make the name of Alexander the Great, Dhul-Qarnayn, beacause islam is a religion while arabic spoken by arab (muslims, christians and others) is a language. So muslims everywhere arab and non-arab can call him what ever they want but as a christian I know that Alexander the Great is called "Al-Iskander Al-Makadoni" in arabic, we studied it in schools we read it in arabic encyclopedias and others.

<p>I need the source, please. "Throughout the Roman world, the one language spoken everywhere was Alexander's Greek". It sounds a bullshit... <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_94a8.html" title="User:Jack">Jack</a> 00:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)<br /></p>

<dd>Yep, I second your point Jack - the Language the Romans used and 'respected' was Latin. Even if Greek was used, how can one call it, 'Alexander's Greek'?Dr.Ramanand 00:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>'Alexander's Greek' refers only to the type of Greek Alexander spoke, not to some ownership of the language. Also, Greek did not just go up in a poof of smoke when the Romans came along, and Latin was not the most used and respected language by the Romans. Quite the contrary. For one thing, learning Greek was a staple of any well educated Roman. Also, conquered Greece (which comprised most of what we would call the 'Roman world') kept their Greek language, and used it much more frequently than they did Latin. I can dig through my books to find a citation for you, but I haven't the time at the moment, though just about any book on Roman history should mention this fact. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 15:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alexander's Greek is a metaphor to name the <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine.html" title="Koine">Koine</a>, since it was extended in his campaigns. So it is perfectly ok. Why not read before writing in such a way? Many questions would be answered... and I'm sure the majority of them aren't, as in this case, <i>bullshit</i> --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucephala_930d.html" title="User:Bucephala">Bucephala</a> 18:04, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, there was not one Indian account of the Alexander-Porus encounter. It is quite natural that Greek accounts glorified Alexander's foray into India. The episode of Ambhi (Omphis) must have been very true because many such self-destructing incidents, fuelled by envy and jealousy, happened in Indian history. Oliver Stone has projected a picture quite sympathetic to Porus. Does it have any historical evidence? There was a story that Rukshana (Roxana) visted Porus's tent the day before the battle and tied Rakhi to Porus's wrist (Rakhi is an Indian festival/tradition during which sisters tie a sacred thred to brothers' wrists seeking protection to their honour and family). During the battle Alexander fell down the horse wounded by an arrow from an Indian soldier. Porus jumped at him and raised the sword to Kill Alexander. While raising the hand he watched the Rakhi tied by Rukshana and overpowered by sentiment he left Alexander untouched. The Greek soldiers carried away the wounded Alexander to the camp. I do not know if this story had any historical support. Can anyone help with the sources?Kumarrao 15:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
