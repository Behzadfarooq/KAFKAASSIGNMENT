<p>It is sometimes claimed (mainly by <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrocentrists.html" title="Afrocentrists">Afrocentrists</a>) that Pushkin was black<a href="http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1605/Alexander_Pushkin_Black_Russian_poet_and_novelist" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1605/Alexander_Pushkin_Black_Russian_poet_and_novelist" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61906-2004May27.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61906-2004May27.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This claim is false. While Pushkin's great-grandfather <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abram_Gannibal_85b1.html" title="Abram Gannibal">Abram Gannibal</a> was black, all other ancestral lines of the poet consisted of whites, and thus Pushkin was no more than 1/8 black. US Afrocentrists by the <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One-drop_rule.html" title="One-drop rule">one-drop rule</a></i> might still claim Pushkin as "<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colored.html" title="Colored">colored</a>", but that is an issue of US, not Russian sociology, and doesn't change the numbers of one African great-grandparent vs. seven Eurasian ones.</p>
<p>Sir, were not his parents first or second cousins(both descended Gannibal)? If so, then I would think that would one-quarter African(a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadroon.html" title="Quadroon">quadroon</a>)? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnglius_e80b.html" title="User:Anglius">Anglius</a> 21:18, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Even <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullato.html" title="Mullato">mullato</a> is considered inappropriate in English-speaking countries for the implication that the "half-breed" is a mule. It's just as easy to use "1/8th", "1/4", "an eighth" or "a quarter".

<p>It isn't maninly claimed by Afrocentrics, many scholars claim it... in fact, it is taken to be common knowledge that Pushkin was, indeed, part black, and referred to himself as such on many occasions. He once said (concerning enslaved Africans in America): "I feel very deeply for my Negro brothers." He also made many reference to being of African descent in his novel "The Blackmoor of Peter the Great" and was known to be very proud of his Abyssinian (Ethiopian) great-grandfather.</p>
<p>where does it say that he identified as a "negro"? was that word even in use in russia during that time period? he was part black, and we all know, but let's not ignore the other ⅞ of his heritage. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColorfulharp233_3624.html" title="User:Colorfulharp233">Colorfulharp233</a> 01:07, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a longtime member of a Pushkin book club, I was surprised to read of Pushkin's ancestor being Eritrean.I think, it would be most enlightening if the contributor shares his reference.Most of the authorities I am aware of refer to an Abyssinian or just African. Eritrea had yet to come into existence-for another few hundred years. ironinmohscale September8, 2006.</p>
<p>The correct translation of the book was "The Moor of Peter the Great." Which is basically like saying "arab". He was part African but whether he was "black" is questionable. His mother doesn't look very black, that's for sure. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnham_36c9.html" title="User:Ernham">Ernham</a> 01:30, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The argumentative note about A S Pushkin's "racial" background is gratuitous and racist. His African great-grandfather was clearly important to Pushkin himself (he started to write a historical novel about the man), so claiming that others' attention to the same subject is somehow unwarranted is specious.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you. I agree.</p>

<li>No it was not the fatal duel with d'Anthes occured in 1837 and is already mentioned in the list of duels.

<p>The comments related to Nabokov's translation of <i>Onegin</i> in the current (19 December 2005) article, in my opinion, do not exemplify proper encyclopedic style. Does anyone else think a more objective revision of the following passage is needed?</p>
<p><i>"</i>Onegin <i>is a work of such complexity that, while only about a hundred pages long, it required translator Vladimir Nabokov four full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English. Unfortunately, in so doing Nabokov, like all translators of Pushkin into English to date, totally destroyed the fundamental readability of Pushkin in Russian which makes him so popular, and Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers."</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a "general" comment in this vein. When I took Russian in college our teacher said that Pushkin is considered equivalent to Shakespeare in talent. She also said that his mastery of the language is <i>so</i> great that, unfortunately, no one has been able to do it justice in any translation into any other language. This was a professor of literature (Mary Emery of Hofstra University) who was <i>fluent</i> in Russian, Serbo-Croation (Yugoslavian), French, German, English <i>and</i> Italian and had two Ph.D's and three Master's Degrees in various fields. Given her comment, It sounds like the above description <i>is</i> accurate.

<dd>Well, Nabokov was fluent in Russian (he was born there, after all), English and French, and is widely acclaimed to be one of the finest writers of the 20th century, so I'm not sure why your professor should be taken as a greater authority than he is. I think the term "totally destroyed" is really loaded here; Nabokov's intent wasn't to make a poetical translation, but a literal one; he aimed to translate the meaning of each word of the Russian original as closely as possible into English, without preserving the rhyme. It's obviously not what one would experience upon reading it in Russian, but that wasn't his intent, and indeed he himself more or less admitted it was impossible to do. (See his famous "Reply To My Critics" in the book Strong Opinions.) So I wouldn't say that his translation is one of "destruction", which definitely would seem to have a negative connotation in this context, but rather a literal translation that didn't concern itself with the poem's poetry. The reference to "four full volumes" is also a bit misleading or perhaps misinformed; the actual translation only took up a small portion of the first volume; the rest was commentary. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrailgesture_47c6.html" title="User:Frailgesture">Frailgesture</a> 05:59, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fyodor Dostoevsky in his novel, "The Brothers Karamazov", repeatedly alleges that Pushkin had a foot fetish. For an example of these allegations, see Book 11, Chapter 2 of "The Brothers Karamazov."</p>

<p>Hi, I would like to add an external link to the World of Biography entry Probably the most famous portal of biography to this article. Does anybody have any objections? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jameswatt (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJameswatt_2bb2.html" title="User talk:Jameswatt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jameswatt_cb2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jameswatt">contribs</a>) 14 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Note: This user has added similar requests to link to biographies hosted on the same site to about 50 different articles. Although I believe that these requests were made in good faith, adding the links to all of the articles would be spamming. In addition, the biographies tend to be not very insightful and/or minimally informative, and the webpages contain Google AdSense links.</dd>
<dd>A fuller explanation of my own opinion on these links can be found <a href="../../../t/2E/_/Talk%7ET._S._Eliot_3dee.html#External_link" title="Talk:T. S. Eliot">here</a>, if anyone wishes to read it.</dd>

<p>This article has been delisted as <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a>, because not all major topics are covered. For instance, Pushkin has had a considerable influence on other writers and poets, like <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Lermontov_46b6.html" title="Mikhail Lermontov">Mikhail Lermontov</a>. Pushkin still exerts a considerable influence on Russians, and was voted number 2 of most influential Russians after Peter the Great, but before Lenin. Furthermore, both the biography and the literary legacy are very limited for a person on whom several books of more than 300 pages each could be written. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 12:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
