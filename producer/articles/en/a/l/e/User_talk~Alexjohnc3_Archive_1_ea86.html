<p>HI Alexjohnc3, I nabbed this nifty info box from the Digimon wikiproject, we could turn it into a good tool. Right now it has digimon stuff on it, but that can give us ideas, and help us out. Heres the template: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Somerset219/sandbox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Somerset219/sandbox" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. If you could tell as many people as possible, that would be great. Perhaps we could replace the existing one at some point. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 08:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">re: Encyclopedia Dramatica question</span></h2>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how you found <i>me</i>, in your quest to determine the truth about the ED article, but I hope I can tell you what you need to know. It does, indeed, come down to those two policies: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The basic problem is that there's no secondary source saying anything substantive about Encyclopedia Dramatica. The site simply hasn't been documented by independent writers. If we're going to apply the same standards to websites that we apply to other organizations, companies, individuals, etc, then we can only report information that's been reported already by some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. That's the basic argument for deletion. If some media coverage arises, or if someone doing a scholarly work on Internet culture or something decides to document ED, then we can use that source to write an article, until then, we've got nothing to work with.</p>
<p>Does that answer your question? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 08:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FYI: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VERIFY#Self-published_and_dubious_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VERIFY#Self-published_and_dubious_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RS#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RS#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. In the normal course of events the amount of coverage ED has received from your analysis would, in my opinion, merit an article. However, ED is not the normal course of events from a wiki point of view. I would advise you to approach the subject with caution, work with established editors to gain consensus before taking any action, and, particularly, to pay close attention to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_MONGO_Proposed_decision_f183.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO/Proposed decision</a>, where ED is a central topic. The ArbCom decisions may have a significant bearing on this subject. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 17:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>MONGO threatened to block you for what he perceived as trolling, which I take to mean pushing a contentious conversation (on a subject which he is particularly sensitive about) to a point of provocation. He did clearly warn you, which is rather better than finding yourself blocked out of the blue without knowing why. And he didn't block you anyway.</p>
<p>ED is different because it attacks wikipedia and its editors, which tends to make them somewhat aggrieved towards it and therefore not want to include it in wikipedia. This doesn't mean it will never get included. It just means people aren't going to be falling over themselves to do so, and, if possible, will exclude it. The situation is made worse by the fact that ED, like some other sites critical of wikipedia, exposes private and personal details of wiki editors/admins, when it can find them out. This can be embarrassing or even dangerous, as admins have received death threats on occasion, and the transition from online to RL harrassment can occur. Jeopardy to a person's job is another possible outcome.</p>
<p>P.S. If an admin threatens to block you if you continue to post about a certain subject on their talk page, it is prudent not to continue to post on their talk page about that subject. And who ever said it was going to be easy?</p>

<dd>AGF doesn't mean you can't use common sense. If someone is clearly irritated, back off and let things calm down. MONGO is probably the worst person to talk to about ED out of thousands of editors, so choose someone else. I can't tell you exactly what ED said/revealed about MONGO. It might have been address and phone number amongst other things. It's probably on ED still. There's a similar site <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Review_04e8.html" title="Wikipedia Review">Wikipedia Review</a> (see the non-article talk page); as regards them, check out <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:Katefan0</a>. Somehow or another another similar site <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> does have an article.</dd>
<dd>As MONGO said, the result of the AfD was that ED didn't have sufficient verifiable notability to justify an article, and this is the bottom line. However, it does seem to be getting it now, and when there is enough, then doubtless there will be an article about ED.</dd>
<dd>Rules have a certain elasticity and also they have to be interpreted. Besides which, wiki doesn't exactly have rules. It has policies, guidelines, consensus and established practice etc. The amazing thing is that it manages to create an encyclopedia.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your question to Mongo</span></h2>
<p>It's perfectly normal to delete the talk page of a deleted page. And as for the protection, well it's hard to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">believe</a> that that's a genuine question from someone who innocently and genuinely is wondering and has no intent to harass and annoy another user. I'll give you a little piece of advice it you want to avoid being blocked for disruption and harassment. If someone deletes something from his own talk page, assume that he has read it and do <b><big>NOT</big></b> attempt to repost it. If you are sufficiently familiar with Wikipedia to be able to check logs and know <i>who</i> deleted or protected a particular page, then you are also have sufficient knowledge to be able to work out for yourself why the page you refer to was deleted and protected, whether or not you agree with the decision. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:23, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having looked more carefully, I see that your second edit was not replacing something that MONGO had removed (although your first one was), so I apologize for using rollback when reverting you, and also for threatening to block you.

<dd>Is it normal for someone to say, "deleted more garbage about that piece of shit website and the jerks who contribute there,"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88007019" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88007019" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> in an edit and then delete and protect a talk page about the article relating to the discussion (hence my question)? Please don't threaten to block me, I'm harassing anyone, I was asking why he felt the need to do that. I don't understand what you mean by "well it's hard to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">believe</a> that that's a genuine question from someone who innocently and genuinely is wondering and has no intent to harass and annoy another user," I have no intent to annoy anyone, it's actually others who are annoying me. I think I may have reposted a comment I made that was removed from MONGO's talk page before, sorry, I'll make sure not to do that again though if my comments are ever removed from someone's talk page. Thanks for the advice! No, I don't know why it was deleted, and yes, I do know how to view the logs. Could you tell me why if you have a chance?

<dd>Regarding the "piece of shit" quotation, I don't ever personally use that language, but I think I'm the unusual one there, not MONGO. One thing I can say is that if I <i>did</i> use that kind of language, I would use it if provoked the way MONGO has been. To answer your question, that particular website has made, and still makes, some extremely vile and disgusting attacks on several Wikipedians. MONGO is one of the victims, but by no means the only one. This case has led to a lot of nastiness and ill feeling on Wikipedia, and has also involved attempts to obtain MONGO's IP address. I was not really aware of this when it was going on (actually, it's still going on), but the article about that website was deleted. Frankly, it's not notable enough to justify keeping it when it's being used to attack, intimidate, and harass. The arbitration committee has ruled that it is an attack site, and that links to it should be removed. In other words, <i>we don't want to give it extra publicity; we don't want to increase its traffic.</i> Unfortunately, there are some people here at Wikipedia who are more than happy to publicize the site in the full knowledge of the extremely low and insulting jokes made on that site about individual people being fat or having had sex-change therapy or other such inappropriate attempts at humour. Suffice it to say that I do not have a high opinion of such people. I am a member of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_English_Society_737b.html" title="Queen's English Society">Queen's English Society</a>. As it happens, I do not state that or link to its website on my user page. But, if I did, and I subsequently discovered that the QES was making very inappropriate jokes about, say, black people, I would remove the links immediately, and I would support any other Wikipedians who were trying to remove such links. I would <i>certainly</i> not have a section on my user page giving a little plug for the site, saying that it was unfairly removed from Wikipedia, and getting round an ArbCom ruling by linking to other sites that linked directly to the offending site. Simply put, my sense of solidarity for the people attacked in such a vile way would be <i>far</i> greater than any wish I had to link to such a site.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the article was deleted, and decent people are helping to remove links. Some less (to my mind) decent people are protesting this, and are also protesting the deletion of the article. There's nothing irregular in deleting the talk page of a deleted article, and it's particularly appropriate if trolling is continuing on the talk page (as was the case here).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to my threat to block you — I do apologize for that. I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88052407&amp;oldid=88046183" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88052407&amp;oldid=88046183" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit summary, which accused MONGO of vandalism, and saw that it had been rolled back by an admin. For the record, you should <i>not</i> replace comments that a user has removed from his talk page; that is regarded as harassment. If he has removed them, you know that he has seen them. Anyway, I then saw that you had posted again. I clicked on <i>that</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88053065&amp;oldid=88052760" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88053065&amp;oldid=88052760" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, saw that it was yet <i>another</i> post on a subject that I know MONGO does <i>not</i> want messages about. I assumed that that was what you had reinstated the first time (with the very wrong edit summary that accused MONGO of vandalism), and so I rolled you back.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I should have looked more carefully before jumping to conclusions. If you had not made that first edit in which you reverted MONGO's own removal of unwanted posts and threads from his own talk page (bearing in mind that he has been the victim of some pretty atrocious trolling), I would not have reverted your second edit. If I had looked more carefully, and had not assumed that the second edit was the same as the first, I might still have removed it, but would not have used rollback. That said, it's quite obvious that MONGO does not want those posts on his talk page, regardless of the intentions of those who have posted them. I will rephrase what I said by saying that I am prepared to block <i>anyone</i> who, knowing that MONGO has been trolled and harassed, keeps posting stuff about that website on his talk page, or starts following him to other articles, as another user was doing recently.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am glad that you have removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88097624" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88097624" rel="nofollow">this</a>. In fact, I was going to ask you to do so. It would probably be a good idea to stay away from MONGO for the moment. If you dislike something that he writes, bear in mind that he has had a lot of provocation, and that the contents of your user page are unlikely to make him regard you as someone of good will. You are free to request a deletion review for the talk page that he deleted, but I would strongly advise against it. Administrators are unlikely to agree to undelete something that breeds trolling and harassment, and you're unlikely to get consensus. Also, it may stir up a lot more ill will. We've had more than enough, and if you think of the <i>spirit</i> of the ArbCom ruling about removing links, you'll see that the more trusted members of Wikipedia do not want this trolling and harassment to continue. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 02:17, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your thoughtful comments! ^_^ I'll get back to this as soon as I can, but I've got a lot of work for school. I would like to mention quickly that I wasn't trying to get around the ArbComm decision, but rather to provide a source of information on ED since it was what I was writing about on my userpage. I made the note so that people wouldn't accidentally believe that I was somehow "linking to ED" or that I wasn't following any of the other decisions made by ArbComm. I also didn't notice (somehow 0_o) that it was on his user talk page, so I apologize for the revert. I saw that he locked and deleted the ED talk page, but I'm not sure where I thought that comment was made. I guess I just saw the edit summary in his contributions (I was wondering if he had done anything else besides lock &amp; delete the talk page, which is how I found out that he tried to ban a friend that I know through ED indefinately) and I must have just decided to revert it. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 03:56, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I've read your comment (before I just scanned it), so I'll address all the points you made excluding those already addressed in my previous message. First of all, you should know that wikis have a wide range of content. Some articles are very informative on Encyclopedia Dramatica, while most are not. There are some that are very offensive or somewhat offensive, but that is no reason to prevent any links or content that may be useful from being put on Wikipedia. It <i>does</i> make sense, however, to say that no links to pages that on ED that attack Wikipedians will be allowed. Regardless of its notoriety, it's still notable and it is <i>not</i> an attack site by nature, it's a site about <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_memes.html" title="Internet memes">Internet memes</a> and drama, basically. Some <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_Archive_1_ea86.html#Some_ED_info_if_you.27re_curious" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3/Archive 1">examples</a> include those posted by an anonymous user on my talk page. Now back to your analogy, I am a member at ED (I created my account after I found out about this going on via Wikipedia), but I, personally, don't like ED that much, for many of the same reasons you and others (like MONGO) don't. Unlike with your association with the QES, I don't have much of an attachment to ED. I just think that it has been removed on Wikipedia by biased editors who feel that just because it happens to be offensive to some people on Wikipedia, including MONGO, who think they should be able to completely remove anything relating to it. A good example is the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> article. They much more well known for causing havoc and being offensive than ED, yet they have an article. They attempt to insult homosexuals and African-Americans in their name alone and if you visit their website, I suggest you don't click on the "members" link. If I had an article made about me on ED that attacked me, I wouldn't even consider removing references to it on Wikipedia. I might add to the article that it is infamous for making attacks on people, but I wouldn't try to get rid of it.</dd>

<dd>Removing links to it on people's own userpages is not being a "decent person", it's just vandalism that can't be reverted. If it's the norm to delete talk pages of deleted articles, then why does it say, "Restoration can be discussed on the talk page or at Deletion Review." I'll continue later on. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 21:59, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently you and MONGO have it out for ED, especially after reading your comment on the DRV (in which you felt the need TO USE ALL CAPS FOR SOME REASON). I've had enough of the crap coming from people like you who feel they can abuse their privileges as administrators. I would like you to stay away from me and that's especially true for MONGO who has made multiple edits to my userpage without my permission, though he knows much better than to do that. Now go away and play in some traffic. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 02:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On another note, I can't believe I tried to apologize to MONGO. I hate it when I try to be nice to people who are too arrogant to even realize their mistakes. Oh well, that's what I'd expect from someone like him. I guess I'm just not used to people like MONGO; I've had more experience with the religiously crazy than the power/censorship/anti-criticism crazy type. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 02:09, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't throwing around the word vandalism. The <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> policy clearly states, "Deleting the comments of other users from Talk pages other than your own, aside from removing internal spam, vandalism, etc. is generally considered vandalism," and I was not violating any of the exceptions to this rule. I'm not assuming that the removal of my comment was meant to be harmful either, nevertheless, it was vandalism. As for the "established user" remark, I could care less about who is and who is not an "established user". I consider new users equal to users who have been on Wikipedia for long periods of time, so I think "established" users should be given just as much notice about their actions as new users should, though you may have different views. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 21:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it wasn't meant to be intimidating at all. I've seen him edit a few times and been treated unfairly, so I was just trying to be nice.

<p>Hi there, After seeing your edit, I see your point; however, I am inclined to revert the edit because the section in question (Argument in favor of United States sovereignty) describes such a fringe position that I didn't want to create a POV problem by giving it <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">undue weight</a>. As such, I noted that "a small minority" believes thus. Let me know if I have misunderstood. Thanks.Ngchen 02:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fine, I just thought that it seemed a bit POV to say a "small minority" at the time, but it's fine with me if you want it that way though. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">(talk)</a></sup> 00:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
