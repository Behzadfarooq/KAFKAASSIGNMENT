	    <p><b>Alex Ramos</b> (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>) is a former <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxer</a> from the 1980s who was a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middleweight.html" title="Middleweight">middleweight</a> of note. A native of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan%2C_New_York_f91a.html" title="Manhattan, New York">Manhattan, New York</a>, he is <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> by his parents' side. He was nicknamed "The Bronx Bomber", after <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Louis_8f6d.html" title="Joe Louis">Joe Louis</a>, whose nickname was "The Brown Bomber".</p>
<p>Ramos won four New York state <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gloves_77be.html" title="Golden Gloves">golden gloves</a> championships. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he knew a guy named <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Lugo_69c4.html" title="Alberto Lugo">Alberto Lugo</a>, who started to pose as Ramos around Ramos' neighborhood. This would affect Ramos later on in life.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Ramos_e92f.html" title="Edit section: Professional boxing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional boxing career</span></h2>
<p>Ramos began his professional boxing career on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">November 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> by defeating Steve Arvin by a fifth round <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knockout.html" title="Knockout">knockout</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stateline%2C_Nevada_072a.html" title="Stateline, Nevada">Stateline, Nevada</a>.</p>
<p>Ramos won his first five fights by knockout. These bouts included four fights in the eastern <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and one in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_New_York_b662.html" title="Syracuse, New York">Syracuse, New York</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Snyder_b93b.html" title="Dan Snyder">Dan Snyder</a> became the first boxer to go the scheduled distance with Ramos, who beat Snyder by a six round decision.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, Ramos had his first professional fight abroad when he beat Donnie Long by an eight rounds decision in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Remo_92d1.html" title="San Remo">San Remo</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. His next fight, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_21.html" title="June 21">June 21</a> of the same year, marked his <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_City%2C_New_Jersey_009e.html" title="Atlantic City, New Jersey">Atlantic City</a> debut, when he defeated Mike Sacchetti, also by an eight rounds decision. Ramos would fight in Atlantic City several times during his career.</p>
<p>Ramos won six more fights, including a victory over Norberto Sabater, before suffering his first loss, being knocked out in round eight by Ted Sanders on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> in Atlantic City. He then fought Tony Cerda to a ten round draw (tie) on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>.</p>
<p>After those two setbacks, however, Ramos became a ranked Middleweight by virtue of three straight victories, including a ten round decision over future world Light-Heavyweight champion <a href="../../../j/2E/b/J.B._Williamson_16d4.html" title="J.B. Williamson">J.B. Williamson</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a> in Atlantic City. Despite losing his next fight, against future world <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Middleweight_7980.html" title="Super Middleweight">Super Middleweight</a> champion Murray Sutherland by a ten round decision, Ramos was by then held along with the highest ranked Middleweights of the era, such as <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustafa_Hamsho_6763.html" title="Mustafa Hamsho">Mustafa Hamsho</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilford_Scypion_5c5a.html" title="Wilford Scypion">Wilford Scypion</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Roldan_6922.html" title="Juan Roldan">Juan Roldan</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mugabi_6d94.html" title="John Mugabi">John Mugabi</a>, Curtis Parker and others.</p>
<p>After knocking out Wilbur Henderson in three rounds on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> in Atlantic City, Ramos challenged Parker for his first career title, the regional, USBA Middleweight championship. He won the title by beating Parker over twelve rounds by a unanimous decision on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">April 25</a> of that year, in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>A world title fight against <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Hagler_7c7c.html" title="Marvin Hagler">Marvin Hagler</a> probably loomed ahead for Ramos after his victory over Parker. Many fans in the United States took interest in Ramos thanks in part to coverage by such magazines as the <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_Magazine_7546.html" title="Ring Magazine">Ring</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/_/KO_Magazine_0c52.html" title="KO Magazine">KO</a>, and his career was also covered in Puerto Rico by newspapers such as <i><a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Nuevo_Dia_02aa.html" title="El Nuevo Dia">El Nuevo Dia</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Vocero_36d7.html" title="El Vocero">El Vocero</a></i>. A ten-round draw against fringe contender <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Collins_2342.html" title="John Collins">John Collins</a>, however, proved to be the first obstacle for that match to take place. The second, and arguably largest, obstacle for Ramos to challenge Hagler for the world Middleweight championship came when he lost his USBA Middleweight title, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, by a knockout in round nine against James Kinchen (who years later lost to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Hearns_8f94.html" title="Thomas Hearns">Thomas Hearns</a> over twelve rounds in a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Boxing_Organization_6a50.html" title="World Boxing Organization">WBO</a> world title bout) in Stateline.</p>
<p>In 1984, Ramos relocated to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottsdale%2C_Arizona_bd9b.html" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>.</p>
<p>After losing to Kinchen, Ramos got back on the contender's list by winning four out of his next five bouts, including a victory over J.J. Cotrell and one over former Hearns challenger Fred Hutchings, knoked out in five rounds on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockton%2C_California_81d3.html" title="Stockton, California">Stockton, California</a>.</p>
<p>This victory gave him a try for the California state Middleweight title, held by future world champion <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Nunn_d1ee.html" title="Michael Nunn">Michael Nunn</a>. The two boxers met on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a> in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reseda%2C_California_15ac.html" title="Reseda, California">Reseda</a>, with Nunn gaining a twelve round decision.</p>
<p>After winning two of his three next fights, and after Nunn had vacated the belt, Ramos got a second chance to win the California win. This time, he was knocked out in eight rounds by Tim Williams.</p>
<p>After another victory, Ramos got his third chance at the California Middleweight title, being outpointed by Alphonso Long after twelve rounds on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>.</p>
<p>Ramos won ten of his next twelve bouts over the next six years, finally earning him a try at a world Middleweight championship; on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">November 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, he fought <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_Castro_%28boxer%29_e0e1.html" title="Jorge Castro (boxer)">Jorge Fernando Castro</a> in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> for the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Boxing_Association_f582.html" title="World Boxing Association">WBA</a> world Middleweight title. Castro defeated Ramos by a second round knockout, after which Ramos retired for good.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Ramos_e92f.html" title="Edit section: Life after boxing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life after boxing</span></h2>
<p>Ramos began working in the sport of boxing doing other things inside the sport. In 1998, he established the Retired Boxers Foundation whose mission is to assist retired professional boxers in the transition from their glorious days in the ring to a dignified retirement. Among other celebrities who became involved in the organizations are <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Derek_454c.html" title="Bo Derek">Bo Derek</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Rooney_7dbd.html" title="Mickey Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolita_Davidovich_21ad.html" title="Lolita Davidovich">Lolita Davidovich</a>, Col. Bob Sheridan, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Shelton_1578.html" title="Ron Shelton">Ron Shelton</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Carville_fe32.html" title="James Carville">James Carville</a> and many others.</p>
<p>In February 1999, Alberto Lugo, whom Ramos had beaten in a street fight for posing as Ramos, was arrested and charged with assault of three women. When arrested, he told the police he was Alex Ramos. The alleged impostor was found guilty of both attempted and completed rape, sodomy and kidnapping. Ramos' private life was severely affected by the Lugo case: since police identified Lugo as Alex Ramos to the press hoping that more victims would step forward and identify Lugo as a rapist, many people actually believed Ramos to be a rapist. After Lugo was sentenced and publicly identified as Albert Lugo, however, Ramos' name was cleared from any rape suspicions.</p>
<p>Ramos relocated to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simi_Valley%2C_California_0092.html" title="Simi Valley, California">Simi Valley, California</a>, where he lived for a long period before returning to New York to begin the Retired Boxers Foundation. While in Simi Valley, he struggled with <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_drugs.html" title="Illegal drugs">drugs</a> and alcohol, but he was able to successfully recover from both addictions (<a href="http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0009/three.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0009/three.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).</p>
<p>Ramos had a professional boxing record of 39 wins, 10 losses and 2 draws, with 24 wins by knockout.</p>
