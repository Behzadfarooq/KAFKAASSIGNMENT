<dd>The symptoms, at least according to all the articles, point to the poisoning with radioactive thallium. The same exact symptoms were described by Nikolai Khokhlov, who was poisoned by KGB back in 1957. Since radioactive thallium quickly decays, the dosage quickly falls below toxic. However, the radiation and whatever remains after decay still wreck havoc on the body, but also make the antidote less effective.
<dl>
<dd>I would disagree that this is according to "all the articles". The newer ones are tending towards ruling out the thallium hypothesis in favour of pol-210. <a href="../../../w/_/g/User%7EW_guice_dd47.html" title="User:W guice">W guice</a> 21:52, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko fell suddenly ill while investigating the death of journalist Anna Politkovskaya. He had had lunch at Itsu, a sushi restaurant in Piccadilly. The female Italian journalist claimed to have information on the murder of Politkovskaya, 48, the outspoken journalist who was killed at her Moscow apartment in October 2006 - the Italian passed him papers on the Russian journalists fate.</p>

<p>This is a very big deal - to call Mr Litvinenko non-notable even without the possible poisoning is laughable, IMHO, but with the poisoning it could have very dramatic repercussions on foreign relations with Britain and Russia.

<p>The point of Wikipedia is to be a collaboration. Just because you don't think something has enough detail doesn't mean it's non-notable. That has nothing to do with the criteria by which you are attempting a speedy deletion. I will expand it, in due time, but I would remind that there's more to Wikipedia than deleting new content without searching for relevance - you could add to it too, especially since I gave you a list of news links (see above). I came here looking for more information and was surprised to see nothing. So I created a new page about this notable figure - that's how this is supposed to work, I thought. Something is certainly better than nothing - and in any case, it doesn't qualify for a speedy delete anyway. <a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuviya_fa69.html" title="User:Tuviya">Tuviya</a> 03:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On 1 January 1983, upon the coming into force of the British Nationality Act 1981, every Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies became either a British Citizen, British Dependent Territories Citizen or British Overseas Citizen.</p>
<p>The use of the term "British subject" was discontinued for all persons who fell into these categories, or who had a national citizenship of any other part of the Commonwealth.

<dd>I'm well aware of that as I stated. However the fact remains, the license these photos are released under is uncertain. As I've stated, they'll almost definitely qualify as fair use IMHO because they're effectively promo photos (in a way, the term promo might sound offensive in this context but they're similar in many regards) and they're also unlikely to be reproducible. However until and unless we can get a suitable license, we can only use them under fair use IMHO. That's why I urge someone to contact the family at some stage and politely and carefully try and get the images released under a suitable license. This may or may not be possible. Bear in mind the family may not be willing given our requirements which prohibit no derivatives and no commercial use restrictions. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:29, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I removed the radioactive thallium bit, as its seemed unlikely to me. I have since seen an AFP release which repeats the speculation, 'citing' an unnamed British toxicologist. As I chemist, I still feel that it is doubtful: if you wanted to kill someone by radiological means, you would not choose thallium to do it: thallium is quite capable of killing someone on its own without bothering to produce a sufficient quantity of the radioactive version (much harder to handle and to administer). It seems like there is a certain amount of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinformation.html" title="Disinformation">disinformation</a> going on (compare with the death of <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yassir_Arafat_a0f2.html" title="Yassir Arafat">Yassir Arafat</a>).

<dd>Well I can read Russian and I can tell you that this an anti-terrorism law. The only part that refers to acting outside Russia is Article 10 "Use of Russian Armed Forces outside Russia for prevention of terrorist activities" that says that armed forces can be used to destroy terrorist bases abroad. The decision must be approved by the upper house of Russian parliament and the president. The decree must specify the number of servicemen, ther specific tasks etc. This law does not authorise secret killings abroad. Russian secret services (and I am sure other countries are not different) definitely do kill people abroad - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelimkhan_Yandarbiev#Assassination" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelimkhan_Yandarbiev#Assassination" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelimkhan_Yandarbiev#Assassination</a> but there is no LAW in Russia allowing that - that would be against international rules and laws.</dd>

Also see this <a href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/8D7E4632-7854-4683-89DA-FB4690795611.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/8D7E4632-7854-4683-89DA-FB4690795611.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. The paper says that ..."the draft law contains a number of controversial elements. One is a clause that allows Russia to eliminate suspected international terrorist targets beyond its borders, although the country's security services would be supposed to act within the terms of international treaties and agreements signed by Moscow." This law was also interperetd by Lev Ponomarev as a step toward creating a parallel FSB government.

<dd>Ilykhin also said that Putin's decree about creating the National Counterterrorism Committee inflates the role of the FSB to the degree that it "makes it a state within a state and a substitute for state functions and prerogatives." <a href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/e7f004b3-d982-4238-ba84-449ac6b5be2a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/e7f004b3-d982-4238-ba84-449ac6b5be2a.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:38, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Investigating" Politkovskaya's death?</span></h2>
<p>Any proof that Litvinenko was "investigating"? What kind of investigation could he possible have done if the murder occured in Moscow and he was outside Russia for the past 6 years? Can it really be called "investigation"? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.126.209.1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.126.209.1_f352.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.126.209.1">contribs</a>) 13:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Well it's been said he'd been told the day he got sick who the killer was. This info was supposedly going to be released when he got well. Since he has died, we can assume this info was passed to someone and will be release in due course, if there is anything really there. However this IMHO isn't too important. He has stated he was investigating the death and unless we have reason to believe this isn't true, then there is no point speculating. Whether or whether not he had any chance of successfully investigating her death without visiting Russia is an interesting question but not one for wikipedia, unless it's something that is raised in a reliable source. However I should point out that journalists have successful uncovered things in other countries relying solely on contacts and without visiting said countries <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't imagine Berezovsky having any "credibility".He ordered the assassinations of a few of his enemies,he supported the Chechen rebels,he always calls for the overthrow of the current goverment of Russia.Everybody knows that!Do you really think he's a nice guy?<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 12:15, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>had to realize, that both other party founders Sergej Juschenkow and Wladimir Golowljow were murdered, by the Kreml or by Beresowsky himself?</p>
<p>Boris Beresowski was a TV-Manager, so he choosed the slow public death of Alexander Litvinenko to destroy the image of Putin?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,450713,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,450713,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,450713,00.html</a></li>

<p>Though, Alexander Litvinenko was doing a recherche to the death aof Anna Politkovskaja.</p>

</ul>
<p>The recherche has to find out now, if Boris Beresowski has a contamination of Polonium 210, or - which forces within russia do not want a modern Kremel with - and of course why Anna Politkovskaja was murdered by the Kremel. Too many death peaople: Alexander Litvinenko, Sergej Juschenkow and Wladimir Golowljow, and Anna Politkovskaja.</p>
<p>If Boris Berezovsky would die as well, Vladimir Putin would be in hard conflicts.</p>
<p><br />
As Ivan Rybkin is a founder of the conservative party</p>

</ul>
<p>and a good Friend of Boris Beresowski, both contrahents of Putin, the motives of the death of Alexander Litvinenko maybe found in the relationsships of Ivan Rybkin to the Russian federation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsrat_der_Russischen_Föderation" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsrat_der_Russischen_Föderation" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsrat_der_Russischen_Föderation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Secretary of the federation is: 2001 - 2004 Wladimir Ruschailo, he has to be asked as well towards the topics, because his period ended as well with the beginning of putin.</p>
<p>Ivan Rybkin was the security-secretary of the russian federation and as well special-secretary for the Tschetschenien-war. He was called "Mr. Consens" so he made peace with them in a mute way - the opposite of Putin: a loud war. And this was as well the topic of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko: the war against Tschetschenien, which should be strategic product of "burning the house down"-Putin, in their eyes.</p>
<p>So the real focus is the nowerdays work of Ivan Rybkin.</p>

<p>The impression I'm getting from the BBC etc is that the doctors that were treating him now think it unlikely thallium or radiation is the primary cause.
