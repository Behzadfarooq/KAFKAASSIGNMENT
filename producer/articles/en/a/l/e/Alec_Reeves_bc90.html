	    <p><b>Alec Reeves</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">10 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a> - <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>) was a British scientist best known for his invention of <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse-code_modulation.html" title="Pulse-code modulation">pulse-code modulation</a> (PCM).</p>
<p>Reeves was born in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redhill%2C_Surrey_be93.html" title="Redhill, Surrey">Redhill</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>. His father Edward was surveyor to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Geographical_Society_77ec.html" title="Royal Geographical Society">Royal Geographical Society</a>.</p>
<p>Alec studied <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a> at <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_College_London_588b.html" title="Imperial College London">Imperial College London</a> and in 1923 joined <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Western_Electric_9599.html" title="International Western Electric">International Western Electric</a>, a leading manufacturer of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and telecommunications equipment. In 1925, the firm was taken over by Sosthenes Behn's International Telephone and Telegraph Company (<a href="../../../i/t/t/ITT_85d4.html" title="ITT">ITT</a>) and Reeves went to work at ITT's laboratory in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, LMT. Here he worked with engineers like Maurice Deloraine and Henri Busignies (who later developed the HF/DF - 'Huff Duff' - system for detecting enemy submarines). Reeves and his colleagues built the first radio-telephone links across the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> and the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>. Reeves also perfected the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condenser_microphone.html" title="Condenser microphone">condenser microphone</a> and made major advances in the use of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_sideband.html" title="Single sideband">single sideband</a> transmission for short-wave radio.</p>
<p>Reeves appears to have had an enjoyable time in Paris. He later claimed he had played in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Open_88c0.html" title="French Open">French Open</a> tennis championships - which were indeed 'open' to anyone who wished to participate. He is reported to have been seen on the roof of the LMT building conducting paranormal experiments - though one report said he was 'measuring moon-beams'. His private notebooks record a profound interest in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritualism.html" title="Spiritualism">Spiritualism</a> and regular communication with a ‘spirit guide’ - an American Indian called <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cloud_717c.html" title="Red Cloud">Red Cloud</a>. Reeves also told friends he was in constant communication with the nineteenth century scientist <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Faraday_1dd9.html" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Reeves_bc90.html" title="Edit section: Invention of pulse code modulation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Invention of pulse code modulation</span></h2>
<p>It was in Paris that Reeves had the idea that made him famous - and which helped shape the modern world. Since the invention of the telephone by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Graham_Bell_395d.html" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> in 1876, speech had been transmitted as a continuously varying wave of electrical energy. But 'analogue' systems have a big weakness: they amplify noise and errors as well as the original message. Reeves proposed a radical alternative. Instead of sending Bell's 'voice-shaped current', he proposed that the sound be sampled at regular intervals. The values of these samples would be represented by binary numbers and transmitted as unequivocal on-off pulses.</p>
<p>In principle, this was a return to the simple, robust technique used by the telegraph. Sending recognisable speech, however, meant that networks would have to carry millions of pulses a second, requiring a high (analogue) bandwidth of the transmission or storage system. Though Reeves' patent of 1937 showed how this might be done in theory, the valve-based technology of the time was not up to the job. <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse_Code_Modulation_0a19.html" title="Pulse Code Modulation">Pulse Code Modulation</a> would not be implemented economically until the invention of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a> decades later. But economy was not always a priority. PCM was first used by <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Labs_88bf.html" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs</a> for the complex and cumbersome radio system known as <a href="../../../s/i/g/SIGSALY_b427.html" title="SIGSALY">SIGSALY</a>, on which <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill.html" title="Churchill">Churchill</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> talked in total secrecy for much of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War 2</a>.</p>
<p>PCM was a very early invention in the history of electronics, only a few years after <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Armstrong_d4f4.html" title="Edwin Armstrong">Edwin Armstrong</a> had invented wideband <a href="../../../f/m/_/FM_ff94.html" title="FM">FM</a>, a method of high-quality radio broadcasting. Noise immunity and fidelity benefit because the sound signal is no longer stored as a delicate analogue signal but as a much more robust sequence of binary numbers. Because PCM is a method of representing an analogue signal in digital form, it is particularly well adapted to work directly with digital data-processing equipment.</p>
<p>In his 1937 patent, Reeves formulated the major advantages of digital PCM transmission, namely</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality depends <i>only</i> on conversion steps</li>
<li>Quality independent of transmission media</li>
<li>Compatibility with different media and traffic (video, audio, and data)</li>
<li>Low cost</li>
<li>New features can easily be embedded.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time, these conclusions required great foresight, as there are two essential assumptions implicit in the above characteristics. First, each quantized sample can be transmitted with arbitrarily small probability of error. It was not known in 1937 that this could be accomplished in theory; let alone that he, or others, knew about practical methods for achieving error-free transmission. There was no research on the topic of <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_correcting_code.html" title="Error correcting code">error correcting codes</a>. It would take another ten years and a world war before research on error free digital communication would take off. Second, he assumed that conversion from the analog to the digital domain, and vice versa, could be done, either in theory or practice, with arbitrary small accuracy by use of sufficiently frequent sampling, and by quantizing each sample with a sufficiently large number of levels. Early theoretical work by mathematicians had been published, but it appears that Reeves was unaware of that literature.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Reeves_bc90.html" title="Edit section: Work on radio navigation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Work on radio navigation</span></h2>
<p>Reeves escaped just in time when the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a> invaded <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> - reaching <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> on a coal boat but losing most of his possessions on the way. He soon entered the world of Scientific Intelligence, joining the team led by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Watson-Watt_9bde.html" title="Robert Watson-Watt">Robert Watson-Watt</a> and A P Rowe that was secretly developing <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a>.</p>
<p>Although a committed <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a>, Reeve accepted the need to defeat <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> - a task to which he contributed decisively. For in 1941, Britain faced a crisis. German bombs had reduced cities to rubble. But the invaders had been repelled and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> launched its own night bombing campaign against the factories that made the enemy's weapons and raw materials.</p>
<p>It was a disaster: British airmen had neither the experience or equipment to navigate 'blind' and bombs fell miles from their target. Defeat looked certain.</p>
<p>Asked to address the night navigation problem, Reeves proposed a novel solution. A pilot would reach his target by flying in an arc centred on a base station, called the 'Cat', and drop his bombs when he reached a precise distance from a second station - the 'Mouse'. An audible tone told him if he was deviating from the correct track and when someone said it sounded like an <a href="../../../o/b/o/Oboe.html" title="Oboe">Oboe</a>, the name stuck.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/b/o/Oboe_%28navigation%29.html" title="Oboe (navigation)">OBOE</a> was so precise that a bomb dropped from 30,000 feet could land within 50 yards of its target. In March 1943, OBOE-guided planes destroyed the mighty <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krupp.html" title="Krupp">Krupps</a> Works at <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essen.html" title="Essen">Essen</a> which made most of Hitler's steel and guns. On the eve of D-Day, OBOE destroyed nine of ten heavy guns that could have decimated the invading force. The RAF used OBOE in over 9,000 raids. Reeves' invention - the world's first remote-controlled bombing device - had altered the course, and perhaps the outcome, of World War 2. Nothing as accurate as this would exist until the days of the satellite and the laser.</p>

<p>In 1945 Reeves returned to <a href="../../../i/t/t/ITT_85d4.html" title="ITT">ITT</a>, working at Standard Telecommunications Laboratories on ways to increase the capacity and reliability of communications systems. He was a pioneer of semiconductor devices and among the first to exploit the possibility of using light to carry information. When '<a href="../../../w/a/v/Waveguide.html" title="Waveguide">waveguides</a>' - pipes carrying high-frequency signals - failed to work, Reeves thought of glass fibres. In the late 1960's, he inspired and led the team under <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Kao_2bbc.html" title="Charles Kao">Charles Kao</a> and George Hockham that created the world's first practical <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_fibre.html" title="Optical fibre">optical fibre</a> system.</p>
<p>Alec Reeves was a visionary who in the 1950s predicted that by the end of the 20th Century people would work from home, linked by optical fibre and receiving information over a screen.</p>
<p>But he had a less conventional side. He was deeply interested in the capacity and character of the human brain and, like earlier scientists such as <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Lodge_f0eb.html" title="Oliver Lodge">Oliver Lodge</a> (who demonstrated 'wireless' communication before <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marconi.html" title="Marconi">Marconi</a>) and <a href="../../../j/2E/j/J.J._Thomson_3436.html" title="J.J. Thomson">J.J. Thomson</a> (who discovered the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron.html" title="Electron">electron</a>), Reeves explored the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a>. For most of his life, he conducted ever more complex experiments using <a href="../../../g/e/i/Geiger_counter.html" title="Geiger counter">Geiger counters</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pendulum.html" title="Pendulum">pendulums</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronics</a> to measure the power of thought and to 'communicate' with the dead. He believed he was guided by the great <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Faraday_1dd9.html" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, who had died in 1867.</p>
<p>Alec Reeves can fairly be called 'Father' of the Information Age. Pulse Code Modulation is a method of translating an analogue, audio or video, signal into a digital representation. Without PCM, there would be no <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_radio.html" title="Digital radio">digital radio</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>, no <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_telephone.html" title="Mobile telephone">mobile telephones</a>, no <a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_4170.html" title="CD">CDs</a>, or <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVDs</a>.</p>
<p>He was awarded 82 patents<a href="http://www.quantium.plus.com/ahr/patents.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quantium.plus.com/ahr/patents.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, as well as a <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a>.</p>
