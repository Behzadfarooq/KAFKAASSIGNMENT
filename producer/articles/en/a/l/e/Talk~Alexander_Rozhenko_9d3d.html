<p>I have here that Alexander's birth year was 2359 rather than 2366. Both <a href="http://www.startrek.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.startrek.com/" rel="nofollow">StarTrek.com</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_Trek_Encyclopedia_7742.html" title="The Star Trek Encyclopedia">the Star Trek Encyclopedia</a> contradict themselves by giving the two different years in various places. I chose 2359 because it makes more sense. For example, Alexander fought with the Klingon Defense Force in 2374. If he had been born in 2359, this would make him fifteen years old (not an out-of-the-ordinary age for serving in the military, especially in warrior cultures such as the Klingon Empire); if he had been born in 2366, this would make him eight. -<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranddobbe_ccfd.html" title="User:Branddobbe">Branddobbe</a> 21:09, Mar 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>But the Stardate of his birth Alexander gives in New Ground places it clearly within the third season of TNG... therefore, 2366.</p>
<p>The relationships between <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardate.html" title="Stardate">stardates</a> and calendar dates is, in a word, flexible. It is not even absolutely established that stardates always run forwards, and there is definitely not an established-in-canon system for converting stardates to calendar dates. (For that matter, although it is almost universally assumed, it is to my knowledge not actually established in canon that events occur in the order in which episodes first aired.) Hanging an argument for a character's age at a certain point on a stardate, in the absense of any on-screen connection between that particular stardate and a particular calendar date, is tenuous at best. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a></p>
<p>Well, that's certainly true of the original series and broadly true of all Star Trek as well. But cannot we at least allow that since the Stardate of Alexander's birth corresponds exactly to the episode Booby Trap, that they must have happened at the same time? You can split hairs all you like, but it's plain that the writers had no intention for Alexander to have been born any time but during the third season of TNG (to say nothing of the clear subtext of The Emissay that Worf and K'Ehleyr had not consumated their relationship before that point -- hence Worf's insistence on the pledge of marriage as soon as they did).</p>
<p>With regard to this sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In order to try and rationalize Alexander's fast growth, some sources have suggested that he was actually born in 2359, however this is contradicted by the official biography for the character at startrek.com which gives the 2366 birthdate...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since when is startrek.com canon? In the Star Trek universe, only what appears onscreen is canon. If his birth date was not given on screen, then it is not known for certain. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a>, 2006 Mar 29.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that in Bloodlines the Alexander of the future says he was three years old when his mother died -- which works with neither of these dates!</p>
<dl>
<dd>The actor who played Alexander in "Reunion" was also the first "Quentin" in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_Under_Fire_86d9.html" title="Grace Under Fire">Grace Under Fire</a>. As he was six at the time I think I assumed that was Alexander's age. Although as young as three I guess could be possible.(What would that make his birth year 2361? The three figure I guess would be 2364 as in the first season) I don't think he could've been a year old when his Mom died as he walked and talked in the episode without difficulty. Maybe Klingon kids advance faster, but he's one-quarter human so that fast seems a bit unlikely. How does this square with him as a warrior in DS9? It doesn't. I remember in one interview a writer for DS9 sheepishly admitted he forgot Worf had a son and in DS9 he could be whatever age they needed. A similar phenomenon happens in soap operas where kids age or fail to age depending on plot concerns. Usually in soaps they go from 5, when they're still "cute", to around 16(when they can legally have romantic entanglements) over night. That's kind of what happened to Alexander except it's not a soap so it's more like he went from 10(so he could be a student) to adulthood overnight.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.
