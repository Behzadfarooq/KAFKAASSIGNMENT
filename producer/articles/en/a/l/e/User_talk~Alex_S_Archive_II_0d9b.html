<p>I played a while before I settled on a signature I liked. Easiest thing to remember is that your setting in your profile is added into your signature like this: [[User:Alex S|<font color="green">(your signature)</font>]] so you can spread it out like [[User:Alex S|<font color="green">Ale]][[User Talk:Alex S|x]][[User:Alex S| S</font>]]. (the parts in green are what go in your Preferences in the signature box. I want to contribute a tenis biographies section i have a username called Christopherhi, leave me a message about whether i can or not</p>
<p>It comes out like this: <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S"><font color="blue">Ale</font></a><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_S_751f.html" title="User talk:Alex S">x</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">S</a> (although since a page cannot link to itself you can't see the link from "x" to your talk page.)</p>
<p>For adding your signature to your comments use: ~~~ and for adding both your signature and the current date use: ~~~~.

<p>Why the hell did you modify my value modifications? Why are you calling them 'dumb'?? Are you crazy or something? There's no such thing as dumb, you think that you're smarter then me? Don't sabotage my information, it is useful to people who want to know, you're a close minded individual and it makes you whatever you call 'dumb'. Here is my mature message: FUCK YOU! SON OF A BITCH, I DONT CARE IF IM BEING BANNED OR NOT, IT WONT CHANGE YOUR STATE OF MORONITY! FUCKING MORON!</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, of course I don't want to ban you (unless you vandalize). I'd just like it if you could tone down your anger a little bit and also leave your message under a header at the bottom of the page (which I did for you, hope that's OK). Anyways, I'm not really sure what you're talking about. I did do some work the page <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value.html" title="Value">value</a>, but I never called anything dumb. I did use the word "dump" in one of my changes summaries – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Value&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Value&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">check the edit history here</a> – but I don't believe that I called anything dumb. Another thing that I don't understand is what you thing I "sabotaged" - I kept the "types of values" section – you were the one to delete it. If you would please tell me exactly what I did wrong and what I called dumb, I'm sure we can work this out. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Αλεξ</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_S_751f.html" title="User talk:Alex S">Σ</a> 14:40, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have agreed, as well as posted a few of my comments on talk:alternative medicine. I can live with alternative medicine being protected exactly the way it is for several weeks.

<dd>I think several weeks is excessive. The page protection should be removed as soon as possible. And also, I happened to protect it right after your revert, so it's not surprising that you'd agree with the version. I'm just asking oyu to be open minded about what RK will have to say.

<p>No worries about spelling. I prefer to fix others' work anyways, rather than developing my own new nodes. I'm used to e2's less stringent neutrality and style requirements.

<p>It's not so much that it's spelled wrong -- it's that undoubtedly is the only actual word, but "undoubtably" is a pseudo-word with a different meaning. So really, you can use either one. I just figured I'd show you the difference. -- <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMcCart42_fb5b.html" title="User:McCart42">McCart42</a></p>

<dd>Regarding your comment that this is not a "dispute" I think the goal of AMA members is to help an individual understand the system, not to necessarily "represent" them in an official capacity, but also to lend a guiding hand, communicate with them and try to explain the system to them.

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>Way back in March you turned the article <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker_views_of_sexuality.html" title="Quaker views of sexuality">Quaker views of sexuality</a> into a redirect to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_morality.html" title="Sexual morality">Sexual morality</a>, which seems odd since that article doesn't appear to have anything to say about Quakers. On the otherhand the original article looks relatively narrow. Was there some sort of general POV cleanup going on at the time? -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 09:13, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not POV; just reorganization. In that page (<a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker_views_of_sexuality.html" title="Quaker views of sexuality">Quaker views of sexuality</a>), the content was completely about homosexuality. What I did was move the content to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker_views_of_homosexuality.html" title="Quaker views of homosexuality">Quaker views of homosexuality</a>. That page is part of a series of articles on Christianity and homosexuality, which is in turn part of a series of articles on religion on homosexuality. Since for the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_morality.html" title="Sexual morality">sexual morality</a> page the content isn't broken down into specific pages for each religion, I thought the best thing would be to simply redirect, so that if a Quaker-sexuality expert began working on Wikipedia, he'd know where to go. If begun, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker_views_of_sexuality.html" title="Quaker views of sexuality">Quaker views of sexuality</a> would obviously include a link to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker_views_of_homosexuality.html" title="Quaker views of homosexuality">Quaker views of homosexuality</a>. If you think it's best done differently, though, go ahead. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Αλεξ</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_S_751f.html" title="User talk:Alex S">Σ</a> 13:15, Oct 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>I contributed an image to the entry "Karlsruhe", which shows the castle of Karlsruhe at night. I just forgot to reduce the size before uploading it. Could you make it smaller (600x800 or so) or remove it so I can upload the picture again?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Alex, could you enter a source and copyright tag for this image. I ask because I spent a lot of time searching the net for public domain images of Sutton Hoo treasure and eventually had to email someone to ask their permission. Images of real objects are by default copyrighted.

<dl>
<dd>Oops - my mistake. I assumed that because the object was so old, a picture of it would be public domain. Obviously not. I simply took the picture from<a href="http://www.sewanee.edu/humanities/102/102_Images/102Image7/102image7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sewanee.edu/humanities/102/102_Images/102Image7/102image7.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and put it into Wikipedia. Since I don't know much about copyright law, tell me what to do - should I delete the picture or ask the website owner for permission to use it? -<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Αλεξ</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_S_751f.html" title="User talk:Alex S">Σ</a> 17:02, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would recommend either contacting them to release it in to the public domain, or to delete it from Wikipedia (one way to do this is put a copyright violation tag on the image page and it will get deleted eventually). Also remove it from the Sutto Hoo page right away.

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>You say you have experience with "tough-headed" Wikipedians.</p>
<p>I use Wikipedia fairly regularly for getting information, since it is the most easily accessible online encyclopedia. The first time I ran across an article that seemed incredibly inaccurate, I did not know anything about vandalism, POV, etc. problems in Wikipedia (apparently they must not be too common). The article I am speaking of relates to the PKK, which is a Kurdish Separatist Terrorist group that operates in the Kurdish region of Turkey.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKK" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKK" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKK</a></p>
<p>A user named CoolCat "polices" the article, i.e., he makes sure that any mention of the aims of the PKK or the issue of Kurdish independence is not included in the article and that the article includes only (very poorly written - I don't think English is his first language) information about the terrorist activities of the PKK, including some unconfirmed accusations of the Turkish Government regarding its number of victims, lots of highly opinionated statements (it has accomplished nothing except death) and links to gruesome images (no English explanations provided). If anyone tries to go in and make the article less one-sided, CoolCat reverts the edits and accuses said person of vandalism.</p>
<p>I have indeed looked at Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, and was particularly struck when Moderators encouraged two users to basically "work things out" on their own when one user was quite obviously launching vitriolic assaults/legal threats against the other, who was just being reasonable. I don't want to put myself in this kind of position with CoolCat, a lot of people have posted comments under the 'discussion' for the PKK page that agree that the page essentially sounds like Turkish Government Propaganda and not like a neutral article and so I hope that some sort of community consensus can be reached to restore the PKK article to a neutral, informative form written in good English and protect it from editing (or "policing") by CoolCat.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that I strongly support mentioning PKK atrocities in the article, as well as the fact that the EU and other authorities consider it a terrorist organization, but only if atrocities committed by the Turkish Army in Kurdistan are mentioned as well, as well as neutral information regarding the issue of Kurdish independence from Turkey and the self-determination goals of the PKK.</p>
<p>If you could give me some advice as to how this could best be accomplished, I would be very grateful.</p>

While the NPS site is a federal web site, and the contents are therefore arguably in the public domain, specific authors are credited. It is intellectually dishonest not to credit them as a source for the article, but I do not think it is technically a copyright violation. At least the Wikipedia article included a link to the NPS web site. The other site did not even do that much. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 21:11, May 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p><br />
I am trying to find out if anyone or perhaps you can direct me to someone who can tell me which is the correct, true to the greek translation of the Greek New Testament.</p>
<p>Accuracy is important in respect to authenticity, it appears that there can be many different choices in translating the greek into english so that begs the question, who is correct, and who is way off?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>I wanted to add Charles Williams' novel "Descent into Hell" (1937) to the list of books about doppelgangers, but I am too computer illiterate to figure out the instructions on how to edit a page. There is a Wikipedia page on Charles Williams which should be linked to this reference, if it is added. I left a request on the Discussion panel of the doppelganger article for someone to do this for me, but I don't know if anyone will. Can you? Thanks. Helen Stanbro (h_stanbro@yahoo.com)</p>

<p>I followed your advice and created a Username for myself. I chose not to use my real last name just to avoid potential complications--I used to be on a cancer newsgroup where I looked up medical information for people and some of them became quite a nuisance, so I have learned to be more cautious about giving out my real name (too easy to find in a small town). So anyway, it is "Helen Astborn."</p>
<p>Thank you for your listing of the places to find editing information. I had found some of them (not all) after much searching around, but some of them are still a bit technical for a person who does not do a lot of webpage work. Since all I had wanted to do was add two literary references to a list, it would have been nice to have an instruction all in one place about how to mark the titles and internal links so they would format properly. Even hopping through all the Guidelines I have still not found a place that succintly says what to put in square brackets and what to put in double quotation marks to create things that will show up underlined or in the blue "clickable" Link format---I had to just copy previous entries and hope it came out right.</p>
<p>Sometime I hope to have time to copy out the instruction pages and study them, but since I am usually pressed for time, I don't think it will be anytime soon!</p>
