<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>Althusser's position at the ENS was quite odd during the time in question. I suppose we could mention the whole story on the Foucault page, but it feels extraneous. In any case, Althusser was basically allowed to live in the medical unit at ENS and basically just hang around the place indefinitely, due to his mental illness and the time he'd spent in prisoner of war camps. I guess my interpretation of things would be that his position would be the equivalent to a PhD in an institution who hung around doing tutoring even though their candidture was suspended or completed and they did not have a formal position. (This info is mostly from memory of Althusser's autobiography by the way, and of the three Foucault bios). Anyway, i replaced the teacher/student thing with 'mentor', which I think is undoubtedly true, and merely implies that Althusser was more senior, not by how much. Hope this is ok. --<a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">XmarkX</a> 00:52, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mr Golub,</p>
<p>I noticed you removed an anonymous comment on globalization at Foucault's entry. I restored an edited version of the original anonymous post and placed it in the section -Influence of Foucault's work-, since I consider it to be acurate and something that needs to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Hi Alex, would like to put in the political aspect of US anthropolgy again . Think it's important for a neutral view.Does not take much space. Can I do&#160;?</p>
<p>Hey 217.185.210.88 --</p>
<p>It is fine with me if you include more on the politics of anthropology -- in fact I think that would make a great contribution. But I think it needs to be better integrated into the article, instead of tacked onto the end. If you can find a way to do a substantive separate section that would be great, or else you could incorporate it into the main body of the article, as I did with your note on race.</p>
<p>Also, your contribution has to be factual and accurate. Anthropologists have certainly beein engaged with government and applied work in many ways (including intelligence functions) but more often than not, U.S. anthropology's leftist tendencies have led anthropologists to work counter to rather than with government intelligence agencies. Consider the <a href="http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=107144429047&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Threatening+Anthropology&amp;Bmain.Subtitle=%3A+McCarthyism+and+the+FBI%27s+Surveillance+of+Activist+Anthropologists" class="external text" title="http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=107144429047&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Threatening+Anthropology&amp;Bmain.Subtitle=%3A+McCarthyism+and+the+FBI%27s+Surveillance+of+Activist+Anthropologists" rel="nofollow">new book by David Price</a> which scrupulously examines the way anthropologists were targeted, or the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/archives/search?author_name=&amp;title=anthropology+on+the+warpath&amp;reviewed_author=&amp;reviewed_item=&amp;form=&amp;year=" class="external text" title="http://www.nybooks.com/archives/search?author_name=&amp;title=anthropology+on+the+warpath&amp;reviewed_author=&amp;reviewed_item=&amp;form=&amp;year=" rel="nofollow">exchange in the New York Times</a> about anthropology in Vietnamn. It strikes me that maybe claimining without a citation that 50% of all anthropologists over a long period of time were working for the secret service is maybe not the most careful or detailed claim you could make.</p>
<p>So go for it, but please do try to write well and research carefully&#160;:!) Also, if you create a user name and login account, then it will be easier for us to talk and to keep track of your contributions.</p>

<p>I appreciate your addition to the Boas article -- and I really want to thank you for your comment on the talk page. I am glad you think my contributions to the article stand up to scrutiny, and I appreciate your support in my conflicts with Jacquerie27 (which are tiring). By the way, only given what you wrote, you should know that I am an academic. But I have always tried, as you say, never "to suggest that we should listen to him 'because I'm an expert and you're not,'" although I honestly have told some people that they should listen to me because I have done research on the topic. I've always endeavored to handle conflicts over content on the basis of the quality of research, and never credentials. Anyway, I really appreciate your comments, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 18:53, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments. I know we all have to choose our priorities, but I hope you will consider adding a section on either the Mauss/Levy-Bruhl tradition, or the Evans-Pritchard tradition. I think you are right, but it has been a long time since I have studied any of this stuff. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 00:46, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One question I would ask of you, though, is whether Evans-Pritchard ever used the term "relativism?" I am not trying to be overly picky, but I do think differences in language signal other differences. I have no doubt that the sort of so-called "structural functionalism" emplyed by Evans Pritchard and others functioned very similarly to Cultural Relativism. But I wonder whether there may also be important differences -- in the epistemological basis, the claims about "culture" (or rather, what is at stake in talking about social structure rather than culture), and perhaps the political uses. These differences may not be great enough to justify excluding them from the article, but they ought to be explored ... <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 19:33, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Er... well my copy of WOMA isn't at hand so I can't remember whether he did or not. I think that in fact structural functionalism (as a generalizing science of institutions) is quite different from cultural relativism (which is an argument about the calibration of different arbitrary and conventional world views to the physical world). However, it is important to note that in many ways Evans-Pritchard is not a paragon of structure-functionalism (Fortes would fit the bill here, though). After all, Evans-Pritchard is the one who suggested that anthropology is more like history and less like natural science. In addition, while The Nuer is the classic examplar of the segmentary lineage system, Witchraft Oracles and Magic Among The Azande is strikingly not in the structure-functional mold. While I'm not an E-P scholar, I think it's pretty clear that WOMA is related to E-P's early Cairo lectures on primitive religion and the influence of Seligman (who wrote on divine kingship and provided the introduction to WOMA) rather than to Radcliffe-Brown. I mean it was published in 1937 and the fieldwork/writing about it was even earlier -- back when R-B was still in Australia or something. I'll spare the you the details of the relationship of this work to Leinhardt's 'Divinity and Experience'. Suffice to say that the argument of WOMA proved very important in discussions of cultural relativism (in the Hollis and Lukes volume, in Gellner, etc.) and WOMA itself is not really a 'structure-functional' monograph. In fact, E-P was too protean and wide ranging to fit under this label.</p>
<p>I still agree with everythig you say. I think you should even consider writing an Evans Pritchard article -- we could use one that has the detail and depth of the Boas article (or at least, the detail and epth to which I aspired) and I still hope at some point you will consider adding an EP section to the relativism page. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 15:31, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you have a source to show that Weber was "highly critical" of Marx? Some sociologists see him as having built off of him, for example in his expansion of Marx's concept of stratification to a <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-component_theory_of_stratification.html" title="Three-component theory of stratification">three-component concept</a> and in his lament of workers being alienated through the process of rationalization, whereas Marx's criticism was that workers became alienated because of a changing mode of production. As capitalism itself is a perfect example of rationalization, Weber's theory was in a sense just a broader version or Marx's same criticism. Certainly there is no agreement among sociologists whether he was expanding off Marx or not, although it seems pretty apparent to me that unlike other early sociologists he wasn't arguing in any sort of direct opposition to him, and in several ways, directly or not, he patched flaws with and helped add to Marxist doctrine. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 19:42, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In fact I think we agree -- 'highly critical' is perhaps too strong since in fact Marx simply wasn't that central to Weber's agenda. I think there was a tendency in the earlier anglophone reception of Weber -- i.e. Parson's appropriation of him -- to try to make Weber a synthetic thinker to 'round out' or 'built upon' Marx's work (presumably as a step on the way to Parson's synthesis of social theory). However, I think more recent scholarship has demonstrated that, to Weber, Marx was just another scholar (albeit a popular one) working in the tradition of political economy in which Weber was also located. I mean have you looked up Marx in the index of Economy and Society? There's not much there, mate! I think it's not very interesting to note that both were interested in diagnosing the pathologies of modernity -- that's what nineteenth century social theory was all about, especially that with (nominal) ties to (some version) of socialism. I mean, Durkheim was also interested in modernization and 'alienation', and was also interested in a kind of socialism, but who would claim that he was 'building off of Marx'? Just looking at the books on my shelf, discussions of Weber's critique of Marx (and his lack of interest in thoroughly engaging Marx) in Gerth and Mill's introduction to "From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology", Guenther Roth's introduction in the first volume of Economy and Society, and the entries on Marx in the index of Marianne Weber's biography of her husband (this is, of course, a document with complicated politics). One of my favorite secondary sources on Weber, Wolfgang Schlucter's "Rationalism, Religion, and Domination" has some pretty extensive discussions of Weber's theoretical and methodological critique of Marxism, as well as Weber's approach to bureaucratization and how it is in fact a critique of Marx's theory of alienation. So Weber was critical, but not engaged enough to take Marx super-seriously <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Golub_1c00.html" title="User:Alex Golub">Rex</a> 20:24, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I didn't mean to claim Weber was influenced in any direct way, in fact I think a lot of Marx's works were not published until after Weber's death. But then also there's a difference between Marx's views as he lived and the expansion of Marxist doctrine after his death. While I agree he was critical of Marx, I'm afraid that the article will imply he was directly hostile to Marxist thought.</dd>

<dd>The secondary text I am consulting (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Ritzer_d3ac.html" title="George Ritzer">George Ritzer</a>'s <i>Sociological Theory</i>) has noted various similarities in their thought. One offering: "Weber was no political radical; in fact, he was often called the "bourgeouis Marx" to reflect the similarities in the intellectual interests of Marx and Weber as well as their very different political orientations. Although Weber was almost as critical of modern capitalism as Marx was, he did not advocate revolution. He had little faith in the "masses" to create a better society" (Ritzer, 2004). Gerth and Mills wrote that "Weber's sociology is related to Marx's thought in the common attempt to grasp the interrelationship of institutional orders making up a social structure: In Weber's work, military and religious, political and juridicial institutional systems are functionally related to the economic order in a variety of ways." (Gerth and Mills, 1958:49)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Stephen Kalberg (a sociologist who has a long experience with Weber's works, including having retranslated <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> to English and who is working on completing Weber's Sociology of Civilizations), also notes that Weber in his later years had become less and less interested in ideas (such as his studies on religion) and much more interested in material things. To quote Weber, "Not ideas, but material and ideal interests, directly govern man's conduct. Yet very frequently the "world images" have have been created by 'ideas' have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which action has been pushed by the dynamic of interest." Weber's concepts have contributed significantly to conflict theory, and although he differed in several major respects (particularly his idea that fact and value could be separated, which Marx deemed impossible), I certainly don't believe it's fair to say he was sharply at odds with Marx at a theoretical level; on the contrary, I think most sociologists would argue they had more in common with one another than in conflict. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 05:10, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gerth and Mills are right: both Weber and Marx want to grasp the interrelations of institutional orders. So did Radcliffe-Brown, Toennies, Luhmann, and Durkheim. This proves only that they are all working in a Western academic tradition of social theory. I have never heard of Ritzer before, and the quotes you provide indicate to me that we'd be better off sticking to actual Weber scholars (and Weber's work itself) for an understanding of Weber rather than intro-level college textbooks. Kalberg's translation is well known although (polite cough) I prefer the Baer/Wells. Many contemporary debates in sociology and political science (for instance, those involving the nature of state-society relations) are in fact divided into separate 'Marxist' and 'Weberian' camps. I don't think it's worth getting into but if you think Weber and Marx are somehow fundamentally aligned, I can only suggest that you stop consulting secondary texts and read more deeply in the work of each scholar. I support a change on the page to "critical" instead of "highly critical". I don't support a change on the page claiming they agreed on most fundamental issues. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Golub_1c00.html" title="User:Alex Golub">Rex</a> 08:56, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have analyzed it myself, and this text actually comes from a 400 level theory class. That you've never even heard of Ritzer strikes me as a little odd, and as it happens he has published several works directly related to Weber, and the bulk of his own theoretical work builds off the concept of rationalization. As it happens, I've also read much of the primary text behind his most important works. Also, I could be mistaken but I'm pretty sure I never claimed anything near the point of a fundamental alignment between the two theorists, or argued for, as you say, a change marking their fundamental agreement on most issues, although I might be mistaken and if you'd like you can cite me saying otherwise. Rather I'm arguing that they're not at fundamental odds with one another. You appear also to be basing Weber's sociological concepts entirely off <i>The Protestant Ethic</i>, which as far as I can tell is the only one of Weber's works that Bae<i>h</i>r and Wells actually examined. That work, from my perspective, was only a subtle introduction to his far more sociological works, namely his much more important <i>Economy and Society</i>. However, it's clear to me our views on the subject are irreconcilable and I don't really have the time nor see the point in extending this etherealized shit-flinging contest any longer. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 00:59, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well I am sorry if you consider this shit-flinging and apologize if you consider this thread etherealized. I also apologize for mistaking the level of course you took on this subject. A brief look back at this thread will indicate I am familiar with Economy and Society. As I said in my last post, and you now obviously agree with, it's not worth getting into. We are obviously (and unfortunately) not at all on the same page, that's for sure. I stand by what I said earlier: I support a change on the page to "critical" instead of "highly critical". I don't support a change on the page claiming they had more in common with one another than in conflict.</p>

<p>Alex, is there any chance you have a copy of Murphy's "Anthropology at Columbia:A Reminiscence" (Dialectical Anthropology) scanned into your computer or as a PDF file? My library doesn't have it and I want to look at it ASAP. If -- by some slim chance -- you have it, could you e-mail it to me at rubenste -the at sign- ohiou dot edu? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:23, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alas, you have uncovered my secret Robert Murphy fetish! (like my Bob Scholte fetish, but longer lived) I have a copy of the article but it's not scanned in.

<p>It should not be a secret. Truth to tell, he was my advisor at graduate school, while he was writing his last book. "Zen Marxism" and "Social Distance and the Veil" are among my favorite articles in anthropology history, and <i>Women of the Forest</i> (to whom much credit goes to Yolanda) is still among my favorite ethnographies, and it isn't nearly as old-fashioned as some people think. And <i>The Dialectics of Social Life</i>... well, we could go on for quite a while. Anyway, I read it a long time ago, but my library just doesn't have it and if I ever had a copy I've misplaced it. I just ordered it from interlibrary loan, so don't worry about it, (and if you want to continue the discussion feel free to e-mail me)<a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:59, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Noemi -- I removed your entry about Unicist anthropology for several reasons. First, it was incorrectly placed in the article (and there wasn't a clear place to put it). Second, no other encyclopedias or standard reference works that I know of contain entries on Unicist anthropology, so I didn't consider it relevant to the wikipedia. I was also guided by my intuition on this as someone who is very familiar with the discipline of anthropology -- and having viewed your website has not changed my mind much on this matter. Most obviously, however, your contribution violates the wikipedia guideline on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_guidelines" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_guidelines" rel="nofollow">Vanity edits</a>.

<p>Hi, I just noticed under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Griaule_dfb6.html" title="Marcel Griaule">Marcel Griaule</a> that there is a typo there -somewhere- at the beginning it says he died in 1965, at the end it states he died in 1956!

<p>I believe the proper date is 1956 and although I am hardly an expert in this area and I've made the change accordingly. I'm hesitant to alter the Dogon or Nommo entries since they are really out of my area of expertise, and I have no desire to get into an edit war with the UFO people... <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Golub_1c00.html" title="User:Alex Golub">Rex</a> 02:35, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh dear, I had really hoped somebody could help us bring back the Dogon to mother earth.... Actually, I believe some of the more "spaced out" people have now been banned from wikipedia, so there is hope (?). Take a look at Talk:Dogon; a few references is needed.

<p>Yes. I am also saying that the vast majority of the page has nothing to do with Maliowski, it information Malinowski is not easy to find.

The project page as it now exists is only a minimum page, and could use the input of interested parties such as yourself.
