<p>The line about Alex's relationship with <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Friedberger_b913.html" title="Eleanor Friedberger">Eleanor Friedberger</a> keeps being changed from "currently" to "previously" and sometimes to not being there at all. Only being a big fan of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fiery_Furnaces_f38e.html" title="The Fiery Furnaces">The Fiery Furnaces</a> (Eleanor's band) and the writer of most of their pages on here, I'm not really in a position to say whether they are really going out or not. Still, changing between two condtradictory stances on any fact (however minor) is really not a good place for an encyclopedia to be. I propose we either decide (and provide a source or reference for) one of the options, make a vague claim that the relationship status is unclear, or remove the sections altogether (on both the individuals' pages). I personally saw mr Kapranos at a Furnaces show only a few weeks ago and both of them certainly looked happy. Perhaps we should ask someone from the indie-rock equivalent of <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smash_Hits_af70.html" title="Smash Hits">Smash Hits</a> to find out for us. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellypuzzle_8e24.html" title="User:Jellypuzzle">Jellypuzzle</a> 11:00, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you don't want people to talk about your relationships do you really think you should be famous AK? Ok sometimes people should leave it out but, come on you're like a hero to people so they're gonna want to know everything about you..</p>
<p>There is a whole paragraph about their relationship on the Wikipedia article on Eleanor Friedberger. If it is okay there, then why not here?</p>
<p><br />
His personal life shouldn't be discussed anywhere. Although he is famous, don't you think he deserves some privacy like everyone else?</p>
<p>Ok fair enough the comment i made earlier about "If you don't want people to talk about your relationships do you really think you should be famous AK? Ok sometimes people should leave it out but, come on you're like a hero to people so they're gonna want to know everything about you" was a little harsh but i'm a huge fan, not a stalker, so it doesn't bother me whether his relationship is over or not, but i know loads of people that want to know everything about him so they can be like him. That's fair enough so long as it doesn't go too far. He should have privacy as you said. Everyone should. In the real world there's always going to be someone who encroaches on that privacy. He's a great guy and he deserves some respect. If he doesn't want Eleanor discussed then i'm willing to respect that wish. BK</p>
<p>He should be and is to most, a hero because of his music, not because of his relationships.</p>

<p>Ok. So there has always been a thing about his age and how Alex has "lost his passport." Anyway, the profile says he is 34 but i've read articles where Alex himself has said he is 29 and that those rumours are bollocks. So i'm wondering what the truth behind his age is. There should be some sort of source to say he is 34.. it's all a mystery to me still.. 34 or 29?</p>
<dl>
<dd>He is indeed, 34. Otherwise he's been 29 for 5 years...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>He finally said that he was 34. Actually he said that he's been writing songs since he was fourteen, and that was twenty years ago. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarla_Dear_5c8f.html" title="User:Starla Dear">Starla Dear</a> 16:46, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i understand allergic to peanuts, but allergic to animals? is that a meat allergy? which meats? is it actually some kind of roundabout way of saying he's a vegetarian? i could be wrong but i don't think anyone in the world has an allergy to every kind of meat. if that's what the article it's saying, then it needs to be wikified... on the other hand if you mean animal dander, again... which animals? humans are animals. as for likening it to arsenic, what does that mean? all of these things would be completely fatal? i've written too much. all i'm saying is that that whole section is baffling. Youdontsmellbad 21:47, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He's allergic to animals, as in live animals as in animal saliva and dander. I think when you say that someone is allergic to animals it's implied that it's animal saliva and dander, and not meat and humans.<br /></dd>
<dd>Here is the post that Alex left on their website. It should explain the whole arsenic thing:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>I had the most horrific night, last night. I was up until 5:30, retching, then retching again until it was just blood and bile coming up. I have an allergy to peanuts. My friend Kate, who is a fantastic cook, made some baklava. The packet of hazelnuts she used had one of those generic catch-all notices on the back: “Made in a factory that processes other nuts - may contain traces of peanut”. I’m not as allergic as some other people. I just retch for hours. Other people go into anaphylactic shock and die very quickly. Apparently it’s a similar death to swallowing arsenic.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Just suppose there was a hypothetical factory which produced chocolate bars or sliced bread. They also processed arsenic. In fact they used the same machines to process the arsenic that they used to process sweets and bread. But that’s OK. They didn’t clean the machines between uses, they just put a little notice on the back by the ingredients saying: “Warning: May Contain Traces Of Arsenic”.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hope that clears it up. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarla_Dear_5c8f.html" title="User:Starla Dear">Starla Dear</a> 16:53, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate a citation needs to be found regarding Kapranos' South Tyneside/Wearside links, but should it really be in question? I thought it was common knowledge. I've heard it referred to in a number of music magazines including Q and NME. You can hear it in his accent and singing voice, just as much as his Glaswegian accent. Anyway, I've found a Guardian article written by him which tells of his links with the area</p>

<p>His grandmother is from South Shields, so he obviously spent a lot of time them. There is also this</p>

<p>“My dad played guitar. He used to play in beat groups in the 1960s. He’d play R’n’B and blues in the working men’s clubs of South Shields. I have very early memories of my dad holding down chords and me strumming."</p>
<p>Is this adequate?</p>

<p>There seems to be a debate emerging the relevance of so-called "slash" fiction, written by teenage girls who fantasise that their idols are homosexual in order to gratify themselves.</p>
<p>Whether this has any relevance to this article is highly questionable. It appears to have been added to assuage the egos of the protagonists of this fiction. It has no direct relevance to Kapranos himself.</p>

<dd>The above 2 (or 3?) partly/uncertainly unsigned messages (1 or 2 sock puppets?) indulge in ad hominem arguments and feeble speculation unworthy of an FF fan. The FF slash is a big phenomenon and AK has talked about it more than once. The quotes are there. It seems entirely 'relevant' for a trivia section therefore. <a href="../../../s/o/a/User%7ESoane_3604.html" title="User:Soane">Soane</a> 16:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Trivia sections are discouraged, see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles</a> and are often used to justify inclusion of various bits of information that may or may not be interesting for an encyclopedia entry. What would make the Slash Fiction notable on this page is if there are newspaper or magazine articles talking about what a phenomenon it has become in Alex Kapranos's life. Thus, this may be better suited for the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Ferdinand_8b2b.html" title="Franz Ferdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a> page. Regardless, I do feel that a Live Journal site of fiction casting the band as gay doesn't merit entry into Wikipedia unless it truly is a phenomenon. Having the band mention it may thrill the Slackened Ties participants, but it hardly makes them noteworthy to the rest of the world, for whom Wikipedia is written. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> should be read. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 17:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A fan site is not included, even in a trivia section or an external link section. Unfortunately, the only people slackening their ties at slackened_ties are the contributors to that site. Please, gals, find another venue for validation. This isn't the place, and if we allowed you all to be included, it would open floodgates that would thus make your inclusion here meaningless. This is a community effort to share serious information; not a fan forum. That said...I completely understand where you all come from - ha! Just the wrong platform here. Please stop. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 01:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't personally have an opinion on this, but others do. How does one decide if a person is Scottish or English? It can't be discerned genetically, so is it a parental thing? If so, does his father actually make him Greek, or is there a rule similar to the Jewish tradition that his mother is the one who decides his status, which would then be English? Or is it a cultural issue, which would undoubtedly make him Scottish. I personally have no horse in this race, but it needs to be decided to stop the revert back-n-forth. And does anybody have a linke to what he considers himself (which is only incidental to this discussion, since subjects don't decide their own WP entries, but it does inform us on the matter). --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 01:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We can not use copyrighted photographs when we have our open-use photographs, per <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. I understand that every fan with a camera phone wants to put a grainy band pic up from the show they attended, but perhaps instead create a gallery. Right now, the best photographs available of Kapranos are the book store shots, several angles of varying quality can be found here: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kapranos" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kapranos" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kapranos</a>. But this artcle is not about Franz Ferdinand, it's about Alex Kapranos, the singer, the writer, the person. So a "band shot" is not necessary, just like a book store photo of Alex Kapranos is unnecessary on the Franz Ferdinand page. Get a better close-up, quality photo of Kapranos, put it up. But let's take the page a little more seriously than every fan with a camera phone who wants to see the "concert that changed their life" on the page. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">David Shankbone</a> 12:42, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about Image:Alex Kapranosconcert.jpg, or a cropped version of it? Shows him fairly clearly. <span style="font-family:Georgia"><font style="background:#0000FF;"><b><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchibald99_3d99.html" title="User:Archibald99"><font style="color:red;font-size:85%">Archibald99</font></a></b>&#160;</font></span> 13:01, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with that photo is it is grainy, it's not nearly as clear as the bookstore shot, and it is of unknown copyright. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">David Shankbone</a> 13:53, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
