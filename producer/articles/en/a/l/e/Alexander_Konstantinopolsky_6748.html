<p>At the beginning of his career, Konstantinopolsky won the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> championships five consecutive times from 1932 to 1936. He played in seven Ukrainian SSR championships. In 1931, he tied for 3rd-5th in <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkov.html" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> (6th UKR-ch). In 1933, he took 3rd in Kharkov (7th UKR-ch). In 1936, he took 4th in Kiev (8th UKR-ch). In 1937, he tied for 3rd-4th in Kiev (9th UKR-ch), which was won by <a href="../../../f/e/d/Fedor_Bohatirchuk_85db.html" title="Fedor Bohatirchuk">Fedor Bohatirchuk</a>. In 1938, he took 3rd in Kiev (10th UKR-ch), which was won by <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Boleslavsky_c6ce.html" title="Isaac Boleslavsky">Isaac Boleslavsky</a>. In 1939, he took 3rd in <a href="../../../d/n/e/Dnepropetrovsk.html" title="Dnepropetrovsk">Dnepropetrovsk</a> (11th UKR-ch). In 1940, he tied for 8th-9th in Kiev (12th UKR-ch). Boleslavsky also won in both 1939 and 1940. Konstantinopolsky's early games from this period are largely missing from games databases. (portrait photo from his later years at bidmonta.com under Konstantinopolsky heading)</p>
<p>In 1936, Konstantinopolsky played in a <a href="../../../l/e/n/Leningrad.html" title="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> Young Masters' tournament, scoring 7.5/14 in a strong field which played a double round robin format.</p>
<p>Konstantinopolsky played several times in <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Chess_Championship_1c2b.html" title="Soviet Chess Championship">Soviet Chess Championships</a>. In 1931, he tied for 3rd-5th (7th URS-ch semifinal), in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. In 1934, he tied for 11th-13th in <a href="../../../t/b/i/Tbilisi.html" title="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a> (9th URS-ch sf). In April/May 1937, he tied for 2nd-3rd with <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viacheslav_Ragozin_ebfa.html" title="Viacheslav Ragozin">Viacheslav Ragozin</a>, behind <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigory_Levenfish_7c4c.html" title="Grigory Levenfish">Grigory Levenfish</a>, in Tbilisi (10th URS-ch), with a score of 12/19. In 1938, he tied for 11th-12th in Kiev (URS-ch sf). In 1940, he tied for 4th-7th in Kiev (URS-ch sf), with a score of 9.5/16. In September/October 1940, he tied for 13th-16th in Moscow (12th URS-ch), with a score of 8/19.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Konstantinopolsky_6748.html" title="Edit section: Theorist and trainer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theorist and trainer</span></h2>
<p>During the late 1930s, Konstantinopolsky trained young players and amateurs in Kiev, at the Palace of Young Pioneers. He was widely regarded as a friendly and kindly man. His prize pupil was the young <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bronstein_3791.html" title="David Bronstein">David Bronstein</a>, who eventually challenged for the World Championship title in 1951, drawing the match against <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Botvinnik_2918.html" title="Mikhail Botvinnik">Mikhail Botvinnik</a>. Konstantinopolsky and Bronstein were close friends, and Konstantinopolsky served as Bronstein's second for the 1950 Candidates' playoff match in Moscow, against Isaac Boleslavsky, which Bronstein won by 7.5-6.5.</p>
<p>He was one of the Ukrainian pioneers who developed the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Indian_Defence_eea2.html" title="King's Indian Defence">King's Indian Defence</a> into prominence, along with Boleslavsky and Bronstein. The variation had been considered suspect until the mid-1930s. During this time, he played one of the earliest games in the Yugoslav Attack against the Dragon Variation of the <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian_Defence_953a.html" title="Sicilian Defence">Sicilian Defence</a>, a line which would become very popular about 20 years later. He also defended the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Defence_1287.html" title="Dutch Defence">Dutch Defence</a> with success at a time when it was rarely played by top players. Konstantinopolsky had a very wide opening repertoire with both colours, a very valuable attribute which he passed on to his prize pupil Bronstein. He was also a formidable strategist and tactician, as the games selection shows.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Konstantinopolsky_6748.html" title="Edit section: Grandmastership denied">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grandmastership denied</span></h2>
<p>He played in the tournament Leningrad / Moscow 1939, scoring an excellent 8.5/17 against an exceptionally strong field. During <a href="../../../w/w/_/WW_II_2b68.html" title="WW II">WW II</a>, he played in national tournaments. In 1940, he took 3rd in <a href="../../../l/v/o/Lvov.html" title="Lvov">Lvov</a> (Lviv, Lwów, Lemberg), which was won by Abram Khavin. The war then seems to have stopped his chess activity for about three years. In February 1943, he won in <a href="../../../k/u/i/Kuibyshev.html" title="Kuibyshev">Kuibyshev</a>. In April/May 1943, he took 6th in <a href="../../../s/v/e/Sverdlovsk.html" title="Sverdlovsk">Sverdlovsk</a>, a very strong tournament, with 6.5/14; the event was won by Botvinnik. In August/September 1943, he took 2nd, behind Boleslavsky, in Kuibyshev. In 1943, he won a match against Yakov Rokhlin (+7 –0 =1). In 1944, he won a match against Lev Aronin (+6 –1 =5). In 1944, he moved to stay in Moscow. He played in the 1945 Moscow City Championship, probably on average the strongest such event in the world, scoring 9/16.</p>
<p>After the war, he played in several more Soviet championships. In 1945, he tied for 1st-3rd in <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baku.html" title="Baku">Baku</a> (URS-ch sf). In June 1945, he tied for 4th-6th in Moscow (14th URS-ch), with 10.5/18; the tournament was won by Botvinnik. In 1947, he tied for 3rd-4th in Moscow (URS-ch sf). In 1948, he tied for 6th-9th in Moscow (16th URS-ch), with 9.5/17; the tournament was won jointly by Bronstein and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Kotov_d3e3.html" title="Alexander Kotov">Alexander Kotov</a>. In 1950, he tied for 2nd-4th in <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartu.html" title="Tartu">Tartu</a> (URS-ch sf). In 1950, he tied for 5th-6th in Moscow (18th URS-ch), with 7.5/14; the tournament was won by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Keres_07b1.html" title="Paul Keres">Paul Keres</a>. In 1952, he took 16th in Moscow (20th URS-ch), with 7/19; the tournament was won jointly by Botvinnik and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Taimanov_6943.html" title="Mark Taimanov">Mark Taimanov</a>. He played in the Soviet Team Championship, <a href="../../../r/i/g/Riga.html" title="Riga">Riga</a> 1954, scoring 5.5/10; this was his last really strong performance. His over-the-board play seems to have largely stopped about 1955, as he concentrated more on correspondence chess and on his job as a trainer and coach. He did play occasionally over-the-board in later years.</p>
<p>So, his best results in the Soviet national championships, which during that period were the strongest tournaments in the world, were four times in the top six (1937, 1945, 1948, 1950). In any virtually other nation in the world during that period, he would have been its national champion, and an almost certain Grandmaster. Because the Soviet chess talent was so deep, he never earned the highest chess title. His best games show he could hold his own with anyone in the USSR, with victories over Botvinnik, Keres, Kotov, Boleslavsky, <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigory_Levenfish_7c4c.html" title="Grigory Levenfish">Grigory Levenfish</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasily_Smyslov_efd9.html" title="Vasily Smyslov">Vasily Smyslov</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salo_Flohr_f859.html" title="Salo Flohr">Salo Flohr</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Tolush_e629.html" title="Alexander Tolush">Alexander Tolush</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viacheslav_Ragozin_ebfa.html" title="Viacheslav Ragozin">Viacheslav Ragozin</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andor_Lilienthal_e32d.html" title="Andor Lilienthal">Andor Lilienthal</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Korchnoi_b7e2.html" title="Viktor Korchnoi">Viktor Korchnoi</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Averbakh_2994.html" title="Yuri Averbakh">Yuri Averbakh</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratmir_Kholmov_36f0.html" title="Ratmir Kholmov">Ratmir Kholmov</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Verlinsky_6149.html" title="Boris Verlinsky">Boris Verlinsky</a>, and others.</p>
<p>The site <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmetrics.html" title="Chessmetrics">chessmetrics</a>.com, which endeavours to provide historical ratings while taking account of different methods of calculation, ranks Konstantinopolsky as #11 in the world in July 1945, at 2669, following his 7.5/13 (2684 performance) in the 14th Soviet Championship earlier that year. This is clear <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmaster.html" title="Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> territory, which is generally regarded as 2600 or higher for events of at least nine games against rated players. Other Grandmaster-level (or near) performances include 2593 at Leningrad 1936, 2635 at Tbilisi 1937 (10th URS-ch), 2631 at Leningrad / Moscow 1939, 2622 (against rated players) at Kiev 1940 (URS-ch sf), 2566 at Moscow 1940 (12th URS-ch), 2625 at Sverdlovsk 1943, 2564 at the 1945 Moscow City Championship, 2678 at Moscow 1948 (16th URS-ch), 2655 at Moscow 1950 (18th URS-ch), and 2571 at Moscow 1952 (20th URS-ch). It is important to understand that international ratings as calculated by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Federation_be95.html" title="World Chess Federation">World Chess Federation</a> (FIDE) only began in 1970. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> had introduced ratings for their own national play in the 1950s. So these older events are being rated retroactively, by chessmetrics, using similar mathematical algorithms, in order to compare the strength of players from those eras to those of today and of the years in between.</p>

<p>In 1948–1951, Konstantinopolsky won the 1st Soviet <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correspondence_Chess_e3bd.html" title="Correspondence Chess">Correspondence Chess</a> Championship. He was awarded the International Master (IM) title in 1950, the International Master of Correspondence Chess (IMC) title in 1966, and the Honourary <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmaster.html" title="Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> (HGM) title in 1983. According to his game files, he only had one chance to play over-the-board in an international tournament outside the Soviet Union, the 'B' section of <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> 1966, when he was well past his prime at age 56. Even so, he scored a creditable 5/9. He continued to work as one of the Soviet Union's most respected trainers well into his 70s.</p>
<p>He introduced an opening which is named for him as the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konstantinopolsky_Opening_51e2.html" title="Konstantinopolsky Opening">Konstantinopolsky Opening</a> (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.g3), against <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viacheslav_Ragozin_ebfa.html" title="Viacheslav Ragozin">Viacheslav Ragozin</a> at Moscow 1956. He published two chess books after age 70.</p>
<p>Konstantinopolsky died in Moscow, September 21, 1990, at age 80.</p>
