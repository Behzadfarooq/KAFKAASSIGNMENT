<p>I don't know what the references to <i>Garrett</i> and other <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_power_of_enforcement.html" title="Congressional power of enforcement">congressional power of enforcement</a> cases are doing in this article. <i>Sandoval</i> is a case about – and <i>solely</i> about – whether a private right of action may be implied under a particular federal statute.

<p>I "show up and complain" not because it is <i>you</i> who are editing, but rather because of <i>the substance of your edits</i>. If your edits were different, I would not complain.

<dd>I think that's a sensible way of proceeding. I do think, however, that your discussion of the relevant background legal principles was too intermixed with a discussion of the majority opinion itself. As (I think) you are suggesting, this page definitely needs more work. Perhaps the best way of improving it would be to try, as much as possible, to discuss the governing legal principles <i>before</i> discussing the way in which those principles were applied in this particular case. For what I think is a good attempt at doing just that, see <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada_Department_of_Human_Resources_v._Hibbs_0704.html" title="Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs">Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs</a>.

</dl>
<p>Good luck with the governing legal principles. What's the principal for defining the holding of a case, for example? Whether there should have been a disagreement (5-4) over something as basic as that, one did exist. If you can find good information on that, a governing legal principles section could be added up front. I still think an overview is needed, although I'll address the concerns you mentioned for that with regard to describing both points of view for <i>Cannon</i> and Scalia's reservations about how to define title VI.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 14:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Jim. I really like your recent edits and I hope you approve of mine, too. I was thinking that perhaps it might be good to remove the following paragraph, which seems duplicative of stuff in the "overview" section, and put some of it in what is now footnote 12. Here's the paragraph in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The majority cited <i><a href="../../../r/e/g/Regents_of_the_University_of_California_v._Bakke_b626.html" title="Regents of the University of California v. Bakke">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</a></i> and <i>Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission</i> as precedents for his contention that only intentional discrimination is allowed as a private cause of action under § 601. It added that "we must assume for purposes of deciding this case that regulations promulgated under § 602 of Title VI may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under § 601. Though no opinion of this Court has held that, five Justices in Guardians voiced that view of the law at least as alternative grounds for their decisions." The <i>Sandoval</i> majority's conclusion was that "These statements are in considerable tension with the rule of Bakke and Guardians that § 601 forbids only intentional discrimination, see, e.g., Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of New York City, supra, at 612—613 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment), but petitioners have not challenged the regulations here. We therefore assume for the purposes of deciding this case that the DOJ and DOT regulations proscribing activities that have a disparate impact on the basis of race are valid." As with <i>Cannon</i>, the majority said that only the holding of the <i>Guardians</i> case should be considered, and that the fact that five justices for the <i>Guardians</i> decision agreed with the disparate impact argument should not be considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Best wishes, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 05:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks. Sounds fine to me, since what you mention is murky.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 05:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jim, thanks for your recent clarification of the issue involving the footnote in <i>Cannon</i>. Best wishes, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 22:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've integrated the "overview" section with the majority and dissent sections. I've preserved as much as I could. Hope it's acceptable. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 05:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think a basic overview would benefit this case more than most. A few redundancies of yours might be corrected as well.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 06:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>By all means, get rid of the redundancies! Also, what do you mean by "basic overview"? I guess I just don't understand what the <i>purpose</i> of such a section would be. If its purpose would be to discuss the applicable law, it seems to me there's already a section devoted to that. Can you explain what you mean? Thanks, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 06:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hope you're not trying to bury or obscure the more important details.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 06:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I'm trying not to. If you think I am, this is the best place to discuss it. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 06:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm only saying that, given Scalia's bold and sometimes colorful prose, often alternating with confusing details, I think the most important and clear cut details on both sides should be made as simply as possible in an overview.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 06:18, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, I see – a kind of summary of the main points of contention between the majority and the dissent? That seems to me a <i>very</i> good idea. (Though I do think the previous overview section didn't serve such a purpose.) Needless to say, you're free to go ahead and try your hand at it. Best wishes, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 06:23, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know, another thing we could do is discuss <i>Cannon</i> in the "law" section of the article. Interpreting what <i>Cannon</i> did and did not hold was so important to <i>Sandoval</i>, after all. Just a suggestion. Best wishes, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 22:57, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just though that briefly mentioning both sides of the most important details in a nutshell would make it more understandable, or that was my intention.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 01:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Really good edits, in my opinion. I wonder, though, if putting the overview <i>after</i> the "law" section might not make more sense. Again, something for both of us to ponder. Best, <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 03:01, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your law section was a good addition as well. Thanks.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 05:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I still can't find any support for the phrase, "At first <b>the majority said the footnote mentioned by the dissent did not refer to disparate impact</b>, but then interpreted the holding of the case to exclude the disputed footnote." The problem is that the part of the majority opinion which is cited to support the assertion in bold doesn't actually seem to support it. The new footnote says: "As Scalia said, 'The language in Cannon to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position.'" However, the full sentence reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The language in <i>Cannon</i> to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position, <b>as we shall discuss at length below, see <i>infra</i>, at 288–290</b>."</dd>
</dl>
<p>532 U.S. at 282.</p>
<p>When one actually goes to pp. 288-290 of volume 532 of the U.S. Reports, the only discussion of <i>Cannon</i> concerns the important role which the rights-creating language of § 601 played in that opinion. See 532 U.S. at 288 ("It is immediately clear that the 'rights-creating' language so critical to the Court’s analysis in <i>Cannon</i> of § 601, see 441 U.S., at 690, n.13, is completely absent from § 602."); <i>id.</i> at 289 (while discussing how § 602 is phrased as a directive to federal agencies, the majority quotes <i>Cannon</i>, which stated that such phrasing provides little support for an implied private right of action); <i>id.</i> at 290 (referring to a discussion in <i>Cannon</i> about the effect of agency enforcement procedures on the existence of an implied private right of action). Note, however, that <i>none</i> of these citations to <i>Cannon</i> discusses the footnote in <i>Cannon</i> that referred to the plaintiff's disparate-impact theory. It seems clear, therefore, that Scalia, by saying that "[t]he language in <i>Cannon</i> to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position," was saying that the language of <i>Cannon</i> – which placed great emphasis on the "right-creating" and not "agency-directing" language of § 601 – actually cuts against the argument that Sandoval was trying to make. Thus I still think the phrase, "At first the majority said the footnote mentioned by the dissent did not refer to disparate impact," should be eliminated. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Apart from this, the <i>way</i> the phrase is written ("at first ... but then") implies, in what strikes me as an unintentionally biased way, that the majority was contradicting itself. At the very least the phrasing should be improved to remove that implication. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 03:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll wait a bit longer for a response, but I think that unless I get one it's only justified to remove the phrase to which I objected. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 21:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because this case concerns a statute and its interpretation and no constitutional issue under the Fourteenth Amendment or more specifically the Equal Protection Clause, I believe this case should not be categorized as a Fourteenth Amendment case or an equal protection case. I'm going to go ahead with those changes now. I notice, however, that many of the other implied-private-right-of-action cases (e.g., Cannon and Cort v. Ash) are categorized as "civil procedure cases." Hence I'll add that category to this case.

<p>Great edits to the overview section, Jim. The way you've contrasted the majority and the dissent in their views of the footnote is terse, accurate, and well written. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 17:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm still convinced that the overview section ought to go <i>after</i> "The law" section. The overview section makes reference to things which simply will be unclear to a reader who is unfamiliar with the law. What a private cause of action is, what <i>Cannon</i> was about, etc. – these things, it seems to me, cry out for an explanation. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydriotaphia_4d58.html" title="User:Hydriotaphia">Hydriotaphia</a> 23:12, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
