<p>Aleknagik is located at 59.273060° North, -158.61778° West Sec. 31, T010S, R055W, Seward Meridian). Aleknagik is located in the Bristol Bay Recording District.</p>
<p>Aleknagik is located at the head of Wood River on the southeast end of Lake Aleknagik, 16 miles northwest of Dillingham. Aleknagik is named after <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleknagik_Lake_1835.html" title="Aleknagik Lake">Aleknagik Lake</a>. <i>Aleknagik</i> means "wrong way home" in <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yupik.html" title="Yupik">Yupik</a>. Yupiks returning to their homes along the <a href="../../../n/u/s/Nushagak_River_7e38.html" title="Nushagak River">Nushagak River</a> would sometimes become lost in the fog and find themselves swept up the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_River_9344.html" title="Wood River">Wood River</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleknagik_Lake_1835.html" title="Aleknagik Lake">Aleknagik Lake</a> by the tide.</p>
<p>Aleknagik is in a transitional climate zone. The primary influence is maritime, although a continental climate does affect the weather here. Average summer temperatures range from 30 to 66 degrees Fahrenheit. Average winter temperatures range from 4 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches and annual snowfall is 93 inches. Fog and low clouds are common during July and August, and may preclude access. The lake and river are ice-free from June through mid-November.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Census_Bureau_2c85.html" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of 48.6 <a href="../../../k/m/%C2%B2/Km%C2%B2.html" title="Km²">km²</a> (18.8 <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_mile.html" title="Square mile">mi²</a>). 29.9 km² (11.6 mi²) of it is land and 18.7 km² (7.2 mi²) of it (38.47%) is water.</p>

<p>Wood River and Aleknagik Lake have been used historically as summer fish camps. Aleknagik means "Wrong Way Home," because Natives returning to their homes along the Nushagak River would sometimes become lost in the fog and find themselves swept up the Wood River with the tide, inadvertently arriving at Aleknagik Lake. The 1929 U.S. Census found 55 people living in the "Wood River village" area to the south. During 1930, there were five families living on the shores of the lake year-round, the Waskeys. Polleys, Hansons, Yakos, and Smiths. A log cabin territorial school was built on the south shore of the lake in 1933, and Josie Waskey was the first teacher. Attracted by the school, other facilities, and plentiful fish, game and timber, a number of families from Goodnews, Togiak, and Kulukak area relocated to Aleknagik. A post office was established in 1937. A two-story framed school with a teacher apartment was constructed in 1938. By 1939, Aleknagik had 78 residents, over 30 buildings, and a small sawmill. In the late 1940s, a <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_a21d.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist">Seventh-day Adventist</a> Mission and School was established on the north shore. During the 1950s, a Moravian Church and a Russian Orthodox Church were built in Aleknagik and over 35 families lived along the lake. In 1959, the state constructed a 25-mile road connecting the south shore to Dillingham. The road was passable only during the summer months, until the late 1980s, when it was upgraded and maintained year-round. The City was incorporated in 1973. Over 24 additional square miles were annexed to the City in April 2000.</p>
<p>In the late 1800s there were about 200 people in Aleknagik and the other Wood River villages. The 1918-1919 influenza epidemic killed most of the residents of the villages. The few survivors were moved out of the area. In the 1920s former residents of the area started drifting back to Aleknagik, and the village grew to about 40 people by 1931. A United States Post Office was opened in 1937 by Mable Smith. By 1940, Aleknagik had over 30 buildings, including a community school, church, and small sawmill. The decline of a <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church_a1ea.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventist</a> colony across the lake from Aleknagik brought several new families to Aleknagik.</p>
<p>In 1946, a territorial school was constructed near Aleknagik. During this period, a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moravian.html" title="Moravian">Moravian</a> Church, a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Orthodox_758c.html" title="Russian Orthodox">Russian Orthodox</a> Church and a Seventh-day Adventist mission school were established in the community. In the 1960s, the State of Alaska constructed a 41 km (25 mile) road connecting Aleknagik to Dillingham.</p>
<p>A federally-recognized tribe is located in the community -- the Aleknagik Traditional Council. The population of the community consists of 84.6% Alaska Native or part Native. It is a traditional Yup'ik Eskimo area, with historical influences from the Seventh-day Adventists, Russian Orthodox and Moravians. Fishing and subsistence activities are practiced. During the 2000 U.S. Census, total housing units numbered 107, and vacant housing units numbered 37. Vacant housing units used only seasonally numbered 21. U.S. Census data for Year 2000 showed 69 residents as employed. The unemployment rate at that time was 21.59 percent, although 51.75 percent of all adults were not in the work force. The median household income was $22,750, per capita income was $10,973, and 40.77 percent of residents were living below the poverty level.</p>

There are three landfill sites. The North Shore landfill is being relocated; the South Shore landfill has an incinerator but is unfenced. A third landfill is located 2 miles from the South Shore, on the West side of the Aleknagik-Dillingham road. Nushagak Electric in Dillingham provides electricity to Aleknagik.

<p>Many residents participate in commercial and subsistence activities on the Bristol Bay coast during the summer. 33 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Trapping is also an important means of income. Most families depend to some extent on subsistence activities to supplement their livelihoods. Salmon, freshwater fish, moose, caribou, and berries are harvested. Poor fish returns and prices since 1997 have significantly affected the community.</p>
<p>Aleknagik is the only regional village with a road link to Dillingham, a 25-mile road which connects the south shore. The "New Aleknagik" airport is a State-owned 2,070' long by 90' wide gravel airstrip located on the north shore, and regular flights are scheduled through Dillingham. The north shore of the lake is not road accessible; residents use skiffs to travel to town on the south shore. Moody's Aleknagik Seaplane Base, also on the north shore, accommodates float planes. There are two additional airstrips, the public Tripod Airport, a 1,250' turf-gravel airstrip located 2 miles southeast of Aleknagik, and the Adventist Mission School Airport, a 1,200' gravel/dirt airstrip with a crosswind runway. The State owns and operates a 100' dock on the north shore of Aleknagik Lake. A breakwater, barge landing, boat launch ramp and boat lift are available on the north shore. Vehicles, skiffs, ATVs and snowmachines are the most frequent means of local transportation.</p>
