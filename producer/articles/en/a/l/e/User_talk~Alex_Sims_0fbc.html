<p>Hi. I knew about the Japanese version of the template for train lines, and have been using its format for the other lines that were made so far. Making a template template is nice, and it will save some time. Thanks for creating it, and I see you started to convert some of the existing lines already. Great! I'll use it for some lines I have the stations all ready for... and I also am happy I found your <a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESoftgrow_Railway_line_WIP_499e.html" title="User:Softgrow/Railway line WIP">User:Softgrow/Railway_line_WIP</a> page of colors.</p>
<p>One reason that I didn't copy the Japanese template/template exactly was because of an idea I have been formulating regarding the mapping of GIS data for the stations into a miniature map graphic on the side of the template, to give an idea of the train line's geography. (That is a major WIP of mine when I'm not distracted with other stuff) Also, I like some of the recent edits to <a href="../../../s/e/n/Template%7ESendai-Subway_b407.html" title="Template:Sendai-Subway">Template:Sendai-Subway</a> (the logo in the corners). I wasn't sure if the mini-map would work well in the template/template or not, and now I don't know about the logo either. And, since everything has an exception (or two), lines like <a href="../../../t/o/h/Template%7ETohoku_Main_Line_e1b3.html" title="Template:Tohoku Main Line">Template:Tohoku Main Line</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/h/Template%7ETohoku_Shinkansen_84f6.html" title="Template:Tohoku Shinkansen">Template:Tohoku Shinkansen</a> need different ways to deal with their branches and overall length.</p>
<p>As for the circle on the Yamanote line, I like the circle better, which is why I deviated from the pattern of the other lines that I made earlier. I've also seen a few comments from others who liked it. I agree that the space taken up by all of the templates is an issue, but there may be other ways to solve it. For the time being, I'd like to revert it back -- I'll remove the colored background, and give it a border instead. When I do that, I'll also put my reasons/preferences for the revert in the talk page of the template, where I'd like to move this discussion about the case for/against the circle and maybe discuss other alternatives to shrink this particular template size down (and the others as well).</p>

<p>Hello Softgrow. I see you have been editing the railways section in Adelaide. Heaps good. For the Finsbury railway station, I have it marked Finsbury on a UBD wallpaper map I have - unfortunately the wall map doesn't have anything about the year of publication at all(I suspect sometime in the 70s). Also, as I was the only editor to that page, feel free to contact me directly, it is more likely to be noticed and I would be pleased (not indignant) to reply to your query. Also my map doesn't have the Semaphore and Exeter train stations, so could you please go to <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semaphore%2C_South_Australia_28bc.html" title="Semaphore, South Australia">Semaphore, South Australia</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeter%2C_South_Australia_5993.html" title="Exeter, South Australia">Exeter, South Australia</a> and describe the previous location and presence of the railway line and stations in the suburb as I have done in <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodville_North%2C_South_Australia_f37b.html" title="Woodville North, South Australia">Woodville North, South Australia</a> as I feel that this is an important and relevant historical aspect of the suburb. Also you could describe where exactly the line was as I have done on <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finsbury_railway_line%2C_Adelaide_dfba.html" title="Finsbury railway line, Adelaide">Finsbury railway line, Adelaide</a> as people no longer have maps which will tell them such information about the geography of the railway line and its neighbourhood.

<p>Hey, I noticed that you resurrected a mis-linked speed limit archives. I did more digging, and I found that the one I originally created had a lower-cased L on "limit." That explans the red link.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you did, but I think it may be best to stick with the original one so that nobody gets suspicious when looking at the history tab. I fixed that link to use a lower-case l on "limit." This page also has some text that is supposedly Wikipedia-compliant for archives.</p>
<p>If you agree, could you flag Talk:Speed_Limit/Archive01 for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">speedy delete</a>?</p>

<p>Having each template is excessive, which is why I intend to replace them with station adjacency templates.

<dd>I would disagree about the collaboration. The articles above have very few redeeming features. In some cases (<a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_limit.html" title="Speed limit">Speed limit</a>) yes there is collaboration to a degree, here I don't think so.

<p>I don't blame you for this. Some of those articles are just awful -- so many people are pushing the cameras are bad POV and will include any link from local papers or whatever to push that POV. It gets wearing setting published research against reports in various local rags. Thanks for removing "thenewspaper" links -- I'd been wanting to do that but was worried it would seem like I was pushing my own POV. --<a href="../../../r/g/c/User%7ERgclegg_deb7.html" title="User:Rgclegg">Richard Clegg</a> 12:54, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Softgrow. I have started a proposal at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal_talk%7EAustralia_f0ce.html" title="Portal talk:Australia">Portal talk:Australia</a> for an inclusion of an anniversary/on this day section to be displayed on the portal. If you are interested in this making this happen, you can comment there or go to the anniversary pages and adding in things that you consider to be notable.

<dd>Hi there, have you been organising this? That's really great of you! Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to make it, as I don't finish lectures 'til 9PM on a Thursday; also, having only lived in Adelaide for about 7 months, I still find myself on the verge of cardiac arrest everytime I try to drive to the city from Bedford Park&#160;:p So, I'm really sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to make it there. However, I am very interested in what you guys will talk about, and I'll keep an eye out for your minutes. Hope you have a good time there, <small>— <a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana_dzasta</a> • <a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">c</a> • <font color="green">e</font> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Riana_dzasta_04dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Riana dzasta">ER</a> • 10:18, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Not sure you're correctly attributing parts to ABD. While they certainly do talk about the issues, it's normally because someone else has already pointed out the problems with these bumps etc. Therefore, I'd suggest changing from criticisms made by ABD to some highlighted by ABD. At least two points in that part were brought up by Auto Express magazine, with tests to show that noise and fuel consumption were significantly greater when in speed bumped areas.</p>

<p>hi alex. perhaps because i am a new contributor, i don't understand "rv POV image designed by an editor (or is original research?)". please tell me why you removed my original image. it is a legitimate illustration of the equipment installed to facilitate the congestion charge and of criticisms related to it. cheers, rob</p>
