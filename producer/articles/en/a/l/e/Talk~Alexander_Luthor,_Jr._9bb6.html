<p>Wow... good job on this page, <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltraexactzz_f2f4.html" title="User:Ultraexactzz">Ultraexactzz</a>! <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexic_agnostic_0405.html" title="User:Dyslexic agnostic">Dyslexic agnostic</a> 00:31, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you, Dyslexic agnostic. I'm sure Ultraexactzz feels the same way. Being a newbie, a compliment is a great thing to hear. On a side note: Ultraexactzz, you did a great job witht the superhero character box. I didn't think there was enough information to make one, but you proved me wrong. I think we can take off the "stub" thingie at the end of the article now. Does anyone know how to check if there are any images of Alex Luthor already uploaded into Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 01:14, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks! I'm thrilled we were able to pull so much together so quickly. I'm still working on a good picture, which I think is the only major item missing. Ace and I seem to make a good team, it seems!</p>
<p>I agree about the Stub tag, as well - fini. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltraexactzz_f2f4.html" title="User:Ultraexactzz">ZZ</a> 01:18, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it seems we do make a good team. The article will look even greater once you find a good picture. If you can somehow find it, I'd suggest taking the image of Alex from the standard non-Perez cover of Infinite Crisis #2 (the one where you can see Power Girl's face). Another thing that remains is caregorizing this article. Under what categories should it go besides "Fictional characters", "DC comics characters", "DC comics heroes", "DC comics villains", etc.? What about "Fictional Red-heads with golden armors"? --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 01:30, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Got the Lee cover, let me know what you think. I think the catagories you have are good for now - esp. the armor one ^_^ <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltraexactzz_f2f4.html" title="User:Ultraexactzz">ZZ</a></dd>

<ul>
<li>Some minor corrections:
<ul>
<li>Earth-Three was destroyed by the same Anti-Matter wave that destroyed most of the DC Multiverse's Earths; The Anti-Monitor didn't try to use a cannon until after the last 5 Earths were protected by the Monitor's aura.</li>
<li>The device that brought him to Earth-one definitely wasn't a rocket, more like interdimensional capsule.</li>
<li>It was Harbinger who found the infant Alex.</li>
<li>Alexander had a important role helping lead the heroes against the Anti-Monitor, along Harbinger and Pariah.</li>
<li>According to the comics research done in the Unofficial DC Universe Chronology website, the Crisis actually lasted from 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
<li>The final section contains some speculations, which according to the rules shouldn't be included in Wiki articles. I don't want to start an argument like the one that happened in the Infinite Crisis page, so I'm letting other decide if it should be edited. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfredo_Martinez_bee1.html" title="User:Wilfredo Martinez">Wilfredo Martinez</a> 02:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, we should probably scale back the speculation in the last paragraph... Though I agree with Ace that recent activities in Infinite Crisis should be mentioned. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltraexactzz_f2f4.html" title="User:Ultraexactzz">ZZ</a> 02:40, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed then, I'll try to put something less speculative in the last paragraph in a while. So before we start putting the category hyperlinks, can we state that there is a consensus that he is, at least partially, a villain? --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 03:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I just did some copyediting, so take a look first before changing... I wouldn;t classify as a villain until the IC series is over, he certainly was a hero in 1985! Something to think about, anyway. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexic_agnostic_0405.html" title="User:Dyslexic agnostic">Dyslexic agnostic</a> 03:53, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I think I should direct everyone's attention to a certain problem: until yesterday, "Alexander Luthor" redirected to <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>, which makes sense since that's Lex's full name, but unfortunately someone else, seemingly at our behest as seen the IC talk page, started another article about Alexander Luthor, Jr. over at "<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Luthor_840d.html" title="Alexander Luthor">Alexander Luthor</a>" a while after we "de-stubbed" this article. It will not only be confusing due to the fact that there are now two different articles for the same character with different amounts of information, but also because we decided that the "Jr." be a necessary part of any article describing this character, since otherwise it's easy to confuse Lex and Alex. Is there any way we can (after taking whatever relevant information there is over at "<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Luthor_840d.html" title="Alexander Luthor">Alexander Luthor</a>" and putting it here) make "Alexander Luthor" a disambiguation page directing you to either <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Luthor%2C_Jr._55d3.html" title="Alexander Luthor, Jr.">Alexander Luthor, Jr.</a>? "Alex Luthor", on the other hand, should redirect here. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 07:10, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, the two pages should be merged, we don't need two articles on the same character (though Alexander's father MIGHT deserve a Wikipedia entry of his own.) The information on how Alexander helped defeat the Anti-Monitor should certainly be included, though the detailed description of his actions (in Villains United and Infinite Crisis) should probably be shorter, it's almost a synopsis of the series so far. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfredo_Martinez_bee1.html" title="User:Wilfredo Martinez">Wilfredo Martinez</a> 13:42, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>perhaps you might want to add genius level intellect. This seemed to be displayed in both crisies. Although never fully articulated, with both displays of knowledge CIE and IC, and his parentage I feel its not a leap.
<dl>
<dd>Disagree. No leaping to independent research or speculation. Is Donald Trump a genius because he can make loads of money by shrewd business choices? Let's not play fast and loose with the term genius. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexic_agnostic_0405.html" title="User:Dyslexic agnostic">Dyslexic agnostic</a> 17:26, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And intellect is hardly a superpower, but does Alex's have anything to do with the way he gained his powers? Or was is illustrated in "Crisis On Infinite Earths" how he was instructed in a matter as complex as saving a Multiverse when he had only been alive for a few weeks? I haven't read the original Crisis for ages, though I recently ordered the trade paperback. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 20:20, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Superintelligence DOES count as a super power (see Brainiac) However, we haven't seen any proof yet that his genius is beyond human level. In my opinion, Alex's powers are not clear yet. We know that he can create interdimensional portals (from the first Crisis) and now we have seen him blast the power-armored Luthor. He did not have that power previously.(Note: there is speculation going around the internet that Alex might be possessed by the Anti-Monitor, leading to the villain's return in a future issue of IC; if this is correct, his new powers might not be his, but his possessor's. This is still mere rumor, though it makes sense, and DC has confirmed (in one of Didio's interviews) that a MAJOR villain will return in IC, so it's very possible. I'm not asking for this rumor to be included, but certainly we should point out that his exact powers aren't clear yet (in fact, his disguise as Luthor was due to one of his machines, as seen in IC #3, not shapeshifting.) Also: where did all the machines he's been using (specially his "floating computers") come from? Does Alex possess the power to create matter? That was one of the Monitor's abilities (and presumably, the Anti-Monitor's as well...) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfredo_Martinez_bee1.html" title="User:Wilfredo Martinez">Wilfredo Martinez</a> 14:00, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hhhhmmm...you're right, that's a viable possibility. In fact, it helps make sense out of the fact that Alexander's floating computers look exactly the same as Donna Troy's (see IC#2). Donna recently discovered Dark Angel and Lyla (Harbinger) were alternate universe versions of herself. Since Donna has pretty much taken up Harbinger's place in the new Crisis, it makes sense she would be able to generate those computers. But how could Alex do the exact same thing...without having been powered by a similar source? --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 05:15, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, looking at the issue, he does reach out towards the reader, with his fingers overlapping some panels and so forth. Then, he turns away from the reader, as Superboy Prime and Superboy crash into his tower. I'd say it's a bit of an homage to the old concept of Earth-Prime, but nothing more than that.
