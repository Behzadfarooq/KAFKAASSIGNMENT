<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_Bakharev_Archive6_f2b6.html" title="Edit section: 3RR">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">3RR</span></h2>
<p>This is a post on my talkpage, I crosspost here to make sure you read it.</p>
<p>After a short wikibreak, I am furious to learn that I had been blocked from editing on the issue of removing warnings from my talkpage, 3RR, and lack of communication. Listed below is a concise and brief explanation.</p>
<p>1. Removing warnings:</p>
<p>A. One is perfectly entitled to remove such warnings from his/her talkpage. An admin support my claim.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51310558" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51310558" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] Another user removed my warning from his talkpage.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henry_Flower&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50938446" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henry_Flower&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50938446" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. To add to that the warnings is justified. An admin support my case. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60587087" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60587087" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60586139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60586139" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] support from another user. Read the full length discussion on <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a> talkpage under the heading User:RevolverOcelotX.</p>
<p>B. Even if I am not allowed to remove such warnings, the warning clearly isn't justified. According to the history of List of Chinese Americans and Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China articles, you would see Bonafide.hustla and RevolverOcelotX had both made 3 reverts in the past 24 hours 2 days ago. However, when the initial warning was placed by RevolverOcelotX I made only 1 edit to the article, making the warning totally irrelevant. He placed the warning on the ground that I BROKEN the 3RR on my user talk page after the final warning. As evident in the above discussion, an admin states that 3RR does not apply to a user's personal talkpage. The accusation is groundless.</p>
<p>2. 3RR Again, the 3RR clearly states that a block should only occur if I have made MORE than 3 reverts in the last 24 hrs for an article. I did not unless you count my personal talkpage, but we already established the 3RR does not apply to personal talkpages. See A. and B. above for further details.</p>
<p>3. Lack of communication</p>
<p>A. A series of POV pushing by RevolverOcelotX occured when he first arrived at wikipedia, when I revert his edits as an effort to preserve NPOV (never violating 3RR), he started to engage himself in edit warring with me and many other users [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Chinese_Americans&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Chinese_Americans&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] While I have also posted relevant reasons for reverts in both edit summary and relevant talkpages, he failed to do so. When I attempted to communicate in order to end edit warring, he angrily responded and continue to make POV edits specifically in Taiwanese-Chinese relation. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60572691&amp;oldid=60555868" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60572691&amp;oldid=60555868" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]</p>
<p>4. Conduct of User:RevolverOcelotX</p>
<p>A. Ever since this user's initial arrival, he has been on a crusade to distort information about Taiwan, China articles. see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>].</p>
<p>B. His behavior is similar to <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a> (who has received an indef. block for bootless wikilawyering and disruption) and often commits wikilawyering. He is in the process of wasting the community's patience. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>]</p>
<p>C. This user went as far as harassing admin to support my case in order to prove his point. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60587999&amp;oldid=60587087" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60587999&amp;oldid=60587087" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]</p>
<p>D. This user even edit the naming convention: Chinese in order to justify his edits. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]</p>
<p>Conclusion: It is obvious that this particular user is a vexatious litigant and the fact that the block on me is not justified. Thanks and I hope someone will restore this unfair treatment.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 23:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Alex. I saw your block notice on Bonafide.hustla's talkpage and meant to review the block, but I simply didn't have time to dig into his contribs to find the violation. I don't mean to bitch at you, but it would be great if you'd mention specifics in block notices, especially in the case of 3RR, because those really are a bit of a business to find. Anyway, now that BH has protested the block--retroactively--I suppose I really ought to take a look. Could you tell me what page it was about, please? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:58, 27 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Hi, Alex! Unfortunatelly, I have to disagree with you. You wrote "there is no discussion", but there was one. You may consider the discussion "not meaningful", but "no discussion" and "miningless discussion" is not the same. "No discussion" is a solid fact that can be checked by inspecting the page history. "Meaningless discussion" is your judgement and other people may disagree with you.</dd>
<dd>Even if one of the parties consider the dispute "miningless" it does not mean that there is no dispute at all and such a judgement does not justify the tag removal.</dd>
<dd>I think, your summary has to be slightly corrected. Thanks.--<a href="../../../m/b/u/User%7EMbuk_9301.html" title="User:Mbuk">Mbuk</a> 06:34, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I like what you did with the external links there. After reverting Elk Salmon's rename of Pro-Umarov to Al Qaeda, I was thanked by <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">User:Ldingley</a> on my talk page. I suppose he does not know I am of Masurian descent.&#160;;&gt;) Yes, I must really do something about my name on en:wikipedia. Pan Gerwazy is a crusader name, which was alright to use in newsgroups (anyone who understands Dutch, French or German can google my earlier presence there and find out who I am) but on Wikipedia it sounds like Napoleon, Bonaparte (sic) or Robespierre.</p>
<p>However, Ldingley's intervention did inspire me. Why should Prague watchdog be listed under "Pro-Umarov" sites. I agree that these guys are one-sided, but choosing sides is not their avowed policy. On the other hand, the yahoo group is "moderated". But moderated by whom? Look at the comments of a/the moderator here: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chechnya-sl/message/48819" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chechnya-sl/message/48819" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>Yes, he affirms he does not know anything about law, but still he thinks he has the right to condemn French judges. On the basis of this (+99% of the news articles quoted are anti-Russia - I know this because I often go there for a quick English version of long Russian articles - my Russian is a bit rusty), I would be inclined to say Prague Watchdog and this yahoo group belong in the same category - move the yahoo group to Pro-Umarov, I would say.

<dd>Well, I guess the question is Irpen's comments on AndriyK's editorial patterns on <a href="../../../u/k/r/Talk%7EUkrainization_9511.html" title="Talk:Ukrainization">Talk:Ukrainization</a>. The significant part of the talk is devoted to discussions about the tags inserted by the user. Many editors suspect that the tags were not inserted in the good faith. In this case a brief factual analysis of the AndriyK's editorial pattern is IMHO appropriate and relevant to the article. Such a discussion obviously should not include attacks on the personal qualities of the user, swear words, etc. - but only facts about his edits to the moment. Such an analysis is not in my humble opinion a Personal attack but rather an attempt to figure out what to do with the tags introduced by the user. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 13:44, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All of this pales of course in comparison to the threat of Ghirla leaving. I actually thought he had a point. And again I am partial, living in Belgium. His alignment ensured that the text about the church in Leuven/Louvain was close to its picture. IN the other version, that was not the case.

<p>I have blocked four editors (and warned a fifth), most of whom I consider to be productive. The problem is that despite a long history of edit warring at that article, and warnings about edit warring before, and a prior protection of that article, all of the editors in question, including Irpen, continued that sterile edit war. It's just 24 hours to cool off and take the time to think about the edit warring a bit before it gets too far. The first revert I cited was a content addition (which wasn't what I was citing) along with reverting the tag again in the same edit. The fact that the same people continued edit warring but used different tags does not change the fact of the unporductive edit war. I don't quite see a reason to reverse the block, as talk page discussion tempered with continuing reverting is not all that helpful. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Grafikm reverted twice today (which is considerably different than three times in seven days), and the self-revert is true, but it's only because (as the edit history shows) he meant to revert AndriyK and continue the edit war, but Telex reverted AndriyK first, so he accidentally reverted Telex. It was still participating in an edit war. No one is entitled to revert, two per day or otherwise. The fact is that his unproductive edit warring today has reignited the conflict unnecessarily. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

To me, it looks like you are trying to tag a specific revert number to a specific time frame, when it seems like the sensible thing to do is look at the situation, especially as it has developed over time, and conclude that this will continue unabated over time if the participants are allowed to continue edit warring like nothing is wrong.

<p>I've looked at the anon user's edit &amp; at Karrmann's complaint, as well as the block notice, and I was wondering if everything really added up on this one, in hindsight. There seems to be a misapprehension on Karrmann's part about what Anon intended with his comment. I'm not seeing anything in Anon's comment to support Karrmann's assertion that Anon is a "predater" (sic). On that basis, I was wondering if a block of this duration makes sense in retrospect, and I was hoping I could persuade you to give it a second look. As an aside, I have no connection to either of these users. I just happened to see the abuse report and had a hard time understanding what abuse needed reported to the anon user's ISP.

<p>Since GoldToeMarionette was strictly following Wikipedia Policy, there should not have been a Check User completed by Jayjg. Hall Monitor only blocked the account because it was labeled as a sockpuppet by Jayjg's completed Check User. Absent policy violation it should not have been processed in RFCU or been blocked.

<p>Alex, this user, and a sock puppet <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangFeihung_c66c.html" title="User:WangFeihung">he allegedly controls</a> continues to add non-NPOV statements on the <a href="../../../a/n/s/Anson_Chan_494e.html" title="Anson Chan">Anson Chan</a> articles, alleging that the British colonial administrations committed brutalities and atrocities in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>He has repeated added his Communist comments on the Anson Chan page despite numerous warnings from me and others who care about this, and calls those who disagrees with his commentaries anti-Chinese and Nazis. I am begging with you to please ban this user, or at least approve a page protection for the Anson Chan page. I hope I will hear from you soon. Thanks for your attention to this matter. --<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">Arbiteroftruth</a> 02:59, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>–––––––<br />
Dear Alex, I wish to clarify some confusions you have about the British administration in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, the British government was not elected, but never, ever did it exercised any dictatorial powers (although theoretically, it can rightly do so). The only time the British administration did exercised any form of rights restriction was during the 1960's leftist protests. The leftists at the time, allegedly mobilised by the Maoist government in China at the time, attempted to violently overthrow the British administration and install a communist regime.</p>
<p>Many Hong Kong people were content with the British administration, and don't care so much about politics. Interests in politics only increased in recent years because Hong Kong people wanted to get rid of a bad leader (he eventually resigned).</p>
<p>WangFeiHung clearly sides with the leftist crowd. These people have wreaked havoc in Hong Kong before, and wished to foist upon the Hong Kong people a Communist government, and yet, WangFeiHung dares to even say that the British Administration dictates and brutalizes the Hong Kong people! Surely, Wikipedia has not turned into a Maoist cafe of opinions!</p>
<p>Although the outcome what not the one I desired, and that I am not in agreement with the decision, I will respect it and I wish to thank you for your attention to this matter. However, I wish you will change your mind on this matter. WFH's edits are extremely POV and this cannot be allowed if Wikipedia is to have even an iota of reputation for impartiality. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">Arbiteroftruth</a> 05:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>–––––––<br />
Alex, leftist are people too, I understand, but everyone who thinks is a human on this planet, no matter how extreme their beliefs are. I mean, dictators are people too, by this definition. I can personally attest to the fact that WangFeiHung's beliefs on this matter is a purely leftist belief, and in Hong Kong, they are as close to "The Earth is flat, and Isreal caused it" as you can get. Hong Kong people, who suffered from leftist protests and Communist regimes before, do not like leftist ideologies. --<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">Arbiteroftruth</a> 05:43, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>–––––––<br />
I will adhere to your advice on this matter. If things get serious (blatant vandalism arises), I will officially request that he be banned. However, he does allegedly have a sockpuppet (user:Wangfeihung). What should we do about that? --<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">Arbiteroftruth</a> 06:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thanks for the ban, Alex. O BTW, Alex, I am thinking about getting an adminship in the future. Given the contribs I have made as of now, do you think I have what it takes?
