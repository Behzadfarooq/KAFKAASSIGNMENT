<p>Thinking aloud - Given that Catholicism is an integral part of the Polish Society: -Would it be relevant to include more on his stance with the Church? -What was the Church’s response? -The public’s response? -How did this affect his term? -Did the Pope ever accept a visit from him?</p>

<p>Folks, the rephrase of his official bio just wasn't very good, so I reordered it and improved the text, which wasn't up to native-English standard. I think the article could still use quite a bit of work, and I'll add more detail later, such as the important details of EU membership, advocacy for Ukraine, the Kosovo and Iraq wars, the controversy surrounding his first election, etc. It would be great to have the picture of him and Wałęsa shaking hands at John Paul II's funderal, if copyright allows. Likewise, I put in some improvements on the page about <a href="../../../j/o/l/Jolanta_Kwasniewska_8bc1.html" title="Jolanta Kwasniewska">Jolanta Kwasniewska</a>, but it's still far from perfect. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 10:59, 2005 May 22 (UTC)</p>
