<p>Constanz, Zinoviev’s works are not pessimistic by definition of the term. “Cynical”, on the other hand, has no negative connotation, and precisely describes his works, which tell us that, basically, all people are scoundrels <small>(similarly to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Adams_9c28.html" title="Scott Adams">Scott Adams</a>’ <i><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert_and_the_Way_of_the_Weasel_e6d8.html" title="Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel">Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel</a></i>)</small>. Now, I hope that I will not have to explain to you why this passage has no place in Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The stories are made delibaretly chaotic in form so as to show the absurd and paradoxality of Soviet everyday life.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>...although I have reasons to suspect that you sincerely believe that <i>this</i> is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 08:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Ramir, if you think Soviet life was not absurd, it's your personal pov and you have every right for that. But: the very sentence quoted by you is not my invention: sorry to say, I've exactly taken it from Websters Concice Encyclopedia. You may of course argue that I need to quote then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of expressing your personal ideas about mr. Zinovyev you might give the translations of his titles. Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 15:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You attribute to me what I do not have. The reason why the words from <i>Websters Concise</i> are... eh, not encyclopedic, is not because of my positive attitude to Soviet life, but because the sentence:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>is a first-hand judgement with no backing. (no examples, references or anything)</dd>
<dd>is vague (the words “<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos.html" title="Chaos">chaotic</a>”, “absurd”, “paradoxality” do not mean much in this context, but are emotionally charged)</dd>
<dd>is incompetent (Zinoviev has never been an outright hater of Soviet life; if some believe so, it is because all they know about Zinoviev is from dodgy <s>Western</s> biased secondary sources)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If “chaotic” here means “haphazard” or “disorderly” there may be one reason for it: <i>The Yawning Heights</i> is in fact a compilation of various short stories by Zinoviev. I am not sure about his other works, but they may be compilations as well. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 19:20, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, on cynicism and pessimism. As I have said, the word “cynicism” is not emotional. That Zinovyev’s works are all cynical is not a completely inarguable truth, but... it just describes his works very well, and very few would disagree with such judgement. It is well-defined and neutral. If there was a scientific method for measuring cynicism of a given text, Zinoviev’s works would certainly pass the test. But anyway, I agree that if one is picky, I cannot really defend the neutrality of such a statement. Well, at least we’ve removed the “pessimistic” from there. (you see, Zinovyev was <i>not pessimistic enough</i> about the fate of the Soviet Union.) <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 19:20, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>it is because all they know about Zinoviev is from dodgy Western biased secondary sources</i> I would remind you I am from 'East' as you appearantly are; my sources are Zinovyev's translations into Estonian and comments by translators/literature scholars.

<dl>
<dd>Sorry if misunderstood; I did not mean <i>you</i> by saying that. Nevertheless, all Western sources I have read are, more or less, like I described. And thus I am against direct copying of their critique of Zinoviev into this article: even if all journalists outside Russia write that Zinoviev is (/was) an anti-Communist or a pro-Communist, it is still not neutral to present that opinion as a fact. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 20:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A defined anti-communist or not, he used to be <b>against communism</b> and now he is obviously <b>for communism</b>. Article should reflect it.Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 18:05, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First of all, Zinoviev has never been “for” Communism. That he was “against” Communism is a much easier point to claim, but if Zinoviev himself was to comment on it, he would, I bet, say that such words are not defined well enough, and thus can not be entirely true or false. Let me approach this issue from another end: if, say, an Estonian wrote a satirical novel about life in modern-day provincial Estonian town, <i>would he be called anti-liberal</i>, or anti-Estonian or anti-Western, etc.? I have read all interviews and publications by Zinoviev I could put my hands on (<small>except most of the scientific ones</small>), and I have met no justification to call him an anti- or pro- Communist or -something else. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 10:34, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Ramir, you're not right. Zinovyev now <b>is for communism</b>, this is without a shadow of doubt (isn't his support for CPRF proof enough? and see <a href="http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2003/09/100680.shtml" class="external free" title="http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2003/09/100680.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2003/09/100680.shtml</a> and his interview for Pravda, where Z admitted everything he has written about Soviet life is true, but had he known what followed, he would not have written a single line of it).</dd>
<dd>And pls stop these arguments that if someone is critical of something, then he is not necessarily opposed to it. See quotations by Z. <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Search/Aleksandr_Zinovyev" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Search/Aleksandr_Zinovyev" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I've collected and tell me, was he against Communism (I'd say, he was furious enemy of it) or not. I really don't know why do you want to make things look milder than they really are. Zinoviev has the disposition of being furiously opposed to smth, and he has maintained it, finding new thingas to hate and what I've read from this author clearly shows that he used to hate Soviet Communism no less than Solzhenitsyn, so let us call things with proper names, shall we? Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 12:35, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please trust that I do not want to promote a political POV or “whitewash” anything about Zinoviev. His support of the CPRF <i>just after Perestroika and in the beginning of 90’s</i> was only the sensible man’s strife to save his homeland from the (actual and observable) economical catastrophe. He has never proclaimed to be a supporter of the Communist ideology itself. In the latest works and interviews, he still calls Marxism an ideology with no scientific basis. On the other hand, I object to the use of the term “anti-Communist” for its vagueness. Even if Z ever was “against Communism”, it can not be completely true, since, in some ways, he has always been “against” any other political doctrine or movement in the world. If it sounds like a demagogy to you, here is a dry and simple justification, “debate-style”: Zinoviev has never appealed to destroy or reform Communism, or proclaimed <i>political views</i> that oppose those of Marxism-Leninism. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 13:00, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You previous claims can be regarded only as sophistry. You maintain, <i>Zinoviev has never appealed to destroy or reform Communism, or proclaimed</i> political views <i>that oppose those of Marxism-Leninism.</i> Let us examine the question then.</p>
<p><a name="Opposition_put_into_effect" id="Opposition_put_into_effect"></a></p>

<p>As for support for destroying communism I would only mention a simple fact known to me: all 3 books by Zinoviev published in my native language (1989-1991) have a notification: <i>the author donates the fee to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Patria_Union_%28Estonia%29_2d62.html" title="Pro Patria Union (Estonia)">Estonian National Independence Party</a></i> (didn't this party aim at putting an end to Soviet rule and communism, at least in Estonia, eh?).</p>
<p>In the author's foreword, he explains his ideas concerning USSR:</p>
<p><i>As a Russian I welcome the liberation movements of every people in the USSR. Already in my youth I presented my minimal and maximal programme for the solution of national problems. The first one would be: the Russian Federation should step out of the USSR. The second: Russian population should step out of the Russian SFSR. Those, whom I presented my programme, regarded it as a joke and laughed at it.</i> (author's foreword to 'Gorbatšovism, Tallinn, 1990'.)</p>
<p>(But Ramir clears our doubts away: 'Zinoviev has never appealed to destroy or reform Communism ...!!!)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now, this is something very new and surprising to me! I admit my ignorance of this, and will try to find more about his “donations”. <b>Still</b>, this is not enough to call him an anti-Communist. Instead, we should write that Zinoviev said this and that. The reader will judge and brand Z’s political views for himself, OK? And it is unclear to me, whether he wrote that <i>in, or shortly before 1990</i> (which I find incredible), or that he “presented his programme” back in 1970’s? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 01:51, 11 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The foreword was written <i>November 18, 1989</i>. And that's the end of the matter: he furiously opposed Marxism in his writings (these sentences proof enough, I think), portrayed life in USSR in dark tones and as hopeless (this is not cynicism, cynicism is when you just laugh at the stupidity of people, which you regard as worthless), supported nationalist movemnt(s). The particular movement founded in August, 1988, was the first (massive) opposition party in the USSR, and its supporters could onlyt be radical anti-communists. And that's enough for Z.'s anti-communism.</dd>

<p>From the end of 1980s on, Zinoviev rejects the basic values of the Western society (...) emerges with the <b>apology of Soviet system</b> and Marxist theory which contradicts with his own sociology and the theory of scientific communism.'</p>
<p>(my approximate translation of some sentences from [<a href="http://liverum.com/content/ZINOV.EV_Aleksandr_Aleksandrovich-22525.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://liverum.com/content/ZINOV.EV_Aleksandr_Aleksandrovich-22525.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>])</p>

<dd>“Apology of Soviet system” is, again, a vague description. Instead of relying (re-lying) on secondary sources, we should provide a direct reference to Zinoviev’s “apologies” in the article. <b>Yes</b>, I know that he said that if he knew (back in 1970’s) that the Union was about to collapse, he would not write any of his works on socialistic Russia.

<dd>I know about these; and I know that Zinoviev has not changed his mind about Marxism. Thus, if these quotations are your proof of Zinoviev’s anti-Communism, he still is an anti-Communist.

<p>I only strive to keep this article <i><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a></i>, true and precise. We should put in it <i>as many facts and opinions</i> about Zinoviev as there are, but Wikipedia’s NPOV policy dictates that all of those opinions must be referenced. <i>Branding</i> (like calling someone a good guy, a sad guy, a cynic, a bird-hater, a snail-eater, or an anti-Communist) <i>is unacceptable</i> outside quotations and references, since it does not provide clear knowledge, but allows various interpretations, and is often emotionally charged. So, Constanz, let us, instead of arguing, edit the article according to the policies. You, for example, can write that “In 1984, Zinoviev was called an anti-Communist by the German newspaper X”, or “Zinoviev wrote about Marxism[1] that it is (...)”. But please, do not generalise things and <i>do not present opinions from secondary sources as facts</i> in the article, even if they seem totally justified to you. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 01:51, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the section "Youth" we find the statement: <i>He (Zinoviev) recalls that he has been arrested but managed to escape, and later involved in a plot to assassinate Stalin during a school parade.</i> Are these claims <b>credible</b>? They seem exceedingly far-fetched to me. Is there any third-party corroboration for these claims or is Zinoviev the only source for them? Either way, the fact of corroboration or lack thereof needs to be put in the article. Hi There 21:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
