<p>"You added Svatos as a rival, but not Phaneuf? Prucha? Say something along the lines of '...his fellow rookies Dion Phaneuf and Sidney Crosby. Rivals Petr Prucha and Marek Svatos were injured midway through the season, effectively removing them from the rookie race.' -Earthhuman</p>
<p><br />
"His parents say they knew he would be an athlete when Alexander chose to run up the steps to their apartment rather than take the elevator."</p>
<p>That's an awful example- Even I run up the stairs, and I'm no athelete. I deleted it. -Earthhuman</p>

<p>The number of images here went beyond fair use. We can only claim [[fair use] if an image is really required for the article. I've reduced the images to only four.

<p>I was told to take this to the discussion page, so here you go:</p>
<p>I still have serious legal doubts: it obviously comes from television footage, and there's usually a warning that any broadcast, redistribution, et cetera is prohibited without express written consent. But I couldn't find that in writing anywhere, so I'll just let it be an open question for now (I used the same copyright tag as the last guy, but I'm very skeptical. I'd say it's more fair-use than anything).</p>
<p>However, the "Sidney who?" is a pretty blatant shot at Sidney Crosby. While I agree in sentiment, it's kind of cheap and sophomoric and really has no place here, especially given the rigid point-of-view stance. I replaced it with another image to improve the NPOV side of things.</p>
<p>I really don't mean to come off as anal as I probably am -- hell, I love the kid -- but when something as blatant as that pops up, it's kind of hard not to edit it out. I hope that the new image is a happy medium (it's better, anyway) and if it is legally sketchy, Wikipedia will probably take it down anyway. --<a href="../../../e/d/27/User%7EEd%27s_Babe_3b96.html" title="User:Ed's Babe">Ed's Babe</a> 23:00, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I loaded the original image, however I did not create it, it was sent to me in an email. As for the "Sidney Who", I didn't even notice it until after someone pointed it out and pulled it off -- lesson of the day: watch the entire GIF closely before loading. &#160;:-)</p>

<p>Nothing personal: just fixed the POV. Further on the legal front: I noticed that you got a copyright warning for the original image, so I just sent off a request to foxsports.com. With any luck, we'll get comfirmation one way or another (leave it up or take it down) soon. It's a bit of a crapshoot, but it's better than a 100% chance of being removed (if we just left it to the administrators). If that doesn't work, I can try Comcast SportsNet because there's no way to tell where the feed came from: it's not trying to buck the system; it could honestly be either team's broadcast. I'll drop a message here when I hear back from FSN.</p>
<p>P.S.: I was at last night's game: two more points for Ovy and for the Caps!--<a href="../../../e/d/27/User%7EEd%27s_Babe_3b96.html" title="User:Ed's Babe">Ed's Babe</a> 21:19, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's been two and a half weeks since I e-mailed my copyright request to Fox Sports about the image and I haven't gotten a response. I take this to mean that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>They're okay with it;</li>
<li>They don't care enough to bother;</li>
<li>They're blowing us off entirely;</li>
<li>They're caught up in red tape because the regional Arizona FSN and Comcast Sportsnet both aired the game, and it might have to go to the NHL for review, and they could do any of 1-3, or</li>
<li>They're in the midst of weeks of intense deliberations about whether an animated .gif of Alexander Ovechkin may be used on a Web site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever it is, I'm taking it as a "yes" until/unless I hear otherwise. Number four is extremely unlikely since I'd have received an e-mail saying that they're checking on it. Again, I'm taking the two and a half weeks without even a form letter as a signal that they don't care.

<p>In the second paragraph, it states that as a child, Ovechkin "threw all his toys." Where is this quote coming from? If it's from his Russophone parents, we're dealing with an idiomatic word (<i>бросил все свои игрушки</i>) that translates better as "dropped" than "threw." In a sense, what I think they're trying to say is that he abandoned playing with toys in favor of watching hockey games on TV. --<a href="../../../i/v/a/User%7EIvanP_1e5f.html" title="User:IvanP">IvanP</a>/<a href="../../../i/v/a/User_talk%7EIvanP_c818.html" title="User talk:IvanP">(болтай)</a> 22:21, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Alexander's parents own a gay/lesbian night club to which he frequently attends."</p>

<p>Alexander the Great, Alexander the Eight, A.O. OV-1 and 8 Train? 5 nicknames? As far as I know CCM had a competition for Ovechkin's official nickname, the winning contribution was "Alexander the GR8". Even though I hate that nickname it should be in the infobox, and IMO the Alexander the Great should be there too. But there is no use for the other 4 nicknames, where one is a abbreviation and the other is his initials.

<p>First off, let me say I'm a big fan of Ovechkin. I think he is the most exciting player in hockey right now, and I can't wait to see all the great things he will do in the next 20 years. But, I have a few questions and comments about the animated GIF image of his goal against Phoenix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it titled "The Goal"? There's no mention of it being called this in the article. If it has been called "The Goal," we need a reference in the text.</li>
<li>There's no doubt this is a great goal, but why is it on Wikipedia? Most, if not everyone, who is a hockey fan has already seen it. This animated GIF makes this page look more like a fan-page than an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>I don't understand the fair-use rationale for this image. On its page, the claim is made that "This is a historic event." I would consider an assassination of a president, war being declared, a record-breaking sports performance, an enourmous charitable donation, and many other events "historic," but not this.</li>
<li>This image is 1.1 megabytes in size. Worldwide, many use Wikipedia with a low-speed connection. I think this image is too large, especially because its importance is questionable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well here i saw it for the first time and that was for sure the greatest thing ive ever seen in hockey. I think its really important and awesome thing to have in an encyclopedia. It shouldnt be removed from this page in my opinion. Shur4 18:43, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hockey fans and media regularly refer to this goal as "The Goal." In the article (next to the GIF), it is described in detail. I added a reference to the term "The Goal." I think that does the trick, and I do think the GIF should stay. -- mmiller20910</p>

<p>I specifically came to this page looking for that gif or a related video of exactly that. I can't imagine the picture not being in an article on him. Nwarner79 04:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I personally think it was the luckiest goal in NHL history. <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgz33_09cc.html" title="User:Burgz33"><i><b><span style="background-color: #5badff; color:#ffffff">&#160;burgz&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../b/u/r/User_talk%7EBurgz33_7dd5.html" title="User talk:Burgz33"><span style="background-color:White; color:#5badff">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 09:02, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"He is considered to be one of the greatest professional hockey players of all time."</p>
<p>Please, that's a little prematureAlso, I don't think a lot of people would share that view quite yet. He is on his way for sure, but he isn't in that league right now.</p>

<p>Maybe we could throw in a pronunciation of his last name since they may be some people out there who unsure (myself included).</p>

<p>There has been an unsourced statement in the Trivia section for a while now saying that Alex listens to <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rammstein.html" title="Rammstein">Rammstein</a> before games. Unless his musical tastes have changed, he prefers lighter music than Rammstein, per <a href="http://www.rushockey.com/events.php?i=nhl&amp;stream=nhl_interviews&amp;id=360" class="external text" title="http://www.rushockey.com/events.php?i=nhl&amp;stream=nhl_interviews&amp;id=360" rel="nofollow">this interview</a>. WashingtonCaps.com says that he likes to listen to techno and hip-hop, and various articles I've read on news sites confirm that. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 21:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
