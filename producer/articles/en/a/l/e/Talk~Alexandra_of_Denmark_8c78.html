<p>The oldest son of Alix and Bertie was called 'Albert Victor', not 'Albert Edward', which was Bertie's name. (I don't know how he got the nickname 'Eddy' I don't know. Maybe Edward was a subsequent name, but history records him as Albert Victor.<br />
<i>Source: Harold Nicolson, King George V - family tree at the back.</i></p>
<p>Alix's suicide attempt, and the fashion craze started by the high 'choker' collars, was reported in newspaper coverage on royal suicide attempts that followed claims about Diana, Princess of Wales's supposed suicide attempt. It featured in a number of Irish, British and continental papers, as well as in magazines. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 01:11 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Would the British Royal Family settle for a piddling two names? I think not&#160;;). Edward was indeed a subsequent name: <b>Albert Victor Christian Edward, Duke of Clarence</b>. I had never heard the choker bit, very interesting...and rather an unusual suicide method. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 01:15 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanx. I didn't have his full name. I presumed Eddy was in there somewhere but he was formally known simply as <i>Albert Victor</i> just as the Duke of Windsor was known as 'Prince Edward' even though his family called him David.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently Alix tried to cut her own throat. When it was a <i>genuine</i> suicide attempt, or something akin to one of Diana's melodramatic 'suicide' attempts (one of which apparently used a knife that was so blunt (and which she knew was so blunt) that it wouldn't cut melted butter!) Alix does come across as a very nice, genuine woman. But people who knew of the scar found it bizarre that millions of women in Britain, Ireland and even America began wearing Choker Collars (often made of lace), having absolutely no idea that Alix wasn't making a fashion choice but was trying to conceal a major scar. Indeed, quite apart from the suicide link, she and Diana were quite alike; strikingly beautiful women in marriages that were none too solid, with difficult relationships with courtiers, married to husbands who if they inherited the throne at all, would only inherit it in old age.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One can only hope that Prince William isn't a modern equivalent of poor Prince Eddy, who was mentally deficient (to put it mildly); others called him at the time mentally retarded'. And the poor lad did have a habit of stumbling quite innocently into 'scandals'; from supposedly being 'Jack the Ripper' (a bit difficult given that for one of the murders, he was up in Balmoral, in full view of Queen Victoria, the German Kaiser, the Prime Minister and senior ministers at dinner. (Even in the days of Concorde, he'd have difficulty getting down to London, murder a prostitute, and then get back to Balmoral in time for dessert! )The of course, there was the rumour that he was caught up in the Cleveland St. gay brothel scandal. I think Britain's monarchy had a lucky escape when he died and the throne went to his younger brother, who as George V was one of Britain's finest ever monarchs. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 03:12 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia does not put birth and death locations in the opening paragraph between the birth and death dates. The style is simply to use &lt;style&gt;&lt;name&gt; (&lt;birth&gt;-&lt;death&gt;).

<p>The respected source, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biographies_58cb.html" title="Oxford Dictionary of National Biographies">Oxford Dictionary of National Biographies</a>, says clearly in its article of Edward VII, that he married "Princess Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg". Which is of course true, since in Spring 1863, Alexandra's father (the future <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_IX_of_Denmark_cd26.html" title="Christian IX of Denmark">Christian IX of Denmark</a>) had not yet ascended the Danish throne. Despite of the fact that her father was at that time already long been recognized as a heir of Denmark, they were yet of a collateral branch (such as Kent, Gloucester and York in today's British royal family - their members being designated as "of Kent", "of York") and not of the main branch of that royal house.</p>
<ul>
<li>New York Times, when printing newspiece about the marriage at those days, avoided territorial designation of Alexandra, saying in the news that Edward married "Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra".</li>
</ul>
<p>This means, in my opinion, that Alexandra's proper pre-marital name is <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_of_Glucksburg_8deb.html" title="Alexandra of Glucksburg">Alexandra of Glucksburg</a>. Denmark could only be some common parlance version. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 29 June 2005 14:59 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Elsewhere, John wrote: "The NYT marriage stuff doesn't really help - it certainly doesn't call her "Princess Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein" or anything like that.

<dl>
<dd>Since it is you who desires those, could you kindly check them from Court Circular and from London Gazette. In my opinion, NYT (which is one of those that are easily available from even so early years) reflects how many English-speakers knew her at the time, which is of course a criterion. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 07:41, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You might do worse than look at the latest book on the subject -- <i>Princesses of Wales</i> by Deborah Fisher (University of Wales Press, 2005). That could surely be quoted as an authority. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 17:53, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have got the understanding that the said book has been authored by someone not scholarly highly qualified. Of course there are plenty of books about royals, written by a motley gang of persons, for whatever reasons - that topic seems to attract dilettantes - in libraries, there are gossip books, photo collection books, etc. about royals. Also we do not put very much authoritativeness e.g regarding geographical research to travel guide books. In this question, we have above been trying to find authoritative sources drom the period in question (such as London Gazette and Court Circular, if such existed), so a book written in recent years does not somehow reflect that contemporary usage. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 19:22, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've posted a query on alt.talk.royalty, which is usually good for ironing out issues like this. I wonder, though, why you are denigrating a source published by a university press? That suggests, at least, that it should be assumed to be a reputable source unless proven otherwise. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:24, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay then, let's be serious for a moment. There are probably a couple of reasons why she was called Alexandra of Denmark by the British. One is that the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg was too much for us to get our tongues around. Another is that that particular dynasty seems to have had several princesses called Alexandra. Either way, what we are doing is selecting the most common name used by UK sources to refer to her <i>now</i>, not at the time she was married. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 21:10, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that Queen Alexandra was titled "HRH Princess Alexandra of Denmark" at the time of her marriage. First of all, do you really think that the children of the heir to the Danish throne would not be given any Danish titles? Also, on <a href="http://www.geocities.com/henrivanoene/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/henrivanoene/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> it says that her titles were HH Princess Alexandra of Denmark before 1858 and HRH Princess after. Though the site does look very small-time and possibly inaccurate, I have found it to be <i>very</i> reliable for things like this. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatjlav_9736.html" title="User:Matjlav">Matjlav</a> 21:23, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did you remember that before 1863, her father was not THE heir of Denmark, he was only at maximum the second in line after hereditary prince Frederik Ferdinand. Depends on traditions, but such position put him as father to the same category as "princess of Kent" in UK. Being also Princess of the United Kingdom, but known with the name Kent. (Of course, if we were to change the stupid headings such as Adelaide of Cambridge, Margaret of Connaught, Alice of Albany, Marie of Edinburgh, Maud of Wales, then...) - And, I would like to stress that maidenists who have tried to use "Alix of Hesse and by Rhine" should be consistent in their endeavors and not illogically repel the form "Alexandra of Glucksburg". Some "university presses" are commercial enterprises, I would be more forthcoming were the publication for example an academically scrutinized dissertation. Then, some universities tend to be nationalistic strongholds, which has impact to certain things. Do you have any counter-argument to usage by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographies? <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 21:59, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Traditions for Denmark and the UK are different - I don't see how we can make an analogy. BTW <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.talk.royalty/browse_frm/thread/98416d92165e2c11/c378f9f11b237af7?q=Christian+IX+%22Prince+of+Denmark%22&amp;rnum=2&amp;hl=en#c378f9f11b237af7" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.talk.royalty/browse_frm/thread/98416d92165e2c11/c378f9f11b237af7?q=Christian+IX+%22Prince+of+Denmark%22&amp;rnum=2&amp;hl=en#c378f9f11b237af7" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an alt.talk.royalty thread dealing with this issue - everyone seems to agree that they were made princes/ses of Denmark along with their father in 1853. And that's a forum where somebody would be sure to have corrected it if it was wrong. Linked there is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Crete/2122/dkres18530731.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Crete/2122/dkres18530731.html" rel="nofollow">the actual ordinance</a> making Christian heir after Frederick VII and his uncle. It very clearly states that Christian and his wife were being made Prince and Princess of Denmark by this act (not Hereditary Prince, as you have claimed - this title belonged to the King's uncle), although it doesn't specifically mention their children. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 22:12, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should be added that normally, the children of a Prince and Princess of Denmark would themselves be Princes and Princesses of Denmark, unless one has some evidence that they were not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 22:21, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's absolutely right. When Christian became a "Prince of Denmark", his children became princes and princesses x, y and z "of Denmark". I knew it must be written down somewhere (apart from that excellent new book published by the University of Wales Press...) <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 22:24, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"Alexandra herself was never known to have taken a lover. Those within the monarchy commonly did do so (women monarchs included), however for someone of her social stature, it would not have been socially accepted if common knowledge."</i> I'm surprised by the assertion that women monarchs commonly took lovers, especially if the reference is to British Queens. Queen Caroline did so, but was the subject of a very messy divorce as a result. Queen Victoria's relationship with John Brown was probably not sexual. I can't think of anyone else in modern times - Edward II's consort Isabelle is going back about 700 years.
