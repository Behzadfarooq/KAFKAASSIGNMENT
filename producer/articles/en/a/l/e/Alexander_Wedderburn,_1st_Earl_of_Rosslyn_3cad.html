<p>He acquired the rudiments of his education at <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalkeith.html" title="Dalkeith">Dalkeith</a>, and in his fourteenth year matriculated at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Edinburgh_53c2.html" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. It was from the first his desire to practise at the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_bar.html" title="English bar">English bar</a>, though in deference to his father's wishes he qualified as an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocate.html" title="Advocate">advocate</a> at <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1754.html" title="1754">1754</a>, but entered himself at the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Temple_3dd9.html" title="Inner Temple">Inner Temple</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1753.html" title="1753">1753</a>, so that he might keep the Easter and Trinity terms in that year. His father was called to the bench in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755.html" title="1755">1755</a>, and for the next three years Wedderburn stuck to his practice in Edinburgh, during which period he employed his oratorical powers in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland_97a8.html" title="General Assembly of the Church of Scotland">General Assembly</a> of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>, and passed his evenings in the social and argumentative clubs which abounded in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755.html" title="1755">1755</a> the precursor of the later <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Review_fa8b.html" title="Edinburgh Review">Edinburgh Review</a> was started, now chiefly remembered because in its pages <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> criticized the dictionary of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Johnson_4852.html" title="Samuel Johnson">Dr Johnson</a>, and because the contents of its two numbers were edited by Wedderburn. The dean of faculty at this time, Lockhart, afterwards Lord Covington, a lawyer notorious for his harsh demeanour, in the autumn of <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a> assailed Wedderburn with more than ordinary insolence. His victim retorted with extraordinary powers of invective, and on being rebuked by the bench declined to retract or apologize, but placed his gown upon the table, and with a low bow left the court for ever.</p>
<p>He was called to the English bar at the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Temple_3dd9.html" title="Inner Temple">Inner Temple</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a>. To shake off his native accent and to acquire the graces of oratorical action, he engaged the services of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Sheridan_8648.html" title="Thomas Sheridan">Thomas Sheridan</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Macklin_cf01.html" title="Charles Macklin">Charles Macklin</a>. To secure business and to conduct his cases with adequate knowledge, he studied the forms of English law, he solicited William Strahan, the printer, to get him employed in city causes, and he entered into social intercourse (as is noted in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Carlyle_ff1e.html" title="Alexander Carlyle">Alexander Carlyle</a>'s autobiography) with busy London solicitors. His local connections and the incidents of his previous career introduced him to the notice of his countrymen Lords Bute and Mansfield.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stuart%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Bute_07ff.html" title="John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute">Lord Bute</a> was prime minister this legal satellite used, says <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Johnson_4852.html" title="Samuel Johnson">Dr Johnson</a>, to go on errands for him, and it is to Wedderburn's credit that he first suggested to the premier the propriety of granting Johnson a pension. Through the favor of Lord Bute, he was returned to parliament for the <a href="../../../a/y/r/Ayr_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_30a3.html" title="Ayr (UK Parliament constituency)">Ayr burghs</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1761.html" title="1761">1761</a>. In <a href="../../../1/7/6/1763.html" title="1763">1763</a> he became king's counsel and bencher of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%27s_Inn_7f29.html" title="Lincoln's Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a>, and for a short time went the northern circuits, but was more successful in obtaining business in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Chancery_0ef5.html" title="Court of Chancery">Court of Chancery</a>. He obtained a considerable addition to his resources (Carlyle puts the amount at £10,000) on his marriage in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1767.html" title="1767">1767</a> to Betty Anne, sole child and heiress of John Dawson of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marly.html" title="Marly">Marly</a> in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Grenville_3c04.html" title="George Grenville">George Grenville</a>, whose principles leaned to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory.html" title="Tory">Toryism</a>, quarrelled with the court, Wedderburn affected to regard him as his leader in politics. At the dissolution in the spring of <a href="../../../1/7/6/1768.html" title="1768">1768</a> he was returned by Sir Lawrence Dundas for <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_%28Yorks%29_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_c5a8.html" title="Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)">Richmond</a> as a Tory, but in the questions that arose over <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilkes_7273.html" title="John Wilkes">John Wilkes</a> he took the popular side of Wilkes and liberty, and resigned his seat in May 1769. In the opinion of the people he was now regarded as the embodiment of all legal virtue; his health was toasted at the dinners of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Whig_Party_0b9e.html" title="British Whig Party">Whigss</a> amid rounds of applause, and, in recompense for the loss of his seat in parliament, he was returned by Lord Clive for his pocket-borough of Bishop's Castle, in Shropshire, in January <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770.html" title="1770">1770</a>.</p>
<p>During the next session he acted vigorously in opposition, but his conduct was always viewed with distrust by his new associates, and his attacks on the ministry of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_North%2C_Lord_North_0c2d.html" title="Frederick North, Lord North">Lord North</a> grew less and less animated in proportion to its apparent fixity of tenure. In January 1771 he was offered and accepted the post of solicitor-general. The high road to the woolsack was now open, but his defection from his former path has stamped his character with general infamy. <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junius.html" title="Junius">Junius</a> wrote of him, "As for Mr Wedderburn, there is something about him which even treachery cannot trust," and Colonel Barr attacked him in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. The new law officer defended his conduct with the assertion that his alliance in politics had been with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Grenville_3c04.html" title="George Grenville">George Grenville</a>, and that the connection had been severed on his death.</p>
<p>All through the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_War_of_Independence_edf0.html" title="American War of Independence">American War</a> he consistently declaimed against the colonies, and he was bitter (and, some historians say, downright slanderous) in his attack on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> before the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. In June <a href="../../../1/7/7/1778.html" title="1778">1778</a> Wedderburn was promoted to the post of attorney-general, and in the same year he refused the dignity of chief baron of the exchequer because the offer was not accompanied by the promise of a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peerage</a>. At the dissolution in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a> he had been returned for <a href="../../../o/k/e/Okehampton.html" title="Okehampton">Okehampton</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon.html" title="Devon">Devon</a>, and for Castle Rising in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, and selected the former constituency; on his promotion as leading law officer of the crown he returned to Bishops Castle. The coveted peerage was not long delayed. In June <a href="../../../1/7/8/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a> he was created chief justice of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Common_Pleas_acad.html" title="Court of Common Pleas">Court of Common Pleas</a>, with the title of Baron Loughborough.</p>
<p>During the existence of the coalition ministry of North and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_James_Fox_c5a4.html" title="Charles James Fox">Fox</a>, the great seal was in commission (April to December 1783), and Lord Loughborough held the leading place among the commissioners. For some time after that ministrys fall he was considered the leader of the Whig party in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, and, had the illness of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">king</a> brought about the return of the Whigs to power, the great seal would have been placed in his hands. The king's restoration to health secured <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Pitt_The_Younger_a0ff.html" title="William Pitt The Younger">Pitt</a>'s continuance in office, and disappointed the expectations of the Whigs. In <a href="../../../1/7/9/1792.html" title="1792">1792</a>, during the period of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, Lord Loughborough seceded from Fox, and on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28.html" title="January 28">January 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a> he received the great seal in the Tory cabinet of Pitt. The resignation of Pitt on the question of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> emancipation (<a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>) put an end to Wedderburn's tenure of the Lord Chancellorship, for, much to his surprise, no place was found for him in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Addington%2C_1st_Viscount_Sidmouth_c15d.html" title="Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth">Addington</a>'s cabinet.</p>
<p>His first wife died in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a> without leaving issue, and he married in the following year Charlotte, youngest daughter of William, Viscount Courtenay; but her only son died in childhood. Lord Loughborough accordingly obtained in 1795 a re-grant of his barony with remainder to his nephew, Sir James St Clair Erskine. The end of his tenure as Lord Chancellor in 1801 was softened by the grant of an earldom (he was created earl of Rosslyn <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a>, 1801, with remainder to his nephew), and by a pension of 4000 per annum. After this date he rarely appeared in public, but he was a constant figure at all the royal festivities. He accepted an honorary vice presidency at London's charitable <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundling_Hospital_1d8b.html" title="Foundling Hospital">Foundling Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1799.html" title="1799">1799</a>.</p>
<p>He attended a festive gathering, quite typical for this time in his life, at Frogmore, in December <a href="../../../1/8/0/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a>. On the following day he was seized with an attack of gout in the stomach, and on the 2nd of January <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a> he died at his seat, Baylis, near Salt Hill, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Berkshire_8835.html" title="Windsor, Berkshire">Windsor</a>. His remains were buried in <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_1d4f.html" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_11.html" title="January 11">January 11</a>.</p>
<p>At the bar Wedderburn was the most elegant speaker of his time, and, although his knowledge of the principles and precedents of law was deficient, his skill in marshalling facts and his clearness of diction were marvellous; on the bench his judgments were remarkable for their perspicuity, particularly in the appeal cases to the House of Lords. For cool and sustained declamation he stood unrivalled in parliament, and his readiness in debate was universally acknowledged. In social life, in the company of the wits and writers of his day, his faculties seemed to desert him. He was not only dull, but the cause of dulness in others, and even Alexander Carlyle confesses that in conversation his illustrious countryman was stiff and pompous. In Wedderburn's character ambition banished all rectitude of principle, but the love of money for money's sake was not among his faults.</p>
