<p>Alexandre, you can communicate with me on <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidcannon_eaa5.html" title="User talk:Davidcannon">my talk page</a> if you wish. Basically, I would like you to integrate Wikimapia with Wikipedia. How it would work: When contributors draw their rectangles around places, landmarks, etc., the info. box that comes up inviting them to write a note about the landmark should feature a Wikipedia article about it, if there is one. If there isn't one, writing a note for a place on Wikimapia would automatically create such an article on Wikipedia. You could talk to <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a>, who runs the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> project, which uses special software to incorporate Wikipedia articles into its own structure. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 22:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't particularly like the notion that an article would be created in Wikipedia when a bounding box is created in Wikimapia, at least at this stage. My concern is one about article notability. There are no controls on notability in Wikimapia, nor (it could be argued) should there be; noteworthy here is the <a href="http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/2006/08/registration.html" class="external text" title="http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/2006/08/registration.html" rel="nofollow">comment on a related blog that folks in India are adding their home information to Wikimapia</a>. I personally have added things that I wouldn't want to see appearing in Wikipedia as articles (residential addresses .. no names .. and gas stations, for instance). I believe that creation of object references in Wikipedia and Wikimapia should be left separate right now, but that the interlinkage between the two be made as easy and bidirectional as possible. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it's not good for adding indian homes to Wikipedia, but there are still many places which might be in Wikipedia. I propose there will be a link, create an article in Wikipedia wich redirect from Wikimapia place to Wikipedia NEW ARTICLE EDIT PAGE (maybe for all or for registered users) with some information from Wikipedia (for example if place has no description - the system won't let you automatically create Wikipedia article, etc.. ). What are your thoughts? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 08:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think Wikimapia is a great concept. Integration with Wikipedia would maximize its usefulness by connecting landmarks with well-written and verified information. It would also allow Wikimapia to "ride" on Wikipedia's popularity. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 22:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree with all of what David has said in this preceding passage. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks! Yes, administrators on Wikipedia have the power to ban vandals and troublemakers (by blocking their user name or IP address). They also have the power to delete pages and to "protect" pages from being edited by unregistered users (semi-protection) or by non-administrators (full protection). (This power is used in the case of repeated vandalism). Above Administrators are Bureaucrats, who have the power to create administrators (but normally only after a vote to approve them). We also have Arbitrators (appointed by the Wikimedia Foundation) to handle cases where administrators are alleged to have misused their powers. There are also a small number of Stewards, who are able to exercise administrator/bureaucrat powers on all Wikimedia projects (Administrators and Bureaucrats, by contrast, are chosen for only specific projects. In my own case, for example, I am an Administrator on the English language Wikipedia. I also edit other language projects and other Wikimedia projects (such as Wikiquote) from time to time, but as an ordinary user, not as an administrator. When I edit the English Wikipedia, several tabs appear at the top of the page that do not appear when I edit other projects).</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Generally speaking, users who have proved themselves trustworthy get "nominated", and a week-long referendum follows. If there are no, or very few, serious complaints voiced against the candidate, he or she is almost always approved.</p>
<p>Wikimapia does not need an identical system, but as the project grows, you will need some way to empower trusted users to exercise certain powers that it would not be wise to give to just anybody.</p>
<p>For your information:</p>

<p>Just a quick comment on your delete function. I tried to delete a couple of placed that were totally unsuitable and/or superfluous (e.g., one building had not one but two rectangles around it, with identical information in both). I found that the correct question screens came up (e.g., ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS PLACE?), but that after I confirmed it, the place was still there. This happened several times. Is this a bug, or is it something that hasn't been made available yet? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 23:06, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>following from "Delete function stil not working" thread</i></p>
<p>Do you have a caching system in place that provides a lag between creation and writing to a more permanent store? The reason why I ask is that I created a Place, then a few minutes later was able to delete it without a lag. As object references become more complex, you should consider introduction of a Preview function that allows the editor to see how the final entry will appear prior to committing the edit; this would be useful right now, in fact, because there is a difference between the edit view and the saved view as the edit view has the 4-corner bounding box handles which are not present in the saved view ... fine-tuning the bounding box is useful for tagging 'small' closely spaced objects. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there! I'm a little unsure about this. A number of people have been hotspotting private houses - e.g. "Peter's house", "My place", etc. Such labels are meaningless to the public and they only serve to clutter the map. Should they be deleted? Also, some people have been hotspotting street names. That seems superfluous to me, because anyone who wants to find the name of the street can select "Hybrid" view. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 00:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello there&#160;:) We understand the page clutters with private places, that's why we included devision private/public. We have idea to make another layer for private or show them with low priority. It's a next step and it will be done. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 08:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hotspots with street names should, indeed, be deleted as this is in many cases superfluous information; usually it means the user doesn't realize the hybrid mode will give you this information. However, in cases where an alternative valid street name is given, or where the street name is missing from hybrid mode, that hotspot annotation should be retained. This would be one feedback mechanism to Google Earth, thereby potentially enriching their byways reference map. As far as personalized places go, I feel that 'ephemera' should be discouraged from the map. Thus "Peter's house" would be a no-no, but "37 Chunk Lane" would be ok. By 'ephemera' I mean information that might easily and frequently change over the life of a given structure. For instance, I have added a couple of gasoline stations, but I've labeled these as "gasoline station" and in the description labeled as (for instance) "owned by Exxon as of 2006-10-10"; the fact that a gasoline station was on a particular spot is important from subsequent use, environmental and demographic perspectives, but the fact it was owned by a particular company is an ephemera. Likewise with family names associated with personal homes; the fact that a personal home of address X is the identity of a particular building is important from the various perspectives, but the identity of the owner is an ephemera, relevant only to personal geneaological research except in those rare cases where the person-site association is particularly notable (e.g. person X murdered by serial killer Y at place Z or persons a,b,c,d all died of cholera and they were all within walking distance of well g [from a classic epidemological study in London]). --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 22:13, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By the way, I do understand that the 'person residing in a building = ephemera' perspective is very much a rootless modern Western one and though relatively representative of the majority of contributors to these resources does not necessarily reflect the perspective of the majority of people on the planet. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 23:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As I don't understand the whole "private place" business at all (luckily there will be a separate layer for it), adresses seem less disturbing than ephemera based on mere vanity. There is, however, another thing about hybrid mode: a lot of regions have street-level photos but no corresponding maps (like here in Lithuania). <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaimhe_591e.html" title="User:Saimhe">saimhe</a> 14:23, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think in that case it's perfectly reasonable to add street name tags to overcome the deficit. I took a look at centeral Lithuania and was surprised (though I should not have been) that the level of aerial photographic resolution was the same as for the continental United States (available down to z=18 but not available for z=19). --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 21:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would also like to make a proposal about a colour-code for hotspots. At the moment, you have white rectangles for approved places and yellow rectangles for upcoming places. How about expanding the system to have different colours for different kinds of places (e.g. red rectangle for government buildings, blue for churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, etc., green for cultural institutions like libraries and museums, purple for shops, orange for famous monuments, and so on. Alongside the UPCOMING PLACES link could be tabs for all these different kinds of places, giving users the option to show only one kind of place, or any combination of places, so they can easily find what they are looking for. Just a thought.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that's a good idea. As for Google Earth we think to make different icons for different types, then for Google Earth and Browser Wikimapia it will be good to change color (and for private it will be a kind of light gray). Again, it's a good adia, just we have to see if it will be looking good with many colors on the map. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 08:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, could users have some way to enter an "edit summary" like what we have on wikipedia? That would allow users to explain what they have done and why - e.g., why they have deleted a place or changed its description. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 00:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>To share my view on this whole ephemera question, I really don't see the point of these "I live here" places, especially when the sorry bastard doesn't mention even a nickname, but I do feel that Wikimapia should in fact be personal. By personal, I mean having lots of information that would be considered irrelevant or ephemeral by commercial informational maps. Street names in themselves are superfluous, but marking a street up named as itself, and describing its aesthetics as seen by one, or a short (true) anecdote that makes it interesting is the very lifeblood of such a system. I do think though that the dating of ephemera is vital. (Like, "As of autumn 2006, there is a rude inscription done in spray on the southern wall.") Wilderns 12 November 2006</p>
<p>I think there are cases where private residences can be useful. Foreign inmigrants in a big city may want to find important persons of their community. Some private homes act as boarding houses or religious services. They should be acceptable as long as properly explained and tagged. Mlatum 19:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello again. I created <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikimapia_4d09.html" title="Template:Wikimapia">Template:Wikimapia</a> by merging two other templates and fiddling around with the syntax.

<p>There are two ways to solve the problem: (1) you could edit the image page (Image:WikiMapia2-logo-en.png) and explicitly give permission, as the copyright owner, for the image to be used in the template and on any page which uses the template, or (2) we could change the image to one that is in the public domain, has something to do with maps, but isn't the Wikimapia logo.

<dl>
<dd>I think that's a great idea, which will ease the cross-referencing of the two projects. I'm looking forward to it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. <i>Also is there now a real necessity that we must choose a 'licence' for the project? Probably a kind of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" class="external free" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/" class="external free" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/" rel="nofollow">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/</a>?

<dd>I don't know how the law stands in Russia, but in many other countries (including mine), there could be legal complications for people wishing to use Wikimapia images on their websites if there is no license. In New Zealand, I have never heard of such laws being enforced, but adopting a licensing system would avoid any potential problems.

<dd>What do you mean by Wikimapia images? You meant with places? I have to check if it's corresponding with Google Map TOS. We can give permission from Wikimapia, but we don't own satellite imagery.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I mean places - maps. You have allowed people to put a portion of a Wikimapia map on their webpage - so some form of licensing would be appropriate. I'm no lawyer, but I think giving permission from wikimapia should be sufficient, as Wikimapia already has permission to use the imagery. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 13:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also have a couple of questions of my own.</p>
<p>1. I'm pleased to see the box linking hotspots to Wikipedia articles. Would it be possible to add a second box, to link famous monuments to that structure's own website?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Could you explain a little bit more? A monuments in Wikidepia?
<dl>
<dd>No, on Wikimapia. For example, if I create a place on Wikimapia for, say, New Zealand's parliament building, there's a box allowing me to enter a link to the corresponding Wikipedia article. Could we have a second box for the parliament building's own website?<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 13:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. I tried to hotspot some Fijian islands, but kept getting the error message that I could not create a new place at that zoom level - I must zoom in closer. But (a) I wanted to hotspot the whole island, and (b) there was no image or map at a closer zoom level. Is it intended to be that way?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I forgot to make this for approved users.
<dl>
<dd>I see. I'll look forward to it.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 13:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed some new functionality -- an attempt to add a linking function to Wikipedia -- which isn't at the moment working exactly correctly. However, when I went to the Wikimapia Blog to see if there was a notice of the change there which would provide a feedback opportunity, I didn't see any mention of it. I'd like to post comments mostly to the <a href="http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Wikimapia blog</a> if they regard Wikimapia functionality ... it would be helpful to keep the Wikimapia blog assiduously up to date by posting new comments to it when changes to Wikimapia are made. I know that can be a lot of work, but I think you'll find the effort pays off in the end.

<p>I'm looking at the "Wikipedia Link" field. Links in general work ok; for instance, I've added a bi-directional reference for <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Cuba_Astronomical_Observatory_8442.html" title="Mount Cuba Astronomical Observatory">Mount Cuba Astronomical Observatory</a>. The type of link I've found so far that does not work is that which contains parentheses. For instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Georges_Bridge_%28Delaware%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Georges_Bridge_%28Delaware%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Georges_Bridge_%28Delaware%29</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Georges_Bridge_(Delaware)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Georges_Bridge_(Delaware)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Georges_Bridge_(Delaware)</a>; both of these yield error messages ('given link is incorrect'). The same error is thrown if the url is "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St. Georges Bridge (Delaware)".

<p>Currently available feature of putting wikipedia link in placemark is very useful and will also help bring more users to wikipedia, showing the wikipedia link in box more prominantly will help further. Following changes can be done for enhancing it further.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on wikipedia link should launch a new browser page instead of opening it in current wikimapia page.</li>
<li>In future we can have another search filter criteria for showing only 'wikipedia linked boxes'</li>
<li>Do you think wikimapia should allow usage of '[[]]' tag (wikipedia internal link tag) for linking the words there in description to corresponding wikipedia pages (putting full url beside the word will clutter the description).</li>

<p>Hi there! A few days ago, I marked some places on and around the Fijian island of Taveuni <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=-16859748&amp;x=-179971161&amp;z=11&amp;l=0&amp;m=a" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=-16859748&amp;x=-179971161&amp;z=11&amp;l=0&amp;m=a" rel="nofollow">(here)</a>. They appeared for several days, then disappeared yesterday. Did somebody delete them? I didn't see them listed for deletion, so I'm just wondering. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 21:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello. I expect they were already normal places (not upcoming)? Now I see: Ringgold Isles, Somosomo, Labasa, Vanua levu. I will look at deleted places (I see only one deleted place where with your typing: This should be deleted as a ship is mobile. It is only temporarily at this location, and may be gone by now). I will check database to see more (there's z Zero meridian, so it's possible that it need to be checked).</dd>
<dd>UPDATE: yes, it's a trouble of -179 to 179 longitude, I'll check this, at this moment places are shown. Have you seen Matrix 3? Same here. But what with Somosomo village? Is it correctly marked?

<p>Hello again! I think the area around Fiji is still problematic. In the last couple of days, I created about seven places in the Lau Islands (<a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=-18119750&amp;x=-178890381&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=-18119750&amp;x=-178890381&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" rel="nofollow">(here)</a>). I don't think anybody voted to delete them, but only one of them is still there. They were upcoming places, not confirmed, but if nobody voted to delete them, why have they vanished? Is it the same problem as before? Sorry to bother you.

<p>Hi, there is one little detail that nags me - you cannot add URLs in UTF-8 as the wikipedia link, wikimapia complains about invalid link. You can still use %-escape codes, but it looks ugly (especially for non-latin script wikipediæ, such as Russian). See <a href="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=48133333&amp;x=17116666&amp;z=10&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;show=/83221/" class="external free" title="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=48133333&amp;x=17116666&amp;z=10&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;show=/83221/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=48133333&amp;x=17116666&amp;z=10&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;show=/83221/</a> (link added by me) for an example.

<dd>I see, we used Wikipedia URL specification. However, we may replace the showing part of the link! <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Help:URL" class="external free" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Help:URL" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Help:URL</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 20:01, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>UPDATE - I think I solved this. It shows (and saves) UTF8 link, but give browser Wikipedia standart URL.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 21:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't forget that often people want just to paste URL as seen on Wikipedia. While Mozilla shows URL escaped, IE or Opera show (and copy) them directly in UTF-8, and wikimapia complains about incorrect wikipedia link. I think you should relax the link validity check (and allow all properly formed UTF-8 strings after the wiki/ URL part). <a href="../../../r/g/r/User%7ERgrg_5a89.html" title="User:Rgrg">rado</a> 16:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Till the functionality of allowing different types of box shape is implemented can we have the functionality of rotating the rectangular box as most of the places are typically rectangular in shape but may not be perfectly aligned vertically, allowing rotated rectangle will help a lot esp in places like India where wikimapia is used heavily (one of the reason is absence of detailed map). Thanks. Vjdchauhan 06:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The rectangle is simplest solution. Rotation is not possible, polygons will be ok for that. Anyhow polygons are for the future, because now we have to focus on some really required functions. We can do polygons now, but it won't help the project on a current state, and it will introduce more complexity. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 22:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In places (esp cities) which were already having high resolution imagery before voting system have been put in place people have misused place marks in very great numbers and for famous monuments/bildings one ended up with multiple box (see number of permanent placemerks over <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> in <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a> at <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=27175763&amp;x=78043077&amp;z=15&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=27175763&amp;x=78043077&amp;z=15&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" rel="nofollow">Tajmahal at Wikimapia</a>), and people like me who want to delete such boxes are not able to delete such frequently visited boxes. Can this be done if possile, i.e. open all the permanent boxes for voting which were created before voting system was put in place, I know I am asking too much but if done it will help in having Wikimapia with very accurately marked places and will also clear lot of mess. Thanks and regards. Vjdchauhan 12:13, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for info, but mostly it's a problem of famous places, this problem could be done by high ranked users like you (just to delete this place, it's possible, only 12 hours pending cancellation and it will be deleted). I cleared Tajmahal by myself. Thanks Vjdchauhan, but we won't turn all places to upcoming, because only of 0.1% wrong placed. Many people now have the power to delete bad places just with a click, a moth will pass, everything will be fine, I think. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 12:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am able to delete some boxes but they still need (even with enhanced user privilege) more than one delete request and for the some incorrectly/improperly marked palces (e.g. see <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=27871859&amp;x=78070564&amp;z=13&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=27871859&amp;x=78070564&amp;z=13&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" rel="nofollow">Aligarh at Wikimapia</a> where its low resolution imagery and all boxes are highly oversized) I am not able to delete them even after repeated delete requests them same was true for some unwanted boxes on Taj Mahal.<br />
I am not sure whether 'only 0.1% incorrectly marked places' data is correct for pre-voting days boxes. I don't think Wikimapians will clear all incorrectly marked permanent places (that too in a shorter time frame like a month), they can at max clean the incorrectly marked (permanent) public places and is it ok with Wikimapia to have tens of thousands of boxes per city (see <a href="http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/2006/08/wikimapia-reached-1-million-places.html" class="external text" title="http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/2006/08/wikimapia-reached-1-million-places.html" rel="nofollow">Most described cities at Wikimapia</a>), I think most of these boxes belong to pre-voting days (in fact I was not requesting for opening per-voting days boxes all at once, it could have been done phase wise say day/week wise).<br />
Alexandre what is your opinion on <i>Tens of thousands of boxes per city</i>.<br />

<p>I found that the system has a pretty clever way of determining the ideal view (center, zoom) of a certain hotspot. (In search view, or the upcoming places waiting for review on the bottom of articles, etc.) However, I didn't find a way to easily extract this link from the system. What I mean is that when I click on a hotspot, it should give me a URL I can post into other articles as a link. At least. What would be even better is an integrated hyperlink system like that of Wikipedia, where I could link to a hotspot by a unique hash based on location and name, or a serial id, or anything like that.

<p>There is something I noticed these days. I have been playing around with Budapest, adding locations, fixing broken data or misplaced hotspots, and adding descriptions to hotspots that lacked one before. What I found quite sad is that almost nobody votes on Upcoming places whatsoever. A quite large and locally well-known place can hang around for a week without getting a single vote, yes or no. (I mean, it would take, like 1 minute to scan the local upcoming list and vote for them.)</p>
<p>I found a few rather stupid Upcoming places, like this: <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=47574995&amp;x=19119878&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=h&amp;v=2" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=47574995&amp;x=19119878&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=h&amp;v=2" rel="nofollow">Csomád utca(hu)</a> - saying in the description "This is Csomád street". For one, the street name is there in the hybrid mode, and for two, the hotspot doesn't come near to covering the street. Another one is <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=47542889&amp;x=19045508&amp;z=15&amp;l=0&amp;m=h&amp;v=2" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=47542889&amp;x=19045508&amp;z=15&amp;l=0&amp;m=h&amp;v=2" rel="nofollow">hamed hanin lakasa(hu)</a> - name and description both stating that this is Hamed Hanin's flat, however the hotspot covers over 10 buildings and around 3 streets.</p>
<p>And this is where the possible abuse comes in, that I did vote No for both these places, and in a few days there were ranks of Yes votes passed on them, 2 for Csomád street, and 4 for Hamed Hanin. What I suspect is that the creator of these hotspots registered under multiple names and voted for himself to push their stupidity through. I mean, in such short time compared to the normal pace on Budapest wikimapia, and such stupid and useless places to boot (with absolutely no votes on normal, useful places just next to the stupid one), one just jumps to such conclusions.</p>
<p>What is Wikimapia policy for this? Is such conduct vandalism? What can a user do in such a case (How to report to authorities? Are there any authorities? Is there a ban system on Wikimapia? Can you check for clone users by IP?)</p>

<p>Hi there! Thanks for updating me on what's going on. I'm excited! Yes, I can see why you're being cautious about the bot. Personally, I don't think we'd ever go as far on EN as they did on NL - the Dutch Wikipedia (and also the German one, BTW) is dominated by a powerful "deletionist" lobby which excludes anything that doesn't fit a narrow criteria. On EN we're somewhat more inclusionist (I think), so the problem wouldn't be with the links to Wikimapia. I cannot see a problem with it at all, but I understand why you want to play it safe. Better safe than sorry!</p>
<p>No, I didn't feel the earthquake. The first I heard of it was from you! BTW, it's almost summer where I am.</p>
<p>I've been busy over the last couple of days annotating Wikimapia's <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=-17916023&amp;x=179362793&amp;z=7&amp;l=0&amp;m=a" class="external text" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=-17916023&amp;x=179362793&amp;z=7&amp;l=0&amp;m=a" rel="nofollow">map of Fiji</a>. I've had to compile the information from multiple sources, as there are NO maps available that label ALL of Fiji's islands (between 322 and 844 - depending on how you define an island). From a combination of sources, I've been able to establish the identity of most of them and have edited Wikimapia accordingly. Very likely, Wikimapia will be THE FIRST resource in the world to have a comprehensive map of Fiji which doesn't omit all or most of the minor islands.</p>

<p>Hi Alexander, since today morning I observed that user interface of Wikimapia has changed/simplified a lot. Apart from UI changes following are new changes that I observed.</p>
<ul>
<li>One can see '+' sign for Hospitals, 'H' sign for Hotels, there may be some other new signs as well can all this be put in Wikimapia faq as well.</li>
<li>'Search' option is simplified and the 'All' search gives the distance of 'Approved Place' from current view, can this be enhanced a bit to give State-District info as well for the places matching the search string. Also I observed when a placemark/city is searched the map view shifts to left and it reverts back on minimizing the search results window, it could be a distraction.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Simplified UI will help a lot. Regards Vjdchauhan 11:07, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>Dear Alexander creator of <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiMapia_c236.html" title="WikiMapia">WikiMapia</a>. I'm a Vietnamese. When i found <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimapia.html" title="Wikimapia">wikimapia</a>, i was so happy because i can watch my beloved country from the sky.To my deep regret; not only can i see my beloved country, but i can also see <i>a huge</i> of violent,offensive,political,coarse comment attached to a lot of places. I and someone esle try to erase it (edit, delete, request delete) but it likes " give salt to sea". When it was cleared, the vandal re-wrote it immediately. I known that the administrative system is under construction. But i can stand seeing , day after day, my beloved country map is filled with rubbish comment.Please,creator, disable the Comment system in my country until the administrative system is finished.

<p>Dear Alexander. After one week deal with vandal&gt; I known that they offten use atricle and comment to complete their goals. I though why can't you limit the number of atricle's and comment's character. An atricle prove the info of the place, like a greetings,an atricle or a comment shouldn't to be too long. 1500 characters is just enough to an atricle, 500 characters is just enough to a comment. If visitor want more they can go to a wikipedia page ( follow the link on the atricle ). Respectfully yours Magnifier 13:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your fine software solved my problem, Alexandre (wink). I tried everything, re-starting my OS, logging in and out of my ISP and my Wikimapia account and nothing seemed to change.

<p>Since there have been so many problems with the comments people leave (spam, inappropriate, violent, abusive, profane, etc.) I was wondering if a point system might be helpful (something similar to Digg or Slashdot). I have seen a number of my own comments that are now hidden for whatever reason, I have also seen perfectly fine comments hidden as well. But I have also seen lots of inappropriate comments hidden (which is a good thing). It seems that if you added a points type system you can make it so at a certain threshold (say 1 point) everyone could see it and if it falls below that it would be hidden. If it reached a certain value (say -5 points) it would be permanently deleted. You could also do it so if it got a lot of point it would move higher on the list. Just a thought there. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt510_0f4b.html" title="User:Matt510">Matt510</a> 07:09, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Alexandre, I am Lily, a student and a WikiMapian. I was informed that you are the person in charge of WikiMapia users. I am sending you this message to request for your consideration and help.<br />
You must have been informed about the WikiMapia's situation in areas of Vietnam. I know that you had made improvement on our places. We appreciate it very much. However, the chain of "abuse message - edit - abuse message -..." will never stop. I think it will be much easier if any of us can be provided the AdminShip.<br />
I have joined WikiMapia since Ferbrary, 2007 with the user name "Lily". So far, I have edited over 1600 places. I have called for a campaign of "Let's keep WikiMapia useful" and it's been supported by many WikiMapians. You may see a topic in my personal blog via this link (unfortunately, it's written in Vietnamese): <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-QTo3xbkgbqcVU.5lSIsXKLRpmgY-?cq=1&amp;p=2064" class="external free" title="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-QTo3xbkgbqcVU.5lSIsXKLRpmgY-?cq=1&amp;p=2064" rel="nofollow">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-QTo3xbkgbqcVU.5lSIsXKLRpmgY-?cq=1&amp;p=2064</a> . You may find the attention of a quite number of users simply by counting their comments. You may check my user details in WikiMapia as well.<br />
I am writing you this message to request for the AdminShip so that I can do more in "keeping WikiMapia useful". Your kind consideration will be very much appreciated. You may email me at Lily.usm@gmail.com. Hope to hear from you as soon as possible!<br />

<dd>Lily, I did it, if you know some trust people, you may tell me. What about situation in Vietnam - we are trying to solve the abuse problem, but currently we are focused on some new but necessary functions. However we are trying to make system protection against abusers (but that's not easy, for example there is one IP for many vietnamian users, so we cannot just simply ban this IP).<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 19:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you very much for your kind consideration and support, Alexandre!<br />
I realized changes in my user functions. However, may I have some more information/ instructions about all functions which are activated for those with adminship? I wish to use my account as effectively as possible.<br />
About the protection against the abusers, we may consider a committee to review contents before they are accepted to be posted or commented to WikiMap places. It takes time and quite number of volunteers but I think it's worth. We are willing to do it.<br />
Thanks for your continued support.<br />
Hope to hear from you!!<br />

I have just visited the location above and voted successfully (wickedly, since it does seem to be some sort of car boot sale judging by the spy satellite) for deletion.<br />
There are differences in behaviour between browsers, but many WikiMapians favour Firefox. I use Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 myself.<br />
I think polygons can only be added by a certain level of registered user. Here's an example of one I baked earlier (grin):<br /></dd>

I also have 2 other questions:<br />
do you consider creating some "meta-like" pages? (By "meta-like" I mean things like user and admin [if there will be some], protected places' lists and similar)?<br />
And the second question is if you could clarify the system of ranking users (how many edits [or what else] are needed to have your level hightened and so on. Regards. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoan_M_f60c.html" title="User:Joan M">Joan M</a> 20:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>Is there any way of resizing biggaer places (like this one: <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=51770000&amp;x=19460000&amp;z=12&amp;l=28&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" class="external free" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=51770000&amp;x=19460000&amp;z=12&amp;l=28&amp;m=a&amp;v=2" rel="nofollow">http://wikimapia.org/#y=51770000&amp;x=19460000&amp;z=12&amp;l=28&amp;m=a&amp;v=2</a> - the big square in the middle shows Łódź but in fact the city is much bigger than there)? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoan_M_f60c.html" title="User:Joan M">Joan M</a> 12:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
