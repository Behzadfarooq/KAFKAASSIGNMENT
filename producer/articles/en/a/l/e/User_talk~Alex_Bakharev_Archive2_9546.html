This is good, since images with large blocks of solid colors (such as <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screenshot.html" title="Screenshot">screenshots</a>, maps, charts, flags, and so on) should almost always be saved as PNGs. But converting the JPEG directly to a PNG does not help much. When you save an image as a JPEG, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compression_artifact.html" title="Compression artifact">compression artifacts</a> are introduced into the image (you can see them in Image:Merridien Web.JPG as "blur" or "fuzz" in the blue bar at the top, for example). Converting the JPEG to a PNG does not eliminate these compression artifacts. So, if possible, you should take the screenshot all over again, and save it as a PNG this time instead of a JPEG. That will yield a smaller file size and a sharper image. Thank you for your help. —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> 05:20, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I've recently accused your friend <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">User:Kuban kazak</a> of anti-Ukrainians trollism. In response, he raised a <a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKuban_kazak_ab5e.html#Please_don.27t_do_that_again" title="User talk:Kuban kazak">very interesting issue</a> regarding all RU editors. So I suggest you to post your answer to my request there. I believe you have only two alternatives. Oh, and this would be a great post-voting test of your abilities as an admin. Thanks, <a href="../../../u/k/r/User%7EUkrained_0b14.html" title="User:Ukrained">Ukrained</a> 20:25, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sasha, that is if you need getting yourself involved in the issue "challenged" to you clearly in a bad faith. The appology has been issued. Those who reject it want an escalation. I would stay out if I were you. If Ukrained wants others' involvement, the right way to go is <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> rather than targeting the singled out users in an embarassion way. But that's just my opinion, of course.

<dd>Sorry, I have not got what two alternatives I have got, if you want any actions of me can you elaborate.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the adminship requires a clear understanding of one's alternatives when dealing with breaches of WP rules. Sorry, but could the lack of understanding those be the reason of your RfA defeat?

<dd>I have looked into the diffs you have provided. Both edits themselves seems to be made in good faith (and IMHO are beneficial to the articles). The edit summary to the first edit has an unfortunate personal attack that Kuban Kazak later apologized for. During my involvement with Wikipedia I have seen hundreds of personal attacks worse than that (quite a few of them against me). If I would reacted on all of them I would not have time to do anything productive. Thickness of your skin may be different from mine, so if you feel like this, you can follow the advise of Irpen and start an RfC. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 21:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please don't simplify things. That <i>thikness of skin</i> effectivelly defines the willingness of people to stay contributing on WP (with their time and money) under the pressure of trolls. Who knows how many readers and would-be newcomers left after witnessing the "deeds" of Ghirlandajo and Kuban Kazak? Protection of such "thin-skinned" users is a direct duty of admins (and candidates for it). But don't worry about my particular skin;) <a href="../../../u/k/r/User%7EUkrained_0b14.html" title="User:Ukrained">Ukrained</a> 18:56, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

Otherwise take my advise to assume good faith (see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>) of other fellow editors and contribute. Once your contributions to Wikipedia would be comparable with Ghirlandajo's your complaints would be taken more seriously. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 11:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's OK, Alex. No more ideas about your help to anybody non-Russian&#160;:). And I've never complained to you. I just offered you (as well as all RU editors) an opportunity to clear your name after Kazak supposed that all of you are in a cabal.</p>
<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: <b>Alex have just told me that newcomer contributors of WP should silently suffer the trollistic attacks by "old" users with large number of edits (no matter how uncivil they are)</b>.

<p><b>Ukrained, this is the most disgusting trolling</b> I've seen from you, and frankly, I expected much better. Alex, I urge you not to respond. I see no reason why you should keep the trollish assaults at your talk page after this RfA is over. If someone trolls at my page I have no problem to remove the attacks (unlike constructive criticism). Let him, "restore this on his page". It speaks of no one but himself.

<p>I really appreciate the information you added. I was deeply frustrated by how little I could find in English. However, I must admit I feel a little cheated by the redirect. First of all, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Powell's, and the bookstores that list his books on ABEbooks all use at least his middle initial. He is sometimes listed as "A.A." - see [<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7003426102&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT&amp;rd=1" class="external free" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7003426102&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT&amp;rd=1" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7003426102&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT&amp;rd=1</a> an eBay auction] (dunno why it showed all the garbage; sorry) that just closed and sometimes as Alexander Alexandrovich, but I can recall exactly one listing that used his first name alone. I suggest that English speakers will be looking for the middle initial or name; that's why I put the full name at the beginning of the content.</p>
<p>It may be a bit petulant on my part, but your redirect just took the information I spent 5 or 6 hours painfully winnowing from the web, added stuff I didn't have access to - which I had hoped would happen - and made a new page (which I hadn't even imagined anyone would do!). Wouldn't it have been easier to edit <i>my</i> page? You had to edit my stuff anyway to add in yours. I intended to do pages on some more Russian authors whose works are highly regarded in the west, while I'm still focused on the Middle Ages. This is not going to encourage me to do all the work required, trust me. Maybe I should just make stubs. Then you can do an article, and make a redirect from the stubs?</p>
<p>By the way, every time I do a preview, the software complains at me about the length of your page. Am I mistaken that it is usual to delete old information? You've got stuff that's 6 months old in here. I've left the welcome message in mine because I don't think I need 19 different welcomes. As soon as there's other stuff in there, it'll go. I guess my experience working with scholarly manuscripts has something to do with my drive for tidyness.&#160;:-P --Tygerbryght 06:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your speedy response. I guess my nightowl hours make it more convenient for people on the other side of the globe. I worked - or at least I <i>thought</i> I did - from the stub. I had gone looking for information once I made the decision that Vasiliev was where I should start reading Byzantine history (to date I've been reading almost entirely about medieval western Europe). As I said, the conventional representation (in the U.S., at least) is, if a middle name or initial is known for for a prominent individual, it is used. That is, unless they show a strong preference for it not to be used, as the first President Bush did. There are several other authors named Vasiliev whose works have been published in English, including another whose first name begins with A. As I said, it's the convention here. I'd want to ask some of my British friends before stating categorically that they do it the same way. However, most of my male Brit acquaintances use their middle initials. Maybe we should ask someone to referee?&#160;:) I'm perfectly willing to have someone else make the decision. I'm a newbie here. I do, however, have a rather long history with both computers and the web (since Arpanet days). I hope I'll be able to master the conventions/customs here soon. I can see a number of areas where I can usefully contribute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would suggest that Russian naming conventions should be followed (and I assume they are) on the Russian language Wiki, and that perhaps our naming conventions should take precedence in the English language Wiki. I don't know how the pages for any of my favorite authors appear in the Russian Wiki, although I'd be very interested to know how Lois McMaster Bujold's and Mary Doria Russell's pages look (if they exist), since each of them identifies herself using her maiden name for a middle name!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How would you feel about my creating stubs for the Russian authors not in the English Wiki, for you (or another Russian-speaker) to fill in? I could let you know that I'd done it, and place a watch on them. After they'd been written, I could then go back to see if there was any commentary that could usefully be added for western readers of those authors' works (and double-check the English, not that <i>you</i> seem to need help in that regard!). As I said in my intro (I think dated Sunday; it's hard to keep the Greenwich time in my head to be sure when I did it), I've been reading medieval history for more than a year now, and there are several Russian authors whom I feel should have pages here. I plan to go back and check to make sure that the other medievalists whose works I've read are also represented here. That is likely to take some time, even without the other areas where I hope to contribute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, sorry if I sounded snarky in my earlier comments. Since I asked for others to look at it, I expected to hear from them before they made changes. Maybe that was foolish of me. --Tygerbryght 08:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I had never heard of him, but came across him as the composer and librettist of an opera called <i><a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiriel.html" title="Tiriel">Tiriel</a></i> that I was making a note of in the article on Blake's character, and as is my habit ... if I need to look something up, I first look on Wikipedia, and if it's not there, I add it. I see Smirnov's <i>Solo for Harp</i> won First Prize in a competition in Maastricht in 1976, but I don't know if this is enough for Wikipedia notability. His publisher, Boosey &amp; Hawkes, is very reputable — I'd guess that might be enough? What are your thoughts?

<p>Hi, Alex, your comments are noted. In English, we do not normally use patronymics in referring to Russians (in fact middle names are rarely used except to distinguish between people of the same names) which is done on Wikipedia with parenthetical references (actor) or the like. US Presidents (FDR, JFK, DDE, WMN) are also an exception, as are most criminals especially executed or deathrow inmates. Any way, I took some time (and will do some more) to enhance the Russian politicians entries and get them categorized and alphabetized. It's a real learning experience. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 17:45, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks again for your comment on the talk page. Two questions I have, maybe there is consensus among Russian editors: 1. transliteration of names: should we use the "usual" English style (e.g., "Alexei" over "Alexey"; "Alexander" over "Aleksandr") or use the opposite. Usually, I will not change these from whatever exists, even if most of the source material in English language differs from the article title. However, if I find a Russian government site that has a transliteration, I will assume that it is somehow "official" and change the article's title. 2. an interesting coincidence on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Tkachyov_4da2.html" title="Alexander Tkachyov">Alexander Tkachyov</a> politician versus <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandr_Tkachyov_4b88.html" title="Alexandr Tkachyov">Alexandr Tkachyov</a> gymnast -- in Russian, the first names are identical, so I am somewhat unhappy leaving them different in English. However, either patronymics or job descriptions would need to be added to one or both, so I have left them with a disambig header for someone better (you?) to solve this. I have also had a difficult time finding source material in English for some of the governors of less well visited regions, but I am trying to put in a one-liner to get the subject some humanity, rather than just a resumé. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 22:14, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was a surprise to find the 2 Tkachyov entries. I will let the consensus determine whether patronymics should be used or job descriptions should be used (as is typical for English-named people, but sometimes only for the lesser known one <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Lee_77ba.html" title="Ann Lee">Ann Lee</a> vs. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Lee_%28singer%29_2b87.html" title="Ann Lee (singer)">Ann Lee (singer)</a>). Of course that leads to the "who is better known" argument and for whom is that person better known, but given that the gymnast has a real article and the politician has just a stub, I can guess who wins&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 22:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quick question: can I move article <a href="../../../l/d/p/LDPR_group_in_the_Duma_5a34.html" title="LDPR group in the Duma">LDPR group in the Duma</a> to better name <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Liberal_Democratic_Party_of_Russia_deputies_in_the_State_Duma_7b01.html" title="List of Liberal Democratic Party of Russia deputies in the State Duma">List of Liberal Democratic Party of Russia deputies in the State Duma</a> which is a mouthful but is more in line with getting rid of acronyms in article titles and clarifies which Duma, and that these are deputies by party name.

<p>I lived there when I was little (like, five years old) and my grandparents and my mother's siblings' families still live there. So, yeah, I consider this my moment in the sunshine. *grins*</p>
<p>Incidentally I see you're running for admin again. At the moment it doesn't look good, but the tide can change. I have to say that out of all the processes on WP (AfD, copyright, arbitration...), adminship is probably one of the nastiest and most poisonous. It must be one of the that can actually create ill-will where there was none before, and the <i>politics</i> of it just astound me. So, whatever the result, I hope you will remember how little it really contributes to the encyclopedia at the end of the day. Onward and upward.

<dd>I, for one, hope that the current trollfest won't drive you away from Wikipedia.

<p>The main thing is not change your mind about remaining here, if you get this RfA trolled. Russophobia is less common than it is prominent. I judge by knowing from <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">my country</a>. Even the Ukraine-Russia Gas Dispute, the recent milk-meat skirmish and other such events won't change the common sense among the great majority of people of my nation. That those exceptions are so prominent is simply because like any fanatics, they are very active. I am sure that there will be more than 3:1 support for you among Ukrainians. Generally, there have been cases that users left after RfA. I am glad it didn't happen after the last trollfest. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 10:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alex, that photo is not a GFDL image and also image:alex756-01-06.jpg is not on my user page, that is the vandalized photo (see the history to see what the vandal did) and I think it qualifies for speedy deletion and it should be deleted (since you are now an admin could you do it? I would hate to do it myself as it is an image of me and I originally posted it for use on my user page only, not for any other purpose). The image on my user page is image:alex756-01-05.jpg. I do not have free copyright on it and my artist friend will not release it, she beleives that artists should control their work and I respect her decision. I think I am allowed to use my own picture on my user page even if someone else took it, without getting a copyleft license, no? That does qualify as fair use as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 04:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for the question. I think it is a wrong approach - first find a link, then go to wikipedia and look where to insert it. Wikipedia is not a collection of links (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). I would rather look for the articles you are interested of and see how you can improve them. Sometimes it is by editing the text, sometimes it is by inserting links (or images) or you name it. Anyway the link should be either a reference showing the material you used in writing the article or it points out the material that should be in the article but could not be included by the copyright restrictions. In both cases that should be credible (preferably academical sources), if the article is about a controversial topic it is a good idea to include links to the both sides, even if they are biased.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another word of advise. Register an account. People tend to believe that many anonymous users are vandals or spammers. The registration require only a few seconds, but provide more possibilities like creating new articles, moving articles, editing semi-protected articles, using watch-lists, voting etc. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a></li>

<p>Hi, there should be no tolerance for vulgar language such as this in Wikipedia. Please go to the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Khwarizmi_3340.html" title="Al Khwarizmi">Al Khwarizmi</a> discussion page, not only that page is a mess, but personal attacks such as the example below should not be tolerated. The user MB has done this many times, despite warnings and the attempts of others to compromise. Under the section ``Khwarizmi being Persian: Original research which has nothing to do with Wikipedia``, the user states,</p>
<p><i>"Let's look into the Persians' claims, shall we?</i></p>
<p><i>Zmmz lists Merriam-Webster with this quote: "Function: biographical name circa 780-circa 850 Muhammad ibn MusA al-KhwArizmI Islamic (Persian-born) mathematician &amp; astronomer; one of the greatest scientific minds of Islam; source of much of mathematical knowledge of medieval Europe".</i></p>
<p><i>Notice, it says "Persian-born" in parantheses, and gives Islamic as the nationality. Basically, they defined him by religion and stated his place of birth. He was born in Khwarizm, in the Khorasan province. At the time of his birth, it was part of the Arab Islamic Caliphate, now it's part of the Uzbegistan nation-state. Alas, Persians burnt us saying that it's in fact Persian, so let's take it as Persian. Now, according to sources cited by Heja Helwada, Khorasan in general had a huge Arab population. In accordance to that, defining him as Persian simply because he was born in Khorasan, is not only disputed at best, it also constitutes OR (original research) which is against Wiki's policy, see: WP:NOR</i></p>
<p>'<b>A troll'</b> showed up lately and claimed that Arabs are fighting a losing battle, I'm not sure we're in a battle-field here, but I got the gist: he thinks we have no sources...poor little guy!</p>

<dd>Guys, I have the authority to block editors immediately after their personal attacks and other disruptive edits, <b>I do not have neither authority nor the intentions to punish people for the edits in the past if they do not repeat them presently</b>. If you want the community to discuss behavior of a user please start an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> process. Regarding the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a> article, I do not think that any user is trying to push the idea that all the Iranian people belong to the same ethnicity, or in particular that Farsi and Kurds are the same people. Even now it states quite clearly that despite similar laguages the Kurds have a distinktive separate cultural heritage, the genetic makeup, etc. If you have an idea how to emphasize it even strongly (preferably not by removing parts of the article but by addition of the new material), I believe nobody would object. Maybe we can have a section Kurds in the Iranian people article that should show both connections and differences between Kurds and other "Iranian people"? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 09:59, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I had just requested an RFC on the issue. He made a little statement redirecting people there that included ad hominem attacks against my argument. Can you please help get the discussion back on the talk page? It should be at the bottom. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 03:32, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
