	    <p><b>Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven</b> (c. <a href="../../../1/5/8/1580.html" title="1580">1580</a> - <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a>), was a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> soldier, in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> service from <a href="../../../1/6/0/1605.html" title="1605">1605</a> until <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>, where he rose to the rank of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Swedish_Field_Marshals_f004.html" title="List of Swedish Field Marshals">Field Marshal</a>. Alexander was the son of captain George Leslie and "a wench in Rannoch", and was a member of the family of Leslie of Balquhain. He was married in 1637 to Agnes Renton (died June 29, 1651, daughter of David Renton of Billie), and in due course his eldest son, Gustav Leslie became a colonel in the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Army_bbe9.html" title="Swedish Army">Swedish Army</a>. At an early age, Alexander was fostered out to the Campbells of Glenorchy. The fosterage bond was strong and still written about by Leslie into the 1640s. Indeed it was this link that brought Leslie into the orbit of the House of Argyll as Lord Lorne, the son of the marquis of Argyll was also a Glenorchy fosterling. This relationship also explains the presence of Campbells in the same regiments as Leslie in Sweden, most notably Captain Charles Campbell (Karl Kammel), whose portrait hangs to this day in Skokloster Slott in Sweden.</p>

<p>Alexander Leslie joined the Swedish army in 1605 and distinguished himself several times during the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years%27_War_f03e.html" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a>) serving in the Swedish army for about 33 years. By 1626 Alexander Leslie had risen to the rank of lieutenant-general, and had been knighted by the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_monarch.html" title="Swedish monarch">Swedish monarch</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavus_Adolphus_2ed5.html" title="Gustavus Adolphus">Gustavus Adolphus</a>.</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Leslie was badly wounded in the winter of 1632, but in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1636.html" title="1636">1636</a> he was appointed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Swedish_Field_Marshals_f004.html" title="List of Swedish Field Marshals">Field Marshal</a>. He was one of the commanders at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Wittstock_e585.html" title="Battle of Wittstock">Battle of Wittstock</a> in 1636, where he was subordinate to <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Ban%C3%A9r_5afe.html" title="Johan Banér">Johan Banér</a>, albeit victory for the battle is attributed to the combined action of Leslie and General <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_King_%28soldier%29_bb9b.html" title="James King (soldier)">James King</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Leslie%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leven_996e.html" title="Edit section: Return to Scotland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to Scotland</span></h2>
<p>In 1638 events in his native country compelled him to return to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> to lead the army of the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanter.html" title="Covenanter">Covenanters</a> in the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops_Wars_ba8e.html" title="Bishops Wars">Bishops Wars</a>. Scottish regiments were generally called into service by the lairds and clan chieftains obliging their tenants with feudal duty or coercion to send their kin to follow the Covenanters' banner into battle, though support among the Presbyterians of Scotland was widespread and the army swelled to over 20,000. The flag bore the motto 'For Christ's Crown and Covenant' and appeared in 1639 before the Covenanter army.</p>
<p>Leslie's reputation, guile and discretion, brought many to his standard, the English officer John Aston and Sir Cheney Culpeper both recording this in their writings. Having amassed a considerable fortune abroad he was able to bring from Sweden his arrears of pay in the form of cannon and muskets which he no doubt put to use in taking the castle of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> by surprise, without the loss of a single man, for the Scotish Parliament against the few remaining Scottish Royalists in the field. He then conducted a brilliant campaign in the North of England, overwhelming the British Royalist forces at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Newburn_eb85.html" title="Battle of Newburn">Battle of Newburn</a>. From there he took Newcastle with ease putting pressure on the King to come to a treaty with the Scottish Covenanters. Tghus followed the treaty of London.</p>
<p>In 1641 King Charles bestowed upon him, at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyrood_Palace_0388.html" title="Holyrood Palace">Holyrood</a>, the titles of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Balgonie_a14b.html" title="Lord Balgonie">Lord Balgonie</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Leven_ed9d.html" title="Earl of Leven">Earl of Leven</a>, and made him captain of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Castle_ec97.html" title="Edinburgh Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a> and a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_councillor.html" title="Privy councillor">privy councillor</a>.</p>
<p>Leven eventually accepted command of the forces raised for the invasion of England, and was in consequence accused of having broken his personal oath to Charles. He rose instead to become a commander of the Scottish army from 1644 to 1646 and fought for the Solemn League and Covenant which bound both the Scottish and English parliaments together against the Royalist forces in the Three Stuart Kingdoms.</p>
<p>In 1644 Leven commanded an army which he marched to England to take part in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Marston_Moor_0a23.html" title="Battle of Marston Moor">Battle of Marston Moor</a>, a crushing defeat for the king. When Charles surrendered to the Scottish army again in 1646, he was placed under the charge of General Lord Leven and was returned to the English in 1647.</p>
<p>Although over seventy years of age, and still active Leven passed active command of the army to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Leslie_%28Scottish_general%29_0b51.html" title="David Leslie (Scottish general)">David Leslie</a> in whom he had complete confidence. However, splits within the Scottish Parliament saw the Royalist Engager faction oust the Argyll radicals. Hamilton led an ill-supported army over the border in support of the king. They were soundly defeated by English parliamentary forces of Oliver Cromwell. This led to the return of the Argyll faction in Scotland. After the execution Charles I, Argyll declared his son, Charles II, King of Great Britain and Ireland leading to an English invasion of Scotland. The Covenanters were before the Scottish Covenanters were defeated (1650) at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dunbar_%281650%29_b7e6.html" title="Battle of Dunbar (1650)">battle of Dunbar</a>.</p>
<p>"<i>In the new war, and in the disastrous campaign of Dunbar, Leven took but a nominal part, though attempts were afterwards made to hold him responsible</i>".</p>
<p>In August, 1651 Leven had the misfortune to be captured by a group of English <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragoon.html" title="Dragoon">dragoons</a>, and was sent to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. He was confined to the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a> for some time, until he was released on providing a bond of £20,000, whereupon he retired to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. Again sometime later in London he was arrested a second time, but through negotiations with the queen of Sweden he again obtained his liberty.</p>
<p>He died in 1661 at <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balgonie_Castle_ca97.html" title="Balgonie Castle">Balgonie Castle</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fife.html" title="Fife">Fife</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>
