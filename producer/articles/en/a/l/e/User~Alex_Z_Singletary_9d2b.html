	    <p>Due to the fact that Alex Z Singletary keep's his life under wrap's, there is not a lot to say about him.</p>
<p>Born on September 22, 1990, with the name Alex Singletary Thomas. He grew up in Machesney Park, Illinois. He was the middle child in his family. He went to Ralston Elementry School for 8 years, with kindergarden and being held back in 3rd. Alex's school life was some what sorrow filled. He acted as a mute. He never had friends. People wandered who he was sometimes. They picked on him, due to his condission as a obese child and not very good looking. He didn't do good with his grades. Some even questioned if he were a goth. It was until 6th grade he finally found his voice. He talked a lot more. He made friends. And he participated in activities. But it still didn't help his grades. During his time in 6th, his grandmother, that of which he looked up to as his only friend, died in her sleep. This, unusually, brought no sorrow to him. But he did mention to a few friends that she passed away. Once again, this brought up question's of his dark backgrounds. He created a comic book, still while he was in 6th, called Rolston School Yearbook. It had to do with two character's named FX and DJ. The book was pointing fun at the event's that were surrounding gay marrage. The plot of the book was FX being turned gay after he is shot with a gay-ray. That is, noticably, a joke to people saying that if they hang out with homosexuals or do anything that is considered gay, they themselves would turn gay. It was a cult classic to the student's. But soon, the teacher got a hold of the book and read it. They, of course, didn't like what they saw. The banned the book from school. Alex showed the book during recess when the teacher's were not looking.</p>
<p>Alex passed 6th grade and moved on to 7th grade. Some unknown event's happened while he was there. Due to those unknown event's, Alex ran away from school and walked home (which was about 10 miles away). This happened constantly. Soon, his mother started to understand his problem and made the choice to let him drop out. Alex's mother, Terisa, tried to get him home schooling. The only option she had was a church schooling center. Alex agreed to give it a chance. After about 2 week's, he demanded to quit the church schooling. Him quiting was due to the fact that he had his own belife's, which he admited. Today, Alex is still at home.</p>
<p>Alex kept himself busy with educating himself in animation and game creating. He constantly used RPG Maker 2000 to practice. He never made a game out of it. He also tried animation. This skill was his strongest. He would take his time to practice day and night. Soon he created a video called Numa Numa Blooper's. A video that made fun of the already popular video called Numa Numa. He created four other cartoon's. One day, he found himself joining the website YouTube. His screen name was Advent INC. After that, he strangely changed his name to Alex Z. The 'Z' stand's for Zero. The advent of number's, he say's. His first video on YouTube was his first five cartoon's put in a collab, named Golden Years of Advent INC. His next video was his 'pride and joy' as he call's it, named Seek And Destroy. Seek And Destroy point's fun at classic video games in random comedy situation's. Something simular to Seek And Destroy is [Adult Swim]'s Robot Chicken. He continued making a few other video's. The video that got him noticed by fan's of The Elder Scrolls series, was a video called Ultimate Morrowind Secret. It's a parodie of every video on YouTube that has to do with finding a secret in a video game. The main character of the video was Ranma. Ranma would explain to the viewer's that he found the ultimate secret. He would attempt to show the viewer, step-by-step, on how to find the secret. Of course, everything that happened was a little bit random and strange. At the end of the video, the player get's to where the secret is. He tell's the viewer's where the secret it. And at the point where he's just about to reveal it, a pop-up picture appears on the screen with loud screaming in the background. His own video's continue to be submited to his channel.</p>
