<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandar_Antonijevic_afc7.html" title="Edit section: Media reviews of dances">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Media reviews of dances</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Four Temperaments:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Veteran principal dancer Aleksandar Antonijevic continues to grow from strength to strength. His Melancholic Variations was mesmerizing – intense, passionate and beautifully performed. He moves in seamless patterns, making choreography a fluid flow of honey rather than abridge between individual steps.” The Globe and Mail, 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>La Sylphide:</li>
</ul>
<p>“The leads were captivating, with Antonijevic showing a particular affinity for Bournonville… was lyrical in his masculinity.” The Globe and Mail, 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>Opus 19/ The Dreamer:</li>
</ul>
<p>“…led magnificently by Aleksandar Antonijevic…he invests his role with the kind of physical intelligence and mature artistic understanding that is all too rare on ballet stages today.” The National Post, 2005</p>
<p>“…The Dreamer is a wonderful showcase for the ever-evolving partnership of Sonia Rodriguez and Aleksandar Antonijevic – a pairing that in a memorable opening night turn bought everything to it that the work demands and then added an indefinable something that made it soar.” The Toronto Sun, 2005</p>
<p>“Last night Aleksandar Antonijevic and Sonia Rodriguez danced the lead roles in Jerome Robbins’ Opus 19 / The Dreamer as if it has been created for them.” The Toronto Star, 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice:</li>
</ul>
<p>“…a poet in motion if ever there was one…” The National Post, 2004</p>
<ul>
<li>Onegin</li>
</ul>
<p>“Antonijevic’s portrayal of Lensky’s bewildering despair was gut-wrenching.” The Globe and Mail, 2003</p>
<ul>
<li>Herman Shmerman</li>
</ul>
<p>“….expertly danced by Greta Hodgkinson and Aleksandar Antonijevic” The Toronto Sun, 2006</p>
<p>“Hodgkinson and Antonijevic showed off their technical expertise with brightness and humour.” The Toronto Star, 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>Swan Lake</li>
</ul>
<p>“Antonijevic was a gentle prince, an outsider living among marauding macho males. His ballon (or lightness) is legendary and his lyrical approach to Siegfried was poetry in motion. The dancer was able to mask his excellent technique within the meaning of the dance, rather than becoming a dancer who drops character when he has to perform virtuoso tricks.” The Globe and Mail, 2005</p>
<p>“Antonijevic flashes across the stage like a streak of moonlight illuminating the dark forest.” The Toronto Star, 1999</p>
<p>“Aleksandar Antonijevic, as Siegfried, was noble, with fine placement and a plush dynamic set off by his soft pliés”. The New York Times, 1999</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sleeping Beauty</li>
</ul>
<p>"Antonijevic's Florimund was one of those bolts of lightning that strikes only once or twice in a decade, announcing that there is magic in the air....Antonijevic must be one of the most exciting dancer-actors anywhere." The Globe and Mail, 1994</p>
<ul>
<li>Romeo and Juliet</li>
</ul>
<p>“Aleksandar Antonijevic and Sonia Rodriguez were magical together…Antonijevic just keeps getting better. His partnering is assured and unobtrusive; he has beautiful technique with gorgeous lines and phrasing, and a ballon lighter than air. Over the years he has also become a consummate actor, and that is the joy of his performance of Romeo – he is a complete dancer.” The Globe and Mail, 2006</p>
<p>“an extraordinary actor-dancer…filled with subtle personality nuance and character detail that fleshed out Cranko’s choreography beyond mere storytelling” The Globe and Mail, 2002</p>
<p>"His Romeo presented a perfect picture of Renaissance Italian youth, swept up by star crossed destiny. (Antonijevic is) an elegantly centred dancer able to toss off pirouettes with patrician ease...truly a Romeo in the making, blessed with impressive promise.” The Toronto Star, 2002</p>
<p>Giselle</p>
<p>“the most princely looking of the company’s present roster” The Toronto Star, 2004</p>
<p>“(Antonijevic) has a soft springy jump that a gazelle would envy – though this leaper lands in perfect fifth and deep plié each time. He possesses high extension and excellent lines, making an elegant and supportive partner.” Dance Magazine, 1999</p>
