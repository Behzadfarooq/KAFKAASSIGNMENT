<p><b>REPLIES</b></p>
<ul>
<li>"Thats a very good breakdown. You nailed it." - <b>Pogo</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Most of the families control over unions and the industries connected to them are in the past. The carting companies are almost all large multinational corporations like Waste Management Inc. They recently forced IBT Local 813 out on strike over health benefit costs and beat the union up pretty badly. Same situation in concrete, garment center, Javits and JFK. Mob control of the airport ended with the clean up of IBT locals 295 and 851 which are the primary unions inside the property. As far as the waterfront goes, ILA 1814 has finally been indicted into submission. Unfortunately, this is too late for the longshoreman as NYC no longer has any commercial pier operations. Similar indictments in NJ and Florida have almost completely driven the mob from those areas as well. The Fulton Fish Market, which was moved to the Bronx, has a miniscule mob presence compared with just a few years ago and any claim that they "control" anything there is wishful thinking. A note on the construction unions-IBT 282 has been cleaned up. They were the key to mob control over construction sites as they controlled access to the construction sites. The Iron Workers, Carpenters, Elevator Constructors, etc... have all suffered numerous indictments and the removal of mob members. For the first time there is now non-union construction of high rise buildings in Manhattan. Things are not what they used to be." - <b>Blindman</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The family listings was both past and present.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that mob presence is all but gone in the Garment center, JFK airport, and the Javits center.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While much of the New York market has been taken away, the Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, and Colombo famlies remain involved in garbage to some extent there, as well as other places like New Jersey, Connecticut, and Florida.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While their complete domination is gone, the Genovese family will likely continue to operate on the fringes of the new Fulton Fish Market for years to come.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>People have talked about cleaning up the docks for decades. I think the Genovese and Gambino families will always be there to some degree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Construction is the big exception in my opinion. Giuliani was never able to put the industry under regulatory control like he did with the waste hauling and the Fulton Fish Market. Despite recurring prosecutions and federal oversight, I'd say most of the New York families are involved in the construction industry as much as ever." - <b>wiseguy</b></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"No doubt that mob still has a presence at the fish market, albeit a small one that is unlikely to grow. Before they could and did extort everybody, including customers who had already paid for their fish.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On NYC docks there is really nothing for the mob to control anymore as Brooklyn and Manhattan piers are being developed for warehousing, condominiums and cruiseships. In NY, NJ and Miami, every guy who went down with the Gotti's and Red Scollo, left a guy to replace him but the feds knew who they were and could easily pick them off. Nowadays the ones we don't know by name can't really operate.&#160;:They can't meet with or even talk to the old crew or they get moved out just for that alone. The presence is still there in some stevedore companies but that won't make economic sense much longer without the cost advantages gained through control of the unions. Gambling and drugs on the waterfront? They will always have that. Containerized freight and GPS on the trucks ruined the highjackers and the control of jobs went away with the union. Not much left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In construction they lost the concrete club, window installation, drywall, tin knockers, operating engineers, elevator construction(a great way to extort a contractor)no show jobs and just about everything else. They still control some small companies involved in all manner of the business, but not enough to feed a family on. Fucking Chinese guys from Queens are building highrises in Manhattan! A year ago they were doing single family homes in Queens. It's all over but the crying." - <b>Blindman</b></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"It seems to me that many people don't see farther than the latest indictment. One can make a list a mile long of various cases over the years. With every new crackdown comes the same tune about "it all being over." We've heard this for years and yet the indictments continually come. The latest batch of arrests and prosecutions is simply evidence to me that the mob's involvement in a given area has continued. All one has to do is read the indictments themselves to see how the mob has continued to make millions from both the docks and construction, despite changes in both industries.&#160;:Regardless of what many have said over the years, the mob's control of the unions in both the waterfront and the building trades - as well as the shakedowns, kickbacks, bid-rigging, and no-show jobs that come with it - has continued. All one has to do is wait for the next indictment to see........." - <b>wiseguy</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Luccheses are also involved in Carpenters in NY - Crea jsut got released for his involvement with two Local 608 guys, the 608 gusy were convicted but the judge dismissed the conviction citing anti-Irish sentiment in the jury.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Colombos (unless they finally got them out) were very big in Locals 14 &amp; 15 of the operating engineers, that was Jackie DeRoss' he had all his kids involved with that" - <b>TS</b></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"When it comes to the docks, any ship coming into the harbor needs a tug boat or two. There are very few tow outfits left. Also, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn is where a few cruise lines board passengers. The income may not be what it use to be on the docks, though there are some earners present running various services.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You can add car dealerships (Columbo's), auto repairs and towing (Gambinos), bakeries (a few families) and real estate rental properties (all)." - <b>cardboardman</b></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"It is evident to me that the mob is still making big bucks from the waterfront. Despite changes in the industry and repeated proscutions, the mob (especially the Genovese family) has remained very active on the ports. Long ago the Genovese family understood that containerized shipping would decrease the need for longshoremen and increase the need for container movers, mechanics, and repair workers. Through their control of the ILA, they created new union locals in New Jersey and Miami in order to retain their control of the industry. The family has continued to make money in a number of ways. It has reportedly made millions of dollars in payoffs from waterfront companies in New York, New Jersey and Miami, as well as from kickbacks from dock workers in order to keep their jobs. The Genovese and Gambino families split $400,000 from the worker's health and walfare funds. Genovese family members and associates have also continued to hold high level union positons that pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in salaries." - <b>wiseguy</b></li>
