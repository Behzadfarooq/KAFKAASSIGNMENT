	    <p><b>Alexander Marion Ryan</b> (called Alex) is a character in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> television show, <i><a href="../../../m/c/l/McLeod%27s_Daughters_915a.html" title="McLeod's Daughters">McLeod's Daughters</a></i>. He is played by <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Jeffery_8652.html" title="Aaron Jeffery">Aaron Jeffery</a>.</p>
<p>Alex is the son of Harry and Elizabeth Ryan. Alex is a risk-taker. Formerly, he was a <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodeo.html" title="Rodeo">rodeo</a> star. Alex now helps run Killarney, the farm and land Harry built from the ground up with Alex is to inherite. Women are easily attracted to his charms, and he is quick to make friends. His current occupation is that of a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmer.html" title="Farmer">farmer</a>, as he owns a property called Wilgul together with his brother <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Ryan_83b1.html" title="Nick Ryan">Nick</a>. Although he and Nick have had some fights in the past, their relationship is quite close.</p>
<p>Alex is a bit of a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_boy.html" title="Bad boy">bad boy</a>. His relationship with his father Harry Ryan (who is not his biological father) has always been explosive. His biological father is Bryce Redstaff, lawyer based in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, who has a history of <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a>. He and Alex's mother had a brief affair until she found out she was pregnant and married Harry.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Mcleod_8d72.html" title="Claire Mcleod">Claire Mcleod</a>, a childhood friend and neighbour, was the love of Alex's life. Unfortunately, she died in a car accident just before he was about to propose to her. Her death devastated Alex, but over time he managed to get himself back on his feet. After Claire died he supported Tess and the girls at Drovers and was reunited with former childhood sweetheart Tracy Morrison. He and Tracy almost got back together until Alex realised that he would always love Claire and that no one else could take her place.</p>
<p>Alex continued to be a father-figure to Claire's child, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_McLeod_2bb6.html" title="Charlotte McLeod">Charlotte</a>, until Charlotte's biological father, Peter Johnson came back to claim custody of Charlotte. Alex and Peter have never got on, as Alex refers to Peter as 'the knob'. A fight arrupts between them during Charlotte's first birthday party. Alex even called upon Bryce's aid to fight Peter's claim in court. Alex has never forgiven Peter for hurting Claire and feels that he has been more of a father to Charlotte than Peter, who has had not seen Charlotte since she was born. Although Charlotte eventually went to live with Peter and his family, Charlotte still continued to visit and stay with Alex. It is not shown on screen it is assumed that Alex and Peter struck up a truce or even a friendship for Charlotte's sake.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Hall_ce05.html" title="Stevie Hall">Stevie Hall</a>, a good friend of his, helped him in those dark times. Eventually a kind of romance develops between them, although neither of them are willing to admit it. As a result he becomes engaged to Fiona Webb, a city girl who has a few secrets and is sees Stevie as a threat.</p>
<p>Just as Alex rekindles his relationship with his father, Harry Ryan dies from a heart attack. Alex is devastated. But finally is finally able to understand his father's <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psyche.html" title="Psyche">psyche</a> and let him go. Alex from then on becomes the sole owner of Killarney. Eventually he learns that Sandra, Harry's much younger wife (Probably the same age as Alex)and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_McLeod_8bc9.html" title="Claire McLeod">Claire's</a> childhood rival and enemy murdered him after he filed for divorce. The fate of Sandra is unknown.</p>
<p>Alex eventually marries Fiona, but later divorces her after she lied to him about being pregnant when she is <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infertile.html" title="Infertile">infertile</a> and realising that he is in love with Stevie. Alex had to pay out a hefty divorce settlement to Fiona when she treid to claim half of Killarney. He once again he called on Bryce's aid. Bryce offered to help Alex financially by investing in Killarney so he could pay out the settlement. Bryce then sends Marcus Turner to overlook his affairs on Killarney until Alex learns that Marcus is Bryce's son and that they are brothers.</p>
