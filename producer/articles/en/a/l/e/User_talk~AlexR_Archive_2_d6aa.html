<p>Fine, but I think the article, either way, has serious POV issues. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 02:53, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to your remark:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would you kindly stop making those stupid and incorrect edits to transwoman? It is obvious that you have no clue about gender assignments, so stop putting BS into the article, or you might find yourself treated as a vandal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not familiar with the theory, but you're presenting POV as fact and being bold as vandalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example, one is not born in any sex</dd>
</dl>
<p>One is <i>definitely</i> born with a set of sex chromosomes and genitalia. There is established POV that states that sex is a matter of genetics and anatomy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>there are debates whether transgender people are clearly one sex</dd>
</dl>
<p>My edits have never made a factual statement either way about that issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>and intersex people can get assigned another gender at any time, not only shortly after birth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And, the most basic thing: You may have something hanging between your legs, but what gets into the papers is not put there by said thingy, but by people - namely, doctors, midwifes and/or parents.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What gets into the papers, according to your POV, decides or "assigns" one's sex. I assert that in most cases, it is simply an empirical observation of a pre-existing biological condition that is recorded. But this is a matter of POV, not fact--as editors, we must often be careful not to confuse the two. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:14, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexR_Archive_2_d6aa.html" title="Edit section: LGBT">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LGBT</span></h2>
<p>I apologize if my judgement was in error on a couple of articles, but my purpose was simply cleaning up the way some people use <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a> as a catchall even for topics that are <i>already</i> filed in LGBT subcategories. Under Wikipedia's stated policy of category management, the number of categories on an article needs to always be kept to the minimum possible number, and an article should <i>never</i> be simultaneously filed in a specific subcategory <i>and</i> the master category that the subcategory belongs to.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> (one of your reversions) doesn't <i>need</i> to be -- and under Wikipedia policy, really <i>can't</i> be -- in both <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a> and the subcategory <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_orientation_8771.html" title="Category:Sexual orientation">Category:Sexual orientation</a>. One or the other is sufficient, and the <i>only</i> thing I did to that article was to remove the LGBT category; it was <i>already</i> filed in both of the other subcats. And most of the other articles you reverted are already filed under "transgender-related topics", which is <i>also</i> subcategorized under LGBT already. As for <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_ISIS_Survey_dedc.html" title="1983 ISIS Survey">1983 ISIS Survey</a>, I simply typed the wrong category by mistake; my actual intention was to file it under <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_history_48fb.html" title="Category:LGBT history">Category:LGBT history</a>.</p>
<p>Some people seem to think "LGBT" needs to act as a one-stop master list of all LGBT-related topics regardless of where else they're filed, but that's not how categories work or what they're meant to be doing.</p>
<p>And, for the record, it hardly constitutes "widespread changes getting pushed through without proper debate". One doesn't <i>have</i> to debate following Wikipedia policy on category management. The angry tone you took on my talk page is neither an appreciated or an appropriate response to the matter, particularly since I'm almost singlehandedly responsible for the T being <i>in</i> most of the category names in the <i>first</i> place, and I will not even acknowledge any future discussion from you that strikes that tone again.</p>
<p>Later update: I see you also reverted <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe_8.html" title="Tribe 8">Tribe 8</a>. For one thing, <b>one does not have to announce a category change before making it</b>; the assertion that an unannounced change should be reverted just for being unannounced is utter bullcrap. But, since you want to know, here was why I made the changes I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>The category "punk rock groups" is <i>redundant</i> with category "later punk groups"; going back to the stuff about subcategory vs. master category, it's a one-or-the-other case, not both.</li>
<li>Tribe 8 is not an individual; it's a band. "Gay, lesbian or bisexual people" is for <i>individuals</i>. This change does <i>not</i> remove them from a queer context, as they're still filed under "LGBT musicians".</li>
<li>The band should be sorted as "Tribe 8" under the letter T, not as "8, Tribe" under the number 8.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and by the way...the next time you want to accuse me of thoughtlessness, you might want to take a gander at the description of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_orientation_and_identity_c5f0.html" title="Category:Sexual orientation and identity">Category:Sexual orientation and identity</a> before you start typing: <i>The category is for articles that have to do with sexual orientation, sexual identity, labels, <b>and gender identity</b>.</i> So if you think that's wrong or offensive, take it up with the person who wrote that. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I fail to understand where you get the notion that the category <i>is</i> conflating "sexual identity" with "gender identity". Where in anything connected to the category is there even the <i>suggestion</i> that anybody thinks transgender is a <i>sexual</i> identity? The category title doesn't say that. The category description didn't say that. I genuinely fail to grasp how you're interpreting "identity" as inherently meaning "sexual identity" to the exclusion of any other meaning of the word, when the category quite explicitly distinguished two distinct concepts of "sexual identity" and "gender identity", and <i>nothing</i> implied that one was being subsumed into the other. And that doesn't make me a transphobic bigot or a person who should somehow "know better" than anything; it makes me a person who knows how to read what's written and not infer stuff that isn't there. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:02, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The spelling2 project (to work on secondary namespaces) was opened and finished. Progress charts will be available soon.</p>
<p>Version <i>six-three</i> tracks who made the edits, and rankings are available. Much of the work was done while I was asleep, explaining my <a href="http://humanbot.joeyday.net/enwiki/stats.php" class="external text" title="http://humanbot.joeyday.net/enwiki/stats.php" rel="nofollow">low place</a>&#160;;).</p>
<p>The next project, which may even be released today, will probably fix incorrectly capitalised headings, particularly "See Also" and "External Links".</p>
<p>The mailing list has grown to 24 people and while that is very nice for my ego, it is rather difficult to send out updates. This is why I did not send out a notice that the spelling2 project had opened. From now on, then, you must watch <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumanbot_announce_6ba3.html" title="User:Humanbot/announce">User:Humanbot/announce</a> for updates. <a href="../../../r/3/m/User%7ER3m0t_5466.html" title="User:R3m0t">r3m0t</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/3/m/User_talk%7ER3m0t_43f3.html" title="User talk:R3m0t">talk</a></sup> 12:03, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>AlexR, during the RfA for Eequor, I engaged you in an unnessesarily confrontational way. I am extremely sorry for my behavior. As Eequor's nominator, I was upset and frustrated by the way the voting was going, and it seems that I took out some of my frustration on you. I highly regard you as a Wikipedian, and I hope you can forgive me.
