<p>just can't win with you....every website states that Thuringowa is its own Electoral district as is Townsville, every site except that ABC site and this is a story from a reporter, wouldn't it be more accurate to cite this info from all the government and electoral sites that show and say that both Townsville and Thuringowa are separate electoral districts...can we please not have a repeat of what happened before this is getting silly and it looks like your just trying to irritate me, but you have to admit that the facts are in the refs on this page, they all say Thuringowa is the Electoral district and none of them say anything about it being a Townsville based Electoral district except for the one from a reporter from a TV station. this is not the best ref to use and I feel that it doesn't really need to be here as all the other ref's give enough info. would love to here yours and anyone else's reply <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 11:10, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>mate why don't you do as i asked and leave it on here for a while and see if anyone else has a problem with it ...it looks like you are the only one that has the prob the page is about Thuringowa's electoral district s othere is no need to have all the other points about Townsville and the same goes for the Townsville district page there is no need for Thuringowa the page is not about the location and how close it is to Townsville its about the Thuringowa electoral district your just being stupid about this know and we have NOT discussed this you just told me you didn't want to talk about this i will change it back and i would like it left like that for at least a week and if nobody else changes it then it should stay isn't that fair....i think so <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 10:51, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alec. Welcome to Wikipedia. I felt that the original wording seemed to suggest that Townsville was disadvantaged by having 'only' one Senator out of 12 ("the only one based in Townsville"). In reality, Queensland is a large place with many cities, so it's not unreasonable that they would be spread around a little bit. I felt that my change still made it obvious that he was the only one but stated the fact in a slightly more neutral way. I didn't think that it was overly POV and thought twice about it before changing it so please don't be too concerned about it. I've made my share of edits that people have later changed to be less POV. It all makes for a better encyclopedia.

<dd>I dropped the Liberal Party bit just to make it less wordy as I figured that people could click on the wikilink to find out which party he was from. Perhaps it should read: " <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_Senators_ca07.html" title="List of Australian Senators">Senator</a> <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Macdonald_%28Australian_politician%29_f69c.html" title="Ian Macdonald (Australian politician)">Ian Macdonald</a>, if the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a> is one of twelve Australian Senators elected from Queensland and is based in Townsville.</i>" I'm not sure.</dd>

<p>hi mate.. it looks good im very happy the only thing i might change is at the top you have Townsville/Thuringowa but it may look better as Townsville and Thuringowa ...but it is ok the way you have it so i will leave it up to you. thanks for asking me for my thoughts <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 11:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>hi mate what you have done is ok the only reason i said Townsville and Thuringowa was becasue of how it is writen in the list ...it has urban areas of Townsville and Thuringowa etc but the way you have it is fine it shows the suburbs of both Townsville and Thuringowa so it is doing it's job. great work <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 02:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think your edits are a big improvement. its not speculation because it presents reported facts rather than saying 'a department store might open sometime in the future'. It presents evidence that the department stores are considering their options. its then up to the readers to draw their own conclusions. I'm going to take the liberty of moving some of the words around a bit. I hope you don't mind. Rather than saying that 'it is widely accepted', it might be better to say that a survey indicated that people thought the shopping experiece was reduced. ... could you please check my changes to see if they reflect what the survey actually found.

<p>Alec, thank you for the invitation to the project. I won't be able to contribute more, as the article is far beyond anything I ever knew about Palm Is.!

<p>Hi - it has come to our notice that you have recently created a new stub type. As it clearly states at <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a>, at the top of most stub categories, on the template page for new Wikiprojects and in many other places on Wikipedia, new stub types should be proposed prior to creation at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Proposals_774a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals</a>, in order to check whether the new stub type is already covered by existing stub types, whether it is named according to stub naming guidelines, whether it reaches the standard threshold for creation of a new stub type, whether it crosses existing stub type hierarchies, and whether better use could be made of a WikiProject-specific talk page template.</p>
<p>In the case of your new stub type, it is already covered by existing stub types, does not reach the standard threshold for creation of a new stub type, and is very vaguely worded as to its actual catchment. Furthermore, it is usually only very large cities which are viable enough for their own stub type (in Australia, only the state capitals have them) - other areas are usually split by county or other official subregional division. Your new stub type is currently listed at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_D_4924.html" title="WP:WSS/D">WP:WSS/D</a> - please feel free to make any comments there as to any reason why this stub type should not be proposed for deletion at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>. And please, in future, propose new stub types first! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:13, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>S'alright... and "illegal" isn't really right - "highly discouraged" is closer to it. Look at it from the stub sorters' point of view. If every city of 200,000 people around the world got its own stub, we'd have thousands more stub types than we already do. I do think that a talk page template would be far more use to you, though, especially if your wikiproject is still small. Have a look at the templates at the top of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Talk%7EPenny_Lane_1517.html" title="Talk:Penny Lane">Talk:Penny Lane</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/n/Talk%7EDunedin_5734.html" title="Talk:Dunedin">Talk:Dunedin</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrahame_Sydney_29d4.html" title="Talk:Grahame Sydney">Talk:Grahame_Sydney</a> to get some idea of the sort of things I mean. That way you can rate all the articles relating to Townsville, not just ones which are stubs. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've deleted it (you have to be an admin to do that part). Thanks for being understanding about it! The wikiproject page looks good BTW. As far as the talk page template's concerned, they're not the easiest types of template to make, but if the Australia Wikiproject has one then you can probably get someone from there to help out with the details if you run into problems. Good luck with the project! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just spotted this conv - hope you don't mind me butting in&#160;:) If you're interested in getting a Wikiproject going for North Queensland (under the WP Australia banner), and can get some editors together, we at the WA project would be happy to help you set one up - we've already done so for Victoria and Tasmania.

<p>Hey there. Personally I haven't had much trouble finding online news sources for Palm Island, I have back-referenced a fair bit of the <i>2004 riot and death-in-custody controversy</i> section. Copyright is something to be very careful of. If you were to do it for one or two articles in your own user space, for a definate period of time, then that's one thing... personally I think you're better off saving to pc the relevant text. By all means, keep adding lists of online refs to talk pages. They are useful things in a lot of ways. But my verdict is, keep the copyright material on the host website. The other thing to bear in mind is, if you do what you are suggesting it may be quite difficult for other editors to correctly source the material they are using. ie if you copy the text but leave off ... the orig website, url, publisher, published date, authors name - then it is no longer verifiable information.</p>

<dd>My thoughts are generally in line with Garrie's. Copyright is very tricky and it is best to err on the side of caution on these matters.

<dd>Regards providing an URL - I have seen the same done in the past. Reference is to the paper-based publication (publisher, location, date/issue number etc) but a URL is provided - just if you try to access the URL you need to log in. There is no problem in providing such a URL - <i>any subscriber</i> can verify the validity. It's like referring to a show that's on cable TV, or a book that's only held in the Parlimentary Library in Canberra / Brisbane - just because it's not easy to verify, doesn't mean the information isn't useful to someone trying to verify the info.</dd>

So it would be best to do on a section by section basis with decent editing remarks not like some of the ones which currently don't give any indication of what is being done.</p>
<p>Anyway, today is my wedding anniversary (11 years I think?) so I need to go buy something for my other half... I won't be doing much on this till next Thursday, I'm taking a few days off until my oldest daughter starts school next Wednesday. Hope it all goes peacefully.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 04:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, it was nice (quite but nice)... More importantly to the whole family, my daughters first school day was also excellent.

(reading more carefully - it's been 40°C and 50% humidity here - not typical Perth weather!) Ah I see your point. What might be needed is simply to expand the scope and rename WPT to WPNQ as we did with Hobart -&gt; Tasmania. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 09:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I don't think it is quite at GA standard just yet (mind you, I have never taken an article there myself although a few of us are working on <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverina.html" title="Riverina">one</a> that I don't think is far away from having a go). The ACOTF process has added plenty of content but I think it needs a good edit to tighten up some of the sections and improve the readability. It probably needs some work adding some needed references as well. But Steve is right, the GA process will get some outside people to provide fresh ideas and is worth a shot.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattinbgn_04d3.html" title="User:Mattinbgn">Mattinbgn</a>/ <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattinbgn_acb6.html" title="User talk:Mattinbgn">talk</a></sup> 12:03, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi&#160;:) The article's coming along very well indeed. With that one interview though, it would seem it would justify one or at most two sentences - it is after all one man's opinion, who lives at the other end of Queensland.

<p>hi sorry about changing a reference from "Townsville/Thuringowa" to "Townsville, Thuringowa" as I thought that is what I was told to do by Amerique so yes I "know damn well" that all these titles describing Townsville and Thuringowa are under dispute, I was on the understanding that yourself and Amerique where going to have a look at the edits I do and put in your views (like you did on my talk page) as for The Express I feel that it does warrant mentioning as it is a business promotional publication like you said but it does have news stories about new business's etc and lifestyle articles like Plan you Wedding, around the House and garden as so on. I did some checking before I added it and was told that journalists do some interviews, I added it due to the fact that it contains info that the residents of the 2 cities would need to know ( I have found info in here on shops that I didn't know about) if you like you can re-word it and thank you for your views and im glad you liked the info about the sun. thanks again <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 06:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>here we go again....--------------------- the info came from the Express, here is the phone number 47888188 so you can give them a call to see if I am full of shit or not( a young Male answered the phone, i called about 3 weeks ago), I don't get all my info from the Thuringowa mayor like you say I do I know a lot more people than him. and for your info the Mayor IS a primary source of info for Thuringowa as is the Thuringowa Website, im sorry I tried to improve your article. You say "info about shops are not 'need to know' journalism, it's fluff" that your POV and I thought you didn't like POV's plus I never make edits based on secondary sources that's you POV again. I will remove it now for you as it is a Thuringowa business anyway so I guess it doesn't belong on a Townsville article <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 07:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>- ------------- when you say "just because a minor fact gives you the opportunity to insert the name Thuringowa two or three times into an article does not make it worthy of mentioning." this is the ------------- I have ever heard....the fact that Thuringowa can be mentioned has nothing to do with it like I said it was a paper that I thought was large enough to mention and you think I am wrong (what a surprise). Info from the Mayor is independent (it's from the mayor) and most of the info I use from him is verifiable by others due to the fact that the info is on the Thuringowa website (I add refs) anyway I took it out for you so lets end this now until Amerique has his say (but it looks like he gave up trying to reason with you to) <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 08:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>wow ok....making personal attacks mmm so when you say to me "you know damn well"(I was doing as I was asked) and "info from e-mails from the Thuringowa Mayor"(I use his info to find out more info and ref it) plus "a minor fact gives you the opportunity to insert the name Thuringowa"(this is your POV and not why I added it) I feel that these are personal attacks, don't worry I know that you legitimately disagree with me and I am fine with that, but you were told to share your thoughts on the edits I did so that Amerique can offer his views, but today you came on here and got up me for making a edit over a week ago that i did to comply with what I was told to do by Amerique. I am in no way trying to attack you until you submit, that is just your way of thinking. Im sorry if I have a sense of humour, but I asked if you had escaped from somewhere due to you stirring me up again (we have had no problems until you got the s**ts with me for doing a edit) and if you are talking about my "filth" being completely inappropriate (I guess you mean the word shit) that is not a bad word and if you feel that it is then im Sorry. oh and I don't loose it every time we disagree I just didn't like the way you came on here today and ripped it up me for doing as I was told I have been very nice to you over the last few mths and this time it wasn't me that spoiled it lets hope it ends again Now as I thought everything was going well thanks <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 09:57, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi again can you tell me how I am to fix the citations needed you added, Thuringowa doesn't have a hospital, I have never seen it in print anywhere but most of us no that it doesn't and that is why I said it relies on the Townsville based ones, and with "the best location would be in the northern beaches area" this info I got while talking with the mayor so as you would know I can not cite that but I do feel that it is important info that need to stay. waiting for your views please. thanks <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 03:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If both you and Thuringowacityrep are agreeable, as a fellow AMA member, I would be happy to try and assist in brokering some kind of peace and looking over edits on the articles while Amerique is away.

<p>Hi Alec, you need to put a slash "/" at the end of your &lt;ref&gt;when you are calling up a previously named reference. For example &lt;ref name="Oz - biased coroner out"/&gt; Otherwise it assumes that all following text is a new reference.

<p>thanks for adding to the Thuringowa page, it's looking better ...but i was wondering if you can help me a little problem i am having... as you know i started a new article called List of Health Services in the City of Thuringowa and Restaurants in the City of Thuringowa so i could link to them on the main Thuringowa page (like you have done with some on the Townsville page) but the 2 pages that i have started are up for deletion, i and being told that the pages are [[WP:NOT#DIR], but on this page it states "Merged groups of small articles based on a core topic are certainly permitted" and i think this is what i have done.</p>
<p>can you have a quick look and offer me your views please (if you have time) the links are <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Restaurants_in_the_City_of_Thuringowa_2e93.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Restaurants in the City of Thuringowa">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Restaurants in the City of Thuringowa</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Health_Services_in_the_City_of_Thuringowa_813f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Health Services in the City of Thuringowa">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Health Services in the City of Thuringowa</a> thanks <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 05:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>thanks for your effort but it looks like i may have to put these 2 pages back on the the Thuringowa page, i was doing what <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">user:Peripitus</a> said in his comments on the talk page after he gave it a rating, i will remove the tag that was put on the 2 pages and go from there but i am at a loss as to why they need to be deleted. thanks again <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 11:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>thanks for looking in on my travel page, it took me a while but it's looking good. I will link it to the Townsville travel page when i am done and i may link the Townsville travel page to the Thuringowa one later (if i can do that). and if it is ok i will put a link to the Townsville and Thuringowa pages on Wikipedia (again if i can) and put a link to the Thuringowa travel page on the Thuringowa article, i think this will get me to how i wanted it before my other 2 pages were put up for deletion. thanks again for your thoughts <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 02:40, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Alec I was wondering, I know there is an article <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulrunji.html" title="Mulrunji">Mulrunji</a> which identifies that is the name of a recently deceased <b>specific</b> aboriginal person.</p>
<p>Would you consider, if you have the relevant sources at your disposal, creating an article relating the the cultural factors which lead to the renaming of a recently deceased individual in various aboriginal cultures across Australia? The creation of this type of article would greatly assist in discussions about the issue and would centralise discussion about when it is no longer appropriate to refer to Mulrinji by that name, and to revert back to the name he had when he was alive (and similarly for other Aboriginal people with similar beliefs).</p>
<p>To clarify - I'm not after a sub-page under WP:WikiProject Australia or something, but an actual article which discusses the cultural belief system.</p>
<p>Was Mulrunji actually working for the dole, or was he an employee of the local Aboriginal Land Council? sometimes it is a very grey issue... the dole money is paid to the ALC then the ALC pays all their employees, but people who work for the ALC don't have to look for other paid employment. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 00:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The debate's just started off again after a NSW user "fixed" all the WA articles without consensus, so I thought I'd let you know this debate seems to be on again <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielT5_5528.html" title="User:DanielT5">DanielT5</a> 08:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>no probs mate I can understand but please try to understand that I am not here to P@#S anyone off, I am a nice person that is trying to do what I can with the life I have left, if I find that I have had a bad day and I've got the sh#ts then I don't get on Wiki because I don't want to be the person that rips the fork out of someone for making an edit (trust me I have some bad days and pain can make a person "not themselves" at times).<br />
so I just want to say that I have no hard feelings toward you but please try not to snap and just explain to me if I have made a mistake, I treat people the same as they treat me. I will remove some of the info on the talk page and hope that editors don't revert it. oh and thanks for your help offer<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 01:04, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It doesn't belong in the article.</p>
<p>It is a non-notable photoshopped gimmick that actually contains advertising to an external site. It doesn't conform to any well known widely circulated description of drop bears, and is clearly a joke. Drop bears AFAIK are just like koala bears, which have fearsome enough claws, teeth and hideous odour.</p>
<p>The topic of the article is a joke, but that doesn't mean the article should be--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 13:10, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi thanks for that, i was going to take some photos around Thuringowa but haven't had a chance to yet so this is a big help. They look great, i have plans on getting some of the Thuringowa city sign, Riverway, the CBD, Cannon Park and others all the way out to Rupertswood and Rollingstone etc, the only think i'm not sure about is the Townsville/Thuringowa in the info box but i will leave it as it is to keep the peace, plus it directs to the Townsville/Thuringowa page and that is a good thing.<br />
Again, great work Thanks <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 00:48, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey..what i will do is try to get some more info on <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushland_Beach%2C_Queensland_6f7b.html" title="Bushland Beach, Queensland">Bushland Beach</a> and then a few pics might look ok, but like you say it might be a bit much now, i'll try to add some info later today or tomorrow. As for the link to Thuringowa i would be very happy if you would do that. thanks again <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 03:38, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>oh also i just seen this on the Townsville page ‹ The template below has been proposed for deletion. See templates for deletion to help reach a consensus on what to do. ›</p>
<p>thought i better let you know that it had been marked for deletion so you ca stop it. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 03:43, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
