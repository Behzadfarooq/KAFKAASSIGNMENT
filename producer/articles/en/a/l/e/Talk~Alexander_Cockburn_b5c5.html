<dd>I'm not sure it is pronounced "<i>Coburn</i>" (as Bruce Cockburn's name is known to be). I saw (Alex) Cockburn in the early 1990s and seem to remember him saying that his name is pronounced as it looks. I think I'll ask him directly.</dd>

<p>I'm pretty sure that Cockburn's father, Claude, was a communist rather than a socialist. Orwell thought so, and the article on him seems to imply that this is the case. In the interests of accuracy, could someone confirm this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Claud Cockburn covered the civil war in Spain for the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Worker_d2c4.html" title="Daily Worker">Daily Worker</a> (a paper of the Communist Party) and he also travelled with the communist Fifth Regiment there: <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPcockburn.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPcockburn.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPcockburn.htm</a>.

<p>Cockburn was forced to leave the Voice after it was purchased by Rupert Murdoch for a trumped up charge of confict of interest. He had accepted fees from a Palestinian organization and did not disclose this when criticizing Israeli policies.</p>
<p>How is that a trumped up charge, it does sound like conflict of interest to me.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 21:57, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If Cockburn was born in Scotland, and his father was British, and he has spent the better half of his life living in the United States, why in God's name does the article say that he is "Irish"?

<p>This cockburn article is under a subject heading of ANARCHISTS...Cockburn is by no stretch of the imagination a socialist. He doesn't, as far as I know, necessarily spell out his views, but if one just reads his articles, they are clearly Marxist and fall into a revolutionary socialist, anti-capitalist tradition, but not anarchist.</p>
<p>(I took the liberty of rearranging the discussion page a bit.) As for Alexander Cockburn's political label, I don't really know if he is an anarchist. I don't ever recall reading that he identified himself as such (and I've read his articles on <a href="../../../c/o/u/CounterPunch_%28newsletter%29_e66c.html" title="CounterPunch (newsletter)">CounterPunch</a> for a couple of years now) so perhaps the label of "socialist" would be more accurate. Perhaps an email to him would clear things up? --<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESus_scrofa_d37c.html" title="User:Sus scrofa">Sus scrofa</a> 21:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the best label for Cockburn and his politics (especially in the last 10 years or so) would be "independent radical." For quite a few years now, he has been associating with libertarians and anarchists, as well as Greens and independent socialists.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 04:37, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to be such an immature, gutter-minded asshole, but, in the second to last paragraph, I noticed the following line: "Cockburn was recently fingered by Alan Dershowitz..." which doesn't sound right. Perhaps there is a reasonably substitutable word.</p>

<p>Does the word "hostility" here seem like a POV characterization to anyone else? Perhaps some might interpret his opinions as "hostility" but I'm sure there are others who would consider them fair and deserved. How exactly are they hostile? Any exemplary quotations? "Critical" might be a better word - criticism is not the same thing as hostility.</p>

<p>I agree with the changes made by 66.69.237.114 (I wish this person had a real identity, rather than an IP number), and would like to see the page reverted to his version. Alexander Cockburn is much more readily identifiable as a radical than a progressive. Indeed, he has been very critical of the so-called "progressive" movement, refering to it many times in his Beat The Devil column as "pwogwessive". I do not ever recall him referring to himself as progressive. Furthermore, his father, Claud, was a Communist, not a Socialist. He never minced words about this.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 20:17, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know what they used to say in HUAC and elsewhere in the '50s: "once a Communist, always a Communist!". Which actually is true enough for present circumstances, I'd say (at least for the purposes of identification). In other words, only a slimy, troglyditic creature like David Horowitz, say, would totally disavow his former existence as a Commie (or whatever). So, to make a long story short, "son of the well-known Communist" should about cover it. ==<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 09:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I've seen this issue before. Alexander's description has changed between these four terms. It all is interpretation though unless we cite Alexander specifically. Let's find a good citation as to how he describes himself. Also later in the article it may be useful to figure out how others describe him. It is completely POV to put in a description if we can't trace it to a source, especially given it is controversial how to describe him and some of the descriptions so far have been close to <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poisoning the well</a>. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLittleGrasshopper_7ba2.html" title="User:LuckyLittleGrasshopper">LuckyLittleGrasshopper</a> 18:35, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added this section. His publications on anti-Semitism are some of the things he is best known for, and as a result he receives quite a bit of criticism for being anti-Semitic himself. He also seems to spend a lot of time defending himself of these accusations, if anybody would like to write a response or defense section.--<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 11:20, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This section you've added is <b>extremely</b> one-sided and cries out for some rebuttal or counterpoint, either interspersed or appended. I've tagged the section accordingly. While I'm a strong A.C. partisan, I do think this topic needs to be discussed; however, what you've given us is basically just a litany or laundry list of complaints that "Cockburn hates Jews" without any countervailing commentary. I think if you actually take the time to read some of his <i>The Politics of Anti-Semitism</i>, you'll find that he is decidedly <i>not</i> anti-Semitic himself. Anyhow. ==<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 17:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Criticism sections are always one-sided. This is because they explain the criticism and give the issues from the stance of the critics. However, nothing in the criticism violates NPOV. It isn't a result of the editor making POV statements or POV claims. Rather, these are the statements and opinions of critics. The editor (myself) has never claimed he was anti-Semitic. Rather, the criticism section pointed out that many people out there do think he is. The fact that people think he is is an objective fact, not a POV statement. A rebuttal or counterpoint would be great. Cockburn spends a lot of his time these days attempting to defend himself from accusations of anti-Semitism. I'm sure someone could write up a 'response' section. And of course the response section would be equally one-sided. Though I'm not sure tagging the article is justified at this point unless something about it actually violates the terms of NPOV.--<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 17:48, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not enough to say "so-and-so says Cockburn is anti-Semitic," the sources quoted have to be credible. Criticizing the policies of the Israeli government, or the ideas of the Likud Party and its right-wing allies, does not make one an anti-Semite. The accusation is used so often, and its definition now so all-encompassing, that it has become nearly worthless. Cockburn has demonstrated in a number of ways that he is a friend of the Jewish people, but no friend of the government that claims to represent them and their best interest. The section you have created, <a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a>, is a travesty and does not meet the standards of Wikipedia. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 17:43, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm well aware of what are considered credible, verifiable sources. Each source quoted is a professional in their field, and fit the criteria for credibility. Each source quoted is just as credible, and accredited, as Cockburn himself. Now, it is your personal opinion that criticism of Israel isn't anti-Semitic. That would be POV. I havn't stated in the section that AC is or is not anti-Semitic. Rather, I pointed out many credible sources that believe he is anti-Semitic. In addition, you claiming it doesn't meet the standards of wikipedia because you don't want to see AC undergo any criticism is absurd. Unless you can somehow demonstrate that a source listed is not credible, then you have no basis for your claim. And even then, it would only justify the removal of that particular source. I think you'll find that each fits the criteria for credibility, however. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 17:48, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This last response indicates a serious forest/trees problem on your part, one that is unfortunately endemic to this whole so-called "encyclopedia". In falling back on the Wikipedia "rules" as a defense, you miss the larger context of what you've created here. Sure, technically speaking you have the rules on your side; the sources you quote are, by and large, "credible". It's the combined effect of the mass of quotations you've assembled here that we (speaking for the congregation here) object to. It's also true, technically speaking, that you yourself haven't accused A.C. of anything, but again, the mass of material you've inserted pretty much speaks for itself.</dd>

<dd>I'm all for a response section to the criticism. However, at this point in AC's career defending himself from allegations of anti-Semitism is an important issue that needs to be brought up when discussing the man. I can't Google "Alexander Cockburn" without getting at least one article in 20 pages that accuses him of some form of anti-Semitism. Right now, it almost appears as if AC groupies are calling it a travesty because they don't want to confront the issue. In reality, this is a very big issue surrounding Cockburn right now.</dd>

<dd>Regarding what you call "mass quotations", I feel as if I've only selected some of the more important ones. The list is rather short compared to the number of persons who have accused Cockburn of being an anti-Semite, or the number of accusations aginst Cockburn you can find out there on the net. Again, I'd love to see a response section or something if it makes everyone feel that it balances it more. Cockburn has written entire articles defending himself of anti-Semitic allegations, and those could make up the body of the response section. I'm sure they could be just as long if not longer than the criticism section here, too.</dd>

<dd>A person's career, especially a journalistic career such as this, is effected in large part by what they report on and how they report it. As I've already pointed out, the anti-Semitism issue with AC is a large one. The real tragedy would be for the wikipedia article to read as a pro-Cockburn gloss-over without addressing and pointing out some of the real issues that people would want to be aware of when researching the man. Thus, I believe the information has a serious place in this article. And I can empathize with those of you who support Cockburn and want to make it appear not so one-sided. Write a 'response' 'support' 'defense', etc. section. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 18:13, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In looking at the recent controversy over the new criticism section, I dug a bit beyond the mere words to see what could be the heart of the matter.

<p>This used to be such a great article, and then slowly but surely, people started fucking it up. Even though the antisemitic entry pissed me off, I eventually accepted it because I think even Cockburn would abmit that it is charge that is frequently leveled against him. However, only a seriously deluded soul would think that Cockburn is a shill for scientology. I know whoever wrote this article is goin to say,"Hey, I put the word nuanced in there, so that proves I'm not just attacking Cockburn". Then why put this in the article other than to tar Cockburn's reputation by associating him with scientology. By no means can Cockburns opinion's in this matter be deemed controversial. I read Counterpunch a lot and I hardly ever hear him talk about being attacked for being a shill for scientology. There is no contoversy here accept in the mind of the person who added this entry. I deleted it because it's irrelevant and is by no means something that Cockburn spends a lot of time on. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">User:anonymous</a> 10:35, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If your an A.C. supporter that's fine, but I've found that on wikipedia there's a childish phobia towards scientology that seems to trump everything else. I personally think the religion is a bunch of bullshit, but so are other religions. Just because Cockburn is critical of the pharmaceutical industry doesn't automatically make him a devotee of the religion. As I said before I don't think is a controversy. When the name Alexander Cockburn comes up I don't think the thought that comes into most people's minds is that great scientology defender. This to me is a prime example of what's wrong with wikipedia. In another post I called it a childish contrarianism. If often seems me that no matter which end of the political spectrum you fall on wikipedia there's this need to somehow defend established authority and present people with alternative viewpoints as dangerous kooks out destroy the world. I do think scientology is a crazy cult, but so are other major religions. Not everyone who's critical of our current over medicated culture is worshipper at the hands of L. Ron Hubbard. It just looks like and indirect attempt to make Cockburn look like a cultish kook and if you were a true A.C. fan as you say you are you'd think about putting up this citation. user:annonymous 14:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I didn't realize that this was intended to be part of a larger section that you hadn't completed yet. It's just that I saw that scientology line and and it sent me into a rage because it felt like a guilt by association smear job.

<dd>The criticism portion wasn't intended as some sort of anti-COS jeremiad, but rather part of a larger section devoted to opinions Cockburn holds that might be controversial, and which have received criticism from other sources.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_Cockburn_b5c5.html" title="Edit section: POV to discredit criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">POV to discredit criticism</span></h2>
<p>I was the first one to introduce the anti-Semitic criticism section of this article. When I came back, to my dismay it would seem that the Cockburn groupies that monitor this have infused it with POV terms and words in an attempt to discredit the criticism. Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alexander Cockburn has been accused of publishing anti-Semitic material by conservative and/or pro-Israel media analysts, academics, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other journalists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first statement from the criticism section. Someone has inserted the qualifiers "conservative" and "pro-Israel" in an attempt to discredit the criticism as legitimate. The fact is that accusing them of being conservative is relative to your own political stance, and thus POV, whereas "pro-Israel" isn't even factually true by any account. The Jewish Political Studies Review, for example, is neither pro-Israel nor conservative. Its an academic peer-reviewed journal. I would accept that NGO Monitor is pro-Israel and that FrontPage is neo-conservative, however to insert those terms into the introductory paragraph would infer that every following group is one or the other. Its misleading and POV. Times Watch I would argue does not demonstrate a conservative political bias in its analysis of Cockburn's anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of blatently POV insertions that attempt to distort and discredit the criticism. These come in the form of inserted rebuttals in the criticism section. The POV insertions will be put in bold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jewish Political Studies Review published an article by Jerome A. Chanes that stated Cockburn was "an intractable foe of Jewish interests." <b>However, he does also go on to say that "to tar all critics of Israel with the brush of antisemitism is unfair, so the argument goes, and may be counterproductive in that it is the first principle of community relations that counteraction of an activity should be premised on the motivating factor of that activity." [11] Still later, Chanes draws a distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, following Gavin Langmuir,[12] and Cockburn is assuredly an outspoken anti-Zionist.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this has done is attempt to make the article's statement that criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitic apply to Cockburn. However, Jerome Chanes clearly accused Cockburn of anti-Semitism. Likewise, Jerome Chanes also noted in the article that anti-Semitism can be disguised as anti-Zionism and accused Cockburn of doing just that. Nor did he "follow" Gavin Langmuir. Gavin Langmuir occurs nowhere in Chanes' work nor do his claims follow from Chanes' work. The addition here has attempted to make it appear that Cockburn's criticism of Zionism and Israel is not anti-Semitic when the Jerome Chanes article clearly stated that Cockburn was a prime example of what Chanes asserted was the "new antisemitism." Turning an article critical of Cockburn into a pseudo-defense is silly and misleading. Its wrong, and its POV.</p>
<p>Yet another example of POV insertions. I'm taking the time to go over most of these and list them because I intend to edit them out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2005, David Horowitz's neo-conservative publication FrontPageMag printed an article by editorialist Steven Plaut, titled "Counterpunch’s Self-Hating Jews." Ostensibly about <b>anti-Zionist communist</b> CounterPunch writer Gilad Atzmon, the article compared Cockburn with the widely-reviled author David Irving <b>in passing</b>: "It is always of interest to see Alexander Cockburn and David Irving, who has actually been convicted of Holocaust denial in a<b>[n Austrian]</b> court of law, sharing the same affections."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The insertion of "anti-Zionist communist" is an attempt to make it appear that this is some battle between critics of Cockburn and critics of Zionism. "Anti-Zionist" doesn't describe Gilad Atzmon in any better or relevent way for this article. The statement "in passing" is an attempt to distance Cockburn from the criticism, as if it were only an off-the-wall remark. The fact is, it wasn't "in passing." The insertion of "[n Austrian]" is an attempt to discredit David Irving's criminal history and conviction in court, as if an Austrian justice system was somehow notable and needed to be specified. If it were an American court of law or a British one, would we have to put that in to specify? Would we turn "A court of law" into "A[n American] court of law?" What is interesting about this is that the editor attempted to defend not only Cockburn's anti-Semitism, but David Irving's criminal history of Holocaust denial. But I digress, the issue at hand is that it is POV.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clay Waters, Director of the <b>conservative</b> online publication Times Watch, itself a project of the Media Research Center (<b>crusaders</b> against liberal media bias), made similar accusations in an article attacking New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I explained above the problem with labeling Times Watch a conservative group. However, the term "crusaders" and in fact the whole statement is POV. Again, it attempts to depict it as a conflict between right-wingers and Cockburn's left, attempting to make the reader believe that there is some inherent right-wing bias in the criticism. It would be as if I went back through the article and inserted "liberal" in front of organizations or groups that are liberal. Example:</p>
<p>Before</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since leaving the Voice he has also written columns for the Wall Street Journal, New York Press and the New Statesman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since leaving the <b>neo-liberal</b> magazine Voice he has also written columns for the <b>left-wing</b> magazines the Wall Street Journal, the New York Press and the New Statesman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you get my point now. I am going to remove these POV attempts to discredit critics based on pro-Israelism or conservativism. I'll also do everyone a favor by not going back and inserting things such as 'far-left' in front of far-left publications, like CounterPunch. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 12:07, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Henry Kissinger used to say of his years spent in academia that "the battles are so fierce because the stakes are so puny". So I'd have to say, ARoyal, that your energetic hairsplitting is indeed impressive. But for all your rhapsodizing about objectivity, it's plan to see in the edit history that you were the one who excised the <b>only</b> passage in the section in which Cockburn defends himself against charges of anti-Semitism in his own words. So if you are really adhering to WikiPedia's ethos of balance and neutrality, it would seem that you have a lot to explain in regards to why you suppressed the accused's response to these allegations. The quotation was verbatim and precisely referenced so I'll presume that your removing it had nothing to do with scholarship.</p>

<dd>Actually I did explain it above. A response to criticism doesn't belong in the criticism section. It belongs in its own section, the title "response to criticism" would be good. To insrt it along with the criticism is a tactic used to discredit the criticism, as it undermines it. Cockcburn's responses to his critics are fine, but they belong under their own heading and not under the criticism section.</dd>

<p>Now I just covered this, so I'm not sure why people are doing it again. Let's review:</p>
<p>Changing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alexander Cockburn has been accused of publishing anti-Semitic material by media analysts, academics, and other journalists. To the following: Alexander Cockburn has been accused of publishing anti-Semitic material by media analysts, academics, and other journalists. <b>In his essay My Life as an Anti-Semite, from his co-authored book The Politics of Anti-Semitism, he defined his own form of anti-Semitism as "to have written an item that pisses off someone at The New Republic."</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is a violation of wiki standards for POV. This is because it is an attempt to discredit criticism of anti-Semitism by inserting Cockburn's response in the criticism section. It's a form of negation, an attempt to rebuff criticism of Cockburn by asserting that he is the victim of New Republic junkies. It's the use of what wikipedia calls "weasel words." Cockburn's responses can go in the responses to criticism section, but not in the actual criticism section.</p>
<p>Likewise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2005, David Horowitz's publication FrontPageMag printed an article by editorialist Steven Plaut, titled "Counterpunch’s Self-Hating Jews." The article compared Cockburn with the widely-reviled author David Irving, <b>because they had a friend in common:</b> "It is always of interest to see Alexander Cockburn and David Irving, who has actually been convicted of Holocaust denial in a court of law, sharing the same affections."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the article doesn't say "because they had a friend in common." It gives criticism of Cockburn's anti-Semitism, not his friendship. Again, the use of weasel words, as well as what wikipedia calls "original research." You're giving your personal opinion on the criticism rather than external, verifiable claims about the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Clay Waters, Director of the online publication Times Watch, made similar accusations in an article[11] quoting at length from an article by Cockburn. Cockburn's article[12] discussed the furor over recently released tape recorded conversations between the Reverend Billy Graham and President Richard Nixon. He contrasted the response to their agreement that genocide would be an acceptable resolution to the Vietnam War, which gained little press coverage, with their subsequent anti-Semitic remarks, which caused a media firestorm. Comtemporary headlines lambasted Graham for claiming Jews had a "stranglehold" on the media which Nixon might someday end were he to win re-election.[13][14][15] Cockburn expressed his concern at what he felt to be misplaced media outrage, writing: "Don’t they [the press] know that this sort of stuff is consonant with the standard conversational bill of fare at 75 percent of the country clubs in America...&#160;?"</b> <b>Without any context,</b> Clay Waters partially quoted the end of the article:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire new introductory sentences, plus the use of weasel phrase "Without any context" renders the new edits POV. Again, it's an attempt to discredit criticism by inserting Cockburn's response. A form of negation. If you'd like to write Cockburn's defense, put it in the appropriate section.</p>
<p>I'll be reverting all of these POV edits.</p>
<p>On a final note, I was the one that wrote in full and introduced the "Allegations of anti-Semitism" section. At that point, it was at least twice as long. And although it strictly adhered to Wikipedia rules and standards, people complained that the length of it unbalanced the article. So I cut it in half so it was a suitable length. It went quite some time without major edits as we see now.</p>
<p>Now, if the Cockburn groupies don't want to cooperate (like I did) by simply maintaing the criticism section without inserting pro-liberal, pro-Cockburn POV edits then I see no reason why I shouldn't go back and insert the full, original version of Cockburn's anti-Semitic criticism. When the Cockburn moonbats are willing to police their own and make sure the criticism section is up to par, I'll be willing to compromise like I did before. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 04:03, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. How is Cockburn's self-accusation, if not confession, of his own anti-Semitism not relevant to to a section about accusations of his anti-semitism? If it was perhaps in the wrong section, you should have moved it, not deleted it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Plaut's entire article, which I read, seemed to be about a Jewish writer for Counterpunch, which Cockburn edits, and perhaps I could have been more precise. The way it is written after your revert, there is no indication that the object of affection is in fact this writer. I'll have to study what the article says again.</dd>

<dd>3 Regarding the Water's article quoting Cockburn, I was merely providing context. Nothing there has anything to do with Cockburn himself. That that quote was taken "without context" is a statement of fact anyone can see by reading the Water's article themselves.</dd>

<dd>Some further comments on Plaut's article. It has criticism of Cockburn all throughout, denoucning him as an anti-Semite. It doesn't compare with David Irving on the basis of them both being fan's of Gilad Atzmon's second-rate jazz music, but compares them by the fact that Irving and Cockburn both rely upon Atzmon's Holocaust denial in their work. The way it reads makes it sound like the only thing the two have in common is the fact that they listen to Atzmon jazz instead of the fact they both use Atzmon as a Holocaust-denying research source.</dd>

<dd>True, but I don't see how liking a Jazz album that the BBC called best of 2003 makes Cockburn an anti-Semite. It's really not my fault if Plaut has built himself a house of cards; that's the only connection I saw Plaut make between the two men in his article. Everything else is guilt by association.

Likewise, the insertion of the term "jazz musician" is violates Wiki policy for [weasel words]. This is because it doesn't add to the information, and attempts to make it seem as if jazz music is their common point. Yet, it says nothing about his jazz music in the article. Rather, it is referring to Atzmon's rabid anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. The article actually says this</dd>

</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Greenstein has publicly declared that Atzmon is an open anti-Semite, that Atzmon is associated with open anti-Semites, and a Holocaust Denier or, at the very least, an apologist for them. In any case, the open Holocaust Deniers themselves proudly proclaim Atzmon to be one of their own. David Irving just loves Atzmon. It is always of interest to see Alexander Cockburn and David Irving, who has actually been convicted of Holocaust denial in a court of law, sharing the same affections.</dd>

<dd>I would suggest going and reading the wiki policy on [weasel words]. Your attempt to stress Atzmon's jazz music as the common factor between Irving and Cockburn violates that policy, as well as failing to add relevent content. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 06:14, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did miss that Atzmon has written for the magazine. Plaut's case still seems to be rather tenuous. Of course anti-Semites love anti-Zionists. That doesn't make all anti-Zionists anti-Semites.

<dd>The following comes from <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>:</dd>
<dd>1. The article should document, in a non-partisan manner, what reliable third party sources have published about the subject and, in some circumstances, what the subject may have published about themselves. <i>The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an advocacy journalism point of view.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. Reliable sources: Not all widely read newspapers and magazines are equally reliable. There are some magazines and newspapers which print gossip much of which is false. While such information may be titillating that does not mean it has a place here. <i>Before repeating such gossip ask yourself consider if the information is true and if it is relevant to an encyclopaedic article on that subject</i>. When these magazines print information they suspect is untrue they often include weasel phrases. Look out for these. If the magazine doesn't think the story is true, then why should we?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material. Be careful not to give a disproportionate amount of space to critics, to avoid the effect of representing a minority view as if it were the majority one. If the criticism represents the views of a tiny minority, it has no place in the article.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticism_8870.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia:Criticism</a> says the following:</dd>
<dd>1. In general, making separate sections with the title "Criticism" is discouraged. The main argument for this is that they are often a troll magnet (see quotes in See also section below).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons to create a separate "Criticism" section include using a source which only criticizes the topic or only describes criticisms of it. Also, not having the time or knowledge to integrate criticism into the other sections of the article might be a reason to create a separate "Criticism" section. In that case, however, the separate "Criticism" section might be only a temporary solution until someone integrates the criticism (in the mean while the "separate" section might be tagged {POV-section} or similar).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. Criticism that is integrated into the article should not disrupt the article or section's flow. For example a section entitled "Early success" should not contain one paragraph describing the success of the topic and three paragraphs qualifying or denying that success. This is often why separate criticism sections are created.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>My take</b>: There is some relevant criticism, but it should probably be re-evaluated to ensure that it is not "advocacy journalism", "gossip", or "positive or negative claims that rely on association". Further, the criticism section seems to be functioning as a 'troll magnet', creating argument rather than progress on the article. The criticism section should be filtered, possibly tagged, and ideally worked in to the rest of the article. I will reiterate that a fair amount of the criticisms deserve representative acknowledgement in the article. We just need to work to ensure that the criticism doesn’t amount to advocacy journalism, that it is representative of opinion outside Wikipedia, and that it is spread relevantly throughout the article rather than isolated in one pole of controversy.</dd>

<dd>On that note, there is quite a bit we could edit in this Cockburn article that comes from "advocacy journalism." Cockburn's entire career has been writing for tabloids. I don't think spreading the criticism throughout the article is a good idea, however. I think that will cause more conflict than has already arisen with people attempting to water down the criticism. A section for criticism and a section for responses has always seemed to work well with controversial people. Perhaps some of the Cockburn groupies could put some time into the new responses section I made instead of trying to water down criticism as it stands. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 06:41, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think that there is advocacy journalism inside of the main article, then it would be good for everyone if you worked to correct it. Leaving the criticism section on its own might also work since everyone apparently agrees that this is a controversial person. Association with a Holocaust denier for the sake of association with a Holocaust denier, and some of the sources (Left Watch, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Jewish Indy) appear to have a bias. You can learn more about this at <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_source_43d0.html" title="WP:Reliable source">WP:Reliable_source</a>.

<p>Having just walked in on this, I just want to say that <a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a>'s conception of a criticism section strikes me as utterly bizarre. Why on earth would you have a criticism section that isn't allowed to address rebutals? An encyclopedia /explains/ events and controversies and criticisms, it doesn't simply present them in a list. This explanation is then supposed to present /all/ notable view points. This means that when you present a criticism, you present the other side. You don't present a whole list of them as if there is no response, and then put the responses down at the bottom where they may not even be found. In addition to being biased and misleading, this is profoundly unhelpful to the reader.</p>
<p>The criticism section here clearly needs an overhaul to include responses, and clearly needs to be converted into a NPOV style. The fact that you put "criticism" as a label doesn't mean it stops being an encyclopedia. It should then /also/ have a response section to the criticism, in which Cockburn gets to counterattack, including any notable responses to that. I would work on it, but I have other things to do at the moment. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 19:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_Cockburn_b5c5.html" title="Edit section: Original Research">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Original Research</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia has a policy against what it calls original research. This includes things that are not verifiable. An example of original research is this</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Also referring to the Billy Graham: War Criminal article</b>, Journalist Suzanne Fields wrote in "The Multiple Faces of anti-Semitism", a 2002 article, "Alexander Cockburn, an American left-wing columnist, who publishes a newsletter 'Counterpunch,' writes about the nasty stories against Jews 'sloshing around the news.' He doesn't endorse these stories, but he doesn't shoot them down either. He's clever, all the while giving them a legitimacy more commonly found in the Arab press. One unsubstantiated story includes the slur that 'the purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins.' Another such story says that Israeli spies trailing Mohammed Atta knew September 11 was going to happen 'but did nothing about it.'"[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article does not explicitly refer to the "Billy Graham: War Criminal" article. This was a conclusion drawn by a wiki editor, and violates wiki standards of original research. Unless you can cite a source that explicitly states that it is a reference to the article about Billy Graham, it must go.</p>
<p>Another example of original research by <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a> is as follows</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Plaut's own link,[9] Counterpunch had written a brief blurb praising the BBC naming[10] Atzmon's CD Exile "Best Jazz CD" of 2003.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This violates wikipedia policys on original research because it attempts to draw the conclusion that Cockburn's criticism for Atzmon was based on Counterpunch praising it. The Plaut article does not state that. It is something that can't be verified and is simply being implied by <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a>.</p>
<p>Further examples of weasel words and original research</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clay Waters, Director of the online publication Times Watch, made similar accusations in an article[12] quoting at length from an article by Cockburn. <b>Cockburn's article[13] discussed the furor over recently released tape recorded conversations between the Reverend Billy Graham and President Richard Nixon. He contrasted the response to their agreement that genocide would be an acceptable resolution to the Vietnam War, which gained little press coverage, with their subsequent anti-Semitic remarks, which caused a media firestorm. Comtemporary headlines lambasted Graham for claiming Jews had a "stranglehold" on the media which Nixon might someday end were he to win re-election.[14][15][16] Cockburn expressed his concern at what he felt to be misplaced media outrage, writing: "Don’t they [the press] know that this sort of stuff is consonant with the standard conversational bill of fare at 75 percent of the country clubs in America...&#160;?" Without mentioning Nixon or Graham, Clay Waters Waters accused Cockburn</b> of "spread[ing] anti-Semitic conspiracy theories" and partially quoted the end of Cockburn's article:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To begin, the statement "without mentioning Nixom or Graham" is the use of weasel words. It's an attempt to water down criticism by implying a bias against Cockburn. It may belong in the response to criticism section, but not here.</p>
<p>The larger bold part is an example of original research. The Times Watch article makes no explicit mention of the conclusions drawn here - rather, the conclusions are the personal research and opinion of <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a>. --<a href="../../../a/r/o/User%7EARoyal_7b5b.html" title="User:ARoyal">ARoyal</a> 06:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You gave citations to the article. They aren't citations that verify claims you make, however. You're drawing conclusions based on an amalgaim of articles, which is original research.

<p>I am finding Cockburn harder to pin down all the time. Considering the fact that he co-edits CounterPunch with Jeffery St. Clair (who writes extensively on the environment) I assumed Cockburn had similar opinions. But I have read pieces by Cockburn where he expresses scepticism about human contribution to global warming (saying it is a regular trend) and says he doesn't believe in peak oil (the idea that oil will run out). Is Cockburn just joking, (it's hard to tell what he really means sometimes) or is he serious? I just read a column by Cockburn saying that he enjoyed "Happy Feet" which is seen by many as being subversively pro-environment. I'm confused. Rlh 1984 06:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
