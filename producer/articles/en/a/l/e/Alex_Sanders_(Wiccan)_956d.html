Soon after his birth the family moved to Grape St, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> and unofficially changed their name to Sanders; Alex was unaware of his official surname until he applied for a passport later in life, and only changed his name by deed poll in the 1960s.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-KingOfTheWitches_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KingOfTheWitches" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Several contradictory accounts have been given of Sanders' initiation into witchcraft, and even his own accounts are inconsistent. The most famous version is that given in his biography, <i>King of the Witches</i>, by June Johns:</p>
<p>Alex had tuberculosis as a child and regularly visited his grandmother, Mary Bibby, in Wales for the fresh air.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to Sanders this was the beginning of his magical education:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"One evening in 1933, when I was seven, I was sent round to my grandmother's house for tea. For some reason I didn't knock at the door as I went in, and was confronted by my grandmother, naked, with her grey hair hanging down to her waist, standing in a circle drawn on the kitchen floor."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Regaining her composure, she told Alex to step into the circle, take off his clothes, and put his head between his thighs. As he did so, she took a sickle-knife and nicked his scrotum, saying, "You are one of us now." It was then that Alex realised she was a <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witch</a>.<sup id="_ref-ManMythMagic_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ManMythMagic" title="">[3]</a></sup> His Grandmother was a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_witch.html" title="Hereditary witch">hereditary witch</a>, a descendant of the Welsh chieftain <a href="../../../o/w/a/Owain_Glynd%C5%B5r_3d2d.html" title="Owain Glynd≈µr">Owain Glynd≈µr</a>, the last man (according to Sanders) to have called himself "King of the Witches";<sup id="_ref-ManMythMagic_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ManMythMagic" title="">[3]</a></sup> supposedly his grandmother let him copy her <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Shadows_0d4f.html" title="Book of Shadows">Book of Shadows</a> when he was nine and taught him the <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual.html" title="Ritual">rites</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">magic</a> of Witches. He was taught <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvoyance.html" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a> first by <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrying.html" title="Scrying">scrying</a> in inky water, then in his grandmother's crystal.<sup id="_ref-KingOfTheWitches_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KingOfTheWitches" title="">[2]</a></sup> Alex claimed that following <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a>, and a few months before her death at age 74, Mrs Bibby conferred upon him second- and third-grade initiations, involving <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Rite_09ca.html" title="Great Rite">ritual sex</a>.<sup id="_ref-KingOfTheWitches_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KingOfTheWitches" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardnerian_Wicca_d535.html" title="Gardnerian Wicca">Gardnerian</a> High Priestess <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricia_Crowther_%28Wiccan%29_76b1.html" title="Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)">Patricia Crowther</a> tells a different story. According to letters she claims she received from him in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, he did not then claim to be an initiate, but felt an affinity with the occult and had experienced <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_sight.html" title="Second sight">second sight</a>.<sup id="_ref-Triumph_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Triumph" title="">[4]</a></sup> In a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> interview Sanders claimed to have been initiated for a year, working in a coven led by a woman from Nottingham.<sup id="_ref-Triumph_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Triumph" title="">[4]</a></sup> This claim is corroborated by <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxine_Sanders_7364.html" title="Maxine Sanders">Maxine Sanders</a>, Alex's future wife and High Priestess.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup> (See <a href="#Wicca" title="">Wicca</a> below)</p>
<p>Maxine also maintains that although Alex was later initiated into Wicca, he was indeed taught a form of witchcraft by his grandmother when he was young. She describes Mrs Bibby as an austere lady, wise in folklore, who taught her grandson magic with his mother's knowledge and permission;<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup> all of Alex's brothers were also psychic, she says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It wasn't unusual to walk into the Sanders' kitchen in broad daylight to find a full materialisation s√©ance in progress. Mrs. Sanders would be carrying on with the chores regardless of the apparitions in attendance."<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA2" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>When Alex publicly revealed himself as a witch, however, Mrs. Sanders feigned shock and threatened a nervous breakdown.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Maxine, Alex also worked for a while as a healer in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritualist_Church_e6e4.html" title="Spiritualist Church">Spiritualist Churches</a> under the pseudonym Paul Dallas; a famous <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_%28spirituality%29.html" title="Medium (spirituality)">medium</a> called Edwards discovered him and his brothers and wanted them to do a stage show, however they refused, believing their clairvoyance, healing and mediumship to be divine gifts not to be misused.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Towards the end of the war he began working for a manufacturing chemists laboratory in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>. He married a co-worker, nineteen-year-old Doreen, when he was 21. They had two children, Paul and Janice.<sup id="_ref-KingOfTheWitches_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KingOfTheWitches" title="">[2]</a></sup> Alex wanted more children but Doreen didn't; she also disapproved of the supernatural.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA2_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA2" title="">[5]</a></sup> The marriage quickly deteriorated and Doreen took the children and left Sanders when he was 26. According to Maxine, Alex was grief-stricken and cursed Doreen with fertility; she re-married and had three sets of twins.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA2_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was also while working in a pharmaceutical company that he became friends with Maxine's mother, however they lost contact for a while, probably due to the "intense dislike" that Maxine's <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheist</a> father had for him.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA2_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>After the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> and his separation from Doreen and the children, Sanders felt isolated by his occult knowledge, and decided to live a life of the "<a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_hand_path.html" title="Left hand path">left hand path</a>" after having drifted from one low-level job to another and had sexual affairs with both men and women.</p>

It worked all right ‚Äî I was walking through Manchester and I was accosted by a middle-aged couple who told me that I was the exact double of their only son, who had died some years previously. They took me into their home, fed and clothed me, and treated me as one of the family. They were extremely wealthy, and in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>, when I asked them for a house of my own, with an allowance to run it on, they were quite happy to grant my wishes. I held parties, I bought expensive clothes, I was sexually promiscuous; but it was only after a time that I realised I had a fearful debt to pay."<sup id="_ref-ManMythMagic_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ManMythMagic" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>One of Alex's mistresses who he was particularly fond of committed suicide; his sister Joan was injured in an accidental shooting and shortly after diagnosed with terminal cancer.<sup id="_ref-KingOfTheWitches_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KingOfTheWitches" title="">[2]</a></sup> Alex, blaming himself, resolved to stop using his magic for selfish reasons and instead teach it to others.<sup id="_ref-ManMythMagic_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ManMythMagic" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this period he also studied the works of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_the_Mage_dad7.html" title="Abramelin the Mage">Abramelin</a>.

According to his own admission he dismantled this book and borrowed it a few pages at a time for copying; discovery of this nearly led to Sanders' prosecution but the librarians allowed him an amnesty on condition that the materials were safely returned, after which he was dismissed without charges being brought against him.<sup id="_ref-KingOfTheWitches_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KingOfTheWitches" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Sanders' first contact with <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicca.html" title="Wicca">Wicca</a> was in the early 1960s, through correspondence and meetings with <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricia_Crowther_%28Wiccan%29_76b1.html" title="Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)">Patricia Crowther</a>. In September 1962, he succeeded in convincing the <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Evening_News_8fdc.html" title="Manchester Evening News">Manchester Evening News</a></i> to run a front-page article on Wicca.<sup id="_ref-Triumph_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Triumph" title="">[4]</a></sup> This publicity had several unfortunate side-effects for Sanders, including the loss of his job at the library and estrangement from the Crowthers, who considered him a troublesome upstart and refused to initiate him.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was eventually initiated by a priestess who had been a member of the Crowthers' coven, and with whom Maxine Sanders later worked for several years.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was rumoured that Alex copied the Wiccan <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Shadows_0d4f.html" title="Book of Shadows">Book of Shadows</a> in a <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardnerian_Wicca_d535.html" title="Gardnerian Wicca">Gardnerian's</a> garage while a party was going on in the house, however according to Maxine he copied his book from his initiator's book in the normal manner.<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Soon afterwards, he joined a <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardnerian_Wicca_d535.html" title="Gardnerian Wicca">Gardnerian</a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coven.html" title="Coven">coven</a> led by Pat Kopanski, which dissolved just over a year later.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Sanders worked with several <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coven.html" title="Coven">covens</a>, including one led by a priestess called Sylvia. Eventually she and several others left the group amicably, leaving Alex to continue as High Priest. During this period the coven worked at Alex's home at 24 Egerton Road North, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.<sup id="_ref-Disciples_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Disciples" title="">[7]</a></sup> Sanders continued to attract media attention which brought him more followers. By 1965 he claimed 1,623 initiates in 100 covens, who apparently elected him to the title of <i>King of the Witches</i>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Among his alleged magical feats is the creation of a "spiritual baby," who became one of his <a href="../../../f/a/m/Familiars.html" title="Familiars">familiars</a>. The birth is to have resulted from a sacred act of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> which occurred between Sanders and a male assistant.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Shortly following its creation the spirit Michael disappeared to grow up, but reappeared later to take Sanders over in his <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channelling_%28mediumistic%29.html" title="Channelling (mediumistic)">channeling</a>. Supposedly Michael forcibly made Sanders carry on at wild parties, insult people and otherwise act abominably.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> But as Michael matured he became a valuable spirit familiar in channeling and healing matters.</p>

<p>One of Sanders‚Äô most famous alleged cures involved his daughter Janice, who was born in dry labor with her left foot twisted backwards. Physicians had said nothing could be done for the foot until the girl reached her teens. It was an "impression" from Michael which instructed Sanders to anoint the foot with warm olive oil. Having done this, Sanders turned his daughter‚Äôs foot straight. The foot stayed corrected. Janice walked normally except for a slight limp in cold, damp weather.<sup id="_ref-Guiley_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Guiley" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the 1960s Sanders met <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxine_Sanders_7364.html" title="Maxine Sanders">Maxine Sanders</a>, then Maxine Morris, a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> and 20 years his junior, whom he initiated into the <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">Craft</a> and made his <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priestess.html" title="High priestess">high priestess</a>.

Many followers came to them. In the same year their daughter Maya was born.</p>
<p>The projection of Sanders into the national public spotlight resulted from a sensational newspaper article in 1969 which led to a romanticized biography , <i>King of the Witches</i>, by June Johns in 1969, and the film, <i>Legend of the Witches</i>. All of which led to much media publicity, guest appearances on talk-shows, and public speaking engagements. It seemed to other Witches that Sanders enjoyed all of this too much to where it was exploitation, and he dragged the Craft through the gutter press.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to Maxine, Alex never courted publicity, but was simply unable to avoid it. She describes how Alex's initial rise to fame came through an attempt to distract media attention away from other witches. The couple running a coven that Alex belonged to were practicing <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christians</a>, and the local press had become curious about their activities. Had they been exposed it would have been disastrous for them. Alex offered the Press an alternative story, proposing to hold a ritual at a magical site at <a href="../../../a/l/d/Alderley_Edge_38a6.html" title="Alderley Edge">Alderley Edge</a>, where he would raise a man from the dead. A bandaged up figure lying on a stone altar was examined by one of Alex's colleagues posing as a G.P., who certified it was indeed a corpse.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Alex promised the reporter and photographer that he would bring the corpse back to life. It would respond to an ancient and strange invocation, which was in reality a Swiss roll recipe read backwards. After much mumbo jumbo Alex dramatically intoned the invocation slowly and with great deliberation, the corpse couldn't help but respond to such power. It sounds ridiculous today that anyone could fall for it, but the pressmen ran away with their story, which made the headlines. These were the days of innocence, but the Christians were safe and Alex was on his way to a life of self-imposed notoriety."<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA1_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA1" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Sanders frequently appeared in ritual photos as robed wearing only a <a href="../../../l/o/i/Loincloth.html" title="Loincloth">loincloth</a> while Witches surrounding him were naked. His explanation for this was that "Witch law" required that the elder of a coven to be apart from the others and easily identifiable.</p>
<p>It was at the preview of <i>Legend of the Witches</i> that Sanders met <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Farrar_e5eb.html" title="Stewart Farrar">Stewart Farrar</a>. Farrar was impressed with Sanders. He, a feature writer for the weekly <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reveille_newspaper.html" title="Reveille newspaper">Reveille</a> was working on a story concerning modern Witchcraft and attended an initiation which Sanders invited him to. The ceremony impressed and interested Farrar who later was initiated by Maxine Sanders into the coven where he met <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Farrar_99a6.html" title="Janet Farrar">Janet Owen</a>, whom he would later marry.</p>

<p>It seems that Sanders‚Äô flamboyance irritated many people and seemed to be a cause for him to receive much criticism. Whether this was justly earned or not is hard to say. There are even questions about whether Sanders was even initiated by his grandmother or copied her book of shadows at the age of nine. To the objective and scholarly observer such questions seem frivolous. What is known is that the Alexandrian tradition does exist in modern Witchcraft. There were enough believers of what Sanders taught to make this possible.</p>
<p>No objective researcher can say any or all of the criticism aimed at Sanders is true or not. All one can do is to make note of it without trying to appear bias. Some claim Sanders <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarized.html" title="Plagiarized">plagiarized</a> some of his material, although, it must be noted, this criticism came after Sanders‚Äô publicity was at its highest. It is said he took material from the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardnerian.html" title="Gardnerian">Gardnerian</a> book of shadows, from material written by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliphas_Levi_d613.html" title="Eliphas Levi">Eliphas Levi</a>, and from the Austrian occultist <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Bardon_b2c6.html" title="Franz Bardon">Franz Bardon</a>. Since the Alexandrian tradition closely follows the Gardnerian tradition some claim this is proof of plagiary. Some say he made few changes in some material, others say he made no changes at all. Others claim the name "Alexander Sanders" was not his own, but one he assumed.</p>

A son Victor was born in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. Alex and Maxine's strong relationship continued, "although it varied in intensity, from a fierce sense of loyalty, blasting curses, to declarations of love until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>".<sup id="_ref-MaxineCOA3_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MaxineCOA3" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> Alex announced to the witchcraft community that he wished "to make amends for some of the past hurts that I have given and many public stupidities I created for others of the Craft", and expressed his desire that the Wicca should some day put aside their differences and "unite in brotherly love before the face of the Lady and the Lord", allowing them to become great again and respected in the outside world.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1979 Sanders began working in magical partnership with Derek Taylor, a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a> and trance medium. Together they developed the magical work of Sanders' Order, the <i>Ordine Della Luna in Constantinople</i> which he was chartered to operate as Grand Prior for England and Wales by a Greek contact in London in 1967 who claimed to be a descendant of the Byzantine Palaeologos dynasty.<sup id="_ref-AquarianGuide_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AquarianGuide" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[14]</a></sup> The pair were reportedly working with celestial intelligences, disembodied spirits and the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demiurge.html" title="Demiurge">demiurge</a> itself.

Even at his death Sanders seemed to arouse controversy. A tape recording was played at his funeral in which Sanders declared Victor was to succeed him as King of the Witches. According to his mother, Maxine, Victor did not want to do so, and had moved to the United States. He would have led the "Witchcraft Council of Elders," which claimed an incredible 100,000 members.
