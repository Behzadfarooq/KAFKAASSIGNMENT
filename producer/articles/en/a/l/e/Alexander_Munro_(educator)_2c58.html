<p><b>Alexander Monro</b> was the Principal of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_University_af14.html" title="Edinburgh University">Edinburgh University</a> from 1685 to 1690.</p>
<p><b>Parentage:</b> fourth son of Hugh Munro, 4th of Fyrish by his wife Isobel, dau of Robert Munro, 6th of Coul, 5th of Balconie. Alexander was the first of his branch of the family to spell his name Monro as opposed to Munro.</p>
<p><b>Early History and Education:</b> Born 1648. He studied for the Church at St Salvator's College at the University of St Andrews, graduating MA in 1664. He then accopmanied, while only aged 17, his cousin Lieutenant Colonel Aexander Munro, who was Colonel of Horse in Lord Dumbarton's Regiment (and also a Captain in the Royal Scots 1st Foot Regiment) to France. Alexander Monro saw active service there for two and a half years, before returning to Scotland to complete his education. He resumed studies at St Mary's College (now New College), St Andrews, and graduated MA from there in 1669. In February, 1682 he was made a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) by St Andrews University.</p>
<p><b>In Holy Orders:</b> Ordained 1673. 7 April, 1673 he was admitted to the second charge of the parish of Dunfermline. 26 Mar 1676, translated to Kinglassie, co. Fife. 26 Apr, 1678, translated to the parish of Wemyss, resigning before March, 1683 having been nominated as Professor of Divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews by the then Chancellor Archbishop <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Sharp_07fe.html" title="James Sharp">James Sharp</a> of St Andrews. From 1682 to 1685 he was Principle of St Andrews University.<br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Principal of Edinburgh University:</b> On 9th Dec, 1685 Alexander Munro was appointed Principal of the University of Edinburgh, being simultaneously appointed by the Town Council of Edinburgh to the Second or Collegiate Charge of the High Church of Edinburgh (now St Giles Church), and inducted on 30th Dec, 1685. As Principle of Edinburgh University he received an emolument of 2000 merks and as incumbent of the High Church he received 1600 merks.</p>
<p>In 1688 <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James II of England</a> (VII of Scotland) attempted to have him appointed as Bishop of Argyle, but this fell through due to that monarchs downfall.</p>
<p>Dr Monro was tried by the Privy Council for refusing to pray for William and Mary in obedience to the Act of Estates passed on 13 Apr, 1689. Although not ejected by the Privy Council he nevertheless resiged as Principle of Edinburgh University and from his charge in the north-eastern division of St Giles Cathedral on 24th April, 1689. He thus resiged before Episcopacy was abolished by the Scottish Parliament on the 22nd July, 1689.</p>
<p>On 20 September 1690 he was formally deprived of his Principalship by the Committee of Visitors (which had been appointed by Act of Parliament in July 1690 with wide ranging powers while visiting Universities, Colleges and Schools). The reason given was his disapproval of the Revolution Settlement (see <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>), having refused to take the oaths of allegiance to William and Mary and due to his known support for the Stuart cause. In addition he was accused of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socinianism.html" title="Socinianism">Socinianism</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arminianism.html" title="Arminianism">Arminianism</a>.</p>
<p><b>Later Years:</b> after his resignations in 1690 he acted as a minister for an Episcopalian congregation in Edinburgh for about two years. Subsequently he moved to London in 1691, lving in or near Swallow Street. He died in 1698, aged 50.</p>
<p>Dr Monro wrote a work in defence of his faith called<i>An Enquiry into the New Opinions (chiefly) Propagated by the Presbyterians of Scotland; Together with some Animadversoins on a Late Book entitled 'A defense of the Vindications fo the Kirk'; in a Letter to a Friend at Edinburgh</i>. This prompted his successor as Principle of Edinburgh University, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Rule_2e5c.html" title="Gilbert Rule">Gilbert Rule</a>, to respond with a book called "<i>The Good Old Way Defended</i>".<br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Wives and children:</b> Dr Monro married firstly to Anna Logan on 6th May, 1673; she came from Aberdour in the parish of Dumfermline and she died on 16 May, 1674. Issue of this marriage was:<br />
1. Anna Monro; born 19 March, 1674, Dumferline; there is no further information on her.</p>
<p>Dr Monro married secondly Marion Collace on 11 Apr, 1676 at Inverkeithing. She was the daughter, it is believed, of Rev Andrew Collace, MA, who served as minister of Garvoch (1615), of St Cyres (1617) and of Dundee (1635-39). She survived her husband by 17 years, remaining in London, and petitioned in 1615 and 1616 for help in her "extreme poverty".<br />
2 Elizabeth Monro; born 26 June, 1677; marreid her cousin Capt. George Papley.<br />
3. David Monro; born 1679, Wemyss; died young.<br />

5. Margaret Monro; twin of James.<br />
6. Catherine Monro; born 1682.<br />
7. Christian Monro; born 1683<br />
8. Helen Monro; born 1685 (twin)<br />
