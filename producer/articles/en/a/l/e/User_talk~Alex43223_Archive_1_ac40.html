It rather surprises me that 20th Century Fox would give up all their rights on something like this.

<p>I am sorry about the last page I created, Cinemanow. I got this information from another source, not Cinemanow.com. They claimed the text was not copyrighted, however after it was deleted I realized that, after checking [cinemanow.com], this was copyrighted. I am sorry for any inconvienience, and will further look into any new articles before creating them. The source i got it from has since taken the content off the internet, after I had reported them to authorities of the internet. Thanks again, I wouldn't have realized the copyright or reported them if you hadn't done this. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex43223_726f.html" title="User:Alex43223">Alex43223</a> 02:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ArbCom election</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Vote_Dbiv_0294.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Vote/Dbiv">vote</a> in the ArbCom elections. I know that I do not spend every waking moment editing Wikipedia, and am involved in my local community outside it, but I am sure that if I wanted to spend more time away from editing and writing articles then I would just do so. I decided to stand for ArbCom very much in the hope of serving on it, because I believe I can bring wisdom to its decisions. I did do so in the knowledge that every minute spent on ArbCom is a minute that I am not spending on article writing, so there was some small regret there, but I think I would regard ArbCom service as being time usefully spent in helping the Wikipedia community. I am very sorry if I have given you an incorrect impression. However it seems to me that your explanation might be politely covering a substantial opposition to my approach, and if this is so then I absolutely accept your entitlement to your views. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 12:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../d/r/e/Image%7EDream_street_blue_house.jpg_2840.html" title="Image:Dream street blue house.jpg">Image:Dream street blue house.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alex43223_Archive_1_e86f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alex43223/Archive 1">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feel intimida</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I am reaching out to you with an odd situation even for Wikipedia. I attempted to edit the article on John Littlechild 1who led the first Special Irish Branch for the UK police and who also investigated the Jack the Ripper and Oscar Wilde cases. I saw that the article only touched on the career points of the subject. I noted that the formation of the Special Branch was opressive to the Irish and that Littlechild has a homophobe for his prosecution of Wilde.</p>
<p>These edits were promptly removed several times by editor Ben W. Bell 2 - a pro British Irishman. The editor Necrothesp 3 -- who authored the article -- also removed various entries. I even reduced the entry to say that the formation of the Special Branch was oppressive to the Irish and nothing more. This too was removed under the excuse that I was offering a POV and not a neutral objective fact.</p>
<p>I was going to get administrators to act as third parties but became intimidated by one simple fact -- on Necrothesp's user page its states that he is a British cop and a member of the U.K. Territorial army. I could go on forever talking about why the British police should not be allowed to edit articles on Northern Ireland but that would be useless. I travel in the UK a great deal and the police have special powers to trace users of any BBS system.</p>
<p>Necrothesp and Ben W. Bell also kept posting on my talk page after I said I felt intimidated. I asked them nicely to leave unitl after the editing conflict wass resolved but they still kept posting. I feel very intimidated. I would like to revise the article with more solid sources but fear being ganged up on again by Necorthesp the cop and his friend Ben W. Bell. In the last entry he made on my talk page Necorthest suggested I leave Wikipedia altogether which is very intimidating coming from someone who is a policeman 4.</p>
<p>I would still like to edit the article but would like you or some other advocate to watch what is being said and done. Please help!</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
