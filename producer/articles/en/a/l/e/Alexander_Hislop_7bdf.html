<p>This book was initially published in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a> as a <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamphlet.html" title="Pamphlet">pamphlet</a>, then greatly revised and expanded and released as a book in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>.</p>
<p>He claimed the Roman Catholic Church was a Babylonian <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_religion.html" title="Mystery religion">mystery cult</a>, and pagan, whereas Protestants worshipped the true <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and the true <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>. He contended that Roman Catholic religious practices are actually pagan practices grafted onto true <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> during the reign of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_%28emperor%29_5860.html" title="Constantine I (emperor)">Constantine</a>. At this point, he alleged, the merger between the Roman state religion and its adoration of the mother and child was transferred to Christianity, merging Christian characters with pagan mythology. The Goddess was renamed <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus_3bac.html" title="Mary, the mother of Jesus">Mary</a></i>, and Jesus was the renamed <i><a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter-Puer_ea8d.html" title="Jupiter-Puer">Jupiter-Puer</a></i>, or "Jupiter the Boy".</p>
<p>Hislop's theory was that the goddess, in Rome called <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_%28mythology%29.html" title="Venus (mythology)">Venus</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortuna_%28mythology%29.html" title="Fortuna (mythology)">Fortuna</a>, was the Roman name of the more ancient Babylonian cult of <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishtar.html" title="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, whose origins began with a blonde-haired and blue-eyed woman named <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiramis.html" title="Semiramis">Semiramis</a>.</p>
<p>According to Hislop, Semiramis was an exceedingly beautiful woman, who gave birth to a son named <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammuz.html" title="Tammuz">Tammuz</a>, was instrumental as the queen, and wife of <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimrod.html" title="Nimrod">Nimrod</a> the founder of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>, and its religion, complete with a pseudo-<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Birth_e8f9.html" title="Virgin Birth">Virgin Birth</a>. This he called a foreshadowing of the birth of Christ, prompted by Satan. Later, Nimrod was killed, and Semiramis, pregnant with his child, claimed the child was Nimrod reborn.</p>
<p>Hislop claimed that the cult and worship of Semiramis spread globally, her name changing with the culture. In Egypt she was <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a>, in Greece and Rome she was called Venus, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_%28goddess%29.html" title="Diana (goddess)">Diana</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athena.html" title="Athena">Athena</a>, and a host of other names, but was always prayed to and central to the faith which was based on Babylonian mystery religion.</p>
<p>Then, according to Hislop, Constantine, though claiming to convert to Christianity, remained pagan but renamed the gods and goddesses with Christian names to merge the two faiths for his political advantage, under Satan's guidance.</p>
<p>The book has been severely criticized by many of being insidiously hateful, and in much of it supporting evidence being found in ante -nicene testimonies, as well as Josephus, and other ancient varifications as some existing evidence: for instance, the Roman state religion before Christianity did worship a central Mother Goddess, Venus and Cupid. Yet many women named Semiramis lived centuries after Nimrod, and not all could be the famed original, and some legend seems to mix them. Hislop also makes some questionable linguistic connections and fanciful word plays, e.g. the letters IHS on <a href="../../../h/o/s/Host_%28Holy_Communion%29_eef8.html" title="Host (Holy Communion)">hosts</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Communion_f177.html" title="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a> are alleged to stand for Egyptian deities <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horus.html" title="Horus">Horus</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_%28mythology%29.html" title="Set (mythology)">Seth</a>, but in reality they are an <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbreviation.html" title="Abbreviation">abbreviation</a> for Ihsous, the Latin spelling of Jesus's name in Greek (Ιησους), although popularly, they stand for the Latin <i>Iesus Hominum Salvator</i> meaning <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, Savior of Mankind.</p>
<p>Despite this, and the fact that his book, if proven true, would discredit Christian traditions as a whole, since the concepts that it attacks in Roman Catholicism are shared by some Protestants, this book was, and still remains in some circles, a staple of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">anti-Catholic</a> polemic. Hislop is a favorite source of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Chick_19ea.html" title="Jack Chick">Jack Chick</a>, who published reprints of his book, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Hunt_4ed6.html" title="Dave Hunt">Dave Hunt</a>, who on occasion alludes to his work. While strong criticisms of this book have been published, it is still considered by many as a definitive work of Protestant Christian <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologetics</a>.</p>
