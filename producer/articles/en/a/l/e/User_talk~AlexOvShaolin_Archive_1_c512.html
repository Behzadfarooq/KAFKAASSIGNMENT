<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:ThighpaulsandraLiveShot.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

<p>Pretty fly job on creating a The Threshold Houseboy's Choir article. I was hoping someone would make one. Though I'm still unsure if it's "Threshold Houseboy's Choir" or "Threshold House Boy's Choir". Either way, cool beans on the article. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinewaves23_691f.html" title="User:Sinewaves23">Sinewaves23</a> 02:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>finally got around to signing up for wiki, and i'm sure peter will appreciate it. actually now that you mention it, it might be two seperate words, i don't have either of the releases yet (just mp3s, but i'll fix it by tomorrow when i check some PC interviews.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just have mp3's as well. I'm curious as to how you got info about Peter's performance in the mentioned art's festival. I'm also wondering if you have more info about the particular appearance.--<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinewaves23_691f.html" title="User:Sinewaves23">Sinewaves23</a> 10:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>i can't tell you how i got the info on the second performance, that would be breaking a promise, however his name does appear on the website, so that question is as good as answered. i do know that the performance was short and followed by a lecture, so i would officially consider it a 'Peter Christopherson' performance. keep this information hush hush, i plan to add to the wiki when the time is appropriate. i have a video performance of 3 of the four songs performed at the russia concert. you should send me an email: alexpallas@gmail.com, please include a list of all user names you have used around the web, i might recognize you.</p>

<p>Also, when saying that it's not to be confused with other works by the same name, I feel like there should be links to the other works with the same name right there.</p>
<p>I'd try to sort it out myself, but I'm not sure what works I'm looking at, and don't want to get it wrong.

A tag has been placed on Ninjas And Dragons, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable</a>, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.</p>
<p>For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">for biographies</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">for web sites</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">for bands</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">for companies</a>.

Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated.
