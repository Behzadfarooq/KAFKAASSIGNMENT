<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed Pop Culture References to New Article</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, I just thought I would <b>be bold</b> and fix what I saw as people adding any minor, random reference to Crowley to the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crowley.html" title="Crowley">Crowley</a> page -- in a few cases in the music section, I suspect the musicians themselves may have done this. Since there was no organization, no vetting, no weighting by relative importance, I felt the excessive length of the section that became the Crowley in Popular Culture article was choking the usefulness of the main Crowley article.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Dogandpony_d7e5.html" title="User:The Dogandpony">The Dogandpony</a> 17:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Removed the following line: <i>Crowley died without leaving a clear line of succession for Thelema and the OTO. See <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Grant_b64e.html" title="Kenneth Grant">Kenneth Grant</a></i></p>
<ol>
<li>There is no "line of succession" for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thelema.html" title="Thelema">Thelema</a>, which is a religion/philosophy.</li>
<li>Crowley left a very clear line of succession for OTO: <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Germer_a565.html" title="Karl Germer">Karl Germer</a>. On March 14, 1942, Crowley wrote to Germer: "I shall appoint you my successor as O.H.O." Seems pretty clear to me. Crowley also gave <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grady_McMurtry_bbe8.html" title="Grady McMurtry">Grady McMurtry</a> letters that make it clear that he was next in line if something should happen to Germer (who did not appoint an "heir"). So, the line was clear: Germer, with a backup plan in case of an emergency.</li>

<p>Until the end, every part of that sentence looks wrong. For example, nothing about Crowley seems obvious. Except for the fact that he had extra-marital sex. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_f2f7.html" title="User:Dan">Dan</a> 07:15, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interesting stuff here</span></h2>
<p>Interesting stuff here. A typical Wikipedia editing question: it seems to me that the one sentence regarding Crowley's death (listed under "Miscellany" in the article) should be part of the "Biography" section instead. His condition at the time of death seems like an interesting and important part of his life story. However the transition from the current last paragraph in that article to this one sentence on the end of his life seems like it would be rather abrupt. Any suggestions on joining these?</p>
<p>Question for any experts watching: this article (currently) contains the Crowley quote "Apparently Parsons and Hubbard or somebody is producing a moonchild. I get fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts." Just before this quote the article relates it to Crowley's previously mentioned book of fiction, "Moonchild," but fails to actually define the term "moonchild." Does it perhaps have something to do with <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babalon_Working_d9f1.html" title="Babalon Working">Babalon Working</a>? --<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJarsyl_ec47.html" title="User:Jarsyl">Jarsyl</a> 07:12, 2004 Sep 16 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Okay, writing NPOV about Crowley is extraordinarily hard</span></h2>
<p>Okay, writing NPOV about Crowley is extraordinarily hard. I have read and been interested in Crowley's ideas on and off for some years, though I am not a Thelemite or occult practitioner (or any other sort of religionist for that matter). I have left out of this extensive rewrite a lot of information about his life because I'm not sure I know how to write it neutrally. On the one hand he seems to have been a very interesting person with a very interesting story to tell; on the other hand he seems to have frequently been a scoundrel -- if not a borderline sociopath who for all his ethical philosophy did not know how to treat others very well.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the three Non-Neutral Points of View that writing on Crowley risks falling into are as follows. I'm not going to be very sympathetic to any of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tabloid-Christian view, as espoused by the press during Crowley's career in Britain and by certain fundamentalists since then: "Crowley was a Satanist who sacrificed babies and did perverted things with goats!"</li>
<li>The Gushing-OTO-Cultist view, as espoused by some Thelemites today: "Crowley was a Saint and a Prophet of the New Aeon! See, it says here in Liber Q vel Schnipp-Schnapp that ...."</li>
<li>The Beyond-Skeptic-to-Cynic view, as espoused by far too many of my fellow atheists: "Crowley was nothing but a crazy con-man who wasted all his money publishing crazy poetry and seducing crazy women."</li>
</ul>

<p>Fubar, I like most of what you've done on this page, but I see a problem with the line, "Yet like Leary's, Crowley's method had many evident failings". I suggest citing someone's critique of his method instead, or describing what you call its evident failings without comment. (The evident doesn't need comment, after all.) As you say, writing NPOV about Crowley presents difficulties. I think one of these modifications would improve the situation. Oh, and kudos on Liber Schnipp-Schnapp. ^_^</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looks better. However, I think it may contradict the facts, at least in regard to Leary. I feel confident I could give some objective evidence for <i>some</i> of his hypotheses (notice the stress on the word 'some'.) We can say, for example, that his experiments produced zero suicides, zero psychoses, zero bad trips. We can say that researchers found a certain percentage of former prison volunteers still out of jail x years after an experiment in rehabilitation, and compare these numbers with national statistics. In other words, I think we could and would have tested some of Dr. Leary's psychological theories in an objective fashion, if not for Prohibition. --Dan</dd>

<p>Removed from the page:</p>
<p><i>(This idea of foreshadowing Dr. Tim seems to have come from an interview Dr. Tim did with Robert Anton Wilson <a href="http://www.rawilson.com" class="external free" title="http://www.rawilson.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawilson.com</a> in which he was asked if he felt he was continuing the work of Mr. Crowley.)</i></p>
<p>Actually, none other than <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Regardie_7320.html" title="Israel Regardie">Israel Regardie</a> commented on Leary, Aldous Huxley, and others in the mid-20th-c. seeming to continue Crowley's work -- in the introduction to Crowley's <i>The Law is For All</i>, the annotated <i>Liber Legis</i>. That was written in 1970. When was the Wilson interview?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Writing NPOV about Crowley is hard.</span></h2>
<p>Writing NPOV about Crowley is hard.</p>
<p>That has got to be an understatement. I'd suggest sticking to the documented, undisputed facts of his life. I think you included everything that is undisputed by all sides.</p>
<p>Maybe adding a section: <i>Crowely: Legends</i> and putting in some/all of the stories that are told of him.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Whats the story with the V-Sign?</span></h2>
<p>So..it is also just a "story" that he "invented" the V-sign? ..and it is also just a "story" that he was the archetype of the witch doctor in "Rosemary´s baby"? ..and it is also a "story" (just half-told) that he was claimed by Charles Manson as a teacher, predecessor etc.? ..and then we have the cycle: Charles Manson kills Sharon Tate and John Lennon was killed by another Crowley believer..in front of the same building where the movie was shot. Perhaps laughing is even possible in a coffin. So: watch your words! Eulenspiegel.</p>

<p>Alister Crowley is well know as a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanist.html" title="Satanist">satanist</a>, sorcerer, and black magician and for saying "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.", which was originally coined by Sir <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Dashwood_3c3e.html" title="Francis Dashwood">Francis Dashwood</a> of the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellfire_Club_7c55.html" title="Hellfire Club">Hellfire Club</a>. There are many incidences of the Hellfire Club, which are all surrounded with rumours of sexual orgies and satanism. He was the founder of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordo_Templi_Orientis_01b0.html" title="Ordo Templi Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> (OTO), which is recognised as some the unoffical ranks above <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>. Crowley was one of the most prominent members of the secret society netowrk, also a member of the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_7912.html" title="Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> and 33rd degre Freemason.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's difficult to say what isn't inaccurate here. Crowley was not a Satanist. The phrase "Do what thou wilt thall be the whole of the Law" is from Rabelais. Crowley did not found OTO; indeed, one of <i>today's</i> OTO sects (Hermetic OTO) does not accept Crowley's "reforms" of that organization. Crowley was apparently involved with Masonry for a while, but not in a particularly regular fashion. <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/Writings/AleisterCrowley.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/Writings/AleisterCrowley.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> OTO is not an appendant branch of Masonry; if it were (as, say the Shriners are) that would mean that one must be a Mason to join OTO, which is not the case. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:45, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">There should be <i>some</i> criticism of Crowley</span></h2>
<p><i>Criticism:</i> There should be <i>some</i> criticism of Crowley on any text on him. I personally think some of his writings are important, but there are issues in such a controversial figure that have to be criticised:</p>
<p><i>Crowley and Satanism:</i> He wrote a letter (or wanted to write - I saw both versions) to Trotzky asking him to eliminate Christianity. (Source John Symonds: The Great Beast)</p>
<p><i>Crowley and Sexism:</i> Crowley was (often) a sexist and wrote for example that women were soulless beings. (New Comment on Liber 220: Note that a woman, having no soul of her own, can be used always as a 'Form' for any Being. This explains why Nuit can incarnate at will in successive women, careless of the physical limits of life. {WEH NOTE: Crowley's opinion regarding the soul-less state of women refers to a matter of expression. He believed it more generally, but probably based it on Victorian male conceptions of "unliberated women". The Comment to this and the previous verse may say more about the defensive insecurity of Crowley the man than the verses of Liber AL. In Chapter I Comment, remember that all this is a male mind trying to contemplate the revelations of a goddess. Square peg and round hole problems may arise.})</p>
<p>He did beat some of his women.(Source John Symonds: The Great Beast) There are many sexist and antifeminist statements in his writings, and I don't have the time to search them all. To be fair, he did write some sentences that could be labelled as pro-feminist. But on the whole, I have the impression that he was rather antifeminist.</p>
<p><i>Crowley and Totalitarianism:</i> Crowley favored a monarchist and aristocratic society. He was against democracy. Or at least his writings can be interpreted in this way. (Confessions of A.C. "There is no need for the fraud of divine right or the cant of democracy.")</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even a superficial examination of the quoted text from <i>Confessions</i> shows that it does not support claims about Crowley as a totalitarian, or even as a "monarchist." To the contrary, Crowley explicitly condemns "divine right" in that passage. That is, the supposed divine right by which kings rule. The quoted text is explicitly opposing monarchy. Crowley's condemnation of democracy in the same breath is of a piece with his opposition to monarchy: Crowley upheld the will of the individual as supreme, and disliked the "tyranny of the majority" inherent in democracy. If one were to label Crowley with any single political POV it would probably have to be anarchism, though that greatly oversimplifies his views. For a citation on Crowley's moral and social philosophy, see <i>Liber OZ</i>. <b>Editing Note:</b> I also added quotation marks around the cited passage in the original comment.Psuliin 17:24, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Crowley and Racism:</i> He wrote for example: "..,we always somehow instinctively think of the Italian as a nigger. We don't call them "dagos" and "wops" as they do in the United States, with the invariable epithet of "dirty"; but we have the same feeling." (Source: Diary of a Drug Fiend, BookI-Chapter 9)</p>

<dl>
<dd>You could probably write off 80% of Europeans as racist on similar grounds. Moreover, this is written in character, and I'm not sure that this Diary is necessarily of Crowley himself (despite the introduction claiming this is a true story). It seems like any late 1800s early 1900s writer has post-mortem racism charges piling up<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 18:48, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a lot more to tell, about the accuracy and correctness of some of his writings, his influences, his megalomaniac nature, etc. --Lcmwda 22:57, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you in some impressions. For instance, Crowley varies all over the place in his regard for women -- in one moment praising Woman as equivalent to the goddess Nuit and thus the infinite universe; at the next ascribing to women very little active role in his rituals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can't agree with you on the "Satanism" charge. A person can be opposed to Christianity without being a Satanist -- except in the fervid imaginations of certain fanatics who believe that every Hindu and Muslim and Neopagan is a secret Satanist. If you contrast Crowley's writings with (say) <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Szandor_LaVey_3b2e.html" title="Anton Szandor LaVey">Howie Levy</a>'s, you will find that Crowley does not use the image or <i>ikon</i> of Satan. He <i>does</i> use the image of Antichrist or Beast 666 (which even in Christian eschatology is distinct from Satan) -- if you dig into Crowleyana you will find that this stems from his own mother (a shriekingly pious member of the Puritan sect of the day) calling young Ed Alex Crowley "The Beast" for his mischief as a child. It is a metaphor. Crowley certainly does frequently invoke <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_%28mythology%29.html" title="Pan (mythology)">Pan</a>, whose classical Greek goatish image was perverted into Satan's by later Christians -- but here Crowley reflects the Neopagan Pan much more than the Christian Satan. Satanism is basically a Christian heresy; and Crowley is no Christian, neither orthodox nor heretical.</dd>

<dd>What about his "Hymn to Satan" in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Equinox_40ed.html" title="The Equinox">The Equinox</a> (Vol. I., No. 10)? What about his commentary on the barbarous names of <i>Liber Samekh</i>?

<dd>This is actually an odd aspect of Crowley that deserves more attention, from someone with more knowledge on the topic than myself. Crowley's views on this actually seemed to change over time. For instance, his "Do as thou wilt" started out as one of the most concise and coherent statements of free will ever expressed. However, by the end of his life, his interpretation of The Law of Thelema had changed so much that he seemed to think it an endorsement of determinism! I recall reading a quote from him (I believe it was in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Equinox_40ed.html" title="The Equinox">the Equinox</a>, although I couldn't tell you where) in which he advocated the formation of a government office to determine what people's "True Will" was. Which sounds suspiciously like fascism to me... But my knowledge of Crowley's writings is far from complete, so I may be mistaken. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorblek_3fa9.html" title="User:Zorblek">Zorblek</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZorblek_e6f0.html" title="User talk:Zorblek">(talk)</a> 16:48, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe it's just me, but wouldn't it make more sense chronologically to have the "Crowley and Rock &amp; Roll" section placed after the "Mountaineering" one?

<p>Also, regarding Crowley's racism, it's interesting to note that someone who's perceived as relatively benign (in non-academic circles) and contemporary like Rudyard Kipling was as glib with the stereotypes as was Crowley (see the Norton Critical Edition of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim.html" title="Kim">Kim</a>, for instance).</p>

<dd>The correct modern French would read: "Fais ce que (tu) voudras". "Fay ce que vouldras" is the correct quote.

<p>"Crowley being visceral towards the frigid and bigotted social views Victorian England exhibited throughout the first half of the twentieth century."</p>
<p>This is just plain wrong. Quite apart from Crowley's own intense racialism and authoritarianism - which is unproven, so I will not put it in the article - it seems rather peculiar to charge all of England with bigotry and frigidity (the word is spelled 'bigoted', by the way).</p>
<p>In addition, Queen Victoria died in 1901, after which there could be no Victorian England.</p>

<dd>It's a possibility. But my main point is that 'visceral' and 'frigid' as descriptors don't really have a place in a Wikipedia article, given that they have emotional baggage. The author also needs to say what exactly the bigotry concerns.

<dd>I would say that he does belong. At the very least it is very clear that modern day satanists tend to have a lot of interest on his works. Also, the attitudes match very well indeed - both camps (Thelemites and Satanists, as well as AC himself) tend to love misdirection and self-centered, manipulative goals and strategies. One side effect is that it is very hard to acquire reliable detailed info about them. But for the purposes of wikipedia categories I would say there it fits well. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Dantas_e357.html" title="User:Luis Dantas">Luis Dantas</a> 11:51, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an ex-Satanist myself, I would agree. While there <i>are</i> some similarities between Satanism and Thelema (and the former was probably greatly influenced by the latter), there are some <b>very</b> substantial differences. Satanism is all about unleashing the ego, while Thelema is very much about controlling it and channeling it towards useful ends. And while both tend to use some variant of "Do as thou wilt", they mean <b>very</b> different things by it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That would exclude LaVey's "Satanism" from being Satanism. Personally, I believe there is a connection between Crowley (which is not to say his Thelema 'will based faith') and Satanism; mostly because he called himself TO MEGA THERION ("the Great Beast" in Greek, which added up, in Greek gematria to 666). Furthermore, he exalted the "whore of babylon" as the feminine extention of the surpeme godhead. Many of his references seem to call the Christian church 'the black brotherhood' and denote them as the enemy. He obviously made some attempt at a Satanist aesthetic without going so far as dubbing himself such. There is definitely enough reason to put a link to Satanism, even if he wasn't flagrantly self assigned such. <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 06:54, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't exclude LaVey because LaVey called his system "Satanism". "If A then C; If B then C" does not mean that it follows "If A then B". (A is Satanism, B is Crowley, C is the Book of Revelation). The evidence you cite are all quotes from that text -- it would be better to link to that. I am not aware of Crowley viewing the Christian church as 'the enemy' or referring to them as 'the black brotherhood', unless he meant some individual faction of "Christians". He includes Christ on the Tree of Life in 777, and of course the notion that he 'completed' the work of Christ in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thelema.html" title="Thelema">Thelema</a>. Neither of these means that he was a Christian, or that we ought to link to mainstream <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Dogandpony_d7e5.html" title="User:The Dogandpony">The Dogandpony</a> 20:18, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a Thelemite, so if I have a bias it would be in Crowley's favor. However, I would argue that Crowley does belong in an article on Satanism. I argue this not because Crowley was a Satanist himself (he was not), but because nearly all of modern organized Satanism (e.g. the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan) was heavily influenced by Crowley's writings. That's certainly not Crowley's fault, but it is nonetheless true. I think that any mention of Crowley in that context should be carefully written and confined to a discussion of that influence. It would be dishonest and incomplete to simply ignore the historical roots of modern Satanism.Psuliin 17:51, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Christianity, anything that deviates from Christian doctrine (such as the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>’s <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonism.html" title="Platonism">Transcendence</a>, the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement.html" title="Atonement">Atonement</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> or the existence of evil and sin, and so on and so forth) or in some other way helps <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Sheten</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucifer.html" title="Lucifer">Helil</a> (admittedly, the methods for determining this often being highly questionable) is deemed Satanic, to some degree. As long as it somehow weakens God’s authority or His relationship with mankind, wittingly or not, then it helps <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Sheten</a>, thus of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Sheten</a>. To clear it up, Satanism should probably be in the context of Christianity unless explicitly admitted by the suspect him or herself (i.e. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_LaVey_21ca.html" title="Anton LaVey">Anton LaVey</a> clearly affiliated himself with Satan so we can be sure of that as a default classification, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theosophy.html" title="Theosophy">Theosophy</a>, on the other hand, being efface to Christian doctrine while not explicitly Satanic, should be identified as “<i>Satanic according to</i>…” or “<i>Satanic under</i>…”).</p>
<p>So is Crowley a Satanist? Yes, if you are a Christian (and he does seem to gravitate towards Satan, at least he shows quite a bit of hostility towards Christianity in general, and, if my suspicions about his religion is true, he would have to be quite <a href="../../../e/u/t/Eutheism%2C_dystheism%2C_and_maltheism.html" title="Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism">maltheistic</a> though whether that is true Christianity he is against is an open topic).</p>

<p>Does this sentence mean his father, after his normal day's work, began preaching? If so, what and to whom? Or does it mean after he retired from the profession of brewer went on to another career as a minister? Also, I would remove the word "practice" unless he was actually rehearsing to preach.

<dd>Yes and no... Crowley definitely framed his skepticism in terms of science, but his definition of science may have been a little broader than most. Certainly he advocates experimentation, but a great deal of his work relies on subjective experience rather than empirical evidence. Crowley's skepticism contains elements of both scientific skepticism and philosophical skepticism.

<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BEGINS HERE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>'s first published novel was <i>Diary of a Drug Fiend</i>. The book was originally published in London in 1922. Although written over seventy-five years ago, the book is still relevant for today's readers. The book paints a vivid picture of the mind of drug users. The drug user's highs, lows, and sometimes strange thought patterns are described in great detail in this interesting book.</p>
<p>The infamous Aleister Crowley invokes a reaction with some people. Some say he was strange and went off the deep-end with his involvement in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magick.html" title="Magick">Magick</a>, the practice of using various techniques to exert control over the forces of nature. If one is too close-minded to read this book because of the author's reputation, he or she would be missing a great read.</p>
<p>This story is supposedly based on truth. False names were used to conceal the identities of the people in the book. For instance, Aleister Crowley is called Peter Pendragon in the book. Peter went to a pub and was socializing with some people he knew when he saw the woman that would change his life, Lou.</p>
<p><i>Across the moaning body of the blackmailer, I was looking at the face of a girl that I had never seen before. And I said to myself, "Well, that's all right, I've known you all my life." And when I said to myself "my life," I didn't in the least mean my life as Peter Pendragon, I didn't even mean a life extending through the centuries, I meant a different kind of life --something with which centuries have nothing whatever to do</i></p>
<p>(Crowley 11).</p>
<p>This truly eloquent description of Peter's first glimpse of Lou reveals that Crowley was truly a master of language. The book is written in such a clever way that the reader continues to want more.</p>
<p>Basically, the story is of Peter falling madly in love with a woman named Lou. They run off to Paris and travel throughout Europe. Lou introduces Peter to <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> and they quickly become dependent on the narcotics. When their supply of drugs runs out, the withdrawal troubles begin. <i>King Lamus</i>, helps the two overcome their addiction by the application of practical Magick. Both Peter and Lou find their true purpose in life and live happily ever after.</p>
<p>"Diary of a Drug Fiend" would be a beneficial source of information for professionals involved with the psychology of addiction. Doctors, lawyers, police, and the average person would gain insight into the thought patterns of a drug addict from the first high, to the constant effort to regain the effects of the first high. The craving for the drug, and how it is the only thing the user thinks about when he or she does not have the drug for a period of time is covered thoroughly. How selfish and careless one becomes when he or she needs a fix is also mentioned in the book. Peter lost his love for Lou because he could only think of the drugs. He quickly knew this was wrong and constantly tried to regain his love for Lou.</p>
<p>If people are open-minded and enjoy challenging their beliefs, then <i>Diary of a Drug Fiend</i> may be the book to read. At the time of reading this book, we may find many useful insights that could dramatically change one's life contained within its pages.</p>

<p>The two entries by 68.40.20.48 seems wrong and is probably some form of vandalism but this is not my field of knowledge so i will leave them alone</p>

<dd>Looks roughly similar to the Amazon listing for the book so am inclined to create an article for it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 17:46, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I deleted: "Lou's father, " in reference to Lamus... ...wait - Lamus was Lou's father? I would like a clear line from the booking saying this - as if this were the case Peter would not have had a sort of jealousy for Lamus and Lou's envolvement!</p>

<p>Just read in an article about funny or weird names names (<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,390891,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,390891,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,390891,00.html</a>) that Crowley had a daughter by the name of <b>Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith</b>. Probably that is worth mentioning in the article. Unfortunately that is the only thing I really know about this. I don't have any more information on the daughter, when she was born and so forth. Probably someone with more knowledge on this matter could add it? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigBen212_e1f7.html" title="User:BigBen212">BigBen212</a> 20:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here we have an article that goes a long way to proving that Wikipedia is fatally flawed. A curious person has been described as a serious person. Newton was an alchemist. He also happened to be relevant. Oh well.</p>
<p><a name="Crowley:_A_Hyper-Calvinest.3F.21" id="Crowley:_A_Hyper-Calvinest.3F.21"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Crowley: A <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyper-calvinism.html" title="Hyper-calvinism">Hyper-Calvinest</a>?!</span></h2>
<p>Were his parents <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritans</a> (as in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a>)? Because if they where then that may explain allot not only about his obvious dislike of Christianity and social Puritanism, but also his cosmology. I suspect him of taking <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">Calvin</a>’s doctrine of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predestination.html" title="Predestination">predestination</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irresistible_grace.html" title="Irresistible grace">irresistible grace</a> to it’s logical limits and ended up becoming a form of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monism.html" title="Monism">Monism</a>, in which <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> is equally good and evil (and if one is a proscriptive eutheist then there is little difference between the two then, though one of the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neviim.html" title="Neviim">Prophets</a> does warn of confusing “ the light for the dark and the sweet for the bitter”, which reflects a purely descriptive, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonism.html" title="Platonism">Platonic</a> morality). When one goes this step, then the next is accepting <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> as being merely another manifestation of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> (such as the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kali.html" title="Kali">Kali</a>), whether literal or not, and since we are including Satan, then the door is left open for all of the other Pre-Christian European gods to begin taking their respective stations within their <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheon_%28gods%29.html" title="Pantheon (gods)">Pantheons</a>, the fact that they may be affiliated with the devil irrelevant because the devil, lying spirits, hardened hearts and evil in general are already established to themselves be different manifestations of God. See: <a href="../../../p/r/o/Problem_of_Evil_f5aa.html" title="Problem of Evil">Problem of Evil</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Problem_of_Hell_c978.html" title="Problem of Hell">Problem of Hell</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodicy.html" title="Theodicy">Theodicy</a> for related subjects).</p>
<p>Please note: I am a Christian (Generically <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>, ideally Lutheran, though I have strong leanings towards <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Orthodox Catholicism</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed.html" title="Reformed">reformed</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arminian.html" title="Arminian">Arminian</a> churches), so I DO NOT believe any of this doctrine to be true and do consider it heresy, as with Calvinism, and am none-too surprised if Crowley figured this out, if, indeed, that is what he was doing (remember, this is all SPECULATION, I am aware that I am not stating facts). See these two external links <a href="http://www.geocities.com/lasttrumpet_2000/theo/calvin9.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/lasttrumpet_2000/theo/calvin9.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.pfrs.org/calvinism/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pfrs.org/calvinism/index.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://www.pfrs.org/calvinism/calvin09.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pfrs.org/calvinism/calvin09.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which show how, if one is ideologically honest, TULIP, alongside the traumatic hypocrisy of Puritanism, can produce people like Crowley (this is why the separation of Church and state is so important, given we are fallible beings and thus will eventually fail at any absolutist system, especially Churches).</p>
