<p>Born in Ithaca, New York, in the year of 1921, Haley spent his first five years in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henning%2C_Tennessee_5fcf.html" title="Henning, Tennessee">Henning, Tennessee</a> in an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> family mixed with <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> ancestry with his 2 younger brothers. Haley's father, Simon Alexander Haley, was a professor of agriculture who had served in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The younger Haley always spoke proudly of his father and the incredible obstacles of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> he had overcome. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_24.html" title="May 24">May 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, Alex Haley began his 20-year service with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Coast_Guard_52b9.html" title="United States Coast Guard">Coast Guard</a>.</p>
<p>He enlisted as a mess-boy and then became a third class <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petty_Officer_2162.html" title="Petty Officer">Petty Officer</a> in the rate of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steward.html" title="Steward">Mess Attendant</a>, one of the few enlisted designators open to African Americans at that time. It was during his service in the Pacific theater of operations that Haley taught himself the craft of writing stories. He talked of how the greatest enemy he and his crew faced during their long sea voyages wasn't the Japanese but boredom. He collected many rejection slips over an eight-year period before his first story was bought.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Haley was able to petition the Coast Guard to allow him to transfer into the field of journalism, and by 1949 he had become a First Class Petty Officer in the rate of Journalist. He later advanced to the rank of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Petty_Officer_3b0f.html" title="Chief Petty Officer">Chief Petty Officer</a> and held this grade until his retirement from the Coast Guard in 1959.</p>

<p>After his retirement from the Coast Guard, Haley began his writing career and eventually became a senior editor for <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Readers_Digest_60ac.html" title="Readers Digest">Reader's Digest</a></i>.</p>
<p>Haley conducted the first Playboy Interview for <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine. The interview, with jazz legend <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Davis_4d69.html" title="Miles Davis">Miles Davis</a>, appeared in the September 1962 issue. In the interview, Davis candidly spoke about his thoughts and feelings on racism and it was that interview that set the tone for what would become a significant part of the magazine. Dr. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>'s <i>Playboy</i> Interview with Haley was the longest he ever granted to any publication. Throughout the 1960s, Haley was responsible for some of the magazine's most notable interviews, including an interview with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Nazi_Party_69cf.html" title="American Nazi Party">American Nazi Party</a> leader <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lincoln_Rockwell_1bdf.html" title="George Lincoln Rockwell">George Lincoln Rockwell</a>, who agreed to meet with Haley only after Haley, in a phone conversation, assured him that he was not Jewish. Haley exhibited remarkable calm and professionalism, despite the handgun Rockwell kept on the table throughout the interview. Haley also interviewed <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassius_Clay_89de.html" title="Cassius Clay">Cassius Clay</a>, who spoke about changing his name to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Ali_9e91.html" title="Muhammad Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>. Other interviews include <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Ruby_12b9.html" title="Jack Ruby">Jack Ruby</a>'s defense attorney <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melvin_Belli_6bcf.html" title="Melvin Belli">Melvin Belli</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Brown_3756.html" title="Jim Brown">Jim Brown</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Carson_bdcc.html" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a>, and <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy_Jones_c1bf.html" title="Quincy Jones">Quincy Jones</a>. He completed a memoir of Malcolm X for <i>Playboy</i> six months before his death in February 1992. The memoir was published in the July 1992 issue of the magazine.</p>
<p>One of Haley's most famous interviews was a 1963 interview with <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> for <i>Playboy</i>, which led to collaboration on the activist's autobiography. Haley later ghostwrote <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X_9f19.html" title="The Autobiography of Malcolm X">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a></i>, based on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interview.html" title="Interview">interviews</a> conducted shortly before <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm</a>'s death (and with an epilogue). The book was published in 1965 and was a huge success, being later named by <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_magazine.html" title="Time magazine">Time magazine</a></i> one of the ten most important nonfiction books of the 20th century.</p>
<p>In 1976 Haley published <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Roots%7E_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family_7951.html" title="Roots: The Saga of an American Family">Roots: The Saga of an American Family</a></i>, a novel based loosely on his family's history, starting with the story of <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunta_Kinte_f1d7.html" title="Kunta Kinte">Kunta Kinte</a>, kidnapped in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gambia_f6b9.html" title="The Gambia">Gambia</a> in 1767 to be sold as a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a> in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_United_States_c14f.html" title="The United States">the United States</a>. This work involved ten years of research, intercontinental travel and writing. Haley went to the village of <a href="../../../j/u/f/Jufureh.html" title="Jufureh">Jufureh</a> where Kunta Kinte grew up, which was still in existence, and listened to a tribal historian tell the story of Kinte's capture. Haley also traced the records of the ship, <i>The Lord Ligonier</i>, which he said carried his ancestor to America. Genealogists have since <a href="#Plagiarism_and_other_controversy" title="">disputed</a> Haley's research and conclusions.</p>
<p>Haley said the most emotional moment of his life was on September 29, 1967, when he stood at the site in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annapolis%2C_Maryland_8650.html" title="Annapolis, Maryland">Annapolis</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> where his ancestor had arrived 200 years before. <i>Roots</i> was eventually published in 37 languages, won the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> and went on to become a popular <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roots_%28TV_miniseries%29_d2ed.html" title="Roots (TV miniseries)">television miniseries</a> in 1977. The book and film were both successful, reaching a record-breaking 130 million viewers when it was serialized on television. <i>Roots</i> emphasized that African Americans have a long history and that not all of that history is lost, as many believed. Its popularity sparked an increased public interest in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a>, as well.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, Haley began working on a second historical novel based on another branch of his family, traced through his grandmother Queen — the daughter of a black slave woman and her white master. Haley died in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a> of a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> before he could complete the story; at his request, it was finished by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Stevens_3874.html" title="David Stevens">David Stevens</a> and was published as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Queen%7E_The_Story_of_an_American_Family_5636.html" title="Queen: The Story of an American Family">Alex Haley's Queen</a></i>. It was subsequently made into a movie in 1993.</p>
<p>Late in his life, Haley acquired a small farm in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norris%2C_Tennessee_3203.html" title="Norris, Tennessee">Norris, Tennessee</a>, adjacent to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Appalachia_6cae.html" title="Museum of Appalachia">Museum of Appalachia</a>, with the intent of making it his home. Subsequent to his death, the property was sold to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Defense_Fund_1277.html" title="Children's Defense Fund">Children's Defense Fund</a> (CDF), which calls it the "Alex Haley Farm" and uses it as a national training center and retreat site. An abandoned <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barn.html" title="Barn">barn</a> on the farm property was rebuilt as a traditional cantilevered barn, using a design by <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a> <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_Lin_c3cd.html" title="Maya Lin">Maya Lin</a>. The building now serves as a library for CDF.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard honored Haley by naming the <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutter.html" title="Cutter">cutter</a> <i><a href="../../../u/s/c/USCGC_Alex_Haley_%28WMEC-39%29_3aae.html" title="USCGC Alex Haley (WMEC-39)">Alex Haley</a></i> after him. Also, a barracks at the Coast Guard Recruit Training Center in <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_May%2C_New_Jersey_4c43.html" title="Cape May, New Jersey">Cape May, New Jersey</a> is named Haley Hall.</p>
<p>Haley was also posthumously awarded the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_Service_Medal_74aa.html" title="Korean War Service Medal">Korean War Service Medal</a> from the government of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> ten years after his death. This award, created in 1999, did not exist during Haley's lifetime.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Haley_c108.html" title="Edit section: Plagiarism and other controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plagiarism and other controversy</span></h2>
<p>Alex Haley researched <i>Roots</i> for ten years; the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roots_%28TV_miniseries%29_d2ed.html" title="Roots (TV miniseries)"><i>Roots</i> TV series</a> adaptation aired in 1977. The same year, Haley won a <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> for the book and the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spingarn_Medal_598d.html" title="Spingarn Medal">Spingarn Medal</a> as well. However, Haley's fame was marred by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> charges in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>; after a trial, Haley settled out-of-court for $650,000, having admitted that large passages of <i>Roots</i> were copied from the book: <i>The African</i> by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Courlander_f9f8.html" title="Harold Courlander">Harold Courlander</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Haley claimed that the appropriation of Courlander's passages had been unintentional.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Walker_7c2e.html" title="Margaret Walker">Margaret Walker</a> also sued him, claiming <i>Roots</i> violated the copyright for her novel <i><a href="../../../j/u/b/Jubilee_%28novel%29.html" title="Jubilee (novel)">Jubilee</a></i>. Her case was dismissed by the court.</p>
<p>Haley's work is controversial for other reasons. He has been accused of fictionalizing true stories in both his book <i>Roots</i> and <i>The Autobiography Of Malcolm X</i>. Malcolm X's family and members of The <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a> accused Haley of changing selected parts of his story.</p>
<p>In addition, the veracity of those aspects of <i>Roots</i> which Haley claimed to be true has also been challenged.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Although Haley acknowledged the novel was primarily a work of fiction, he did claim that his actual ancestor was Kunta Kinte, an African taken from the village of <a href="../../../j/u/f/Jufureh.html" title="Jufureh">Jufureh</a> in what is now <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gambia_f6b9.html" title="The Gambia">The Gambia</a>. According to Haley, Kunta Kinte was sold into slavery where he was given the name <i>Toby</i> and, while in the service of a slavemaster named John Waller, went on to have a daughter named <i>Kizzy</i>, Haley's great-great-great grandmother. Haley also claimed to have identified the specific slave ship and its specific voyage that transported Kunta Kinte from Africa to North America in 1767.</p>
<p>However, noted genealogist Elizabeth Shown Mills and the African-Americanist historian Gary B. Mills revisited Haley's research and concluded that those claims of Haley's were not true.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> According to the Millses, the slave named <i>Toby</i> who was owned by John Waller could be definitively shown to have been in North America as early as 1762. They further said that Toby died years prior to the supposed date of birth of Kizzy. There have also been suggestions that Kebba Kanji Fofana, the amateur <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griot.html" title="Griot">griot</a> in Jufureh, who, during Haley's visit there, confirmed the tale of the disappearance of Kunta Kinte, had been coached to relate such a story.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>To date, Haley's work remains a notable exclusion from the <i>Norton Anthology of <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_Literature_0f7b.html" title="African-American Literature">African-American Literature</a></i>, despite Haley's status as history's best-selling African-American author. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> professor Dr. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Louis_Gates%2C_Jr._d38a.html" title="Henry Louis Gates, Jr.">Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</a>, one of the anthology's general editors, has denied that the controversies surrounding Haley's works are the reason for this exclusion. Nonetheless, Dr. Gates has acknowledged the doubts about Haley's claims with regard to <i>Roots</i>, saying, "Most of us feel it's highly unlikely that Alex actually found the village whence his ancestors sprang. <i>Roots</i> is a work of the imagination rather than strict historical scholarship."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
