<dd>Do you mean halt updating players until tournaments and organizations are finished? That might make some sense. I realize that I have not done as much work as I would like, but it has been a busy summer (and with the World Cup!) I haven't had so much time. I do not have any experience in doing a Portal. In fact, I don't really use those that exists for other subjects. But, yes, a Badminton Portal would be nice.--<a href="../../../s/v/t/User%7ESVTCobra_8aba.html" title="User:SVTCobra">SVTCobra</a> 21:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/v/t/User_talk%7ESVTCobra_5c9a.html#Interested_in_Project.3F.3F.3F" title="User talk:SVTCobra">Talk</a></dd>

<dd>Sorry, it took so long to get back to you, very busy summer. It is OK by me if you eliminate players from the project. About "Portals": I have looked at some that already exist for other sports. It would be great if there is one for Badminton, but it also looks like a lot of work to maintain and keep up-to-date. Therefore, I cannot commit to working on a portal.

<p>Hi Allenf1. No, I don't think it is necessary to separate Thomas and Uber. They are held at the same time and at the same place, right? Also, they even make a single logo for the event. However, you are the one that is working on tournaments, so if it is easier for you (since there are more Thomas cups) to break the up, I'd say do it. I trust you to do what is right. --<a href="../../../s/v/t/User%7ESVTCobra_8aba.html" title="User:SVTCobra">SVTCobra</a> 01:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was thinking that the crosstable belongs on all of the hockey pages, along with the playoff brackets which you removed as well. Both of them are useful summaries of the more detailed information below. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 11:35, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Response to your response on my page::) Let me explain better. I think that the various tournaments described in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_field_hockey_tournaments.html" title="International field hockey tournaments">International field hockey tournaments</a> should all be consistent (formatted the same as much as possible), with or without crosstables and with or without playoff brackets.

I'm willing to start reformatting those past tournament articles to match your work -- it will take a (long) while, but I think it will be a positive step forward for coverage of field hockey (I'm North American, we also have <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_hockey.html" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a>) in Wikipedia. I'm not really a field hockey fan, but I'm a fan of consistently formatted articles.&#160;:-) I first started editing the qualifier article when it was listed on "needs wikification" page, which is why I'm interested.<br />
Now, I think that the articles should include crosstables and playoff brackets because they are good summaries, which can be present in the same article as the more detailed game reports. Admittedly, for some of the older articles the game-by-game info may be hard to find. I'd like to have a public discussion about the crosstables and playoff brackets, but if it goes against my idea, I'm still willing to help do the work of formatting past tournament articles.<br />
By the way, did you like the way I did the team listings on the qualifier article? I thought that was a good way to have the information available without taking up a ton of visual space -- just clicking on the bar for each team will display the team members in the table.<br />
Anyway, let me know what you think, thanks. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 17:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>((Response again)) Okay, I can live without the crosstables. I'd still like to have the playoff brackets along with the game records, though. I'll start working on the previous qualifier articles, formatting the games and such the exact same way that you have the 2006 qualifier article, and doing the teams with the hidden boxes -- but only for the qualifiers. Does that sound okay? -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 02:32, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Really, I think that format looks poor. Why use a small font size like 85% or 90% (which is a bad idea in the first place, as per WP:MOS) and then expand the table to 100% of the page? There is a huge amount of whitespace around the text, which looks very bad. I looked at the basketball and football pages as per your suggestion, and they look terrible too! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 19:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, I received your message on my talk page, but to be honest, I have a difficult time understanding your English. I am dismayed that you are blindly reverting my changes. The previous format on those pages does <b>not</b> look good when rendered on different screen sizes. For example, on a 1024x768 display, it is okay (not great), but on a 1280x1024 display (or larger), it looks poor. Most dreadful is the rendering on a widescreen display. Forcing the table to 100% page width results in a huge amount of white space. This is a poor page design practice. I test my edits on multiple display resolutions, and I suggest you consider the same. I have seen this formatting style on other Wikipedia pages, and I am tempted to make changes there too, but my concern is the set of Olympic pages right now, so that is why I will continue to make improvements to those pages only. Please have a look at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Formatting_issues" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS#Formatting issues</a> for some comments on font sizes (i.e. only "if you absolutely must") and legibility. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 05:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your attitude is disrespectful (please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>), and your arguments are unsound (as far as I can tell - please try to use better English!). You claim "1280 X 1024 pixels is not use by much person" [sic]. Do you really believe this? I think the reverse is true! Expect for laptops, the vast majority of monitors sold today are at least that size. You also disregard my comment about widescreen displays, which are quite common today (even on laptops). Forcing the table to 100% screen width is bad web page design, and causes a very poor rendering on those displays. I wish to engage in constructive discussion, so please keep comments like "Rediculous" [sic] to yourself. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 06:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did you even look at my most recent edits? I attempted to use a format that approximates your version at XGA resolution, but doesn't render poorly at widescreen resolutions. Instead, you blindly reverted, and are now clearly in violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. I am most upset that you blindly reverted <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_at_the_Summer_Olympics_cc9b.html" title="Basketball at the Summer Olympics">Basketball at the Summer Olympics</a>, on which I made some significant improvements, all of which you deleted with no explanation! That is clearly unacceptable, and could be considered vandalism. Your most recent message on my talk page is clearly inflammatory (not to mention, barely understandable). I shall be forced to protect those pages if you persist. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 06:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are trying to say (in your most recent message on my talk page).</dd>
<dd>My most recent edits were different - an attempt to find some common ground. You simply discarded them without any explanation, in the edit summary or elsewhere. I just ask that you take a look at the most recent version, and if there is still something you don't like, please tell me, rather than reverting without explanation. My most recent edits look about the same on an XGA display (which I assume you are using), but don't forced a stretched table on widescreen displays. That should satisfy both of us, but since you are throwing away these edits without explanation, I assume you are still unhappy with the appearance. Please consider the most recent versions and tell me what you find wrong. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 06:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still don't understand what your point is. I'm sorry to have so much trouble with your English, but I really don't understand what you are trying to tell me.</dd>
<dd>I did take a look at those pages, and they have the same problem. The use of 90% font and 100% width is a bad combination. It renders okay on XGA displays, but not on others. However, as I stated before, my immediate concern is Olympic pages, and I intend to work on those first before moving on to other projects.</dd>
<dd>Can you please answer my question: What do you not like about the most recent versions of the field hockey, basketball and football Olympic pages? They should look about the same to you. If they are unacceptable, please tell me why, as clearly as you can. Be specific about what doesn't look right on your display. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 07:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument (such as it is), seems to be that the "common" format is reason enough to revert my changes. Do you really think that there is no room for improvement? Just because it is "common" doesn't mean that there aren't problems! Please use an open mind and consider what those tables look like on a widescreen display. Trust me, they look terrible! Do you want me to send you a screenshot? For (hopefully) the last time, please tell me <b>exactly</b> what you don't like about removing the 90% font and 100% page width formats. I have left everything else alone. Explain what doesn't look good about the versions without those formats? They look good to me on both my 4:3 display and my 16:10 display, at XGA resolution and above. That's great! Why wouldn't you think that is an improvement on a version that looks good only on one aspect ratio? <b>PLEASE</b> explain what is wrong with those! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 07:39, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, I will meet you halfway. I will concede the 90% font size. Just take a look on your display at the two most recent revisions (before &amp; after). The <b>ONLY</b> difference is the 100% page width, which causes tremendous grief on a widescreen display. Take an <b>honest</b> look at the two versions on your display and tell me if you see <b>any</b> problem with my version. I want to believe you are not just being stubborn about the "common format".

You have consistently violated <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> (as have I), but more importantly, you stubbornly reject an improvement to the page without any rational explanation. I have asked you multiple times to explain what you think is wrong with the "width=100%" removed and you ignore these requests. I have looked at the page on a 4:3 aspect ratio display and it looks about the same in both versions. but obviously, it is a vast improvment on a 16:10 aspect ratio display when the "width=100%" is removed. Why do you reject this obvious improvment? It is satisfactory to everybody! What is wrong with that?

<dd>I do not understand your last message. Is there someone who can help you with English? You are not communicating clearly. One thing I did understand is that you stated the table "looks good". So then why do you persist in changing it?!? You also state that you "dunno [sic] why you look so far about 4:3 and 16:10". I don't know what you mean by "look so far about", but my intentions should be obvious. There are a significant number of 16:10 displays in use today (e.g. pretty much everybody at my office uses one, almost all of my friends have them at home, etc.) Maybe in your part of the world that is not the case, but it certainly is around here. Working towards a table format that renders well on <b>both</b> aspect ratios is an obvious goal, yet you persist (for reasons unknown, since you say "I no need to answer you" [sic]) in using a version that renders well on only a 4:3 aspect ratio display. This totally baffles me. Why would you be against an obvious improvement that appeals to a broader set of Wikipedia readers? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 17:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You only apply it to Taiwan because your non-democratic government supports BEijing in all matters regarding Taiwan.

<dd>You yourself are not consistent in using what the international organizations use, as I have already shown on the Asian Games page.

<dd>And your inconsistency is your problem. The conventions for good article writing includes making sure that it includes information that makes sure MOST people understand what is being discussed. Most people in English speaking countries have no idea that Chinese Taipei is a reference to Taiwan. I have already exposed you for the fact that you insist on only using Chinese Taipei for Taiwan, but not using official IOC names for othe countries. That is hypocritical and inconsistent. Also, please try to clean up your grammar as it is sometimes hard to understand what you write.

<dd>Happy to help you with the English, no problem there. However, just because people haven't complained about Chinese Taipei in the past doesn't mean that this is a viable or reasonable issue to take up. I am a native of the US, though I am now in the process of becoming a citizen of Taiwan. I know most native-English speakers have no clue what Chinese Taipei really is. I also talked to two Australian baseball fans who came to Taichung for the baseball tournament who didn't know what Chinese Taipei was before they came up here- and they are big baseball fans where Taiwan is a major world power! Still, it is your lack of consistency that is especially galling. You are willing to impose this on Taiwan in Wikipedia, without acknowledging that you are, in fact, not using the IOC names you insist on for Taiwan for five other delegations. <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudahai_8a04.html" title="User:Ludahai">Ludahai</a> 07:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I LIVE in Taiwan. Of course I know the reason behind the use of Chinese Taipei. It is because Beijing has an illegitimate claim to this country and forcing Taiwan to accept this moniker was a condition for China attending the 1984 L.A. Olympics. Spare me the history lesson. You still aren't following a consistent naming policy yourself by not using other IOC designations in the article. <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudahai_8a04.html" title="User:Ludahai">Ludahai</a> 07:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to let you know that while I am not abandoning the Taiwan issue, I will not comment on it the next couple of days for two reasons. 1. We need a cooling off period and let other people put in their two cents worth. 2. I am extremely busy this weekend. I have a soccer game and will go to the Taiwan-Cuba baseball game this evening.

<dd>Aleenf1, I totally understand your feelings and I support your opinion in this situation. I don't see anything necessary in adding (Taiwan) next to Chinese Taipei, but on the other hand it doesn't bother me that much if it's there. What I do dislike is that when people revert the additions because they are not the wiki standards that they are reverted back again and we get into edit wars because of it. I understand what you meant when you said you get less or no praise for your work on Wikipedia. I'm in the same situation as I do pretty much on sports related articles. I almost never get a praise for it, while I see other people who contributed not as close as much as I did getting the compliments. That's the way it goes and I guess we just have to live with it. If you like editing in Wikipedia, please go on. Live with the fact that you might not be praised and don't let people scare you away. You are just like all of us one of the people that like to edit Wikipedia. You are a wikipedian, it's your life and you can go on as long as you want to. Others don't have to say anything about it.

<dd>Hmmm, from what I saw I think he did make a compromis by leaving it as Chinese Taipei, but with a note at the bottom of the participating nations. I think that's a good thing, at least it's a start on which we can go further and see what the future brings. To be honoust I don't know whether there was really a concensus on this subject in the past. This may have been on one of the Olympics problems as Chinese Taipei is the IOC name. Maybe we can ask around at some places to wheter it is there and from where we can show him that is was agreed like that. If there isn't talked about it in the past (which I doubt) then he probably has a point. If there is talked about it in the past, then I'm pretty sure there is a wikipedia page that tells us to only use Chinese Taipei somewhere in this project and we need to find it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BWF</span></h2>
<p>Hi Aleen,</p>
<p>I think it may be too soon to make the IBF/BWF change. Sure, it is official, but they still use the same <a href="http://www.internationalbadminton.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.internationalbadminton.org/" rel="nofollow">old website</a> and they have yet to pick a new logo. I think it makes most sense to do it in January when they have the <a href="http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/show_news.asp?section=0001000100110022&amp;monthinview=2006/11/1&amp;itemID=949" class="external text" title="http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/show_news.asp?section=0001000100110022&amp;monthinview=2006/11/1&amp;itemID=949" rel="nofollow">new logo</a>, etc. But if you want to start the work now, go ahead. For now, I think it is enough that the wiki entry for IBF says that the new name has been adopted. But why are they moving so slowly? Doesn't it just create confusion?

<dd>I thought I heard about some new project starting this year in badminton about a super series just like the ATP Tour in tennis, with also rankings towards a Masters Tournament at the end of the season. After each event the leader in these rankings could be placed there. If I'm mistaken here feel free to change it as it should be. I would like to ask not to take the table out of the article. Take for instance a look at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_in_cross-country_skiing.html" title="2007 in cross-country skiing">2007 in cross-country skiing</a> article and also click on the main articles in World Cup and Tour de Ski to see the effect of pages like this. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 06:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, by tennis the leaderboard is always shown. Of course I don't know if this will also be the case in badminton, all we can do is wait to be sure about that. As you can see above the table there is a red link to main article for the Super Series. That is where the more detailed + writing can be done, so we can leave the 2007 in badminton article for a quick summary for those who are interested but do not know where to look. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 07:08, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>sorry but there is no way to zoom in and out on the map while it is loaded. Unless you mean where there is a large map and it is displays on the page as a thumbnail, and you click "Download high resolution version" to view the full size version --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey</a><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">44</a></small> 04:02, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because the full image is displayed where it is less than a certain size (800 pixels wide x 600 pixels high, I believe) When the image size is less than this, there is no need for zooming because the whole image is shown. I have cropped the image, no worries. Since the image size is small it also does not zoom in. By the way it might be nice to add the year numbers to the image itself so you can see when each games was held. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey</a><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">44</a></small> 07:32, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
