<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Woollcott_c6e9.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Nicknamed <b>Aleck</b>, Woollcott was born in Phalanx, New Jersey, near <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bank%2C_New_Jersey_85fe.html" title="Red Bank, New Jersey">Red Bank, New Jersey</a> and graduated from <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_College_d44f.html" title="Hamilton College">Hamilton College</a> in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton%2C_New_York_aaf3.html" title="Clinton, New York">Clinton, New York</a>. In his early twenties he contracted the <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumps.html" title="Mumps">mumps</a>, which left him, apparently, mostly, if not completely, impotent. He never married or had children, although he had a large number of female friends, most notable of whom were <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Parker_f8a9.html" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/y/Neysa_McMein_1a24.html" title="Neysa McMein">Neysa McMein</a>, to whom he actually proposed the day after she had just wed her new husband, Jack Baragwanath.</p>
<p>Woollcott was born in an 85-room house, a vast ramshackle building that had once been a commune. It was called The <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Phalanx_25e3.html" title="North American Phalanx">North American Phalanx</a>, and was in Phalanx, New Jersey. There were many social experiments in the mid-1800s, some more successful than others. When The Phalanx fell apart after a fire there in 1854, it was taken over by the Bucklin family, Woollcott's maternal grandparents. There, amid his extended family, Woollcott spent large portions of his childhood. His father was a ne'er-do-well Cockney who drifted through various jobs, sometimes spending long periods away from his wife and children. Poverty was always close at hand.</p>
<p>The Bucklins and Woollcotts were avid readers, giving young Aleck a lifelong love of literature, especially the works of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>.</p>
<p>Through a family friend, Dr. Alexander Humphreys (after whom he was named), Woollcott made his way through college, graduating from Hamilton College, in upstate New York, in 1909. There, despite a rather poor reputation (his nickname was "Putrid") he founded a drama group, edited the student literary magazine, and was accepted by a fraternity.</p>
<p>He was one of the most prolific drama critics at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>, and was an owlish character whose caustic wit either joyously attracted or vehemently repelled the artistic communities of 1920's Manhattan. He was actually banned for a time from reviewing certain <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theater.html" title="Broadway theater">Broadway theater</a> shows.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> As a result he sued the Shubert theater organization for violation of the New York Civil Rights Act, but lost in the state's highest court in 1916 on the grounds that only discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or color was unlawful.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> From 1929 to 1934 Woollcott wrote a column called <i>Shouts and Murmurs</i> for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>. He was, however, frequently criticized for his ornate, florid style of writing and, in contrast to his contemporaries <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Thurber_a1af.html" title="James Thurber">James Thurber</a> and <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._J._Perelman_7cf9.html" title="S. J. Perelman">S. J. Perelman</a>, he is little read today, although his book, <i>While Rome Burns</i>, published by <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grosset_%26_Dunlap_2a2a.html" title="Grosset &amp; Dunlap">Grosset &amp; Dunlap</a> in 1934 was in 1954 named by critic <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Starrett_69a1.html" title="Vincent Starrett">Vincent Starrett</a> as one of the 52 "Best Loved Books of the Twentieth Century".</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolcott_Gibbs_a67d.html" title="Wolcott Gibbs">Wolcott Gibbs</a>, who often edited Woollcott's work at <i>The New Yorker</i>, was quoted in <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Thurber_a1af.html" title="James Thurber">James Thurber</a>'s book <i>The Years with Ross</i> as saying: "'Shouts and Murmurs' was about the strangest copy I ever edited. You could take every other sentence out without changing the sense a particle. The whole department, in fact, often had no more substance than a Talk [of the Town] anecdote. I guess he was one of the most dreadful writers who ever existed."</p>
<p>After being kicked out of the apartment he shared with <i>The New Yorker</i> founders <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Ross_4125.html" title="Harold Ross">Harold Ross</a> and his wife <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Grant_596e.html" title="Jane Grant">Jane Grant</a>, Woollcott moved first into the Hotel des Artistes on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, then to an apartment at the far end of East 52nd Street. The members of the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquin_Round_Table_2e31.html" title="Algonquin Round Table">Algonquin Round Table</a> had a debate as to what to call his new home. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_P._Adams_fd02.html" title="Franklin P. Adams">Franklin P. Adams</a> suggested that he name it after the Indian word "Ocowoica", meaning "The-Little-Apartment-On-The-East-River-That-It-Is-Difficult-To-Find-A-Taxicab-Near". But <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Parker_f8a9.html" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a> came up with the definitive name: Wit's End.</p>
<p>Woollcott yearned to be as creative as the people with whom he surrounded himself. Among many other endeavours, he tried his hand at acting and co-wrote two Broadway shows with playwright <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_S._Kaufman_7b2a.html" title="George S. Kaufman">George S. Kaufman</a>, while appearing in two others. He also starred as Sheridan Whiteside, for whom he was the inspiration, in the traveling production of "The Man Who Came To Dinner" in 1940.<sup id="_ref-Levant_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Levant" title="">[1]</a></sup> He also appeared in several cameos in films in the late 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>Politically, Woollcott called for normalization of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">U.S.</a>-<a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics_1ed3.html" title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">Soviet</a> <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy.html" title="Diplomacy">relations</a>. He was a friend of reporter <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Duranty_2006.html" title="Walter Duranty">Walter Duranty</a> and Soviet foreign minister <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim_Litvinov_8b85.html" title="Maxim Litvinov">Maxim Litvinov</a>, and traveled to the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_2531.html" title="USSR">USSR</a> in the 1930s, as well as sending his friend <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpo_Marx_34e0.html" title="Harpo Marx">Harpo Marx</a> to Moscow on a comedy tour in 1934.</p>
<p>Towards the end of Woollcott's life he semi-retired to an island he had purchased on <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Bomoseen_0801.html" title="Lake Bomoseen">Lake Bomoseen</a> in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a>. He collapsed in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> while leading a panel discussion of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">the war in Europe</a> on the 1943 <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> radio program <i>People's Platform</i>; he died a few hours later, aged 56.</p>
<p>Woollcott is buried at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_College_d44f.html" title="Hamilton College">Hamilton College</a> in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton%2C_New_York_aaf3.html" title="Clinton, New York">Clinton, New York</a>.</p>

<p>He was one of the most-quoted men of his generation. Among Woollcott's classics is his description of the Los Angeles area as "Seven suburbs in search of a city" â€” a quip often attributed to his friend <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Parker_f8a9.html" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a>. Describing <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> editor <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Ross_4125.html" title="Harold Ross">Harold Ross</a>, he said: "He looks like a dishonest <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abe_Lincoln_9dae.html" title="Abe Lincoln">Abe Lincoln</a>."</p>
<p>He was also known for his occasionally savage wit. He once said about another contemporary wit and piano player: "There is absolutely nothing wrong with <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Levant_9da0.html" title="Oscar Levant">Oscar Levant</a> that a miracle can't fix." He also was known to greet friends with, "Hello, Repulsive." Famously, he published the shortest theatrical review in history by submitting to his editor simply: "Ouch."</p>
<p>His judgments were frequently eccentric. <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Parker_f8a9.html" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a> once said: "I remember hearing Woollcott say reading <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Proust_9cf8.html" title="Marcel Proust">Proust</a> is like lying in someone else's dirty bath water. And then he'd go into ecstasy about something called, '<a href="../../../v/a/l/Valiant_Is_the_Word_for_Carrie_c1f0.html" title="Valiant Is the Word for Carrie">Valiant Is the Word for Carrie</a>', and I knew I had enough of the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquin_Round_Table_2e31.html" title="Algonquin Round Table">Round Table</a>. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
