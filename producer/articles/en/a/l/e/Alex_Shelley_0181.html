Generation Next, led by Shelley, spent the entirety of the event attacking other wrestlers, claiming that they were "the best that Ring of Honor has to offer". They began feuding with wrestlers with a respect for tradition such as Matt Stryker, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Rave_d18f.html" title="Jimmy Rave">Jimmy Rave</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stagikas_abc1.html" title="John Stagikas">John Walters</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, 2004, at <i>Reborn: Completion</i>, Shelley lost to <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Williams_%28wrestler%29_35e5.html" title="Doug Williams (wrestler)">Doug Williams</a> in the finals of a tournament for the vacant <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_Pure_Championship_d589.html" title="ROH Pure Championship">ROH Pure Championship</a>.

The match was won by Generation Next, with Shelley and Aries surviving.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">December 26</a>, 2004 at <i>Final Battle 2004</i>, Shelley and Strong were defeated by CM Punk and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Corino_f8c2.html" title="Steve Corino">Steve Corino</a>. Following the match, Aries came to the ring and demanded that Shelley step-down as leader. After Shelley refused, he was attacked by Aries and Strong.</p>
<p>Shelley feuded with Generation Next throughout early 2005, unsuccessfully challenging Aries for the <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_World_Championship_bb9c.html" title="ROH World Championship">ROH World Championship</a> at <i>Manhattan Mayhem</i> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">July 23</a> at <i>The Homecoming</i>, he joined <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Embassy_%28professional_wrestling%29_7646.html" title="The Embassy (professional wrestling)">The Embassy</a></b>, a stable controlled by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Nana_30ed.html" title="Prince Nana">Prince Nana</a> and then competed in a tag team match which saw Austin Aries &amp; Roderick Strong against Shelley and a mystery partner, who many fans thought would be a newcomer to ROH or someone who was making waves in professional wrestling at that time. The fans were disappointed to find that upon joining The Embassy, his partner was that of Fast Eddie Vegas. The Embassy feuded with Generation Next throughout the remainder of 2005, with Generation Next defeating The Embassy in an eight-man elimination <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_cage_match.html" title="Steel cage match">steel cage match</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a> at <i>Steel Cage Warfare</i>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">January 14</a>, 2006 in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Shelley and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Rave_d18f.html" title="Jimmy Rave">Jimmy Rave</a> attacked ROH World champion <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Danielson_88a1.html" title="Bryan Danielson">Bryan Danielson</a> after a successful title defense. During the attack, Shelley performed a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques.html#Shiranui" title="Professional wrestling aerial techniques">Sliced Bread #2</a> on Danielson, claiming it was his "<a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptonite.html" title="Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a>" as Danielson's long-time rival, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Kendrick_9ba5.html" title="Brian Kendrick">Spanky</a>, utilizes the move as his signature finisher. Shelley was set to face Danielson at the 4th Anniversary Show, but lost the title shot after Jimmy Rave used his title shot earned at the <i>Tag Wars 2006</i>. Shelley used his title shot and faced Bryan Danielson for the ROH World title on March 11th in Philadelphia at Arena Warfare, but came up short. During that match Shelley became enraged with some fans sitting at ringside who had began a "boring" chant. Shelley grabbed the microphone and went so far as daring an overweight fan to get in the ring with him by saying "Listen here tons of fun, If you think you can do any better, then get your fat ass in the ring!", which resulted in the fans responding in a "Let's go fat guy" chant and Shelley responding with "You know what that makes you sir? A pussy". Shelley wrestled sporadically in ROH for another few months and made his final appearance on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_24.html" title="June 24">June 24</a>, 2006 managing Jimmy Rave and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_Kennedy_III_8aa8.html" title="Conrad Kennedy III">Conrad Kennedy III</a> in a losing effort against the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briscoe_Brothers_cddb.html" title="Briscoe Brothers">Briscoe Brothers</a> before leaving the company on June 26, 2006.</p>
<p>He has since returned to ROH along with Chris Sabin, attacking Jay Briscoe after he won the ROH tag titles at the March 30th Detroit show. Shelley and Sabin then challenged The Briscoes for a shot at the tag titles on the April 28th show in Chicago.</p>

He then entered the <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_2005_Chris_Candido_Memorial_Tag_Team_Tournament_5240.html" title="TNA 2005 Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament">TNA 2005 Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament</a> with <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Waltman_ebf9.html" title="Sean Waltman">Sean Waltman</a> as his tag team partner, and won the tournament by defeating Shocker and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Sabin_447f.html" title="Chris Sabin">Chris Sabin</a> in the finals on the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a> episode of <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Impact%21_c56e.html" title="TNA Impact!">TNA iMPACT!</a>. As a result of their victory, Waltman and Shelley were granted a shot at the <a href="../../../n/w/a/NWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship_56ee.html" title="NWA World Tag Team Championship">NWA World Tag Team Championships</a> in a four way tag team bout at <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Unbreakable_794c.html" title="TNA Unbreakable">TNA Unbreakable</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>. After Waltman <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-show.html" title="No-show">no-showed</a> the event, Shelley was left without a partner, but opted to wrestle alone. He was doubled teamed by <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Canada_%28TNA%29_d944.html" title="Team Canada (TNA)">Team Canada</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Young_%28wrestler%29_6c33.html" title="Eric Young (wrestler)">Eric Young</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Ralphs_4816.html" title="Alastair Ralphs">A-1</a>) for much of the match until <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Candito_7590.html" title="John Candito">Johnny Candido</a>, the brother of Chris Candido, climbed on to the apron and accepted Shelley's tag. However, Candido was pinned by Young shortly thereafter, with Shelley being eliminated from the match as a result.</p>
<p>Throughout late-2005, Shelley wrestled in the X Division as a <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heel</a>, facing <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries</a> on several occasions. In November 2005 he introduced a <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimmick_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Gimmick (professional wrestling)">gimmick</a> that saw him bring a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camcorder.html" title="Camcorder">camcorder</a> (the "Shelley-cam") to ringside in order to film matches to study later for strategic purposes (in reality, Shelley owns over 200 professional wrestling <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">videotapes</a>). In late 2005, he began teaming with his former <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Next_2df2.html" title="Generation Next">Generation Next</a> teammates <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_Strong_0009.html" title="Roderick Strong">Roderick Strong</a>, feuding with established X-Division babyfaces, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonjay_Dutt_6a63.html" title="Sonjay Dutt">Sonjay Dutt</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Sabin_447f.html" title="Chris Sabin">Chris Sabin</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Bentley_3628.html" title="Matt Bentley">Matt Bentley</a> and demanding bigger roles in the company from road agent <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Lynn_3135.html" title="Jerry Lynn">Jerry Lynn</a> which lead to a series of matches in which the reformed Generation Next came out on top.</p>
<p>In early 2006, Shelley was recruited by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Jarrett_f8e9.html" title="Jeff Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> to obtain candid video footage of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Gayda_8ad1.html" title="Jackie Gayda">Jackie Gayda</a> for the purposes of blackmail. Shelley went on to create the fictional enterprise "<b><a href="../../../p/a/p/Paparazzi_Productions_92aa.html" title="Paparazzi Productions">Paparazzi Productions</a></b>" and obtain footage of <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting_%28wrestler%29.html" title="Sting (wrestler)">Sting</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Reso_28ce.html" title="Jason Reso">Christian Cage</a> and their respective families for the purposes of intimidation. Throughout April and May 2006, Shelley wrestled in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_World_X_Cup_Tournament_207f.html" title="2006 World X Cup Tournament">2006 World X Cup Tournament</a> as a member of the victorious <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_USA_2bfe.html" title="Team USA">Team USA</a>. In May, he interviewed <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Nash_51a6.html" title="Kevin Nash">Kevin Nash</a>, and aligned himself with Nash after Nash announced that he intended to destroy the X Division.</p>
<p>Since then the two have done several well-received comedy vignettes (some exclusive to <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>) mostly focusing on their feud with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Sabin_447f.html" title="Chris Sabin">Chris Sabin</a>. At <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Slammiversary_%282006%29_9a96.html" title="TNA Slammiversary (2006)">Slammiversary 2006</a>, Shelley helped Nash defeat Sabin. Earlier Shelley had been ranked fifth in the X-Division after being the second person eliminated in a 6-man contender's match. In a post-match interview with Nash, Shelley claimed there was "ten guys, twenty guys- some of them had knives. I think I spotted a couple gats... guns."</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> Shelley teamed up with Kevin Nash to face Chris Sabin and Jay Lethal. The two lost the bout, but would get the last laugh by Shelley, Nash, and Johnny Devine.</p>
<p>At <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Hard_Justice_34b8.html#2006" title="TNA Hard Justice">Hard Justice 2006</a>, Alex Shelley would replace Nash in a match. Shelley and Devine would move into the tag team division until they lost a Triple Chance Tag Team Battle Royal at <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_No_Surrender_4392.html#2006" title="TNA No Surrender">No Surrender 2006</a>. Shelley also appeared in Kevin Nash's Open Invational X Division Battle Royal at <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Bound_for_Glory_%282006%29_75b3.html" title="TNA Bound for Glory (2006)">Bound for Glory 2006</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. He lost the match to Austin Starr.</p>
<p>Since the creation of <b><a href="../../../p/a/p/Paparazzi_Productions_92aa.html" title="Paparazzi Productions">Paparazzi Productions</a></b>, Shelley recruited former <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Canada_%28TNA%29_d944.html" title="Team Canada (TNA)">Team Canada</a> member <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Devine_2320.html" title="Johnny Devine">Johnny Devine</a> as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Production_assistant.html" title="Production assistant">production assistant</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Devine_2320.html" title="Johnny Devine">Johnny Devine</a> was later fired by the Paparazzi. Devine has been replaced to the dismay of Shelley by former <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Next_2df2.html" title="Generation Next">Generation Next</a> team mate <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Starr</a> due to Kevin Nash's wishes. Since this, the three were seen backstage on various episodes of Impact in a tournament known as the Paparazzi Championship Series, which he won at <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Final_Resolution_9ca4.html#2007" title="TNA Final Resolution">Final Resolution</a></p>
<p>Afterwards, he would tape two <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayfabe.html" title="Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> attacks by the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_American_Exchange_535c.html" title="Latin American Exchange">Latin American Exchange</a>. One on Brother Rays uncle, another on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Rodz_c6a5.html" title="Johnny Rodz">Johnny Rodz</a>. When he showed the footage of the LAX beatdown on Rodz, he was confronted by <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_Ray_aa46.html" title="Brother Ray">Brother Ray</a>. Before a fight could breakout, the LAX attempted to attack Brother Ray. However, when it seemed Ray had the upper hand, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Nash_51a6.html" title="Kevin Nash">Kevin Nash</a> distracted him. This allowed Shelley to hit him with a <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_blow.html" title="Low blow">low blow</a>. This led to a small feud between Shelley and <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_Boys_4101.html" title="Dudley Boys">Team 3D</a> which was only escalated at the <a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_Destination_X_6486.html#2007" title="TNA Destination X">Destination X 2007</a> ppv. This was because he hit <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_Devon_8233.html" title="Brother Devon">Brother Devon</a> with a <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_camera.html" title="Video camera">video camera</a> and hit him with a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques.html#Frog_splash" title="Professional wrestling aerial techniques">Frog Splash</a> through a table.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Shelley_0181.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Alex Shelley's TNA theme music is an instrumental version of The Fly by U2, but is often confused with "Six Barrel Shotgun" by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, which was his entrance music in ROH at one point. He also used an instrumental version of <i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamonds_from_Sierra_Leone_f9a9.html" title="Diamonds from Sierra Leone">Diamonds from Sierra Leone</a></i> by <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanye_West_f668.html" title="Kanye West">Kanye West</a> while in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Embassy_%28professional_wrestling%29_7646.html" title="The Embassy (professional wrestling)">The Embassy</a>, and currently uses "The Clap" by The Unicorns for UWA Hardcore Wrestling.</li>
<li>Due to Alex Shelley's wrestling prowess and charisma, he has been referred to "The next...", followed by several wrestlers, including <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Jericho_f48a.html" title="Chris Jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Van_Dam_c722.html" title="Rob Van Dam">Rob Van Dam</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawn_Michaels_859c.html" title="Shawn Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a>.</li>
<li>Alex Shelley's favorite wrestlers are <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawn_Michaels_859c.html" title="Shawn Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Jericho_f48a.html" title="Chris Jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reckless_Youth_af7b.html" title="Reckless Youth">Reckless Youth</a>, and <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kaz_Hayashi_103b.html" title="Kaz Hayashi">Kaz Hayashi</a>.</li>
<li>Alex sells a black t-shirt on his website, which features a modified TNA logo that says 'TN@LX', representing "Total Nonstop Alex," which is also one of his patented wrestling maneuvers. The t-shirt includes the line, "Let's make history," a reference to a The International Noise Conspiracy song.</li>
<li>Alex actually hates the orange 'Paparazzi Productions' t-shirt TNA produced for him (which oddly enough became the top selling shirt in TNA at the time). He refused to wear it and was actually told by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Jarrett_f8e9.html" title="Jeff Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> that he had no choice in the matter and he had to wear it.</li>
