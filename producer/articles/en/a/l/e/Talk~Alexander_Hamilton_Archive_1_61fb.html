<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alexander Hamilton removed from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">Wikipedia:Good articles</a></span></h2>
<p>This article was originally written to prove that Hamilton belongs on Mount Rushmore (see comments immediately after this), and it is still a panegyric. Only the Reynolds affair, of Hamilton's several scandals, is even mentioned. The article is also unverifiable, since where each claim is sourced is not mentioned.</p>
<p>Go to the bottom of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_Washington_a222.html" title="Talk:George Washington">Talk:George Washington</a> page and see the ranks for honored Americans. Does Hamilton have a rank anywhere from 20 to 60?? 66.245.115.51 00:17, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hamilton is America. He belongs more on Mount Rushmore than Roosevelt or Jefferson. People want to honor those who are excessively naive and can't accept a prophet.</p>
<p>Until <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> set <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> as pretty much the patron saint of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> was considered as such. In fact his contributions to economics, especially the United States economy, affected the world eventually. Americans live in a Jeffersonian political system with a Hamilton economy. He might not have been one of the most honorable men, but he is extremely important, nonetheless.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hamilton a spy?</span></h2>
<p>"Inventing a Nation" by <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore_Vidal_7281.html" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> repeatedly refers to Hamilton as "British Agent Number 7" and talks repeatedly about him passing significant information to the British during early Presidential administrations. I find the book hard to read and without citations, but a quick scan of the web finds me claims like "Hamilton's diaries were unearthed sometime in the last 20 years and show that he was a paid agent of the British while serving as the US Secretary of the Treasury." and "Hamilton gossiped freely with Beckwith and George Hammond, the first British minister to the United States." I'd like to know more, and either way the web hits suggest if this is false it would be good to mention to debunk.</p>
<p>This stuff is like the diaries of Adolf Hitler that made so much press but turned out to be forgeries. That is my opinion of Mr. Vidal's work based on my historic and political science background. Of course other's disagree, which is why I do not contest the inclusion or allusion to it here on the page at the moment. What can I say? Hamilton is not here to defend himself and has been under attack by the same forces who represented the same opinion at his time namely: free-trade and laizzee faire(sic) advocates who dominate economic opinion today. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 20:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And why the hell is an article in a webzine critical of this very article cited here as a <i>reference</i>? A reference to what? The uncertainty about the year of his birth? That's mentioned on hundred of other sites, and is well-documented. No need to cite this one story. I'm removing it (again). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:48, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The author of that article says "Hamilton himself used, and most contemporary biographers prefer, the latter year" [1757] in giving his date of birth. Don't you suppose Hamilton knew how old he was? Why don't we go with what Hamilton said it was, and refer to the other in a footnote? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 00:38, 2004 Nov 18 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It still is not clear. Having looked through several Hamilton biographies today it appears that most of the more recent ones had 1755 as the year of birth. According to one biographer he gave contradictory accounts of his age at various points in his life: "He himself, mentioning his age in several connections (each time approxiamtely), in effect assigned different years for his birth". He cites a few statements he made, putting his year of birth between 1754 and 1757, including: "...in a communication to the Christiansted newspaper, April 6, 1771, signed 'A.H.', he gave his age as 'about seventeen' (that is, born 1754)" (Mitchell, p.12-13). So it isn't clear, and I think the way we have it is the best for now. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 01:28, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the 1990s version of the encyclopedia Americana whiled Hamilton claimed to be born in 1757 most recent evidence suggests that he was born in 1755.--<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary123_ad90.html" title="User:Gary123">Gary123</a> 8 July 2005 02:17 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the article really only attacked one <i>factual</i> problem (or rather factual controversy not mentioned: uncertainty of his year of birth, which I sort of addressed, but should probably be mentioned specifically (oh yeah, the years he was Sec. of Treasury too, I think; I didn't address that)), and was more of an attack on style and grammar. I did a pretty quick proofread and edit of the article, and there were some pretty egregious grammar, punctuation, captialization, and punctuation problems. Others should probably do the same; my repair was rather cursory. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:36, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Removing the reference is irresponsible. The information is taken from that article, so leave it as a reference. I'm sorry I put it back in without looking here, but the removal of a valid reference is what should face the burden of proof, not its addition. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 17:35, Nov 16, 2004 (UTC)

<p>I removed the following sentence: "General <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wilkinson_614e.html" title="James Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a> had also approached Hamilton repeatedly with plans for <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster_%28settler%29.html" title="Filibuster (settler)">filibuster</a> expeditions along the Spanish frontier." If it's to be mentioned it needs some context. It was previously tacked on to the end of the section on Aaron Burr, and was a glaring non-sequitur. I encourage anyone to expand and re-insert it in an appropriate section. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:04, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Birthyear_question" id="Birthyear_question"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Birthyear question</span></h2>
<p>There's some doubt as to Hamilton's birthyear (see <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html" class="external text" title="http://www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html" rel="nofollow">Robert McHenry's review of Wikipedia</a>). Someone beat me to noting it by a minute or so, but it would be useful if someone could include a new section in the main page noting the sources of the two years.</p>
<p>The text "While the day and month of Hamilton's birth are known, there is some uncertainty as to the year, whether it be 1755 or 1757. Hamilton himself used, and most contemporary biographers prefer, the latter year." in the article was a direct copy and paste from the article at <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html" class="external free" title="http://www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html</a>. Fixed now.</p>
<p>(Someone has reverted this change in wording, perhaps because it was overly verbose and not nearly as elegant as the sentence copied without permission from the critique article. The note still needs to be fixed, therefore.)</p>
<p>That same critique of Wikipedia points out this poor phrasing: "Arguably, he set the path for American economic and military greatness, though the benefits might be argued."</p>

<dd>I wrote the original note about the years in question, using my own phrasing and using a separate source. I guess someone thought a word-for-word copy from the critique article was better, for some reason. I reverted it to my wording, which has the advantage of not having to site the mentioned critical article, which seems a sort of asinine thing to link to. If someone wants to site the primary sources of the years in question then they should go ahead, but there is no point in siting another secondary source for general and widely-accpeted information such as this. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:30, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO McHenry's article is pointless to cite as a reference regarding the birth year discrepency. That article is only tangentially concerned with Hamilton and information about the discrepency in birth years in commonly available. If there is a better source that can be readily cited, that is fine, but IMO if we expect every little detail to be substantiated with a citation, then the list of citations will quickly overwhelm the article. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:51, Nov 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very true. It's ridiculous for an article like this to have only a single reference, and for that reference to be an article that basically says "wikipedia is crap". Of the hundreds of facts mentioned in this article, to list one source (let alone the hundreds that could substantiate the year problem) only for this one fact is dumb.

<dd>It is not pointless. It verifies a contended fact explicitly. Until you have a better source properly formatted to verify the fact, please leave this one in. Then please do go get the primary sources and properly format those. McHenry is a relatively respected source, so his article being anti wikipedia is completely irrelevant. You say you have another source for it, so add that. A note without a citation to a primary or secondary source is nearly useless from the standpoint of verifying the material in wikipedia. Having a well researched and properly cited project is an important goal. Removing references doesn't help a bit.

<p>Usually in situations like this, it's best to just put the more likely year of birth in the first paragraph, and add a footnote about the discrapancy. Either that, or articles would end up becoming something like, "Gracie Allen (born July 26 1895, 1897, 1902 or 1906 ...).--<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFallout_boy_7dea.html" title="User:Fallout boy">Fallout boy</a> 03:42, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources and footnotes</span></h2>
<p>It seems that there is a bit of confusion surrounding the use of footnotes. Let me just point out that footnotes serve two purposes: they can be used to cite sources, and they can be used for further explanation of a point when incorporating it into the main text would be disruptive. The latter is the use here.</p>
<p>Inserting a paragraph between the year of birth and year of death at the beginning of the article would be very disruptive, so an explanation is given at the bottom.</p>
<p>People have been very anxious to cite a source, any source, for this, but such mundane facts as years of birth and death (even when they are not known with 100% certainty) do not need to be cited; one can get this information almost anywhere, and to pick one as <i>the</i> source is pointless.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since McHenry's article is getting fairly wide publicity it makes sense to neutralize his criticism showing that in addition to size and breadth, the wikkipedia also has the advantage in speed over EB and can match it in accuracy. Jjk 21:36, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Furthermore, an encyclopedia article does not attempt to argue a point, and has no thesis; it attempts to convey factual information that is widely accepted (contrarily, if we decided to choose one year as the "correct" year of his birth, we would need a citation). Hence sources are not needed for most general statements. If one wants to mention what sources were used in the writing of this article, then that is fine, but I fear it's a bit late. Unless the users who contributed the bulk of the information in this article want to list them now, there is little anyone else can do. To mention what source <i>may have</i> been used (e.g. the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica) is silly.</p>

<dd>As the discussion here and McHenry's original article all deemed the lack of a citation to be problematic, and the citation of McHenry's article seemed to be also problematic I deliberately looked up Hamilton's birthdate in the 1911 Enc.

(In fact, arbitrarily using the 1911 Britannica for the year dispute is wrong, as it states 1757 as the year of his birth.)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry. I'm not getting the point of this last statement, could you explain why the 1757 date should not be used or whatever it is that you are proposing is wrong with it? I fear I must be missing something obvious. Thanks. (1757 is the date most widely accepted by historians (McHenry) and this citation provides a credible source for that number.)

<dd>My point was that a previous editor used the EB as a source confirming that the year of his birth was uncertain, when, in fact, it says quite the oppsoite, and gives a year without any mention of uncertainy surrounding it. The alteration of the note (which I think may have been your addition) was better, in that it was used only as a source for the 1757 assertion. Still, as R points out below, using a dated EB as a source when many in depth biographies are mentioned just below does seem a bit silly. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:00, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately, until somebody goes and looks it up, (Sincerely, Thank you for offerring to do that below, by the way), we don't if any of the biographies deal with the uncertainty.

<dd>This is one particular fact that is in dispute across sources, and is specifically called into question by a recent article, so it is valuable to cite.

I agree the 1911 Brittanica is not the best reference for the date dispute since it doesn't even reference the dispute. Please put back the properly formatted McHenry citation until primary or better sources are found.

<dd>All facts do not need to be cited. Citing "Alexander Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury" is not the sort of fact that anyone should need to cite. Picking one arbitrary source to mention that is inane. The footnote for such a fact might as well read "1. Every single person on the planet who knows anything about the guy", because, let's face it, it's true. We have tens of thousands of articles on people, and we mention the dates of their births (or approximate dates when the exact date is unknown) without citing sources in every single one of them (maybe there are a handfull of exceptions, I don't know). Are those pages all flawed? I have in my hands the 1957 EB, and about the only times it directly cites a specific source is for direct quotations (which do need citations), although it does have a pretty comprehensive bibliography. So I'll tell you what I'll do. Tomorrow, if I have time, I'll go down to the library and find one of those biographies of Hamilton and I'll bet it will tell exactly what the documents are that give the different dates in question. I'll mention those documents in the footnote, and we'll have a valid and useful citation, as opposed to an arbitrary one that doesn't really explain anything. If someone can beat me to this, that's fine. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:00, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lets leave that citation intact to neutralize the effect of McHenry's criticism until R. fiend gets the better citation installed. We don't know what any of those biographies contain and without any citation at all, all the readers visiting the page because of McHenry's widely publicized criticism will have no reason to disagree with him. This way it is partially neutralized until R. Fiend van put better info in place. Thanks. Jjk 12:44, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, excellent work. I take it those two sources at least you have in front of you? For proper form any articles that have been actually used as references for the material in the article should go into a references section and those that haven't should go in something like a further reading section. So I've created the references section. The 'Biographies' section is a bit misleading because those could either have been used in the article or not. If you have them to refer to or they have in fact been used for material for this article please put them in the references section. And yes, ideally all other important or disputable facts in the article should be similarly cited.

It states that <i>You may wish to revert an article to an earlier version, perhaps because it has been vandalised <b>or material has been added or removed inappropriately.</b></i> I'd say that pretty accurately describes the disagreement over this article. I see no clear consensus here as to what is appropriate in way of citation. Certainly, persistent reversions are a bad thing, but that really has not been much of a problem in this case. Discussion is taking place here and without any clear consensus there is nothing that should preclude anyone from making a good faith edit to the article, so long as it doesn't devolve into an edit war. While you may see the inclusion of a particular citation as appropriate and beneficial, someone else may not share your opinion and feel that it is an inappropriate addition that clearly makes the article worse. So far as I can tell, NO ONE has used the rollback function, which is clearly a tool intended for fighting vandalism, but editing an article to add or remove disputed content is justifiable where there is no clear consensus. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 18:04, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)

Yes the page is not entirely consistent, but are you seriously claiming a properly cited reference makes an article "actively worse"?

<dd>Well, R. fiend has made all this moot (thanks). But what you describe as a "properly cited reference" is IMO anything but that. The McHenry piece was laughable as a serious reference and the 1911 EB really did adequately not address the discrepancy in birth dates. so yes, I very honestly think that addition of either of those citations made the page "actively worse". It was reverted two times!!!! OMG such an outrage! Among the worst edit wars ever seen. (Actually I think it was reverted more than twice, but with many intervening edits.) Give me a break. This never got anywhere near being a serious edit war. And there has been rather civil discussion on the talk page througout. I have not seen any recent edits to this article (aside from some obvious vandalism) that would qualify as not being good faith editing. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 21:01, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Not being a serious edit war doesn't mean it was a needed revert. If it was put in multiple times by different editors it is not likely to be that bad an edit. Besides, the guy was former editor of EB, a generally respected source. He is likely to have a good idea what he is talking about, and as it turns out he was correct. And yes, it is now moot as to the issue of this specific citation, but not for the issue of unneccessary reverts. Again, I mentioned the citation on the talk page as a made it.

<dd>OK, but it was the citation was also removed by multiple editors, so it was not unproblematic. There was discussion on the talk page throughout this episode as far as I can tell. And if you are referring specifically to my reversion of your edit without my making a`specific comment on the talk page first, well I apologize, but I actually don't feel all that guilty about it. I had been monitoring the discussion here and felt that the re-addition of the citation was not warranted based on the discussion at that time (even though to that point I had not actively participated). I did not feel it was necessary for me to jump in with a "me too" when the substantive points had already been expressed. You yourself said you had re-added the citation without first checking the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Alexander_Hamilton&amp;diff=7528703&amp;oldid=7528615" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Alexander_Hamilton&amp;diff=7528703&amp;oldid=7528615" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I agree that it is always helpful to keep wikiquette in mind while editing, but I don't see that anything that transpired here came close to improper wikiquette.

<p>Alexander Hamilton wrote the confession of his own accord. He gave a copy to each James Monroe, Abraham Venable, and Frederick Muhlenberg. Hamilton believed that Monroe was ultimately responsible for leaking the information to the press and never forgave him.</p>
<p><a name="Arguing_before_Congress" id="Arguing_before_Congress"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arguing before Congress</span></h2>
<p>While Hamilton did write up reports, did he really argue them personally before Congress? I have heard Chief Justice William Rehnquist say on C-SPAN that Hamilton was not allowed to argue before Congress, and that this set a precedent that made the American government system significantly different in style from the British system, where cabinet members make speeches before the legislature (e.g., some time ago, then National Security advisor Condolezza Rice nearly refused to testify when called before a Congressional subcommittee inquiry into the September 11th attacks). Also, I've read in the biography by John C. Miller "Portait In Paradox" that at least in the case of his Report on the Public Credit that Hamilton was not allowed to argue his report -- the report was read to Congress instead. The book also says that this established a precedent for future American governments.</p>
<p>I do not know if Hamilton --never-- argued personally before Congress, but perhaps the part that mentions his personal presence on this page could be removed -- it should be sufficient just to say that his reports were magnificent and had tremendous influence, and avoid the question of his personal presence.</p>
<p>Both Hamilton and Jefferson influenced Congress indirectly. Washington let his cabinet do this as a rule and did not originally call them together as a Group. Incidently, it was Madison who coined the phrase "Cabinet". --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 00:20, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hamilton on Currency</span></h2>
<p>This topic has been severely redacted non-neutral editors. There is a current debate over whether Hamilton should be removed from currency for his Federalist beliefs. There is a high profile movement that is attempting to replace Hamilton with Reagan.</p>
<p>As a side note to this issue overall: Though I admire Reagan for his: patriotism, saving Chrysler-Craftsman-Harley/Davdison etc, having the courage to go against free-trade zealot's in his administration-placing quotas on Japanese cars etc., and for helping us to win the Cold War including proposing the still needed SDI; he does not compare to Hamilton who was instrumental in getting the Constitution passed in New York, was a member of the Constitutional Convention, had served with distinction in the Revolution and helped establish the American System philosophy that built this country into the Arsenal of Democracy capable of defeating the Central Powers in WWI and the Imperial Japanese, Fascist Italy, and Nazis Germany in WWII. Thank God we listened to him and the voices of men like Clay, Lincoln, McKinley and so on to become an great Industrial power with the highest standard of living by 1900 of anywhere in the world. Hamilton belongs on Mount Rushmore in my opinion for the work he did to make America the great Middle Class country it became and that is now under attack by the same forces or advocates that opposed him way back when. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 20:44, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Include content from 1911 EB and Making of America?</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me poor Hamilton's article is being redacted to a stub, often for modern political reasons. There is so much public domain material available on his life that it is a shame to see the state of this now. Is anyone else in favor of incorporating public domain material to flesh this article out?</p>
<p>I suppose I am making of mess of it as I hesitate to remove the content of others. Maybe we need a Federal system here with checks and balances to reign in the anarchy.</p>
<p>I do think Hamilton's role as chief advisor to Washington during the Revolutionary War should be mentioned since this had a huge effect on the War. Also, Hamilton's command of French made him a chief liason to the French, who in the Revolutionary War were America's chief ally. Really important things are missing.</p>

<p>Is it just me or does this article restate many of its points almost to a cut and copy effect? For example, "Later he secured a field command, through Washington, and won laurels at Yorktown, where he led the American column in the final assault on the British works. In 1780 he married Elizabeth, daughter of General Philip Schuyler, and thus became allied with one of the most distinguished families in New York." and further down the page "Leaving Washington's staff, Hamilton took command of an infantry regiment that participated in the siege of Yorktown, and led the assault that captured Redoubt #10. After the war he served as a member of the Continental Congress (from 1782 to 1783), and then retired to open his own law office in New York City. He married Elizabeth Schuyler (known as Eliza), heiress of a wealthy and influential New York family, on December 14, 1780"</p>

<p>Wasn't there a rumour going around during Hamilton's lifetime, that he (Hamilton) was a (bastard) son of Washington's? Mightberight/wrong 13:18 (AST), 30 October 2005. No, this is wrong. Washington did however, consider him a surrogate son. Washington came to trust Hamilton more than any other man, siding with him over Jefferson and Madison more than not in the early years of the Republic. Washington even came to rely upon Hamilton to handle his correspondance and the drafting of his Farewell Address upon the end of his 8 year term as President.</p>
<p>That is dishonorable to the Father of our Country and the Father of American economics to call him a bastard child of Washington without evidence. I've heard of no such rumor. Washington was fond of Hamilton and considered him like a son. Hamilton was Aide'de'Camp(sorry on Spelling my weak point) to Washington and grew to know each other during the Revolution or War for American Indepedence. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 00:14, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Alexander Hamilton, 1755–1804, American statesman, b. Nevis, in the West Indies was the illegitimate son of James Hamilton (of a prominent Scottish family) and Rachel Faucett Lavien (daughter of a doctor-planter on Nevis and the estranged wife of a merchant). Orphaned and impoverished at around the age of 12, the brilliant, ambitious youth went to the North American colonies late in 1772 and studied (1773–74) at King's College (now Columbia). In the troubled times leading to the American Revolution, he wrote articles and pamphlets espousing the colonial cause so well that the works were popularly attributed to John Jay." <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/alexanderhamiltonbio.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/alexanderhamiltonbio.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 00:45, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

If you read the report on manufactures its program called for government intervention in the economy to stimulate manufacturing, Bush's system rooted in the policies of free trade and hands' off to business has lead to a situation of decline in manufacturing where our workers cannot compete with low wage China for example. On National Defense, your right.

<p>This is the argument that I posted in the Cfd for my weak keep vote: this is something that a researcher might want to know someday (or even right now). It IS interesting to know the company that Mr. Whittington is in. While there are other ways for researchers to find such information, it's nice to have it in simple category format. Furthermore, removing this article from the category now, with an ongoing Cfd vote, could prejudice the vote, as Mr. Whittington would be the only member of the category otherwise. If the category is kept, it would appropriate to discuss whether to remove Hamilton from it then, but not with an ongoing Cfd vote.

<p>Just letting people know I have closed out the CFD with no consensous. I personally wanted the category gone, but the numbers simply were not there. Sorry folks. Whether this article stays in or out of the category is now up to you folks here on this article. OTOH, I would not be surprised to see the category up for CFD again before too long.

<dd>I would object to such a category. And not just because it makes it sound like the officials may have been acting in, well, official capacity, or at least that's an invited inference. It simply makes no sense to have a category for "shot" or "shooter", since the parties may have been consenting participants in a duel, victims or perpetrators of murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, assault, etc. This is just not a natural category. Its boundaries are ill-defined and we will see constant debates about category membership.

<dd>What was Hamilton's influence. That's an interesting question but Lind is not the patient scholar who can tell us. His "book" consists of excerpts from politicians with a running commentary and little or no regard for the large scholarly literature. Lind could care less about scholarship--he writes polemics full of exaggerations. What was H's influence on Clay and Calhoun? Lind gets Clay wrong and misses Calhoun. Lind misses Gallatin and the debate over the Bank in 1816. He misses Hammond's great book on banks and politics. What was H's influence on Hamilton and the Civil War era? Lind invents an influence where it did not exist. He does that by talking about Hamilton-like ("Hamiltonian") ideas that in fact did not represent an influence by Hamilton himself. Lind picks up (from Huntington) the point that AH was influential on Croly, Roosevelt and Lodge, but misreads the Progressives policy. For example Lind misses Hamilton's influence on banking history, and wants instead to talk about tariffs, a much less important issue in economic history. All in all, he does a mediocre/poor job. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 23:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with some your commentary above. Though, you are right Lind speaks of the Hamiltonian influence based on Hamilton's economic philosophy. To completely discredit Lind, is wrong in my opinion and is based on your POV on economic history. Your statement about tariffs is absolutely misleading and wrong per economic history, especially of the USA. What we are speaking of is Hamilton's influence per banking, per tariff's, per subsidies etc. The three Reports of Hamilton had a major impact US economic thinking - more so than Smith's Wealth of Nations. To deny Hamilton's place in the economic history of the USA is intellectual madness. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 23:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have read many biographies on Hamilton and I would absolutely not classify Hamilton as being <i>Persecuted</i> by James Madison. James Madison was the leader, along with Thomas Jefferson, of the opposition party to the Federalist. Madison was also the leading partner in the writing of the Federalist papers; however, he eventually came to be the leader of the Republican party(Not the same as the modern Republican party founded in the 1850s). Madison and Jefferson, and other adherents to the Republican thinking, did not act as a formal party as we now understand them to be. However, they were undeniably opposed to the Federalist, of which Alexander Hamilton was the unofficial leader.</p>

<dd>Hamilton was a longtime opponent of slavery. Elkins &amp; McKitrick (p 99) write that during the revolution <i>Hamilton and his South Carolinian friend and fellow-aide, John Laurens, both of whom detested slavery, devised a scheme for enrolling South Carolina slaves in the army, and in urging it upon John Jay, thePresident of Congress. Hamilton wrote: "An essential part of the plan is to give them their freedomwith their muskets. This will secure their fidelity, animate their courage,and I believe will have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a door totheir emancipation." The South Carolina legislature, as mighthave been expected, would not hear of it.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Biographer Forrest McDonald [p. 34] says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In one crucial respect, however, his attitude never changed: he always championed liberty and abhorred slavery. Much of what he said about slavery at first was patriotic hyperbole, but beneath the talk about evil ministerial designs lay an intense hostility toward slavery in the more conventional sense. In support of Laurens's plan to recruit several battalions from the slave population in South Carolina, Hamilton wrote a strong letter to Jay, then president of the Continental Congress. Renouncing the bigotry that prevailed in regard to blacks, which "makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience," he argued the egalitarian position that "their natural faculties are probably as good as ours" and the culturally deterministic position that their intellectual shortcomings stemmed only from a "want of cultivation." It was an essential part of Laurens's scheme, he said, "to give them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure their fidelity, animate their courage, and I believe will have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation." Thus from "dictates of humanity and true policy equally," Hamilton was an abolitionist, and on that subject he never wavered. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 21:30, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And Laurens' reasons for doing this are perfectly clear: to secure an army for South Carolina (and a command for himself, but that is a laudable ambition). Freeing the slaves you arm gives them an incentive ro fight on your side; and is invariable in the classical instances, with which both men were familiar.

<dd>As one recent historian notes:
<dl>
<dd>"The Manumission Society was a a "real working organization" it circulated petitions, awarded prizes for tracts which it printed and distributed, sponsored lectures and orations, and, most important of all, exposed violations of the laws against the slave trade by placing watchers to report purchases and to spot ships known to participate in the trade. Its lawyers, such as Hamilton and Burr, processed thirty-six cases of unlawful enslavement as legal counsel for blacks.... Burr, Hamilton, and Jay in organizing "boycotts against merchants and newspaper owners involved in the trade. . . . The Society had a special committee of antislavery militants who visited newspaper offices to remind publishers of the unwisdom of accepting advertisements for the purchase or sale of slaves. Another committee kept a list of persons who either participated in or invested in the slave trade . . . and urged members to boycott anyone listed." [<i>Burr, Hamilton, and Jefferson: A Study in Character</i> by Roger G. Kennedy - Oxford University Press. 2000. page 97-98] <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 00:05, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does he cite any examples of Hamilton actually doing anything, as Mitchell cites for Burr, Sands and "others"? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>In one crucial respect, however, his attitude never changed: he always championed liberty and abhorred slavery. Much of what he said about slavery at first was patriotic hyperbole, but beneath the talk about evil ministerial designs lay an intense hostility toward slavery in the more conventional sense. In support of Laurens's plan to recruit several battalions from the slave population in South Carolina, Hamilton wrote a strong letter to Jay, then president of the Continental Congress. <i>Renouncing the bigotry that prevailed in regard to blacks, which "makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience," he argued the egalitarian position that "their natural faculties are probably as good as ours" and the culturally deterministic position that their intellectual shortcomings stemmed only from a "want of cultivation." It was an essential part of Laurens's scheme, he said, "to give them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure their fidelity, animate their courage, and I believe will have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation." Thus from "dictates of humanity and true policy equally," Hamilton was an abolitionist, and on that subject he never wavered</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The first sentence of this paragraph is mere conjecture; the remainder is selective quotation. For both parts, we should describe points of view, rather than quoting them (especially one-sidedly). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This sentence remains unsourced. If it refers to Laurens' troop, it is redundant, and does not belong in the discussion of the Constitutional Convention.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">What Chernow actually says</span></h4>
<p>Rjensen must be quoting from memory; an always dubious practice. What Chernow actually says about Hamilton's activities at the Manumission Society is as follows, by page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The society was formed Jan. 25, 1785, by nineteen men, of whom Hamilton was not one. He attended the expanded second meeting. (214)</li>
<li>Hamilton was one of the members of a committee (November 1785) that proposed that the society themselves gradually emancipate their slaves, mostly between seven and thirty-five years thereafter; Hamilton's share in the report is unclear, although Chernow does not let this stop him calling it Hamilton's. (The general meeting voted it down anyway.) 215</li>
<li>He was elected to the standing committee to lobby for an end to the slave <i>trade</i> out of New York. This is the only mention of office within the Society. 215</li>
<li>He signed the petition against the slave trade (March 1786). So did most of New York politics, including Federalists and anti-Federalists alike. 216</li>
<li>He attended a meeting of the society in August 1787 and one in 1788. 239</li>
<li>He was on retainer as lawyer for the society from 1788 until his death 239, 581</li>
<li>He was mentioned by the Society as buying a slave for his sister-in-law. 581</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these slender materials, the text has erected the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>He opposed slavery and as as secretary of the Society for the Promotion of the Manumission of Slaves was one of the three or fourn most prominent Founding Fathers in the abolitionist movement.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This comprises a partial truth and several falsehoods. He was not secretary. It is fairly clear that not all members of the Society were abolitionists, as opposed to meliorists. He was not third or fourth most prominent even <i>in New York</i>; Jay, Burr, Troup, and Smith were clearly before him, even by Chernow's account. There were strong and successful abolitionist movements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, which included Franklin and Adams.<a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:29, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is the wiki spirit. The claim of fact about the Manumission Society is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hamilton <i>was among more than thirty New Yorkers who, in January 1785, formed the New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them as Have Been,or May be Liberated. With John Jay as its president and Hamilton as secretary, this organization sought to end slavery</i> ... and so on, about the activities of the Society.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not an independent source, as its notes demonstrate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It cites Brookhiser, p.176 (<i>rectius</i> 175-6)
<ul>
<li>Brookhiser calls Hamilton "chairman of the Ways and Means Committee" which reported that the society should free their own slaves. This is the special committee of November 1785 above, which Chernow says not only had its report rejected, but was summarily dissolved.
<ul>
<li>Chernow also mentions "ways and means", IIRC not capped.</li>
<li>Reading Brookhiser alone, the translation to "secretary", while unwarranted, would not be unreasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brookhiser, like Horton, has missed Chernow's first meeting. This "founding" meeting is Chernow's second meeting, as the numbers in attendance show. Brookhiser is more precise, and says Hamilton + 31. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 23:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Horton's other points of fact seem to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hamilton grew up among slaves.</li>
<li>Hamilton denounced George III's government of the Colonies as slavery.</li>
<li>He regarded slavery as evil.</li>
<li>He argued that the capacity of blacks was equal to whites</li>
<li>he opposed the colonization of freedmen.</li>
<li>He supported relations with Haiti.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do these make an abolitionist? Horton himself remarks that he shared #3 with Jefferson; IIRC also 1,2, and in due course 4. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:25, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Madison on debts 1790</span></h2>
<p>Madison said the people who took government paper during the war deserved 100% repayment, and people who later bought the paper at a discount (say 12%) should be repaid not 100% but the discounted price of 12c. Hamilton responded that it was fraud to repay your debts at 12 cents when you could pay 100%. Here's Madison's key letter:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Madison To Edmund Pendleton. NEW YORK, March 4, 1790. "The House of Representatives has been chiefly employed of late on the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.... The plan which it proposes is in general well-digested, and illustrated and supported by very able reasoning. It has not, however, met with universal concurrence in every part. I have myself been of the number who could not suppress objections. I have not been able to persuade myself that the transactions between the United States and those whose services were most instrumental in saving their country did, in fact, extinguish the claims of the latter on the justice of the former; or that there must not be something radically wrong in suffering those who rendered a bona fide consideration to lose 7/8 of their dues, and those who have no particular merit towards their country to gain 7 or 8 times as much as they advanced. In pursuance of this view of the subject, a proposition was made for redressing, in some degree, the inequality. After much discussion, a large majority was in the negative." <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:49, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Well, I should not edit from memory either.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, this is another exercise in selective quotation.
<ul>
<li>It dates from <i>March 1790</i>; and there was a period when everybody, <i>including Jefferson</i>, approved Hamilton's plans. Quotes from this honeymoon do not represent the grounds and nature of Madison's opposition, nor Jefferson's.</li>

</li>
<li>I trust that when I return to this sentence, it will no longer suggest that only the Jeffersonians could be seen as acting in a sectional interest.</li>

<dd>Why do Wikipedians have to make such leaps of illogic? The world is not divided into those who worship &lt;fill in name of person&gt; and those who hate &lt;fill in name of person&gt;. Frankly, I am getting quite weary of people who cannot envision good-faith reasons for disagreement. Do you have evidence that Septentionalis is actually in favor of any form of slavery, or are you just lashing out in frustration in response to his going over-the-top with "whitewash"? On this page, he has argued that Hamilton was too wishy-washy to be termed an "abolitionist" -- hardly a pro-slavery stance. As for your edits, Horton (the one source that is FUTON) does not support all of your glowing language, such as the comparison of Hamilton to other Founders. I will reserve judgment until I get a chance to hit the library on the weekend of the 4th and check other sources.
