<p>Alex Rider is described as a strikingly good-looking 14-year-old <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy.html" title="Boy">boy</a>, with light fair hair that hangs in strands, and a handsome slender face that "would attract plenty of girls". Alex has serious dark-brown eyes and a slightly hard, narrow mouth.</p>
<p>Alex is well-built and slim, and has a suntan. He is very fit, being described as having "the body of an athlete"<a href="http://syndetics.com/index.aspx?isbn=0399236201/DBCHAPTER.HTML&amp;client=kitcp&amp;type=rn12" class="external autonumber" title="http://syndetics.com/index.aspx?isbn=0399236201/DBCHAPTER.HTML&amp;client=kitcp&amp;type=rn12" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Alex is of medium height but quite tall for his age.</p>
<p>Alex wears mostly casual clothing, and often wears a wooden bead necklace.</p>
<p>Towards the later novels, though he stays fourteen throughout the series, Alex is described as looking older - this being due to pain endured by him on his missions, and difficult life since the death of his uncle.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that Alex was raised in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, he speaks with an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_accent.html" title="English accent">English accent</a>. He is generally polite and well-mannered, having been raised in high class.</p>
<p>Alex has a rather dry <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sense_of_humour.html" title="Sense of humour">sense of humour</a>, with a tendency to make jokes during difficult situations, and also to mock the flaws of his enemies and their actions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Rider_%28character%29_b936.html" title="Edit section: Alex's background and personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alex's background and personal life</span></h2>
<p>Alexander Rider was born on 13th February 1987, in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_London_e74d.html" title="West London">West London</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, to John Rider, an MI6 agent, and Helen Rider, a <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse.html" title="Nurse">nurse</a> working in <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiology.html" title="Radiology">radiology</a>.</p>
<p>When Alex was a baby, his mother and father were killed by Scorpia in a bombing after an aeroplane had landed. Fortunately, Alex was not on the aeroplane (though he was meant to be at the time); he had an ear infection and stayed behind with a nanny. Alex's paternal uncle, Ian Rider, raised Alex after his parents died.</p>
<p>Alex has become quite independent in his character as a result of having no parents, and his uncle Ian's long absences. Ian and Alex were very close, and when Ian was home they did practically everything together.</p>
<p>Ian Rider often took Alex around the world to educate him about other cultures. Alex has lived abroad, once spending the best part of a year living in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and he has also stayed in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marais.html" title="Marais">Marais</a> district of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.</p>
<p>Because Alex's parents and uncle have died, his former <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housekeeper.html" title="Housekeeper">housekeeper</a>/<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babysitter.html" title="Babysitter">babysitter</a> (now his new <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_guardian.html" title="Legal guardian">guardian</a>), <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Starbright_8de0.html" title="Jack Starbright">Jack Starbright</a>, takes care of him.</p>
<p>Alex currently lives in Chelsea, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, with Jack Starbright. He attends Brookland <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comprehensive_School_19dd.html" title="Comprehensive School">Comprehensive School</a> and is now in year 9 of secondary school (third year of high school). Alex has a friend in this school named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_%28Alex_Rider%29_a9ea.html" title="List of characters (Alex Rider)">Tom Harris</a> who finds out about his MI6 life. But unlike Sabina Pleasure, Tom is very supportive of Alex and covers for him whenever he needs it.</p>
<p>Alex has been raised in a somewhat different environment than most other boys his age. As a result, he tends not to relate much to his peers, and does not have many friends at his school, apart from Tom Harris. But Alex does not mind this, as he is not the type to hunger for popularity.</p>
<p>Before Alex was forced to join MI6, he wanted to be a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">footballer</a>, but now is unsure of what he wants to do when he graduates from school. He still does not express interest whatsoever in following his father's (and uncle's) footsteps in becoming a full-time MI6 agent.</p>

<p>The person Alex has had the most time with is Jack Starbright, his uncle Ian always having been away on business. Alex met Jack when she came from America under employment of his uncle as a housekeeper and babysitter for Alex, who was seven years old at the time. She has known Alex for seven years. After Ian died, Jack became Alex's guardian. Jack is by far Alex's closest friend, and even though it was originally her job to care for Alex, they have grown attached and their relationship has become very personal. However, as Alex's MI6 life starts to take a toll on him, it also places somewhat of a strain on their relationship - Jack is always very worried and upset that Alex's life is constantly being put in danger.</p>

<p>Alex met Sabina at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships and they quickly became good friends. Sabina soon became suspicious when Alex had to leave the Championships early, and more so when Sabina saves his life and then he disappears for weeks on a mission. Alex's constant disappearances place a real difficulty on their relationship, and when Sabina finally finds out the truth about Alex when they are kidnapped, things turn out differently for them. Sabina soon leaves Britain to live in America. She has kissed him twice and shows more romantic feelings for him.</p>

<p>Alex normally goes to Brookland School in London, England, but his education has been interrupted several times for MI6 missions.</p>
<p>From what Alex's hobbies are, it is easy to tell what this favourite school subjects would be: <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_Education_42b7.html" title="Physical Education">Physical Education</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">Language</a> would be among them.</p>
<p>The school secretary, Jane Bedfordshire, has always had a soft spot for Alex. In the British version of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpia.html" title="Scorpia">Scorpia</a>, while the students were on excursion to <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, Alex recovered Miss Bedfordshire's <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handbag.html" title="Handbag">handbag</a> after it was stolen.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpia.html" title="Scorpia">Scorpia</a>, Alex receives a <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutor.html" title="Tutor">tutor</a>, Mr. Grey, to help him catch up with the schoolwork he missed while on errands for <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a>. He eventually takes Alex on the school trip to <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, where Alex attempts to find Scorpia.</p>
<p>However, Alex ends up in a bad situation in Venice and finds himself unable to return to Mr. Grey and the other students. This ultimately makes Mr. Grey very worried about Alex, as well as suspicious, no more so than when they had to return to England without him. When Alex eventually returns to school, Mr. Grey does not talk to Alex and is wary around him.</p>
<p>Alex's school life suffers quite a lot from his life as a spy and it's constant interferences.</p>

<p>Alex is fluent in several languages - as well as his native <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, he speaks fluent <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>.

<p>While on a trip to <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, Alex learnt the "art" of <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickpocketing.html" title="Pickpocketing">pickpocketing</a> from his uncle. He puts this skill to use when he needs a special persons' ticket to a conference to investigate Damian Cray in <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Strike_a7f0.html" title="Eagle Strike">Eagle Strike</a>.</p>

<p>After Alex's uncle was killed in strange circumstances, Alex wanted to investigate the matter. He researched the breaker's yard where his uncle's car was going to be crushed, and he narrowly escaped because of his wits and talent. <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a> had a hidden camera on Alex during this incident, and were curious about him. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Alex_Rider_characters_8643.html" title="List of Alex Rider characters">Crawley</a>, MI6's messenger, phoned Alex and invited him to talk about his position since Ian Rider was dead. Alex agrees, but is curious to look in his uncle's office in the building (which is locked), and he climbs out of a 17<sup>th</sup> story window and talentedly maneuvres to the office window to do that. It is this that interests Blunt into making Alex an agent.</p>
<p>Alex found and read his uncle's work documents. He was deeply shocked by what he found out.</p>
<p>It turned out that Ian Rider was not a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banker.html" title="Banker">banker</a> as Jack and Alex originally believed. He was an agent for MI6, and was killed on his last mission.</p>
<p>By encouraging Alex's hobbies, Ian Rider had trained Alex his whole life to be his successor. Upon realising this, Alex is highly reluctant.</p>
<p>Alex does not want to be an agent for MI6, in fact, initially he flatly refuses. But Blunt tells him that his <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_guardian.html" title="Legal guardian">legal guardian</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Starbright_8de0.html" title="Jack Starbright">Jack Starbright</a> will be deported and Alex sent to an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution.html" title="Institution">institution</a> if he does not cooperate. Alex does not want this for Jack or himself, so reluctantly he agrees. He is sent to a training camp to prepare for his first mission.</p>

<p>As an MI6 agent (as unwilling as he is) Alex has been sent on various missions, all notably within one year, and these have had an impact on him in various ways. They are:</p>

<p>After Alex finishes training with the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Air_Service_a80c.html" title="Special Air Service">SAS</a>, he is sent to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_England_5122.html" title="South England">South England</a> to investigate a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> multi billionaire, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_Sayle_a37d.html" title="Herod Sayle">Herod Sayle</a>, who has invented a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> called Stormbreaker.

<p>Alex's cover is eventually blown, and Sayle, now aware of what Alex is doing at his estate, keeps Alex tied to a chair in his office - rendering him helpless to thwart Sayle's plans to destroy the children of Britain by pressing a button at the Science Museum that will activate a lethal virus in the Stormbreaker computers.</p>
<p>Alex manages to escape using the gadgets Smithers gave him, and his mission is a success - Alex bursts into the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Museum_59d5.html" title="Science Museum">Science Museum</a> and shoots the activation button.</p>
<p>Sayle attempts to take revenge on Alex after the mission. As Alex is walking out of MI6 headquarters, he is kidnapped by Sayle and taken to a helipad, where Sayle tries to shoot him, but Yassen Gregorovich arrives and shoots Sayle, saving Alex's life.</p>

<p>After the events of Stormbreaker, Alex is back at school. But one day he finds a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_dealer.html" title="Drug dealer">drug dealer</a> near his school and follows him, eventually using a <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crane_%28machine%29.html" title="Crane (machine)">crane</a> to destroy the drug dealer's supplies. This leads on to Alex's next mission.</p>
<p>Alex is sent to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Alps_e770.html" title="French Alps">French Alps</a> to Point Blanc Academy, a proclaimed school for misbehaving wealthy boys, to investigate the supposed head teacher of the school, Dr. Grief. Alex goes undercover as Alex Friend, rebellious son of Sir David Friend. For his cover, he has to dress and behave completely different - he has his ear pierced, a different hairstyle, and different clothes. To reinforce his cover, Alex pretends to drink <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">gin</a> when he first arrives in the Point Blanc hotel, knowing that there are surveillance cameras monitoring him.</p>
<p>Alex is dining in the hotel, when he realises he has been drugged - his drink has been spiked. Alex staggers out to his hotel room where he collapses. He is transported to a laboratory where doctors strip him of his clothing and examine every inch of him, with the intention of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloning.html" title="Cloning">cloning</a> him. When Alex wakes up, it seems nothing has happened - but after this, Alex finds that Point Blanc Academy is not what it claims to be, and is a threat to the future of the world.</p>
<p>When Dr. Grief finds out that Alex is investigating him, he arranges for Alex to be dissected alive in a biology class. Alex manages to escape using the gadgets Smithers gave him, including an exploding earring.</p>
<p>After this mission is successful, Alex returns home, but his relief is short-lived. He finds out that Dr. Grief and his staff managed to create a clone of Alex after he had been drugged at the hotel - the clone is completely identical to Alex, apart from his voice. The two Alexes have a showdown in Alex's school.</p>

<p>Sometime after <i>Point Blanck</i>, Alex is playing <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> when he unexpectedly encounters Crawley. He tells Alex about how MI6 expects the Wimbledon Tennis Championships are being sabotaged. Alex is soon sent to the Championships undercover as a <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballboy.html" title="Ballboy">ballboy</a>. It is here that he meets <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Alex_Rider_characters_8643.html" title="List of Alex Rider characters">Sabina Pleasure</a>.</p>
<p>A Big Circle (<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_people.html" title="Chinese people">Chinese</a> gang) assassin finds out Alex is investigating the games, and unsuccessfully attempts to kill him. Alex is almost killed again by another assassin later when he is on a surfing holiday with Sabina in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> - Alex rides the "Cribber" wave on <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fistral_Beach_d7d2.html" title="Fistral Beach">Fistral Beach</a>, when the assassin attempts to run him over with a <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_ski.html" title="Jet ski">jet ski</a>. Although he escapes the gang member, he cannot escape the relentless tide of the Cribber. Alex drowns and stops breathing, but Sabina does <a href="../../../c/p/r/CPR_4e3f.html" title="CPR">CPR</a> on Alex to resuscitate him, after finding him <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconsciousness.html" title="Unconsciousness">unconscious</a> in the water.</p>
<p>Alex spends five days recovering in <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> after his near-drowning. To escape the Big Circle, Alex leaves <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> temporarily. MI6 sends him to Skeleton Key, an island near <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, to investigate General Alexei Sarov, a wealthy Russian who lives on the island. Alex goes undercover as Alex Gardiner - an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> boy supposedly visiting on holiday. Two <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> agents accompany him, undercover as his "parents", though both are soon killed.</p>
<p>Alex's cover is blown, and he becomes a prisoner in Skeleton Key, kept against his will by Sarov. Alex must find a way to escape before Sarov puts his threatening plan to action. Sarov also develops twisted, sentimental feelings for Alex. He tells Alex he wants to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adopt.html" title="Adopt">adopt</a> him, as Alex reminds him of his deceased son. When Alex refuses, claiming he would rather be dead than have Sarov as a father, he shoots himself in front of Alex. Alex is taken to hospital in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> by Russian police and eventually back to England.</p>
<p>Alex is affected deeply by the events of this mission. He suffers such <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> that even Jack Starbright can not console him - he snaps angrily at her when she attempts to get him to see a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor.html" title="Doctor">doctor</a>, and her attempts to uplift him are not successful. But Alex soon encounters Sabina Pleasure again, who invites him on holiday to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.</p>

<p>Alex is on holiday with Sabina Pleasure in the south of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> when he sees Yassen Gregorovich, the assassin who killed his uncle. This makes Alex very wary and no longer able to enjoy the holiday. Soon their holiday home is destroyed by a bomb, injuring Sabina's father. Alex is sure Yassen was involved, so he investigates.</p>
<p>When Yassen finds out, he tests Alex's skills by forcing him into a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullfight.html" title="Bullfight">bullfight</a>. Alex is forced to wear a <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matador.html" title="Matador">matador</a> costume and endure a terrifying ordeal from a bull, all of this in public. Alex eventually succeeds, and manages to escape Yassen and his accomplices with only minor injuries, before being safely returned to England.</p>
<p>During this, Alex finds out that Yassen's mobile phone has the number of Damian Cray, a singer and anti-drugs campaigner. He suspects Damian Cray was also involved in the holiday house incident. Alex, accompanied by Jack Starbright, travels from France to the Netherlands investigating Damian Cray.</p>
<p>Alex acquires a ticket to a conference Cray is attending, where Cray introduces his new <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_console.html" title="Game console">game console</a>, the Gameslayer. Alex is the only teenager in the conference, so he is ushered onto the stage and made to play the Gameslayer. When Alex is starting to beat the game, Cray cheats him into a loss by pulling his arm away.</p>
<p>Alex continues to investigate Cray when suddenly Cray finds out what Alex is doing. Alex is captured and forced to endure a real-life replica of the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> Cray created from his Gameslayer, and is nearly killed - he barely manages to escape.</p>
<p>Alex does not go undercover in this installment.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Rider_%28character%29_b936.html" title="Edit section: Scorpia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i><b><a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpia.html" title="Scorpia">Scorpia</a></b></i></span></h4>
<p>Alex has been told by a now-dead Yassen Gregorovich to go to <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> to find "Scorpia" so he can find his "destiny". He has also found out that Yassen once worked with Alex's father. Alex is confused and unhappy about this, as he does not know what Scorpia is, or what it has to do with him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jack Starbright has expressed worry over Alex's schooling - concerned about Alex's progress due to the constant interruptions of his missions, Jack hires a tutor for a reluctant Alex. This really annoys Alex, as he has to work very hard in order to catch up.</p>
<p>Alex finds out about the school trip to Venice, and he attends, hoping to find Scorpia. He separates from the other students, and his friend Tom covers for him as he investigates.</p>
<p>When Alex eventually finds Scorpia, he discovers it is an organisation his father worked for, and joins them without telling MI6. Alex does this because he wants revenge against MI6 for all of the things they put him through. His first mission is to kill Mrs Jones, the head deputy of Special Operations.</p>
<p>While temporarily working for Scorpia, Alex goes undercover as a pizza delivery boy while infiltrating Mrs Jones's apartment. He does not succeed, and realising that Scorpia are attempting to use him against MI6, Alex goes back to MI6 and does a mission to investigate Scorpia for them. This mission is a success.</p>
<p>Upon his return from the mission, Alex finds out that his father was not an assassin; he worked for MI6 undercover as an assassin, and that it was Scorpia that killed Alex's parents.</p>
<p>As he is walking out of MI6's building, Alex is about to phone <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Starbright_8de0.html" title="Jack Starbright">Jack Starbright</a> and ask her to go out with him - when he is shot in the chest by a Scorpia assassin. Alex is rendered unable to breathe. He sees his deceased mother and father, having a <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near-death_experience.html" title="Near-death experience">near-death experience</a>, before losing consciousness.</p>

<p>Alex is in <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> after the events of Scorpia. When a group of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecoterrorist.html" title="Ecoterrorist">ecoterrorist</a> kidnappers known as Force Three target Paul Drevin, the boy next door to him, they <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidnap.html" title="Kidnap">kidnap</a> Alex instead after he switches the room numbers. Alex eventually manages to escape.</p>
<p>Alex returns home with Jack Starbright after eleven days in the hospital, to find out that Jack is angry with him; she loves him and nearly lost him only for him to be nearly killed again, and fears that next time he may not make it. Alex assures her it will not happen again and tells her how much she means to him - only for there to be a phone call from multimillionaire Nikolei Drevin, Paul Drevin's father, inviting Alex to stay with him and his son out of gratitude for Alex's bravery, or so it would appear.</p>
<p>Alex accepts, only to discover that Drevin is not the man he originally seemed to be - Alex finds out that Drevin planned his own son's attempted kidnapping and even his attempted <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutilation.html" title="Mutilation">mutilation</a> for his own ends. When Drevin suspects Alex of trying to intervene with his plans (due to eventually finding out about his MI6 life) he locks Alex up.</p>
<p>After an ordeal, Alex escapes from Drevin, and then has to do another mission for the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> -to infiltrate Ark Angel, a hotel located just <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_space.html" title="Outer space">outside Earth</a>, as Drevin has planted a bomb there that will destroy <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> (where Jack Starbright is staying to visit her parents) unless it is desposed of as quickly as possible... And Alex is the only one that can fit in the small <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probe.html" title="Probe">probe</a>, therefore the only one who can carry out the mission. Resulting from that is not only that an entire city is prevented from being destroyed, but also a world record is broken: Alex Rider becomes the youngest person to visit space.</p>
<p>When Alex has gotten rid of the bomb's threat, he cannot resist taking a look at Earth as it is seen from outside it in space. Alex knows it is an experience he will never forget.</p>
<p>After this mission is complete, Alex lands in the water near <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>

<p>In the 2006 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormbreaker_%28film%29.html" title="Stormbreaker (film)">Stormbreaker</a> film directed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Sax_4446.html" title="Geoffrey Sax">Geoffrey Sax</a>, Alex Rider is played by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Pettyfer_783b.html" title="Alex Pettyfer">Alex Pettyfer</a>, a rising <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a>. Pettyfer was chosen from 500 hopefuls for the role of Alex.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Horowitz_55f8.html" title="Anthony Horowitz">Anthony Horowitz</a>, who was the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scriptwriter.html" title="Scriptwriter">scriptwriter</a> for the film as well as the author of the novels, recommended Pettyfer to the casting director to play Alex Rider after seeing him in <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Brown%27s_Schooldays_a0bf.html" title="Tom Brown's Schooldays">Tom Brown's Schooldays</a>. Horowitz gave Pettyfer intense guidance on becoming the character of Alex Rider, expressing him and bringing his athletic talents, intellect and charm to the screen.</p>
<p>The role of Alex Rider was said to be the most physically demanding ever taken by a child actor. Pettyfer undertook <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_arts.html" title="Martial arts">martial arts</a> training with <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> martial arts choreographer <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donnie_Yen_917d.html" title="Donnie Yen">Donnie Yen</a>, as well as horseback riding.
