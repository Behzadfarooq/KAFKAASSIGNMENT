<p>In the spring of 327 BCE, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian.html" title="Macedonian">Macedonian</a> conqueror crossed <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindukush.html" title="Hindukush">Hindukush</a> and was on the road to the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus.html" title="Indus">Indus</a>.

<p>At Nikaia, near modern Jallabad, Alexander divided his army into two parts, one under Hepaistion and Perdikkas was ordered to proceed through <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> to <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhara.html" title="Gandhara">Gandhara</a> and second part of which Alexander personally took command, and which included the select force of shield-bearing guards, foot-companions, archers, Agrianians and horse-javelin-men, led them against the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja.html" title="Kamboja">Kamboja</a> <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">clans</a>—the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspasios.html" title="Aspasios">Aspasios</a> of <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunar_Valley_7f9d.html" title="Kunar Valley">Kunar</a>/Alishang <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley.html" title="Valley">valleys</a>, the Guraeans of the Guraeus (<a href="../../../p/a/n/Panjkora.html" title="Panjkora">Panjkora</a>) valley and the Assakenois of the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swat_%28Pakistan%29_6165.html" title="Swat (Pakistan)">Swat</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/n/Buner.html" title="Buner">Buner</a> valleys.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander%27s_Conflict_with_the_Kambojas_e297.html" title="Edit section: Battle Against the Ashvayanas (Aspasios)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle Against the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvayanas.html" title="Ashvayanas">Ashvayanas</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspasios.html" title="Aspasios">Aspasios</a>)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ascending the <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunar.html" title="Kunar">Kunar</a> <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley.html" title="Valley">valley</a>, Alexander came into conflict with the Ashvayanas. They were brave people and offered stubborn resistance to the invader. Alexander was seriously wounded in the right shoulder by a dart and his officers Ptolemy and Leonatos were also injured. Next morning however, Alexander succeeded in breaching one of the walls of their citadel. Finding them thus besieged, the Ashvayanas issued from the gate of citadel and made for the hills. Macedonians razed the city to the ground and proceeded against another clan of the Ashvayanas known as Andakas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Andakas put up some resistance but lsoon capitulated against heavy odds. Leaving Andaka citadel under charge of Krateros, Alexander proceeded along river Kunar against the Gorys, the main branch of the Ashvayanas. The defenders also set fire to their city and retired to the mountains. The Macedonians gave them hot pursuit. Ptolemy, with his contigent, first chased them on horseback, but when the ascent became steep to ascend, they proceeded on foot till they were near the Ashvayanas. The Ashvayana chief turned back and struck Ptolemy on the breast with a long spear which pierced his cuirass but unfortunately could not enter into his body. Like the stroke of lightening, Ptolemy smote Gorys chief on the thigh and as the latter tumbled, Ptolemy cut off his arms. On the death of their chief, some of the Ashvayanas took to their heels, while others wheeled around to rescue his corpse and offered a grim resistance. By that time, Alexander also reached spt and reinforced the embatteled contigent of Ptolemy. A bitter struggle ensued thence after. At last, the Ashvayanas vanished into the hills.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then, Alexander crossed the mountains and reached a city named Arigaon in the province of Bajaur. Here the story of Gorys was repeated. The Arigaonians burnt their place and fled to the hills. Alexander ordered to fortify the citadel of Arigaon to be developed into a strong military base for the Macedonians.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Alexander’s detectives found that the fleeing Ashvayanas had assembled on remote hill. Learning this, Alexander, accompanied by Ptolemy and Leonnatos, proceeded in that direction. Seeing the Macedonians approach, the Ashvayanas made a tactical mistake by descending into a plain ground on a small hill to give the enemy a decisive show. The conflict between the two armies was indeed sharp indeed. The Ashvayanas though “the stoutest warriors of the neighborhood” (aacording to Arrian) were confident of their numbers and disdainful of the Macedonians. This complacency, coupled with cooping-up of large numbers in a small place told upon their mobility. The determined attacks by Alexander, Ptolemy and Leonnatos from three different directions finally broke their ranks. Hence after a display of grim contest, the Ashvayanas gave way. Macedonians captured 40,000 men and 230,00 oxen which, barring the element of exaggeration, shows that it was not really an army of tained soldiers but an agglomeration of whole tribes, including a large number of non-combatants. It appears that they had assembled there either for purpose of safety or in course of their movements, with the result that they were not all trained for fighting. On the other hand, Alexander’s army was fully trained and by that time also was well experienced in mountain warfare. Hence it was, in reality, an encounter of a disciplined army and a dense mass of tribal people than a fight between two hosts of requisite training and preparation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It appears that the Ashvayanas were good agriculturists and cattle breeders. This is clear from the big number of bullocks, 230,00 according to Arrian, of the size and shape superior to what the Macedonians had known, which Alexander captured from them and sent to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> for agriculture. This fact is in perfect agreement with Kautiliya’s <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthashastra.html" title="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a> which attests that besides warfare, the Kambojas also practiced cattle-breeding and agriculture<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>.</li>

<ul>
<li>After reducing the Ashvayanas, Alexander marched against the hardy <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvakayanas.html" title="Ashvakayanas">Ashvakayanas</a>, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assakenois.html" title="Assakenois">Assakenois</a> of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical.html" title="Classical">classical</a> writings. Asasakenois inhabited <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swat.html" title="Swat">Swat</a> valley and were strongly entrenched in Massaga, Bazira, Ora and Aornos. They faced Alexander with an army of 30,000 cavalry, 30000 infantry and 30 <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Elephant_1ae8.html" title="War Elephant">elephants</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>. Seven thousands mercenary soldiers joined from Abhisara<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>. The Ashvakayanas had fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to the invader in many of their strongholds like the cities of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Ora.html" title="Ora">Ora</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/z/Bazira.html" title="Bazira">Bazira</a> and Massaga. The fort of Massaga could only be reduced after several days of bloody fighting in which Alexander himself was wounded seriously in the ankle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the very outset, Alexander made a tactical move to retreat his forces so to beguile the Ashvakayanas out of their fort of Massaga. About seven thousand Ashvakayanas force-charged the Macedonians helter-skelter, whereupon, Alexander suddenly wheeled around and attacked back, killing 200 and driving the rest into the citadel. Then Alexander brought his famed Phallanx against their fortifications. From the citadel, rain of arrows poured on Macedonians, one injuring Alexander himself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Next day, Alexander pounded the fort-wall with war ballists and his soldiers tried to rush in through the breach, but were repelled back by the defenders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Next morning, Macedonians returned to assault and started shooting from the Ballist machines as well as from the wood-tower into the fort.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Next day, a bridge was thrown-in to reach the citadel but, as the Macedonian troops thronged on it, it collapsed, hurtling them all down. Taking advantage of this, the defenders started pouring rain of arrows and stones and whatever articles they could snatch from top. Some of the Ashvakayanas issued from the posterns and struck the invaders hard at the close quarters. It was indeed a disaster day for the Macedonians.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On fifth day, Assakenian chieftain, “Assakenos”, was hit by a missile from the war engine of the invaders and was instantly killed. The battle was resumed by <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleophis.html" title="Cleophis">Cleophis</a> (q.v.), the mother of the deceased leader, who also stood determined to defend her motherland to the last extremity. The example of mother Cleophis assuming the supreme command of the military also brought the entire women of the locality into the fighting.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>. In this famous battle of Massaga which spread over several days, Macedonians had suffered heavy losses. The tribesmen also, likewise, suffered heavy losses, gave way and therefore, entered into a peace agreement with the invaders. It is very interesting to know, as we see below, that world’s greatest military General, Alexander the Great, could only reduce Massaga fort by resorting to abject treachery and despicable action of betrayal, which, forever stand a blot on his military reputation.</li>

<p>According to <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrian.html" title="Arrian">Arrian</a> (<i>Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon'</i>) (92 c AD – 175 c AD), Assakenos, the war leader of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assakenois.html" title="Assakenois">Assakenois</a>, fell on fifth day of fight and the Ashvakayanas sent a herald to Alexander for peace talks. The two sides came to an agreement ensuring the safe vacation of the tribesmen and providing that the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenaries</a> would join the Macedonians. On this, the defenders left the citadel and encamped on a hill facing the Macedonian camp. But, adds Arrian, “ they had no wish to fight against their own countrymen and resolved to arise by midnight and flee to their homes” . When Alexander was informed of this, he surrounded the hill the same night with all his troops and cut the tribesmen assembled there to pieces <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtius.html" title="Curtius">Curtius</a> (<i>Quintus Curtius Rufus</i>), a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a> historian belonging to the later half of the first c AD, does not refer to any such train of events.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/i/o/Diodorus_Siculus_3a81.html" title="Diodorus Siculus">Diodorus</a> (<i>Diodorus Siculus</i>) (93 c BCE 30 c BCE), clearly gives the lies to Arrian. He does not mention any agreement whereby the tribesmen had consented to join Alexander and later changed their mind and planned to flee in the dead of night. But he <i>positively</i> states that when the tribesmen had evacuated the city, in accordance with terms of the agreement, and retired to a distance of 80 stadia, without harboring any thought of treachery, Alexander <i>“who was actuated by an implacable enemity”</i>, and <i>“ had kept his <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops.html" title="Troops">troops</a> under arms ready for action”</i>, suddenly pounced upon the tribesmen (who were unaware and unprepared) and <i>“made a great slaughter of their ranks”</i> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>. Baffled by this unbecoming behavior, which flouted all canons of propriety and dignified conduct, the tribesmen loudly protested that they were being attacked in violation of the sworn obligations and also reminded him by invoking the gods in whose names Alexander had taken oaths to faithfully observe the terms of the agreement. But Alexander, throwing the gods and the oaths in their names, to the winds, retorted: <i>“My covenant merely bound me to let you depart from the city, and by no means a league of perpetual amity between them and the Macedonians”</i><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup>. Clearly, he implied that he was only to allow the tribesmen to move out of the citadel and was then free to attack them unaware and massacre them. <b>“Hardly could knavery know higher limits”</b> <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander%27s_Conflict_with_the_Kambojas_e297.html" title="Edit section: Plutarch’s Account">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plutarch’s Account</span></h4>
<p><a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> (<i>Mestrius Plutarchus</i>) (46 c AD 127 c AD) gives altogether a different version of the happenings. He says that Alexander <i>“incurred serious losses and accordingly, concluded a treaty of peace with them but, afterwards, as they were going away, set upon them while the were on the road and killed them all"</i>. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup>. He thereby clearly suggests that the peace proposal was initiated by Alexander himself, when after five days of hard fighting (nine days according to Curtius), he failed to take the Massaga citadel and had suffered heavy losses; and having beguiled the the Ashvakayanas by treaty of peace, made them retire from the city, betrayed them and attacked them, all of a sudden from behind. Rightly, therefore, Plutarch denounces Alexander by saving that <b>“this rests as foul blot on his martial fame”</b><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>“In view of these clear remarks of Plutarch, the accounts of Arrian seem to be a tendentious effort to window-dress a despicable act of abject treachery ad perjury. Its unreliability is amply manifest from the simple fact that, according to him, only 25 men of the Macedonians side fell in the hard fighting of five days <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> (nine days according to Curtius) which fact is amply contradicted by Plutarch‘s remarks that they had incurred heavy losses" <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Diodorus gives a detailed account as to how the brave <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvakayanas.html" title="Ashvakayanas">Ashvakayanas</a> had conducted themselves when faced with the sudden treacherous onslaught from Alexander. Writes Diodorus: <i>"Undismayed by the greatness of their danger, the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvakayana.html" title="Ashvakayana">Ashvakayanas</a> drew their ranks together in the form of a ring within which they placed their women and childern to guard them on all sides against their assailants. As they had now become desperate, and by their audacity and feats of valour, had made the conflict in which they closed, a hot work for the enemy,--great was the astonishment and alarm which the peril of the crisis had created. For, as the combatants were locked together fighting hand-to-hand, death and wounds were dealt round in every variety of form. While many were thus wounded, and not a few killed, the women, taking the arms of the fallen, fought side by side with their men. Accordingly, some of them who had supplied themselves with arms, did their best to cover their husbands with their shields, while the others, who were without arms, did much to impede the enemy by flinging themselves upon the enemy and catching hold of their shields. The defenders, however, after fighting desperately along with their wives, were at last overpowered by superior numbers, and thus met a glorious death which they would have disdained to exchange for the life of dishonour"</i> <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the heroic resistance and courage displayed by the Ashvakayanas (Kambojas), in the face of treacherous onslaught of Alexander, Dr Buddha Prakash remarks: <b>"Hardly could any <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Thermopylae_fd42.html" title="Battle of Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> be more glorious&#160;!"</b> <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtius.html" title="Curtius">Curtius</a>: <i>"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubbles."</i></p>
<p>In the aftermath of general <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaughter.html" title="Slaughter">slaughter</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">arson</a> committed by Alexander at Massaga and Ora, numerous <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assakenois.html" title="Assakenois">Assakenian</a> people fled to a high fortress called <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aornos.html" title="Aornos">Aornos</a>. But Alexander followed them close behind their heels and captured the strategic hill-fort but only after the fourth day of a bloody fight. The story of Massaga was again repeated at Aornos and a similar <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnage.html" title="Carnage">carnage</a> on the tribal-people followed here too.</p>
<p>Writing on Alexander's campaign against the Assakenois, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Hanson_f01b.html" title="Victor Hanson">Victor Hanson</a> comments: "After promising the surrounded Assacenis their lives upon capitulation, he executed all their soldiers who had surrendered. Their strongholds at Ora and Aornus were also similarly stormed. Garrisons were probably all slaughtered.”<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Scholaras like Dr W. W. Tarn, the unquestioned authority on the subject, after deep and thorough analysis of classical accounts, concludes that <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrian.html" title="Arrian">Arrian</a> has delibrately tried to throw a clever veil over the losses suffered by Alexander and has presented the Macedonian fatility figures in much reduced numbers.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup>. He has also cast a veil over how the Ashvakayanas had conducted themselves when faced with sudden treacherous onslaught from Alexander at Massaga, but Diodorus, his predecessor gives a vivid account of the train of events at Massaga, thus further lighlighting Arrian's unreliability. Arrian has also tried to window-dress the despicable act of abject treachery and unexcusable perjury for Alexander's blatant violation of the peace treaty with the Ashvakayanas, thereby slaughtering the entire garrison of tribesmen as well as the innocent population of Massaga, and razing the Massaga city to rubbles. And last but not the least, Arrian also asserts that the initiative for peace talks at Massaga had come from the Ashvakayanas, but the statement of his predecessor, Plutarch, unequivocally prove that the peace iniative was started by Alexander himself. The above facts are amply confirmed when Arrian's accounts are critically analysed in the light of statements of his predecessors like Plutarch, Diodorus and Curtius etc <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Arrian attests that Sisikottos, who had helped Alexander in this campaign against the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvaka.html" title="Ashvaka">Ashvaka</a> <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriyas.html" title="Kshatriyas">Kshatriyas</a>, was made the governor of Aornos. Alexander’s victory of Aornos was also elusive since, as Curtuis clearly attests, Alexander only conquered the position rather than the enemy though “he gave to this success the appearance of a great victory by offering sacrifices and worship to gods” <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup>. It is very clear that Ashvakas were defeated but no crushed. Hardly a few months had passed when brave and indomitable Ashvakayanas rose and revolted against the Macedonians and assasinated the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a> governor Nicanor of Massaga; and also reduced Sisikottos to such straights that it left him no alternative except to report the matter to Alexander at Glansai, asking his assistance. Alexander sent Phillipos an Tyriaspes to quell the Ashvakayana rebellion. How far they succeeded we have no means to know, but since Tyriaspes soon had to be replaced with Oxyartes, Alexander’s father-in-law, which shows that everything was not going well for Alexander in the land of the Ashvakas <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup>.</p>
