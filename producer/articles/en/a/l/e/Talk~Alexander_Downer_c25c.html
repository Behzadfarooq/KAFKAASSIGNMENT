<p>Downer judged ineffective in handling Indonesia by who?</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that some of the comments about Downer have been written in quite a harsh way.</p>
<p>Downer also played a role in the subsequent negotiation of the Pacific Solution in which Australia held refugees off-shore in foreign jurisdictions in an attempt to deny them entry into Australia.</p>
<p>Probably should be written like this: Alexander Downer also played a role in the subsequent negotiation of the Pacific Solution in which Australia held refugees off-shore in foreign jurisdictions which (some arguee) is an attempt to deny refugess direct entry into Australia (though some have been admitted into Australia).</p>
<p>&amp; He has been a firm supporter of the legality of the war in Iraq and he vociferously defended the claim that weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq to justify the 2003 invasion of that country, long after this claim was abandoned by many others [1] [2] [3]</p>
<p>He was and continues to be a firm supporter of the legality of the Iraq War (which is based on te UN resolutions that George Bush used a pretext for going to war) and he also defended the claim that WMD would be found in Iraq eve though a majority opinon indicated that there was a very slim chance any WMD would be found.</p>
<p>It seems sad that the article simply shows his 'mistakes' and really adds nothing of any success he has had. Downer is also known for his very dogged defense of Austrlian Foreign Policy.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think he's done a good job in dealing with them, unlike Crean who can't even get his appointments honoured.</p>

<p>I seriously question the statement about a majority of Australians supporting the Howard Government's policy of close alliance with the US. This is the very sort of issue that politicians and people generally argue endlessly about, each side producing their own evidence and counter-arguments. That makes it, in my book, intrinsically arguable and therefore, by definition, not NPOV.

<dd>Meh. I left that in when I took out some more obviously POV material on a majority of Australians supporting the Iraq war before, because I thought that was fairly widely agreed on. From what I can remember, the polls have shown a majority in favor, and both main political parties support it rather strongly (which I doubt very much Labor would do if that position had much support). Still, if you want to take it out, I wouldn't object - it's not exactly relevant to this article. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbivalenthysteria_aa78.html" title="User:Ambivalenthysteria">Ambivalenthysteria</a> 12:19, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Labor founded the US alliance and has always supported it, even when dissenting from the US over issues like Vietnam and Iraq. As far as I know opinion polls have always shown majority support for the alliance <i>in principle</i>, but opinion obviously fluctuates on specific issues like Iraq. Even so I think the Iraq war had majority support before and during the war. I suspect that support has now retrospectively evaporated as a result of the WMD debacle and general contempt for Bush. I agree that the point is not really relevant to this article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:19, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did he work on his accent with professionals, trying to make him sound more "Australian"&#160;? Does his Cultivated Australian English come from his education and attendance at Oxford?</p>
<p>A nicely balanced and informative article. I do query whether the statement that he supports the <i>legality</i> of the Iraq war is quite accurate - his support isn't restricted to the war's legality.</p>
<p>This probably can't be worked in, which is a pity, but DFAT and Downer don't have a lot of input into foreign policy these days - the important decisions are handled in the PM's office, and Downer and DFAT are left to work out the details. This, unfortunately, comes from what I believe is called "original research". <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 20:52, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some quotes about Downer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugh White, the head of the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, describes Downer as "genuinely now very knowledgeable about the world and diplomatic affairs", an effective diplomat whose tendency to "say things a bit offbeat" is regarded by peers as endearing, and a foreign minister whose judgement, through sheer experience, is sound, though he still has lapses.</li>
</ul>
<dl>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>From the same article, but this time the words of the journalist: "Downer is a realist and a pragmatist who sees the world in terms of power relativities and threats, and has never had a high regard for international law or institutions. He will not go down in history as a great policy innovator - unlike Gareth Evans or Percy Spender (the latter negotiated the ANZUS Treaty) - but he has had some foreign policy successes. His departmental colleagues, with whom he has a good relationship, say Downer doesn't get enough credit for his commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, or for the attention now given to consular matters and the protection of Australian travellers overseas."</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 08:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think these are fair comment by well-informed people and can be used. Downer is no genius, and still harms himself with outbursts of childish behaviour in the House (partly because he and Rudd clearly loathe each other), but by sheer persistence he has got on top of the job. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:03, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps this news story could be included in the statement about East Timor? It might add an important opposing view of Downers support of East Timors freedom, and I quote "A report to the United Nations has found Australia actively lobbied to delay East Timor's independence ballot in 1999 and prevent its separation from Indonesia" and "Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer made it clear it would be preferable if Timor remained legally part of Indonesia and actively lobbied the government in Jakarta to delay the independence vote..." <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1560743.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1560743.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1560743.htm</a> -Grant 02/02/2006</p>

<p>Anyway, the paragraph as a whole misses the really big change in Oz foreign policy since Howard came to power - the abandoment of the self-reliant Australo-centric policy of Aust as a good international citizen as pushed by Keating/Evans and its replacement with the Howard/Downer policy of Aust as a member of the US alliance, integrating both foreign policy and defence posture into US goals.

<p>This entire paragraph would seem to be dedicated to praising Alexander Downer.</p>
<p>"Hugh White, the head of the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, describes Downer as "genuinely now very knowledgeable about the world and diplomatic affairs", an effective diplomat whose tendency to "say things a bit offbeat" is regarded by peers as endearing, and a foreign minister whose judgement, through sheer experience, is sound, though he still has lapses. He has been described as "a realist and a pragmatist," a man who "will not go down in history as a great policy innovator" but who "has had some foreign policy successes" and who has worked hard in areas such as nuclear non-proliferation and at raising the attention given by his Department to comparatively neglected areas such as consular matters and the protection of Australian travellers overseas.[1]"</p>
<p>Although it is not 100% positive, it certainly seems to be tilted strongly in his favour. Perhaps it should either be removed, or counter balanced with a more critical quote from a reputable source.</p>

<dd>A good article should cover <i>both</i>, and while it could do with a bit more on his successes, it certainly isn't bad. The "idiot son of the aristocracy" stuff was a highly successful tactic against used him when he was Opposition Leader, which is why it warrants at least some discussion here. You seem to be pushing for the removal of anything that could even remotely reflect negatively on conservative figures of late, leading to articles that end up like glorified resumes. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the rude accusation. I won't bother engaging in argument against you, doing so is folly. There is a huge bias problem with so many Australian political articles but I am not in a position to take on the resident politics oligarchy. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 06:28, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is the problem. Mentioning of something that reflects badly on a conservative politician, even if accurate, verifiable and notable, as with the aristocracy issue here, is deemed "huge bias". When I write articles, everything relevant and notable I can find goes in the article, regardless of whether it could be argued to reflect positively or negatively on the person and regardless of my personal feelings for them. As such, anyone from overseas reading the article gets a comprehensive picture of the person's career. When anything negative about a person is expunged, however, you end up with an article that, frankly, isn't worth a pinch of sh*t to anyone who didn't already know about the subject. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think one way to remove bias from the article is to remove all assessments of his performance in the 2nd-last paragraph. Who says he "got off to a shaky start"? Who says he has "performed effectively"? Who says East Timor was "his most notable achievement"? I think it is sufficient to list his main challenges (clearly Indonesia and Iraq IMHO) and characteristics (strong USA links) of his ministership (is that a word?), and to note that Howard has left him there for 10+ years so to note that <i>Howard</i> thinks he has been effective. I don't think it is possible (or appropriate) for Wikipedia itself to try to evaluate his performance. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 10:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia shouldn't be trying to evaluate his performance, but we can and should cite other people in doing so. Otherwise, we end up with a glorified resume. Really, this article could do with quite a lot of work (mainly because it is incomplete, rather than biased) - but attributing its current state to some sort of leftist cabal, as Michael did, was just downright rude. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 10:21, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean to offend Bec, I just meant to bring up an issue - there was no intention to be "downright rude". There's no point keeping silence when something does concern me. If I'm wrong, so be it and no harm done. If I'm right, its good that I brought it up so it could be attended to. I'm no fool and I hope you realise I don't mean to rock the boat.

<p>The "things that batter" paragraph isn't biased, it's a fact of history. It is also a genuine reflection of Downer's sheltered, private scool boy attitude towards venerable citizens.
