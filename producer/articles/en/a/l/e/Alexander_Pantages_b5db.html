<p>Born <b>Pericles Pantages</b> on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> island of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andros.html" title="Andros">Andros</a>, he ran away from home at nine while with his father on a business trip in Cairo, Egypt, and he went to sea at the age of nine, spending the next 12 years working on merchant ships all over the world. He spent some time helping the French to dig the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_Canal_ac67.html" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>, but after contracting malaria he headed north to cooler climates.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pantages_b5db.html" title="Edit section: Entry into Exhibition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Entry into Exhibition</span></h3>
<p>In 1902, Pantages left Dawson and moved to <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, where he opened the Crystal Theater, a vaudeville/motion picture house of his own. This took place a few months after Rockwell had opened up a small storefront movie theater in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_B.C._b900.html" title="Vancouver, B.C.">Vancouver, B.C.</a> That same year, he married a musician named Lois Mendenhall. Klondike Kate filed a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breach_of_promise.html" title="Breach of promise">breach-of-promise-to-marry</a> lawsuit against him (settled out of court) and later wrote that he had stolen from her the money with which he purchased the Crystal. It would be more than two decades before they saw each other again, at his rape trial, and then only briefly.</p>
<p>In 1904, Pantages opened a second Seattle theatre, the Pantages. By 1920, he was owner of more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more, in both the United States and Canada. These theatres formed the "Pantages Circuit", a chain of theatres into which he could book and rotate touring acts on long-term contracts.</p>
<p>The starting point of the Pantages Circuit was the city of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg%2C_Manitoba_55db.html" title="Winnipeg, Manitoba">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, where Pantages built the Pantages Playhouse in 1914. All Pantages tours originated in Winnipeg and moved from there around the circuit of theatres. If an act died in Winnipeg it would not go on the road.</p>
<p>While the majority of "his" theatres were owned by others and managed by Pantages, he became, from 1911 on, a builder of theatres all over the western U.S. and Canada. His favoured architect in these ventures was <a href="../../../b/2E/_/B._Marcus_Priteca_ecb6.html" title="B. Marcus Priteca">B. Marcus Priteca</a> (1881-1971), of Seattle, who regularly worked with <a href="../../../m/u/r/Mural.html" title="Mural">muralist</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Heinsbergen_e356.html" title="Anthony Heinsbergen">Anthony Heinsbergen</a>. Priteca devised an exotic, neo-classical style that his employer called "Pantages Greek".</p>

<p>His theatres often set standards of elegance and good taste, not to mention cleanliness and efficiency of operation. He insisted that his customers receive the best service at a reasonable price, despite his shortsighted early refusal to allow African-Americans into his theatres. He was successfully sued by an African-American after being refused entry into a Pantages theater in Spokane, Washington.</p>
<p>A ruthless but intensely hard-working businessman, Pantages shrewdly invested his theatrical profits into new outlets and eventually moved to Los Angeles from Seattle around 1920 to take advantage of his status as a powerful theatrical mogul. His showcase theatre at 7th and Hill Streets in downtown L.A. also housed his offices. While seemingly leading a stable family life with three children and eventually a fourth adopted daughter named Carmen, he had a reputation as an "old goat." It is reputed that several of his theaters had penthouses where he led many after-show parties with attractive young starlets.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pantages_b5db.html" title="Edit section: Business Dealings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Business Dealings</span></h3>
<p>Around 1920, Pantages entered into partnership with the motion picture distributor <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Players_b839.html" title="Famous Players">Famous Players</a>, a subsidiary of film producer <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, and further expanded his "combo" houses, designed to exhibit films as well as staging live vaudeville, to new sites in western U.S. Throughout the 1920s, the Pantages Circuit dominated the vaudeville and motion picture market in North America west of the Mississippi River. Pantages was effectively blocked from expansion into the eastern market by the dominant, New York-based Keith-Albee-Orpheum Circuit (KAO).</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, with the looming advent of talking pictures, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sarnoff_9d51.html" title="David Sarnoff">David Sarnoff</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_P._Kennedy_68e8.html" title="Joseph P. Kennedy">Joseph P. Kennedy</a>, the principals of the Radio Corporation of America (<a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a>), which held a number of patents in film/sound technology, established the film production company Radio Pictures and moved to acquire control of the KAO theatres through quiet purchases of the company's stock.</p>
<p>In 1927, Kennedy and Sarnoff were successful in gaining control of KAO, and, in 1928, changed the name of the company to Radio Keith Orpheum (<a href="../../../r/k/o/RKO_e9df.html" title="RKO">RKO</a>). They then approached Alexander Pantages with an offer to purchase his entire chain. Pantages rejected the offer.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pantages_b5db.html" title="Edit section: Pantages Rape Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pantages Rape Trial</span></h3>
<p>In 1929, in the midst of a meltdown on Wall Street, Alexander Pantages was arrested and charged with the rape of a 17-year-old would-be vaudeville dancer named <a href="../../../e/u/n/Eunice_Pringle_dfc7.html" title="Eunice Pringle">Eunice Pringle</a>. Miss Pringle alleged that Pantages had attacked her in a tiny side office of his downtown theater after inviting her in to audition. Pantages was tried and convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison, despite his claim that he was "set up."</p>
<p>Pantages then engaged the young attorney Jerry Geisler (later to become famous as Hollywood's leading divorce lawyer) and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> lawyer <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Ehrlich_2c7d.html" title="Jake Ehrlich">Jake Ehrlich</a>, later to become a famous attorney in his own right, to file an appeal on his behalf. Geisler successfully petitioned for a new trial, basing his argument on the original trial judge's exclusion of testimony relating to Eunice Pringle's moral character.</p>
<p>Geisler triumphed in the second trial, picturing the alleged victim as a woman of low morals, theatrically demonstrating how impractical was a rape in Pantages' broom closet and planting in the jurors' minds the suggestion that Miss Pringle might have been paid by business rivals, particularly Kennedy, to frame his client. It was alleged that in 1933, when Pringle was about to announce this to the press, she died mysteriously.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pantages_b5db.html" title="Edit section: Significance of Rape Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Significance of Rape Trial</span></h3>
<p>The tawdry original trial exposed several fissures in American society. The trial took place at a time when America was changing from a rural society to an urban one, with the consequent break in conservative, even religion traditions this implied. Not only was society becoming more urbane and "liberal," but women entered the social world, first as voters with passage of the 21st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, and increasingly as members of the working world.</p>
<p>The hidden narrative of the rape trial, at least as expressed in newspapers at the time, was that women were too fragile to be out in the real world, that they would be safer at home. This subtle subtext was also prevalent in other famous trials at the time, most notably involving Hollywood comedian Fatty Arbuckle in the early 1920s.</p>
<p>Another important fissure the Pantages rape trial exposed was the deep-seated misgivings many Americans had for immigrants, especially those that dominated the Hollywood movie industry. The period between 1880 and 1920 has seen the largest influx of immigrants ever to the United States, when roughly 15% of the total population of the country was suddenly foreign born. In many ways, Pantages may have been a victim of the era as much as of circumstances.</p>
<p><a name="Tragic_End_Years" id="Tragic_End_Years"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pantages_b5db.html" title="Edit section: Tragic End Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tragic End Years</span></h3>
<p>Although Pantages was acquitted, the trials ruined him financially and may have broken him in both health and spirit. He sold the theatre chain to RKO for a lower sum than that originally offered - far less than what his "Pantages Greek" vaudeville palaces had cost him to build - and went into retirement. He owned and raced horses, even as he desperately yearned to return to the exhibition business. His plans for an encore as a theatrical mogul never materialized. Alexander Pantages died in 1936 and was interred in the Great Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Benediction, in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park_%28Glendale%29_adc6.html" title="Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)">Forest Lawn Memorial Park</a> in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_California_2c37.html" title="Glendale, California">Glendale, California</a>.</p>
<p>The rumour, begun at the second trial, that RKO and Kennedy paid Eunice Pringle to frame Alexander Pantages, was revived in Ronald Kessler's biography of Joseph Kennedy "The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded" (New York: Warner Books, 1997). There is only anecdotal evidence, however, to support this claim. Years later Eunice Pringle married Richard Worthington, who became a psychologist. Pringle, who was known as Toni Worthington, moved to San Diego and had a daughter, Marcy Worthington. Pringle died of natural causes in 1996.</p>
<p>An apocryphal popular story about Pantages alleges that the boy who dropped out of school at 9 never learned to read or write; he kept atop a powerful, multi-million dollar business thanks to the extraordinary powers of memory sometimes developed by the illiterate.</p>
