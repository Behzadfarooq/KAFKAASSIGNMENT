<ul>
<li>Would not it be usefull to create a universal template for an infobox related to a Russian city, something like <a href="../../../u/s/_/Template%7EUS_City_infobox_d4a7.html" title="Template:US City infobox">Template:US City infobox</a>? It might contain English name, Russian Name, Population, Lattitude/Longitude, Post code, Phone code, Foundation year, Architectorial landmarks, Famous people connected.

<ul>
<li>Alex, I don't think it is a good idea. We have a number of city templates already, but actually they are not very informative and don't prettify atricles too. Also, most of the Russian city articles are stubbish, which result in the tiny article being overloaded with images, tables, and templates. By the way, I moved your porposal to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiportal_Russia_Russia-related_Wikipedia_notice_board_dfac.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiportal/Russia/Russia-related Wikipedia notice board">Wikipedia:Wikiportal/Russia/Russia-related Wikipedia notice board</a>, which is intended for such announcements. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> 12:38, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, for moving the proposal, would not do it again. You are more experienced wikipedian, so you must be right. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 12:51, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apostrophes in the article's titles are against Wikipedia tradition, they might be wronly interpreted in the address bars of some browsers, in search requests, etc. Many English-speaking peoples does not have a clue whow to prononce Russian words with apostrophes inside, etc.</li>

<p>Hello Alex! Thanks for looking at the article about Frid and thanks for considering to trans-wiki it to the German wikipedia. Lucky Germans now have two Frids&#160;:) but I'm sure they will figure it out all right. My question to you is about what's left here in the English wikipedia: you reduced it to a stub-stub; is it your opinion that it actually isn't worth translating? Or perhaps you would be interested to give it further translation and expand it a little, and just need more time? In which case I thought I'd let you know that the copyvio question came up so it might be wiser to wait out a bit. You can check out the status on the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_translation_into_English_8f7f.html#Grigory_Samuilovich_Frid" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English">page with the list for required translation</a>. Your help is very valuable!</p>

<dd>Alex, большое спасибо. Т.е. вы считаете, что то, что было, незачем переводить? Вы практически удалили немецкий текст, вот почему я спросила. Если бы там был хороший текст, то кто-нибудь со знанием немецкого перевел бы. Я подозреваю, что тот текст был несколько примитивный (насколько я смогла немного прочитать), да еще и copyvio... в общем, бог с ним, наверное, подожду я - две недели на перевод дается.

<p>Hi, refering to your work on this article. I realise that you have probably added the foreign language stuff to work on it and translate. But, it seems to me that it is copyrighted material from a different website.

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>Could you please help me with the article about Salahov. I think there are too many redirects, and in my opinion we should only keep the name Tahir Salahov according to Azeri spelling and redirect from Tair Salakhov according to Russian spelling. Any other spellings should be deleted, including the one with his father’s name in the middle. I’m new to wikipedia, and sometimes have difficulties with making things work. Thank you for your kind assistance. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 12:59, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Once an article is created in Wikipedia, you have to have administrative rights to delete it. Neither me nor you have such rights, thus, we have to go through voting on AfD page - that is reasonably cumbersome and lengthy. Thus, I would not recommend to delete an entry (unless it is somehow offensive, harmful, etc.), just make it a redirect to an article with the right name. See <a href="../../../r/e/d/Help%7ERedirect_9b77.html" title="Help:Redirect">Help:Redirect</a>. Usually redirect does not harm - they a take negligeble amount memory, but simplify search. Even the redirects with an orphographic errors might be helpfull, if you made such an error been our expert on Salakhov, then quite possible that an American schoolboy or whoever would look up the wikipedia would make the same mistake - so the more redirects the merrier.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thus, the strategy would be decide the right name for the main article. Move the article there by pressing the move button on the top and entering the right name. It would create a redirect on the place of the right name. Check that all the other redirects points to the main article, so that there will be no double redirects, if necessary, edit the redirects. That's all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Last few words, for the Russian-related articles we decided to avoid using patronimics in the titles of the main articles - they look foreign for the English-speakers, to long to type, introduce additional errors (what is right: Ivanovich, Ivanovitch or Iwanowitch?), etc. So we decided to use them only to distinguish among equally notable people - Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy vs. Aleksey Nikolaevich Tolstoy, etc. It is in theory, but in reality many people are still using patronimics in the titles. I am not sure if it is relevant to the Azerbajani form of patronimics with ogly/kyzy. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 13:45, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Alex-I removed some material from <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arseny_Tarkovsky_c844.html" title="Arseny Tarkovsky">Arseny Tarkovsky</a> because I couldn't understand it. You put it back, but I still don't really know what it means:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>he worked for the newspaper "Gudok" managing the section of the Rhymed Satire (Поэтического Фельетона). In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> he studied at <b>Higher State Courses for Writers</b> (Высшие государственные литературные курсы).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not familiar with "Rhymed Satire" - maybe you can find a better English translation of this concept? If not (maybe it doesn't really exist in English journalism), then you can give a brief description of what it is. Just saying "Rhymed Satire" with no explanation is confusing. And about his studies, can you clarify as to exactly what that means? I assume that it refers to studies at a state university- but that's not clear. I know all 4 of those Russian words, but I still don't know what exactly that refers to, and it makes this sentence confusing rather than informative.

<p>I was wondering if you could help me do the same with the other Ukrainian painters. Also, was David Buliuk a jew? (the name David?? just a given name?)</p>
<ul>
<li>I will try to help, if I would have spare time. I do not know for sure, but strongly doubt that Burliuk was a Jew. His father was David Fyodorvich, his brothers were Vladimir (or Wladimir) and Nikolay (Mikolay). A Jew of that time could have name David, but not Fyodor, Vladimir or Nikolay, they are New Testament names of Greek, Latin and Slavic origin. His father was an agronom, Jews of that time usually hated agricultural jobs, and the Government usualy forbade Jews the rural living (it is not absolute, the father of Trotsky was a farmer, but it was a rare case). He lived outside the Pale (in Kazan and Saint Petersburg) but there are no evidences of difficulties in obtaining the permit to do so, as in the bios of e.g. Chagall and Bakst. Thus, I think Burliuk was a Ukainian Ukrainian not a Ukrainian Jew. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 08:59, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

That's what Wiki community is about and I'm really pleased to see that it works.<br />
As my RfA voting failed with 71% support, I don't plan to reapply for adminship any more. However, I hope I might still be of some help to the community.

<p>Hi Alex - I don't know whether you saw my later comment on SFD, but if Azerbaijan-stub is deleted, then there is still a {{<a href="../../../c/a/u/Template%7ECaucasus-stub_b7e0.html" title="Template:Caucasus-stub">Caucasus-stub</a>}} which would be used. Given the overlap likely on articles relating to Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and the disputed borders between these countries, it's probably easier to group the stubs from these countries into one stub category anyway, at least until there are a large number of them. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:59, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article on ZZ which I recently created states that she is Russian. In fact, for many years, she reced under a Russian UCI license and was identified everywhere I could find as a Russian. She also (or so I believe) lived in Russia for those many years and raced in the Russian cycling championships.</p>
<p>However, I believe she is Kazakhistani and last year (her last before reitring), she raced under a Kazakh license and is listed as Kazakhistani in the UCI points list for that year. If she is Kazakh, you might want to alter the category listings. I will be completing the Palmares section of that page in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of the transliteration of the name. I checked on the Russian (sic!)Cycling Federation web site and saw the name in the original Cyrillic. I believe I have applied the correct transliteration. The UCI lists the first name as Zoulfia, which is more a phonetic transliteration. <a href="../../../j/f/p/User%7EJFPerry_f0dc.html" title="User:JFPerry">JFPerry</a> 18:41, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the Cyrillic version of ZZ's name in the article on <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulfiya_Zabirova_f33e.html" title="Zulfiya Zabirova">Zulfiya Zabirova</a>. But there is a typo which I haven't figured out how to fix. The third letter of the first name is an "l", not a "d". Also add that the third letter of the last name is a 'b', not an 'f". <a href="../../../j/f/p/User%7EJFPerry_f0dc.html" title="User:JFPerry">JFPerry</a> 16:29, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alex. I noticed you just created this page. Are you sure it's a good idea? First of all, it's just a copy of the <i>Age</i> data, right? Then it might strictly be under copyright. Secondly, it seems like it's going to be a lot of work to maintain. It would have to be updated every year, right? Not to mention all the possible lists from other states and their education certificates... who do you see this page as being useful to?</p>
<p>Thirdly, and the most important reason, is that I think it's not terribly NPOV and it's just going to introduce a bunch of shitfights from people trying to talk up their school or talk down another school. Bored schoolkids, you know... and there are lots of different ways of ranking schools, even just from VCE data.</p>
<p>Some things to think about. You can reply on <a href="../../../p/f/c/User_talk%7EPfctdayelise_a4c0.html" title="User talk:Pfctdayelise">my Talk page</a>, if you like. cheers, <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 01:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accept your point on copyright. I'm not totally convinced that it's encyclopaedic material though. I mean why should parents turn to Wikipedia for this information? I'm not going to AfD it, but I'm just saying - don't be surprised if it happens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A couple of points about style. Firstly, some of the schools are marked with asterisks (*) but it doesn't explain anywhere what this means. Secondly some comment needs to be made about how complete this list is. Is it every school in Victoria? Every government school, every private school, every school above a certain threshold?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the table is kinda... ugly, I'm afraid. See <a href="../../../t/a/b/Help%7ETable_8f3b.html" title="Help:Table">Help:Table</a>. Wikitables are much prettier:</dd>

<dd>While I have no doubt that the list is worthy of inclusion, the table does have some major problems. Firstly, the way the schools are named is...odd. They should really be in lowercase, spelt out and linked. Secondly, the table really should be in Wikiformat. Thirdly, it really needs to do a better job of explaining the criteria that it was based on - the study scores are not a percentage. I spent quite a while trying to fix this up last night, when I suddenly realised that the list would be completely out of date and would need to be replaced from scratch in three weeks, so I threw the draft away. Anyway, it's some things to think about when the 2005 list comes out.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:36, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Alex! You did such a great job on this article, and thank you very much for helping out, with those unfortunate reversals. I just added a bit more; I was trying to clarify why he, born a Ukrainian, is reputed widely as a Russian engineer and his works published in academia papers under "Russian Engineering school" and such. Also added a ref to his autobiography. It seems like a rare edition and I'm not sure if I can easily get it to check out the important facts - would be nice though... So perhaps someday somebody (if not myself) will find the way to do it&#160;:) I also wasn't sure how best to structure the text but it's growing large, so may be you could think of a way to break it into paragraphs? In any case, I think we should un-stub it, what would you say?

<dd>I guess for the same reasons as <a href="../../../i/g/o/Igor_Sikorsky_8505.html" title="Igor Sikorsky">Igor Sikorsky</a>. He was not particularly associated with Ukraine, that's why. This does not deny their ethnic roots. It's just that their work did not connect particulalry to Ukraine which was just a part of the Empire. A totally opposite example would be <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kostomarov.html" title="Kostomarov">Kostomarov</a>, a scientist of also a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>.

<dd>Hey Irpen! Warm greetings, I meant to thank you too! just didn't make it yet&#160;:) Yes you are right (as always&#160;:) and I agree. We do need to explain the roots because that speaks of the person. Except I also think that for mathematicians, physicists, engineers, other "abstract" scientists, especially those *not* in humanities, and especially of such caliber, who are really, citizens of the world indeed... does it really make sense to insist on any ethnical categorization at all. Shouldn't it be: by nationality, in the sense of "a national of a country", a resident, a citizen on one hand, then on another hand, based upon which school of science does one represent - unless someone's life and professional work truly has deeper interconnections on the ethnical basis (which is not the case I don't believe?). In this case, for Stepan Prokofyevich, I think you got it right: we should categorize as Ukrainian -- not because he was (or wasn't?) one ethnically but mainly because that's where he was born and raised, and due to his indisputable worth for the Ukrainian academy and Kiev Polytech; as Russian -- because of his education from the St Ptersburg school, which he would later distinguish as the strongest in the world, by the way, and because that's what the entire wrld-wide academia knows him to be (as of today at least); and finally, as an American engineer I guess, also -- because, well. (Yet, clearly we shouldn't be making up a Serbian or a German engineer for him.) All in all, I suspect I am just comfirming the obvious for the record&#160;:) Best wishes for all the coming holidays to you both!

<dd>Lysy, how this all explains your wholesale revert of Alex's thoughtful and careful attempt to order this page somewhat from its messy state? Others did revert too ferverntly between two messes. Alex came to organize it, you were in your very <i>respectful</i> words "<b>almost</b> treated him seriously" but probably it wasn't much if you reverted his edit the same way as Node and Bonaparte revert each others.

<p>I did review that particular diff even before you posted it here, and all I can see is an attempt to clean up and format the page, to remove blatant POV, to re-organize the reference section, and to remove copyvio.

<p>I guess it is copyvio they talk about on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransnistria_archive_2_1412.html#Copyvios.2C_brought_to_us_by_Bonaparte" title="Talk:Transnistria/archive 2">Talk:Transnistria/archive 2#Copyvios, brought to us by Bonaparte</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransnistria_archive_2_1412.html#Copyvio" title="Talk:Transnistria/archive 2">Talk:Transnistria/archive 2#Copyvio</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransnistria_archive_2_1412.html#Copyvio_diffs" title="Talk:Transnistria/archive 2">Talk:Transnistria/archive 2#Copyvio diffs</a>.

You are telling that there is nothing to worry about here, he is telling that this is a blatantly copyvio, that should be removed. I was neutral, my original changes have the paragraph in question. then <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">User:TSO1D</a> edited my edits, then <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> worked on infoboxes, then Node ue removed the alleged copyvio, then Phill Boswell worked the format of the article references. The came an anonymous reverter and twice reverted all our work. If he would only restored the paragraph removed by Node ue, I would not interfere as yes, so far I heared only allegations not proven facts. But the reverter did not bother to only restore the paragraph, he reverted all the good changes quite a number of people did that day. Why should I have a preference to the edits of the anonymous reveter over Node ue? I reverted the POV fork and think I did the right thing. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a></p>

<dd>I know that these edits have been confusing, probably equally for me and you.

I was not even able to guess which are these supposed copyvios there that he removed. Most of what he removed were my edits. Again, I can only apologize if you got caught in the middle of this, but your lack of reaction to Node's edit seemed like your support for his revert at that time. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a>)</sup> 16:22, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe, you, Bonoparte, have the electronic versions of the papers. Would you mind to send them to Lysy, so he could evaluate if this a copyvio or not.

I do not see myself fighting some bias on Wikipedia. It is just so happen that I know a few areas better that an average Wiki-editor and some things worse.

<p>Hey Alex...sorry I didn't get your note until voting was closed. Better luck next time (let me know sooner!) ...

<p>Hey, condolensces on your admin nom. Too bad it didn't go well, and especially with so much interference.</p>
<p>My bureaucrat nomination also failed, and there was a ton of interference with that one too. It was particularly upsetting for me, since it appeared that the interferer had succeeded in sinking my candidacy. Eventually I came to the conclusion that it would have failed anyway, and that the guy was just wasting his time, which seems to be true in your case as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to say that I sympathize, and I predict you'll make a great admin the not-too-distant future. Just use edit summaries more, refrain from saying things that appear insulting (even to people that deserve it), and avoid edit wars like the plague, and I'm sure you'll have no problem in another couple of months.</p>
<p>One final tip: I'd use words like "vandalism" and "troll" very sparingly. If a person is <i>probably</i> a troll or does something which is <i>arguably</i> vandalism, it's a part of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> to refrain from any labelling.</p>

<dd>My apologies for the personal attack. I have not researched the topic well enough, and saw the other set of four reversions by Ghirlandajo that had only disputed tag restored. In the set you presented the fourth edit by Ghirlandajo looks completely different from the other three. It does not look to me as a violation of the 3RR, but rather like a content dispute. I am also not sure if you give Ghirlandajo an opportunity to explain his edits before applying your blocking action. Additionally I still consider edits that remove a dispute tag set by an opposite party of a conflict to be a form vandalism and their reversion not to be covered by the 3RR. If you want to get an objective opinion about smartness and/or competence of you blocking action you better ask a better expert in the Wiki-law than me 03:09, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, your interpretation of the 3RR is probably a correct one and mine is not, you have the complete right to name me incompetent and, probably, stupid. Still <b>usually</b> 3RR rule refers to reversions to the same version. E.g. the standard report Original Version/1R/2R/3R/4R is completely useless for the case of reversions to different versions, that might be a reason of my mix up. It seems that my ignorance was shared by Ghirlandajo, despite all his experience, so it was probably a good idea to warn him that his edits of the article looked like a violation of your interpretation of 3RR and should be stopped. He appeared to have believe a good faith that he was not in breach of the 3RR. It is really difficult to judge the basis of his believes without seen the versions he supposedly reverted to. The edits of Ghirlandajo does not look very logical to me - why simultaneously add dispute tags and blank the disputed paragraphs, but maybe there is a valid explanation for this. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 12:06, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ghirlandajo was well aware of the fact that revert warring is a bad thing (even if no "rule" is being violated). Keep in mind that "three reverts per page per 24-hour period" is an absolute limit that should rarely be reached; it isn't an entitlement. Ghirlandajo had just been involved in another revert war, in which he used up all three reversions and reported another editor's 3RR violation.

In other words, he realized that he was violating the spirit of the rule, but believed that he had discovered a loophole in the wording. Even if he had been correct (which he was not), that type of behavior would have warranted a block.</dd>

<p>Sorry to hear that as well. You clearly deserve to be an admin. In between the troll and puppet shows there was also fair criticism (edit summaries, for one, or a tiny number offensive statements) and if you take its advice and go on the way you do, the small difference of support of your percentages and of that required to become an admin can be leapt next time.

Especially for those who actually voted to support me&#160;:). You put a great effort into it, it was me who mixed up everything.

<dd>Alex, there is some interesting development in Russian Wikipedia, we grew nicely in December:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>23 декабря, пятница — <b>В Русской Википедии 50 тысяч статей</b>.</li>
<li>4 декабря, воскресенье — <b>В Русской Википедии 40 тысяч статей</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've checked all of the naming convention articles and <b>none</b> of them say anything about not being able to use non-ASCII characters in titles. That's one of the reasons Wikipedia moved to using UTF-8: so special, non-ASCII characters could be used if needed. There was already a redirect in place for the title without the ★, but the <b>correct</b> title has the ★ in it. I will be moving the page back to where it was. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 05:38, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It must be galling to lose under such questionable circumstances. I still think you'd make a gread admin; drop me a line when you're nominated again, so I can add my $0.02 to the discussion. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 14:48, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
