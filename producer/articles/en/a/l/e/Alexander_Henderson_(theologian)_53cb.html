<p><b>Alexander Henderson</b> (c. <a href="../../../1/5/8/1583.html" title="1583">1583</a> – <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">19 August</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a>) was a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> theologian.</p>
<p>He was born at Criech, <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fife.html" title="Fife">Fife</a>, graduated at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1603.html" title="1603">1603</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1610.html" title="1610">1610</a> was appointed professor of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questor.html" title="Questor">questor</a> of the faculty of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts.html" title="Arts">arts</a>. Shortly after this he was presented to the living of <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leuchars.html" title="Leuchars">Leuchars</a>. As Henderson was located upon his parish by Archbishop George Gladstanes, and was known to sympathize with <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopacy.html" title="Episcopacy">episcopacy</a>, his settlement was at first extremely unpopular; but he subsequently changed his views and became a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> in doctrine and church government, and one of the most esteemed <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_religion.html" title="Minister of religion">ministers</a> in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. He early made his mark as a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> leader, and took an active part in petitioning against the five acts and later against the introduction of a service-book and canons drawn up on the model of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">prayer-book</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">1 March</a> <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a> the public signing of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Covenant_fd8a.html" title="National Covenant">National Covenant</a> began in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greyfriars_Kirk%2C_Edinburgh_bc72.html" title="Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh">Greyfriars Kirk</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Henderson was mainly responsible for the final form of this document, which consisted of</p>
<ol>
<li>the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">kings</a> confession drawn up in <a href="../../../1/5/8/1581.html" title="1581">1581</a> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Craig_1e12.html" title="John Craig">John Craig</a></li>
<li>a recital of the acts of parliament against superstitious and papistical rites</li>
<li>an elaborate oath to maintain the true reformed religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Owing to the skill shown on this occasion he seems to have been applied to when any manifesto of unusual ability was required. In July of the same year he proceeded to the north to debate on the Covenant with the famous <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> doctors; but he was not well received by them. The voyd church was made fast, and the keys kept by the magistrate, says <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baillie.html" title="Baillie">Baillie</a>.</p>
<p>Henderson's next public opportunity was in the famous <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland_97a8.html" title="General Assembly of the Church of Scotland">Assembly</a> which met in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">21 November</a> <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>. He was chosen moderator by acclamation, being, as Baillie says, incomparablie the ablest man of us all for all things. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hamilton%2C_1st_Duke_of_Hamilton_a49f.html" title="James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton">James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton</a>, was the king's <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioner.html" title="Commissioner">commissioner</a>; and when the Assembly insisted on proceeding with the, trial of the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishops</a>, he formally dissolved the meeting under pain of treason. Acting on the constitutional principle that the king's right to convene did not interfere with the church's independent right to hold assemblies, they sat till <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">20 December</a>, deposed all the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> bishops, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunicated.html" title="Excommunicated">excommunicated</a> a number of them, repealed all acts favoring episcopacy, and reconstituted the Scottish <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk.html" title="Kirk">Kirk</a> on thorough <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> principles. During the sitting of this Assembly it was carried by a majority of seventy-five votes that Henderson should be transferred to Edinburgh. He had been at Leuchars for about twenty-three years, and was extremely reluctant to leave it.</p>
<p>While Scotland and England were preparing for the First <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops%27_Wars_af4c.html" title="Bishops' Wars">Bishops' War</a>, Henderson drew up two papers, entitled respectively <i>The Remonstrance of the Nobility</i> and <i>Instructions for Defensiite Arms</i>. The first of these documents he published himself; the second was published against his wish by John Corbet (<a href="../../../1/6/0/1603.html" title="1603">1603</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/4/1641.html" title="1641">1641</a>), a deposed minister. The First Bishops' War did not last long. At the Pacification of Birks the king virtually granted all the demands of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_people.html" title="Scottish people">Scots</a>. In the negotiations for peace Henderson was one of the Scottish commissioners, and made a very favorable impression on the king.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1640.html" title="1640">1640</a> Henderson was elected by the town council rector of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_University_af14.html" title="Edinburgh University">Edinburgh University</a>, an office to which he was annually re-elected till his death. The Pacification of Birks had been wrung from the king; and the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_people.html" title="Scottish people">Scots</a>, seeing that he was preparing for the Second Bishops' War, took the initiative, and pressed into England so vigorously that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles</a> had again to yield everything. The maturing of the treaty of peace took a considerable time, and Henderson was again active in the negotiations, first at <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripon.html" title="Ripon">Ripon</a> (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a>) and afterwards in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. While he was in London he had a personal interview with the king, with the view of obtaining assistance for the Scottish universities from money formerly applied to the support of the bishops.</p>
<p>On Henderson's return to Edinburgh in July <a href="../../../1/6/4/1641.html" title="1641">1641</a> the Assembly was sitting at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Andrews_f2ea.html" title="St Andrews">St Andrews</a>. To suit the convenience of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliament</a>, however, it removed to Edinburgh; Henderson was elected moderator of the Edinburgh meeting. In this Assembly he proposed that a confession of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a>, a catechism, a directory for all the parts of the public <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a>, and a platform of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>, wherein possibly England and we might agree, should be drawn up. This was unanimously approved of, and the laborious undertaking was left in Hendersons bands; but the notable motion did not lead to any immediate results.</p>
<p>During Charles's second state-visit to Scotland, in the autumn of <a href="../../../1/6/4/1641.html" title="1641">1641</a>, Henderson acted as his chaplain, and managed to get the funds, formerly belonging to the bishopric of Edinburgh, applied to the metropolitan university.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a> Henderson, whose policy was to keep Scotland neutral in the war which had now broken out between the king and the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliament</a>, was engaged in corresponding with England on <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical.html" title="Ecclesiastical">ecclesiastical</a> topics; and, shortly afterwards, he was sent to Oxford to mediate between the king and his parliament; but his mission proved a failure.</p>
<p>A memorable meeting of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">General Assembly</a> was held in August <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a>. Henderson was elected moderator for the third time. He presented a draft of the famous <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solemn_League_and_Covenant_c9ac.html" title="Solemn League and Covenant">Solemn League and Covenant</a>, which was received with great enthusiasm. Unlike the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Covenant_fd8a.html" title="National Covenant">National Covenant</a> of <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>, which applied to Scotland only, this document was common to the two <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">kingdoms</a>. Henderson, Baillie, Rutherford and others were sent up to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to represent Scotland in the Assembly at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster.html" title="Westminster">Westminster</a>. The Solemn League and Covenant, which pledged both countries to the extirpation of prelacy, leaving further decision as to church government to be decided by the example of the best reformed churches, after undergoing some slight alterations, passed both parliaments, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Scotland_b6d1.html" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">Parliament of England</a>, and thus became law for the two kingdoms. By means of it Henderson has had considerable influence on the history of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. As Scottish commissioner to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Assembly_5e60.html" title="Westminster Assembly">Westminster Assembly</a>, he was in England from August <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a> till August <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a>; his principal work was the drafting of the directory for public worship.</p>
<p>Early in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1645.html" title="1645">1645</a> Henderson was sent to <a href="../../../u/x/b/Uxbridge.html" title="Uxbridge">Uxbridge</a> to aid the commissioners of the two parliaments in negotiating with the king; but nothing came of the conference. In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a> the king joined the Scottish army; and, after retiring with them to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle-upon-Tyne_91d2.html" title="Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Newcastle-upon-Tyne</a>, he sent for Henderson, and discussed with him the two systems of church government in a number of papers. Meanwhile Henderson was failing in health. He sailed to Scotland, and eight days after his arrival died, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">19 August</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a>. He is buried in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greyfriars_Kirkyard_dd07.html" title="Greyfriars Kirkyard">Greyfriars Kirkyard</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>; and his death was an occasion of national mourning in Scotland.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">7 August</a> Baillie had written that he had heard that Henderson was dying most of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heartbreak.html" title="Heartbreak">heartbreak</a>. A document was published in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> purporting to be a Declaration of Mr Alexander Henderson made upon his death-bed; and, although this paper was disowned, denounced and shown to be false in the General Assembly of August <a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a>, the document was used by Clarendon as giving the impression that Henderson had recanted. Its foundation was probably certain expressions lamenting Scottish interference in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> affairs.</p>
<p>Henderson is one of the greatest men in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Scotland_0851.html" title="History of Scotland">history of Scotland</a> and, next to <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knox.html" title="Knox">Knox</a>, is certainly the most famous of Scottish ecclesiastics. He had great <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a>; and his <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statesmanship.html" title="Statesmanship">statesmanship</a> was so influential that he was, as <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masson.html" title="Masson">Masson</a> well observes, a cabinet minister without office. He has made a deep mark on the history, not only of Scotland, but of England; and the existing Presbyterian churches in Scotland are largely indebted to him for the forms of their dogmas and their ecclesiastical organization. He is thus justly considered the second founder of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Church_731b.html" title="Reformed Church">Reformed Church</a> in Scotland.</p>
