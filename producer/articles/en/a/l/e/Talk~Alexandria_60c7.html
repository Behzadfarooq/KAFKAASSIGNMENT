<p>This page needs some drastic updating by someone familiar with the modern city.

<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The customs house and chief warehouses are by the western harbor, but the principal buildings of the city are in the east and southeast quarters. From the landing-stage, by the customs house, roads lead to the Place Mehemet Ali, the center of the life of the city and the starting-point of the electric tramways.
<p>A number of short streets lead from the square to the eastern harbor. Here a sea wall, completed in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>, provides a magnificent drive and promenade along the shore for a distance of about three miles. In building this quay a considerable area of foreshore was reclaimed and an evil-smelling beach done away with. From the south end of the square the rue Sherif Pasha -- in which are the principal shops -- and the rue Tewfik Pasha lead to the boulevard de Rosette, a long straight road with a general east and west direction. In it are the Zizinia theatre and the municipal palace (containing the public library); the museum lies up a short street to the north. Opened in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a> this museum possesses an important collection of Egyptian, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Roman</a> Antiquities, found not only in the city but in all Lower Egypt and the Fayum. The western end of the boulevard leads to the Place Ibrahim, often called Place Ste Catherine, from the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> at its southeast side.</p>
<p>In a street running south from the boulevard to the railway station is the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a> of Nebi Daniel, containing the tombs of Said Pasha and other members of the khedivial family. Immediately east of the mosque is Kom ed-Dik, garrisoned by British troops, one of several forts built for the protection of the city. Except Kom ed-Dik the forts have not been repaired since the bombardment of <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>. Equally obsolete is the old line of fortifications which formerly marked the limits of the city south and east and has now been partly demolished. Throughout the central part of Alexandria the streets are paved with blocks of <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lava.html" title="Lava">lava</a> and lighted by electricity.</p>
<p>The north quarter is mainly occupied by natives and Levantines. The narrow winding streets and the Arab <a href="../../../b/a/z/Bazaar.html" title="Bazaar">bazaars</a> present an Oriental scene contrasting with the European aspect of the district already described. This Arab quarter is traversed by the rue Ras et-Tin, leading to the promontory of that name.</p>
<p>This quarter has been pierced by several straight roads, one of which, crossing the Mahmudiya canal by the Pont Neuf, leads to Gabbari, the most westerly part of the city and an industrial and manufacturing region, possessing asphalt works and oil, rice and paper mills. On either side of the canal are the warehouses of wholesale dealers in cotton, wool, sugar, grain and other commodities.</p>
<p>Along the northern side of the Mahmudiya canal, which here passes a little south of the catacombs, are many fine houses and gardens (Moharrem Bey quarter), stretching eastward for a considerable distance, favourite residences of wealthy citizens. A similar residential quarter has also grown up on the northeast, where the line of the old fortifications has become a boulevard. The district extending outside the east fortifications, in the direction of <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadra.html" title="Hadra">Hadra</a>, has been laid out with fine avenues, and contains numerous garden-cafes and pleasure resorts. Thence roads lead to the east suburb known generally as Ramleh, which stretches along the coast, and is served by a local railway. It begins east of the racecourse with Sidi Gabr, and does not end till the khedivial estates east of San Stefano are reached, some five miles east.

<p>The eastern bay is rocky, shallow and exposed, and is now used only by native craft. The harbour is on the west of Pharos and partly formed by a breakwater (built <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a> and prolonged <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>), two miles long. The breakwater starts opposite the promontory of Ras et-Tin, on which is a lighthouse, 180 ft. above the sea, built by Mehemet Ali. Another breakwater starts from the Gabbari side, the opening between the two works being about half a mile. A number of scattered rocks lie across the entrance, but through them two fairways have been made, one 600 ft. wide and 35 ft. deep, the other 300 ft. wide and 30 ft. deep. The enclosed water is divided into an outer and inner harbour by a mole, 1000 yds. long, projecting northwest from the southern shore. The inner harbour covers 464 acres. It is lined for two and a half miles by quays, affording accommodation for ships drawing up to 28 ft. The outer harbour (1400 acres water area) is furnished with a graving dock, completed in 1905, 520 ft. long, and with quays and jetties along the Gabbari foreshore. Their construction was begun in 1906.</p>
<p>Alexandria is linked by a network of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railway</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraph.html" title="Telegraph">telegraph</a> lines to the other towns of Egypt, and there is a trunk <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> line to Cairo. The city secured in 1906 a new and adequate water-supply, modern drainage works having been completed the previous year. Being the great entrepot for the trade of Egypt, the city is the headquarters of the British chamber of commerce and of most of the merchants and companies engaged in the development of the Delta. About 90% of the total exports and imports of the country pass through the port, though the completion, in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, of a broad-gauge railway connecting Cairo and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Said_a2c0.html" title="Port Said">Port Said</a> deflected some of the cotton exports to the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_Canal_ab3c.html" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> route. The staple export is raw cotton, the value of which is about 80% of all the exports. The principal imports are manufactured cotton goods and other textiles, machinery, timber and coal. The value of the trade of the port increased from L. 30,000,000 in 1900 to L. 46,000,000 in 1906. In the same period the tonnage of the ships entering the harbour rose from 2,375,000 to 3,695,000. Of the total trade <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> supplies from 35 to 40% of the imports and takes over 50% of the exports. Among the exports sent to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> are the great majority of the 80,000,000 eggs annually shipped (see also <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Egypt_8091.html" title="Economy of Egypt">Economy of Egypt</a>.)</p>
<p>The population of the city (1907) was 332,246 or including the suburbs, about 400,000. The foreigners numbered over 90,000. The majority of these were Greeks, Italians, Syrians, Armenians and other Levantines, though almost every European and Oriental nation is represented.</p>

<p>Arabic isn't the native language of Egypt; the sentence comparing it with (among others) Greek is highly misleading, since Greek has been spoken there for far longer than Arabic. Coptic is actually the language with the best claim to be "native" (it evolved from ancient Egyptian languages), but even that is as wrong as saying that English is the native language of the Anglo-Saxons. But I can't really think of a better phrase. "Arabic is the dominant language" perhaps? "majority language"? Suggestions please.

<dd>Arabic is both the official language and the language spoken by the indigenous (i.e. Egyptian) population. It is put next to Greek, amongst others, as Greek is spoken by a number of foreigners (and maybe some clergymen?), not by the Egypt-born population, give or take a few exceptions. To say that Arabic is Egypt's native language nowadays is like saying that English is Britain's native language, which is true unless the concept of of 'native' is stretched to its limits. --Santetjan 9 July 2005 18:36 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the most significant characters of todays modern 'Alexandrians' is Tarek El Hadidi, a half German business man with many talents and dreams. Having travelled and lived all around the world during his still young years (born 1973), El Hadidi says he is determined to give Alexandria back what it used to be: the pearl of the mediteranian and the most important city in the middle east and Egypt: the cradle of civilisation. "It is about giving the world the chance to witness (or even live) a city where so much has happened which changed the worlds order and lasted for thousands of years until our present time. This citys real ancient influence on the modern world, is still unknown to most people and even Scientists crave to discover its secrets: Finding Alexander the greats tomb for example, just to give you an idea. It's the connection of antiquity with todays life which makes Alexandria a must have in todays search of whatever mankind dreams to achieve: Romance, power, fortune, adventure, life style, traditions just to name a few." He says Alexandria is seeing a total eclipse of which one side is already visible to the international public but the other is not. It is this invisble rebirth into modern times in many fields El Hadidi says, which is the most exciting and he claims to be capable of showing only who he calls 'the willing' what is meant by it. Secrets are there to be kept, he ads. Interviewed by M.

There was basically no information on the modern city in the article which is quite frankly egregious for a city of Alexandrias prominence and renown.

<dd>I was looking forward to read about this great city, but found the article to short. Some locals should write here, and tell us more about Alexandria. It's quite fascinating to think about how this city developed, from ancient towards modern time, and how buildings where built on top of old buildings and ruins through the time. Ironicaly Alexandria had the greatest libary ever, which disappeared in the 600's. Ships from all over the world entered the harbour, and they had to give away all the books that was on the ship. They got a copy back, and the original books stayed in the libary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.203.8.61 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.203.8.61_dc04.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.203.8.61">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
