<p>A Recluse and His Long-Hidden Trove of Cars By RITA REIF August 18, 1996</p>
<p>Alexander Kennedy Miller was always something of an eccentric and miser. The son of a wealthy stockbroker from Montclair, N.J., he attended Rutgers University on a scholarship to study mechanical engineering. An anecdote alongside his yearbook picture recounts an occasion on which he zoomed down the street on a motorcycle coatless in the dead of winter, heading to the barber shop <i>for his quarterly haircut.</i></p>
<p>By then he was training to be a pilot and had moved on from collecting license plates to acquiring cars and airplanes. He had bought his first Stutz while still in high school and continued indulging his passion, buying Stutz Bearcats and autogiros, the precursor of the helicopter, for a fraction of their worth at bankruptcy sales and from the Army.</p>
<p>Over the decades, as he grew increasingly eccentric -- taking on a shabby appearance, hiding treasure beneath the floorboards -- Miller assembled the most comprehensive collection of Stutzes known. The 35 low-slung Bearcats, Blackhawks, Bulldogs and even a fire engine were made between 1913 and 1932, the peak years for Stutz production. He also bought other early cars like a Stanley Steamer, a Locomobile, three Franklins, a Henderson and a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.</p>
<p>Only now, three years after Miller's death (at the age of 87, he fell from a ladder while installing a storm window on his house), will his collection be on public display. On Sept. 7 and 8, the 50 vehicles along with thousands of gaskets, engines, shock absorbers and radiator caps that he owned will be auctioned on the 81-acre property on which he lived in this village of 125 residents some 60 miles southeast of Burlington. Christie's of New York expects the sale will total about $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The auction will take place near the cluttered, unheated barns and sheds, thick with cobwebs, in which Miller stored his vehicles on blocks for decades. Collectors have long been aware of Miller's cache of vehicles, but he was so secretive that no one realized the extent of his holdings. The luxury cars, upholstered in leather and trimmed in brass or chrome, still retain their flower vases and weather flaps. But in most cases the paint is chipped and the metalwork has dulled. The upholstery on several cars has been <i>ravaged by the raccoons who slept there,</i> said David Brownell, the editor of Hemmings Motor News, a trade magazine for vintage cars, who is a consultant to Christie's on this sale.</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell agrees with collectors who say that most of the automobiles will be costly to restore. That they are in less than mint condition is reflected in the low estimates published in Christie's catalogue. The prices expected range from $3,000 for a 1923 Stutz touring car to $200,000 for a rakish 1930 Stutz coupe. While sales of Stutzes are rare, a vintage one in prime condition was sold in January for $125,000 at an auction in Scottsdale, Ariz. Earlier, another was sold privately for $400,000.</p>
<p><i>Stutzes are an underappreciated car,</i> Mr. Brownell said. <i>They were an early American sports car, and they racked up quite a record in races and became a status symbol of the rich. When you think of a Stutz you get this image of a low-slung, powerful roadster, bright yellow or red, zooming down the highway at top speed. But so few were made they are seldom on the market.</i></p>
<p>TO NEIGHBORS, MILLER AND his wife, Imogene, were recluses. They had no children, lived frugally, dressing in ragged clothing and rarely socialized beyond church affairs. Miller was a tall man with dark hair and strong features who sported a Hitler-style mustache and did not always shave. <i>Every time you'd try to do business with him, he'd quote the Bible to an annoying degree,</i> Mr. Brownell said. <i>If you asked him whether he'd be interested in selling a car, he'd say, 'You're being covetous.' You'd take it, because this was your entry ticket to see the cars.</i></p>
<p>While neighbors had known of Miller's cars and eccentricities, they were nonetheless surprised by what came to light after his wife's death in February. It was then that investigators for the estate uncovered a million-dollar horde of gold and silver bullion and coins, stowed in safes and in a metal cabinet, which was buried deep in mud under the floorboards of a schoolhouse on the Miller property.</p>
<p>Self-employed throughout his life, Miller ran the Miller's Flying Service in New Jersey in the 1930's, and thereafter he bought and sold planes, cars and parts. He never paid Social Security or income taxes, and now Federal and state officials have brought claims against the estate totaling well in excess of the amount expected from the auction: $7.3 million by the Federal Government and $899,742.45 by the State of Vermont. Another 50 claims have been filed in state probate court by relatives and some of the Millers' favorite religious organizations.</p>
<p>In the early 1940's, when he learned that he was too old to fly in the United States Air Force, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and rose to the rank of captain, ferrying planes to Britain, teaching tactical aviation and salvaging damaged aircraft, some of which he acquired.</p>
<p>In 1946, when he and his wife returned from Canada, they settled in Vermont and bought the 19th-century triple-gabled white clapboard farmhouse, now yellowed with age, in which they lived year round with no central heating, little electricity and antiquated plumbing. Hot water was generated by coils in the wood cookstove. In the late 1970's, after Miller inherited his family home in Montclair, they spent winters there. For decades, though, the Millers traveled far to acquire airplanes or parts. And he often regaled collectors with stories of his feats. Roderick C. Rice, a car buff of Burlington, recalled Miller telling him how he once drove a 1917 Stutz Bulldog, the first car he owned, to St. Louis to pick up an airplane wing. <i>A. K. said he brought it back, driving with the canvas roof down and the wing replacing it, strapped to two-by-fours attached fore and aft,</i> Mr. Rice said.</p>
<p>Steve Teel, who lives a mile or so up the road from the Millers' property and who is writing a biography of Miller, said Miller was always thrifty. <i>Alec and Jean went to England in the 1950's and 60's several times by freighter, working for their passage, of course,</i> he said. Miller, he added, also saved money storing his cars <i>wherever he could find a roof in the barn of a neighbor.</i></p>
<p><i>And once a car was installed, he'd charge the batteries on the host's electricity,</i> he explained.</p>
<p>Miller was tight-fisted with everyone. <i>Once he used S. &amp; H. Green Stamps instead of postage on a card he mailed back to a customer, with his query crossed out and an answer typed in,</i> Mr. Brownell said. <i>That original sender had to pay the 4 cents postage due. He'd skin you anyway he could.</i></p>
<p>Mr. Teel said he continued to wrestle with the seeming incongruities in the Millers' lives. <i>From their photographs when they were young, he looking dapper and she beautiful. They seemed to belong to that slick Stutz-Bearcat time,</i> he said. <i>But when they stepped out of their cars in recent years in their faded vintage clothes, they just seemed shabby.</i></p>
