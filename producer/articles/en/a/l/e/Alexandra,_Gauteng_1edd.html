<p><b>Alexandra</b> (sometimes nicknamed "Alex") is a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Township_%28South_Africa%29_7f25.html" title="Township (South Africa)">township</a> located in <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauteng_province.html" title="Gauteng province">Gauteng province</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. It is situated on the outskirts of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, close to the wealthy suburb of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandton.html" title="Sandton">Sandton</a> and is bounded by <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynberg%2C_Gauteng_6578.html" title="Wynberg, Gauteng">Wynberg</a> on the west, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlboro%2C_Gauteng_73c7.html" title="Marlboro, Gauteng">Marlboro</a> and Kelvin on the north, and <a href="../../../k/e/w/Kew%2C_Gauteng_932e.html" title="Kew, Gauteng">Kew</a>, Lombardy West and Lombardy East on the south. In contrast, Alexandra is one of the poorest urban areas in the country.</p>
<p>Alexandra is situated on the banks of the <a href="../../../j/u/k/Jukskei_River_937a.html" title="Jukskei River">Jukskei River</a>. The township covers an area of more than 8&#160;kmÂ² and has an estimated population of 470,000 people. In addition to its original, reasonably well-built houses, it also has a large number (estimated at more than 20,000) of informal dwellings or "shacks".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra%2C_Gauteng_1edd.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Alexandra was established in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912_in_South_Africa_8756.html" title="1912 in South Africa">1912</a>, on land originally owned by a farmer, a Mr. Papenfus, who tried to establish a white residential township there, naming it after his wife, Alexandra. However, due to the fact that it was (at the time) a considerable distance from the center of Johannesburg, this was not a great success.</p>
<p>Consequently, in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912_in_South_Africa_8756.html" title="1912 in South Africa">1912</a>, Alexandra was proclaimed as a so-called "native township". Because the township was proclaimed prior to the South African <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913_in_South_Africa_578f.html" title="1913 in South Africa">1913</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Land_Act_3d3e.html" title="Native Land Act">Land Act</a>, it was one of the few urban areas in the country where black people could own land under a freehold title.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916_in_South_Africa_406d.html" title="1916 in South Africa">1916</a>, the population of Alexandra had grown to 30,000 people and thus the Alexandra Health Committee was established to manage the township. However, the Committee was not allowed to collect local taxes, nor was the Johannesburg City Council willing to take responsibility for an area that it claimed fell outside its jurisdiction, leading to a lack of resources and proper management.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_%28South_Africa%29_eca4.html" title="National Party (South Africa)">National Party</a> came into power in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_in_South_Africa_fd34.html" title="1948 in South Africa">1948</a> and started to implement its policy of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>, Alexandra was put under the direct control of the then Department of Native Affairs. The government's main aims for "dealing with" Alexandra were the reduction of the population, the control of movement into the area and the expropriation of freehold property. However, unlike many black freehold areas such as <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophiatown.html" title="Sophiatown">Sophiatown</a>, it was never the intention of the government to remove blacks from Alexandra entirely, as it was too valuable as a labour pool to serve Johannesburg. Despite this, about 50,000 people were forcibly moved to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tembisa.html" title="Tembisa">Tembisa</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/w/Soweto.html" title="Soweto">Soweto</a>.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the government decided to demolish all family accommodation in Alexandra and replace them with single-sex hostels, which led to widespread resistance and protest. However, due to the high costs, lack of alternative housing for the persons that would have to have been removed and the escalating opposition led by the Rev Sam Buti's Save Alexandra Party, only two hostels were actually completed, and so the scheme was cancelled in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_in_South_Africa_f7eb.html" title="1979 in South Africa">1979</a>.</p>
<p>The riots that started in Soweto in June <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_South_Africa_46bb.html" title="1976 in South Africa">1976</a> quickly spread to other areas such as Alexandra, where 19 people were killed. As a consequence of these riots, the government modified their strategy somewhat. Evictions, forced removals expropriation of black properties were stopped; urban blacks were no longer regarded as temporary residents and their permanent status was recognised.</p>
<p>Finally, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_in_South_Africa_88be.html" title="1982 in South Africa">1982</a>, Alexandra was given the official status of a residential area and the then Alexandra liaison committee, led by Rev Buti, was instituted to run the township.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_South_Africa_489b.html" title="1980 in South Africa">1980</a> a "Master Plan" for Alexandra was introduced, which aim was to transform Alexandra into a "Garden City" with a completely new layout. However, only a small part of this plan was actually ever implemented; the execution of the "Master Plan" was permanently stopped by the violent "Alex Six Days" uprising in February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, during which 40 people were killed. By May the council started collapsing and the councillors resigned which saw the emergence of street committees and peoples' courts. After the imposition of the nationwide state of emergency in June, the Defence Force moved in to keep the peace. In its place, the government introduced the "Urban Renewal Plan" as part of its strategy during the state of emergency. However, this plan lead to considerable demolitions, disruptions and displacement in the community as well as two treason trials involving 13 leaders of Alexandra.</p>
<p>This, combined with the considerable number of additional people moving into Alexandra during this time, led to a new area called the "East Bank" being built.</p>
<p>Because of the insufficient capacity and difficult maintenance of the newly built infrastructure, the situation quickly deteriorated and thus the "Urban Renewal Plan" was shelved in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>.</p>
<p>During the communal and political conflicts that took place in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> period, many people were killed, injured or displaced. This led to several peace initiatives, which were greatly assisted by the first fully democratic South African elections in April <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. It was a source of great pride to the community that <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, a former resident of the community, became the first black president of South Africa.</p>
<p>In order to assist in renewing and uplift the community, the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Renewal_Project_9831.html" title="Alexandra Renewal Project">Alexandra Renewal Project</a> was launced in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_South_Africa_838f.html" title="2000 in South Africa">2000</a>. Approximately 3,000 houses built for relocation purposes to date.</p>
