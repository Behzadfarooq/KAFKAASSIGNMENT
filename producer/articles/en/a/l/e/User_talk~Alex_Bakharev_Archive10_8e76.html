<p>By what right do you delete Category:Genocide from <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a> article. Even if you are an admin of Wiki, you have no power and right to neglect the law. Any discussions are profitable before the law was accepted. But now law says: "Holomor is a genocide", so be so kind not edit the Holodomor article.--133.41.4.46 10:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note.</p>
<ul>
<li>Massacres in Ruanda and Holocost are recognized as a genocide in UN</li>
<li>Armenian genocide, Holodomor, ethnic cleaning in former Yugoslavia are recognizes as genocides by law of several countries</li>
<li>Massacres of Mongols in the 13 century are called democide and aren't recognized as genocide--133.41.4.46 10:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are great debates whether the Holodomor was genocide. It is discussed in the article. We include in the Category the facts that all the scholars agree about. This is not the case. See the discussions on the talk page of the article and archives. Genocide is a subcat of Democide, it includes such disastrous events as <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>. Nobody of the sane people deny that millions died there, that is argued if a specific national group was targeted. Thus Democide is a good compromise <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 11:12, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anon, the law only defines Genocide. To be exact it is defined by the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Convention provides only a definition and does not list any specific cases. As such, it is up to scholars, anot not the governments to agree or disagree on whether the definition fits a specific case. The scholarly debate is still unresolved as presented in the article. Your opinion, while valuable, belongs only to a talk. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 11:14, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I am not saying no group can do more than 3RR, though I think as a basic principle only 1RR should be done anyway. Simply alternating reverts till someone gets to 4RR and a block doesn't seem a good policy. Irpen could have been blocked for his actions. I've made my points and that's as far as I wish to take things. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> does not like the way the poll is going, so he decided to restart a new one on his own whimsy. I removed his new, completely unjustified vote proposal twice (it is only a rehash of the vote already occuring), while I attempted to persuade him on his talk page that going ahead will only introduce further chaos into the discussion. In the meantime, I also tried to explain to him on his talk page that his course of action is unreasonable, not least because it disrespects the votes of 12 other people who have already voted. That is all I can do. If he persists in introducing his proposal, I will not stop him. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 05:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Editcountitis is used humorously to suggest a belief that a Wikipedian's overall contribution level can be measured solely by their edit count. This is a phenomenon which some think may be harmful to processes such as requests for adminship, as well as to the Wikipedia community in itself. The problems with using edit counts to measure relative level of experience are that it does not take into account that users could have an extensive edit history prior to registering an account (posting anonymously), and that major and minor edits are counted equally, regardless of whether the edit is a typo fix, or the creation of a full article.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, edit counts do not judge the quality of the edits, as insightful comments on talk pages and acts of vandalism are counted equally. Hence, it is not always a reliable way of telling how experienced or worthy a user truly is. Nevertheless, using the edit count tool is often useful for obtaining a very rough idea of how the editor interacts with the Wikipedia and how much experience he or she has.</dd>
<dd>All edits are perfectly welcome, including trivial edits like fixing typos. Each edit consumes disk space and other resources, so please don't edit in a manner intended to artificially increase your edit count, such as never using preview. Using Kate's tool to see where you are relative to some personal milestone (like 1,000 or 5,000 edits) is perfectly fine. Remember what we're all doing here is building an encyclopedia, not competing to see who makes the most edits.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would hope that you wouldn't think that a lack of <i>counted</i> edits would detract from my ability to do sysop duties.

It was comforting to learn that you, like me and several others, are concerned about the Project. I do believe that the Project shall continue to thrive despite several negative factors as wikipedians have repeatedly demonstrated their agility as the most vibrant virtual community. Ultimately, nothing is going to deter wikipedians from accomplishing the mission for which we all have gathered together. You could have noticed that immediately at the suggestion of <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a>, I had "forgotten" the matter. But, certainly, none would like to be called a "troll".

<p>Hi Alex, was asked by Evrik to look into his block. I was reviewing WP:AIV at the same time you were earlier and saw Ryulong's post, which was in error. I'm assuming this is what prompted your warning message. I see things escalated after Evrik removed the template messages from his talk page. I've advised Evrik not to remove administrative warnings even if he thinks they were placed in error. Would you consider unblocking him?

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>Clearly you're not familiar with the conflict. It spans several Wikis. First of all, my initial message to him was polite. His response was very rude. My second message was also polite. Rather than respond, he simply deleted it from his talkpage.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of a pattern he has enforced at the Wikis where he is an admin - whether or not a user is a native speaker, if they criticise him in any way, he has banned them, including a native speaker of Uighur, even though they didn't vandalise at all. He then deletes all of their messages on talkpages.</p>
<p>As you can see, above he requested that I be banned from en.wiki. And look at the message he left on my talk page just before you. Can you honestly expect me to continue assuming good faith after he has pretty much proven he hates my guts? --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 05:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alex, this is a problem that concerns several Wikis (not just the Uyghur Wikipedia, but the Hawai'ian Wikipedia, as well as several other Wikipedias Jose is "helping" at). I'm not sure Jose has an account on Meta, anyhow, this conflict is confined to user talk pages. Saying that his writing was "hissing" is not a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. On the contrary, it is a subjective description of the rude and uncivil tone Jose77 used in his initial response to me as well as in all subsequent responses. Again, while you may be attempting to be fair, I will remind you that I was only concerned with solving a problem peacefully in my first two messages (which have since been deleted by Jose77) and that I was very polite. In my 3rd message, I was extremely terse, but again I did not say anything which was a personal attack. Indeed, he did ban a user on the Uyghur Wikipedia for expressing their opinion. This is verifiable, even the reason he gave for the ban confirms it. I have not so far acted outside of policy. You seem to be prejudiced against me based on previous experiences with me. May I remind you that those were in topics that are completely unrelated to this, took place several months ago, and that you weren't even directly involved with those (I don't recall you commenting on any of the talkpages or banning any users or locking any pages, just a warning or two to me for "bad behaviour" which you seem to have judged entirely outside the scope of aforementioned conflict). Other users involved in that conflict, including Oleg Alexandrov, Mikkalai, and Irpen, should be able to confirm that I am not, as you have told Jose, "known to be excessively confrontational and stubborn". If anyone here has made a personal attack, it's you or Jose -- I'm surprised at you, having said what you did. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 09:27, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Node, I want to say sorry if you consider that I say to Jose as a personal attack against you. It was not my intention. Still no amount of consensus here would change anything on the Uighur or Hawaiian wiki, so I would suggest to move your argument there it matters - either to these wikis or to the Meta. I have no authorities over these places, so you have to go there by yourself. On English Wiki this argument is empty that does not help to build English-language encyclopedic content, you welcome to keep civil discussion here but I would not tolerate any incivility here, not from you nor from Jose. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 09:54, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you really believe Image:Merridien Web.png is a good example of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobia.html" title="Russophobia">Russophobia</a>? Somehow I doubt it. You may not like to hear this, but Russians on holiday do not have a very good name. And this is quite understandable, because certainly in the first years after the fall of communism, the new wealthy Russians were able to go abroad. And typically, these people did not acquire their fortune by being nice; this reflects on their personality, and they typically think they own the world and order other people about. Also typically, they create an awful mess in their hotel rooms, which could explain the additional charge. Of course, this situation is awkward for an ordinary Russian, and on my travels in Russia, I have befriended many people who would make an excellent impression abroad, but are unable to go there financially. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 23:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, statistically, black people of the United States are much more often involved into violent crimes (both as perpetuates and victims). Still an announcement in a hotel "Blacks - 20% extra" would be rightfully considered racist. I do not see much more difference here. In fact the announcement came to my attention after my coworker (with whom I share my office) was booking his holidays. He has been living in Australia for the last 15 years, AFAIK not particular violent nor excessively rich. Speaking of the article it is indeed biased. IMHO there are two main POVs on the matter: 1) The Russophobia is a very important phenomenon, 2) It happens now and then but not a big deal. The article seems to be strongly biased towards the first POV, while the second seems to be the mainstream. I simply do not know how to fix the problem. It is difficult to prove that something is not a big deal (maybe some sort of statistics would help here). The problem is shared by all the X-phobia type of articles. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 23:36, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Every word of the article is from western newspapers. They are very anti-Russian, I know. I don't know what your setiments are, but I think, based on the English articles I have read, despite the American propoganda, I think <a href="../../../t/v/6/TV6_Russia_72db.html" title="TV6 Russia">TV6 Russia</a> should have been closed.</p>
<p>I don't read Russian very well. Please take the time to <b>add verifiable sources</b> to this artile, preferably russian sources, to "even out" the bias.</p>
<p>I am guessing about what portions you think are not neutral, becuase you really didn't explain.</p>
<p>Also, in the future, please comment on the talk page why you want the NPOV tag to be added, many people remove this tag if you don't comment on the talk page.</p>
<p>I will keep the tag for a week, and if no one has come forward to explain why it is not neutral, after a week I will remove it. Udachi Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 07:40, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am surprised that their have been so many revolutions in the FSU. I never thought it could happen in my dear Ukraine. I really despise so much about Americans, but their ideologies and their beliefs really work. What I saw in Ukraine, I don't have very much hope for those in the FSU. There is not the Protestant work ethic or value system like Americans. The corruption and the alcholism is so complete in Ukraine. Ukrainians are too timid, to patient, to willing to follow others. I feel so bad for my dear Ukrainian friends and their bleak futures. I predict there will be many, many more <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Gusinsky_3f0b.html" title="Vladimir Gusinsky">Vladimir Gusinskys</a>.

<p>Hi, Alex. This person has been subjecting people to repeated personal attacks of the lowest kind (you may see previous blocks on his page), and he has just launched in a disgusting diatriabe against me on my talk page (because I have told him repeatedly to list entries for persons by family name, and he has not understood what I meant on any of those occassions). The messages are in Romanian, and are both threatening and obscene from one end to the other. I have told him, following his first reply, that I will appeal for a ban, and he has replied that he has tens of accounts opened, and threatened to ruin my reputation (?). I can indicate one of the accounts he uses, but I have to check my archived talk pages. I think his large contribution of spam and inaccuracies will help pinpoint all accounts he has opened or intends to open.Thank you for your attention. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Alex, please consider locking this article [2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy] based on RV wars, POV deletions and huge dispute over the article. Until somebody can resolve this issue, the article should be locked from being edited and contents being deleted. I think Girla has gone too far in his attacks on Kober. Many times i offered him co-operation<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79872670" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79872670" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> but unfortunately it did not work.

<p>Dear Alex, I need your advice, cause i do not want to involve in any edit war but there is on going war against every turks/turkey related articles by users tekleni and hectorian. Actually, i'm trying not to take them into account but i'm confronting with these users almost all the turks/turkey related articles. I'll give you a recent example. The article Turkish Republic of Western Thrace is merged with the article Republic of Gumuljina by user tekleni (who is supported by user hectorian) without building any consensus on the talk/discussion page. These greek nationalists (can be realized from their contributions history) are now trying to delete the article. If you investigate their contributions history, you'll immediately discover that these users are trying to dispute everything related with turks/turkey related subjects. Wikipedia should not be a propaganda or advertisement service for turkish hostility. What should we do? <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 06:15, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Alex, please check my contributions, my edit summaries and the messanges i have posted, and u will see if i am a nationalist or not... User:E104421 had been adding a tag in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antalya.html" title="Antalya">Antalya</a> asking for a citation about... (?), i guess etymology and history of the greek name. i removed the request for citation cause i could not believe someone could dispute something so obvious! he insisted, so i added a source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antalya&amp;curid=361527&amp;diff=80960810&amp;oldid=80959038" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antalya&amp;curid=361527&amp;diff=80960810&amp;oldid=80959038" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> (note that's not a greek one).

<dd>Why you (Hectorian and Tekleni) are so fast about merging and deleting? You never mentioned anything in the talk/discussion page but decided together to delete the article. Your contributions history simply reveals what you are doing in wikipedia againts turks/turkey related articles. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 07:20, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For Antalya article, i just wondered whether the information is correct or not? In academical writing, references should be given for these kind of information. However, you (hectorian and tekleni) merged the article, and now trying to delete it by voting. Furthermore, i never edited anything about the article <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Western_Thrace_1bbd.html" title="Turkish Republic of Western Thrace">Turkish Republic of Western Thrace</a>, but just wondered why you are trying to remove/delete it, and ask Alex what to do. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 07:33, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have merged the history of the articles as it was requested by Khoikhoi. Now in the history of the article we can see contributions of the authors of the both original articles, the authorship rights of everybody according to <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> and everybody is happy. Despite the scary template, merging of histories only means that an article is in the deleted state for a few seconds, no reasons to worry. Everybody on the Wiki is now and then accused of been a <i>nationalist</i>, I was accused in been Russian Nationalist, Zionist and Ukrainian Nazi as well as Russophobe, Anti-Semite, Polonophobe, Anti-Ukrainian, Anti-Romanian, Anti-German etc. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">User:E104421</a> was accused as beed Anti-Turkish (probably as been a Greek nationalist) straight for the very first of his edits.

<dd>Hallo Alex. I noticed that the page on Samos Island has been locked. Earleir today I noticed that the page had a few mistakes which I attempted to change. For example: The Samos "muscat grape" was refered as "Vathy grape" which is obviously wrong; "Vathy" does not exist as a name of any grape apellation, it is just the name of the old town of Samos!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another piece of information that I found quite irrelevant was located at the top of the Samos Island page therefore of promient importance and refered to the actual name of Samos Island in the Turkish language as being "Sisam". As an inhabitant of Samos Island I find this piece of information to be irrelevenat, misrepresenting and offensive. Samos is a Greek island with Greek inhabitants since antiquity. At one point in time over a century ago it was under Ottoman power but only as a semi-independent state with special privileges. There was never a Muslim/ Ottoman/Turkish minority on the island just a small guard and typically a Christian governor of Greek nationality appointed by the sultan. Secular modern state of Turkey was created after the fall of the Ottoman empire and long after the war of independence of Greece and particulalrly Samos which became once again a part of the state of Greece in 1913. Therefore according to historical facts there is no reason to state any other names for Samos apart from that which is Greek and recognised all around the world since antiquity. The malovalent claims of some Turkish politicians and military chiefs in recent years over the Aegean and Greek islands make this sort of misleading piece of information even more dangerous. I kindly request that under these circumstances and within the context of the encyclopedic information presented by Wikipedia that the Turkish name of Samos be excluded from the Samos Island page. What would happen if anyone would just visit any other city/location description and add different ethnic names? I hope this request is found logical and just and this matter is corrected appropriately!

<p>Privet, Alex!</p>
<p>This is regarding the issue about <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisss_0f2f.html" title="User:Fisss">User:Fisss</a> uploading unsourced images and falsifying licenses that I brought up on Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents. You were the only admin who commented there, and you asked that somebody goes through the images Fisss uploaded and looks for possible copyvios. Well, I did. Then the issue got archived and no action has been taken. Fisss continues uploading tons of images with no source info and removing the tags that I added (e.g. here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Moskwa4.jpg&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Moskwa4.jpg&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Moskwa4.jpg&amp;action=history</a> or here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Bolshoytheatre.jpg&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Bolshoytheatre.jpg&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Bolshoytheatre.jpg&amp;action=history</a> ).</p>
<p>So, I'm a little confused. What's the story with that issue? Should I continue tagging the images? Should I just let it be?.. <a href="../../../a/z/o/User%7EAzov_7723.html" title="User:Azov">Azov</a> 21:59, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Alex. This time the problem is out of wikipedia but related with the web site. Khoikhoi warned me that the person called warrior soul started a propaganda campaign in his web site [<a href="http://warriorsoul.4t.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://warriorsoul.4t.com/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>], cause this is a kind of <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trol</a>-feeding, i did not replied. This person claims that the link to his site was removed by me (which is incorrect) and accusing us as virtual thefts. I think he's a paranoid. Actually, you know, i'm not an army expert and involved in this edit conflict in order to remove the mess of main equipment list and reverted the lists prior to the edit war and made some arrangements for army and gendermarie. For the navy and the coast guard the information is directly taken from the official sites. Many other wikipedians later involved in editing later and the articles are progressing day by day. I want to know your opinion and proposals about this issue. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 13:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There were different proposals about the name of the article and Khoikhoi offered voting. However, the voting process ended so fast (6 days) preventing many users (including the ones who contributed the article more) to involve in the process. Just 8 users voted with 5 support and 3 oppose. Furthermore, the last two voters are Tekleni and Hectorian who push the same POV all the time. The session is closed immediately after their voting by SysOp <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">User:Duja</a>. Is this a fair process?

<dd>Correction, total 7 votes, 5 support and 2 oppose.

I presume you removed the gallery because it was using images from Commons, which does not accept fair use images (something I only recently learned). Would there be any problem with my moving more images over to En or uploading new ones so that the gallery can be restored? Also, do you know of a way to transfer images directly without downloading them to another computer first? --<a href="../../../j/t/i/User%7EJtir_03f8.html" title="User:Jtir">Jtir</a> 16:26, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I didn't know fair use implied such severe restrictions, but I do know you have done a lot of work uploading gallery images. When Serebryakova's heirs donated her works did they retain copyrights? (IANAL so this may not be the right question.) If the museums have the copyrights they might be easier to contact. I discovered an art history professor whose major area of research is Russian and Soviet art and who has written on Serebryakova. <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/hiltona/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/hiltona/index.html" rel="nofollow">She has an email address</a>. --<a href="../../../j/t/i/User%7EJtir_03f8.html" title="User:Jtir">Jtir</a> 20:46, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I myself criticized Halibutt for his recent action, I find the tone of the note you left on his userpage way too strong. <i>you could get blocked from editing Wikipedia for it. You might not get another warning before having a block imposed</i> - what?? For creating two articles under wrong names? Sure, it was intentionall, but I find it hard to find that offending, or overall very disruptive. As you have always been one of the voices of reasons in the debates we all know too well, I'd hope this is not changing. PS. Considering the amount of slander and attacks directed at Halibutt, I am amazed he has not left this project. We should support him, and deal with those who break WP:CIV and other policies, instead of punishing him when he is dragged down to their level.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 03:23, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bravo, Piotrus. <b>Your level</b> reached such heights that I'm afraid it will not be reachable anytime soon by anyone. Just quick question - when did any of Lithuanian editors came up xenophobic and pejorative remarks like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Eustachy_Tyszkiewicz&amp;diff=80436791&amp;oldid=80024074" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Eustachy_Tyszkiewicz&amp;diff=80436791&amp;oldid=80024074" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and when did Lithuanian Wiki ADMINS rushed to the scene to deffend it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Laurynas_Gucevi%C4%8Dius&amp;diff=81089216&amp;oldid=81086800" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Laurynas_Gucevi%C4%8Dius&amp;diff=81089216&amp;oldid=81086800" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>? But of cause when <b>your level</b> is reached, it is very hard to see what is so offensive about making pejorative remarks regarding the way some nations construct their surnames. It's just a joke anyway. God, those -as, -is, -us are so funny, but multiplied by ten, it's ten times funnier - Tiskeviciusasasusisisisus. I must agree really, really funny.

<dd>Thanks for milding it out. A small sidenote to what Piotrus wrote: either I created all of my articles under wrong names, which indeed seems to be offending to our fellow Lithuanians, or only one article. Not two, if I'm right. But still, while my bad level joke might have been of some (minor possibly, given the popularity of the subject, but still) harm to the project's credibility, it was by no means aimed at the Lithuanians. After all all names in the world have their Lithuanian version with their suffixes and their grammar, and using one of those names should not be considered offensive to anyone. Certainly it wasn't meant as such and certainly it wasn't understood as such (proof being lack of complaint this time; our dear Lithuanians have accused me of so many things recently that I'm pretty sure they would use this occasion to finally find some back-up for their slander). <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 05:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alex, please be so kind as to enlighten me how the heck am I supposed to "return to working relations" with people who constantly slander my good name yet show not enough guts to either apologize or withdraw their accusations? Sure, fine, I could stand it for half a year (as the talk pages of, for instance, <a href="../../../w/a/w/Wawrzyniec_Gucewicz_5941.html" title="Wawrzyniec Gucewicz">Wawrzyniec Gucewicz</a> show), but how much more?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've wasted enough of my time on trying to settle the things politely at the talk pages - to no avail. All I get in response is slander. My patience has ended. I could apologize to Lithuanians for placing an article on apparent Pole under his Lithuanian name only if our fellow Lithuanians act likewise and apologize for placing articles on apparent Poles under Lithuanian names. Sorry, tit for tat is the only way it works here. Sad but true, the only way to be just is to apply the same rules to both sides. I waited half a year before loosing my nerves. Now I feel excused.</dd>

<dd>I've lost all hope and belief in wiki rules, as they do not prevent some people from offending me and not even getting a comment from anyone. Just imagine what would happen if I started acting the same way they do. Some guys are moving pages all around and, when pressed to provide any evidence, just resort to personal remarks and unsupported accusations. But when I, after half a year of discussing and repeating my <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">plea for sources</a> over and over again, do the very same thing, I'm instantly bashed. Of course if I went further their way and accused them of, say, paedophilia, anti-Polish sentiment and hatred towards anything Polish, I would instantly be blocked. Is that just? Should I apologize for that as well? <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 08:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Alex, I had already changed the licence on commons to {{PD-Art}}, which I think is appropriate here. And I did the same for many more two-dimensional reproductions of works of art, formerly licensed under {{PD-Soviet}}. {{PD-USSR}} definitely is not the proper license for these works. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 12:04, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I saw it. I am not sure the changes are correct as the PD-art is for the reproductions of images that became public domain because of age. Thus, digital reproductions of <a href="../../../w/l/a/Wladimir_Burliuk_d260.html" title="Wladimir Burliuk">Wladimir Burliuk</a> are PD-art (the image was PD and making digital copies does not create new copyright) but reproductions of his brother are not (since the original were not PD).

<p>Hi, Alex. I need some tools (i heard that there are tools helping edits) to make my edits more easier, cause whenever i open another explorer window to compare the articles, i automatically sign out. Some time ago, i accidentally edited with my ip name rather than my user name. I realised this after checking my contributions summary. You know i'm using static ip (144.122.30.134). What do you suggest? Should i use another borrowser or a tool? Cheers <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 19:21, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ol>
<p>The question concerns edits that I made on 31 October 2006 68.166.31.155 and not those made afterwards by others. From other topics you follow and the stance you take there, it does not seem you would object respecting nations who were part of the early Rus state and who do not enjoy being generalized as Russians. I am sure we would agree that the idea of a single Russian people consisting of three brotherly nations of Belorussians, Russians and Ukrainians is undeniably controversial. I am sure that this debate can continue and that cutting and reverting can see its end in eternity, but I hope we can find a better solution.</p>
<p>The edition I tried to make substituting Russian for Rus' does not infringe on the rights of any people that were part of the early Rus period of our lands. You may notice that my substitutions of Russia for Rus' were only made to the early period section. That way, we leave room for people to decide for themselves if Rus and Russia are one and the same. In that sense, to stay true to the spirit of the Internet and the *public* encyclopeadia, is this not what our role is about?</p>
<p>I do not want to make the debate political; I hope you would support the idea of staying as objective as possible to all people involved in the history of the early Rus state in the context of Wiki, for the benefit of those who lived through the history and those who are reading about it now.</p>

I, personally, do not find the distinction Rus-&gt;Russia; Rusian-&gt;Russian to be very important and try to be not involved in the arguments unless in the obvious cases. Clearly the people of 14th-15th century did not see any distinctions in that terms. For me Rus' is the name for the common Eastern Slavic state that collapsed after the Mongol-Tartar invasion. The parts afterwords consolidated arounf Moscow became Russia while the parts that got into the Lithuanian-Polish influence became Ruthenia and then Ukraine and Belarus. As I understand there is very little cultural connections between the Kievan Rus and Ukraine, e.g. Kievan Rus are never mentioned in any folk songs, bylinas, etc. The national heroic epics are concentrated around the cossacks not Vladimirs and Svyatoslavs, etc. Thus, I think reasonable to talk about Rus before the Mongol conquest, and Russia+Ruthenia afterwards. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 06:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Reply from Geolog7: Alex, I apologize, my comment was misplaced. Certainly, the word "pepole" does no exist. As for your opinion on the appropriateness of using Rus', especially where you say "I understand there is very little cultural connections between the Kievan Rus and Ukraine, e.g. Kievan Rus are never mentioned in any folk songs, bylinas, etc.", then by your logic there is too little in common between Russia and the Kiev Rus as well. In reality, though, just walk the streets of Kiev and will not help noticing how much in common there is between the Kiev Rus and Ukraine. It all happened right there. However, if you are trying to refute the connection between the Ukrainian state and the Kiev Rus, truely there is hardly any more connection than between the Roman Empire and Italy. And yet, I am sure you would agree, that has nothing to do with modern Italians taking pride in that state as their past.</p>

<p>Hi, Alex. I have a problem related with <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">User:Khosrow II</a>. I already commented on his talk page but did not work. He's confusing different issues. First, Hilaire de Brenton is a historian focused on Sumerians. Second, Brenton's book is related with a guess on Sumerian language connection with Turkish. Thirdly, it was Hermann F. Kvergić who initiated the hypothesis (Sun Language Theory). I already explained these to him. He's continuously reverting the article to his version and removing the other sourced information, such as an article on Hermann Kvergić, Jens Peter Laut (originally from "Turkic Languages" 6 (2002) (120-133). I had to revert and insert the information back but he never understood. You can see my comments from his talk page <a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhosrow_II_2e38.html" title="User talk:Khosrow II">User talk:Khosrow II</a> also, it's obvious that he ignores other comments. The article is now reflects his inaccurate version. Kind regards <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 17:43, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a source written in 1936 by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> about the Sun Language theory. That is very reliable information for two reasons 1) written by the New York Times and 2) written in 1936, at the time of the theories proposal. Secondly, it was hypothesized that Sumerian was the mother language of all languages, and Turkish "historians" and "academics" of the time, who considered Sumerians Turkic, ran off with the research and said basically that if there is a theory that says Sumerian is the mother langauge of all langauges, and that if we theorize that they were Turkic, then Turkic langauges are the mother languages of all languages on Earth. Thats basically how things happened.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 20:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, all these linguists and historians were not turkish. Furthermore, the new york times does not mention anything about linguistics studies. Anyway, i appreciated Alex's approach to solve the problem. Ok, maybe it's better to mention all, although in my version i had added Hilaire de Barenton to reference section.

I happened to spot vandalism by <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.10_08cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.10">64.12.116.10</a></b> on the <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacey_Chabert_7a96.html" title="Lacey Chabert">Lacey Chabert</a> article, and then decided to see if this was a recurrent vandal, and when I saw <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osip_Mandelstam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85713852" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osip_Mandelstam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85713852" rel="nofollow">his edit</a></b> at the <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osip_Mandelstam_050b.html" title="Osip Mandelstam">Osip Mandelstam</a> article, my intention was to revert his edit, but for some reason I didn't realize this had been already done, and I ended up reverting the anti-vandal revert. This was a big Oops, and while I do make technical mistakes once in a while, I would never intentionally vandalize an article, as you can confirm by looking at <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChaChaFut_42ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChaChaFut">my contributions</a></b>. Plus, I do spend time reverting vandalism, which is what I intended to to on this article (which is of somebody I never heard of&#160;:( ). Earlier today I had to revert about 15 vandal edits by the same user, and I guess I got carried away in doing that. Again, be assured that my intention was good, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time... please accept my sincere apologies, and I will try not to make the same mistake ever again. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaChaFut_8e6e.html" title="User:ChaChaFut">ChaChaFut</a> 03:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>its ok to keep a topic highly POV and ethnically cleanse it so that the counter view is totally suppressed but that i cannot express my opinion about a deranged artist in the discussion section?

<dd>Are you sir insinuating that I am a troll?

<dd>Wait, let me get this straight, are you suggesting that my question regarding the edit amounted to trolling? Are you for real??? Did you read my original reply to your threat? If so did you understand that I did not make a personal attack on anyone in the wiki forum in my original thread? Also, if you read the wiki personal attack policy, you will notice that nothing I said amounts to a personal attack! If you dont agree with this, then please enlighten me by pointing out which personal attack policy I violated. Do you also realize that suggesting that I am a troll amounts to a personal attack according to the PA policy? <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutherian_6635.html" title="User:Lutherian">lutherian</a> 16:11, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Alex. This user warned me not to cite encyclopedias and reverted my edits without any comment on talk/discussion page. Is there something wrong with citing world wide recognized encyclopedias. I think this is common in wikipedia. I still do not understand his action of removing/reverting the information and references for this reason. Could you please explain, what should i do when referring to other encyclopedias? Is it something wrong? I do not think so? If it is, i shall remove them, if not one should warn CRCulver about this.

<dd>Thank you very much for your information. I added the information with sources to the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a> article again, and commented on the talk page about this, but <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> reverted again. What should i do? Should i revert the page? I reverted before but i made no sense.

<p>Hi Alex, May I ask you to throw a cold eye on the Transnistrian main page. I have two suggestions.</p>
<p>1 Only wording that is completely factual and NPOV be allowed. Currently it is littered with POV.</p>
<p>2 Agreed changes be made by a nuetral editor for the time being while the page is locked.</p>
<p>3- Edit warriors be blocked if we reopen the page.</p>

<p>He is vandalizing the article <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hephthalite.html" title="Hephthalite">Hephthalite</a>, constantly deleting the EI and EIr sources, claiming that these two sources are <i>nationalistic and dogmatic</i> (which is pure nonsense, since more than 500 world-renowned scholars, mostly from the USA and Europe, have worked on each of the two).

<li>Hi, Alex.

It was the user Karcha claiming so. Furthermore, i never deleted anything from the article but replaced the introduction paragraph prior to my edit to the etymology section which is more suitable for that paragraph. I never used the terms "nationalistic and dogmatic" and also "Persian nationalists" but i'm accused of being "uneducated hypocrite", "who unable to read and to understand", and "ultra-nationalist" by users <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a>.

<dd>@ Alex Bekharev: I had already talked to <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> as well as <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">User:Sikandarji</a> (who is an academic in Oxford), and both have assured that the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> are HIGHLY reliable and renowned sources. The point is that the Britannica - though it is no doubt a very good source - is NOT specialized on Islamic or Iranian history. It is a general encyclopaedia that collects informations and servs as a general source for everything. The <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> are scholarly works totally <u>specialized</u> on Islamic and Iranian history. Unlike many articles in Britannica which are usually NOT written by scholars, <b>all</b> articles in EI and EIr are written by leading experts, from <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nelson_Frye_f375.html" title="Richard Nelson Frye">Richard Nelson Frye</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Boyce_f2a4.html" title="Mary Boyce">Mary Boyce</a> and <a href="../../../e/h/s/Ehsan_Yarshater_c509.html" title="Ehsan Yarshater">Ehsan Yarshater</a> personally. These two encyclopaedia's are - of course - not gospels, but they are - at this moment - the most detailed and most accurate sources available, and they are THE basis of oriental studies in America and Europe. Just take a look at what scholars say about Iranica: <a href="http://iranica.com/opinion/main.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://iranica.com/opinion/main.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Only this should be enough to prove that - in this case - Iranica is CLEARLY superior to Britannica or Columbia (by the way: the Encyclopaedia Iranica is a grand project of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>!) and thus <b>authoritative</b>. If Britannica says "a", Columbia says "b" and Iranica says "c", then "c" is the most accurate and authoritative answer - "b" and "a" are secondary!</dd>
<dd>@ <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a>: of course you have deleted authoritative sources and called the Iranica and Britannica "POV": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hephthalite&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86238301" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hephthalite&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86238301" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>.

Besides that - as one can see in the first link, as well as in your most recent edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hephthalite&amp;diff=86473353&amp;oldid=86407650" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hephthalite&amp;diff=86473353&amp;oldid=86407650" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> - you have actively reverted the reference to Enoki's "On the nationality of the Hephthalites" (which is <b>THE</b> scholarly reference work on the Hephthalites since 1955) and and the reference to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nelson_Frye_f375.html" title="Richard Nelson Frye">Richard Nelson Frye</a>'s "The Heritage of Central Asia". Just for your information: these two scholars belong to the "mainstream scholars", and as you can see, they do NOT support the claim of Columbia (Britannica does not even mention the ethnic origin of the Hephthalites!).</dd>

<li>(unintending) Firstly, nothing was removed. Dublicate statements and references combined in a single sentence (i recommend to check the final revision, cause other users also contributed and i had to keep theirs because i have no time to check their accuracy, but also keep the "pov-check tag"). Furthermore, there is nothing wrong in the Britannica and Columbia as sources cause these are the world wide recognized ones. The information included in the content of the encyclopedias are of course summaries and does not reflect the current research status. However, as far as i know from the policies of Wikipedia, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia is not a place for original research</a>.</li>

<li><b>Warning</b>: The <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> is making a propaganda against myself. He is commenting on talk pages of users to invite them to contribute against my contributions. He's accusing me as "ultra-nationalist and vandal". I'm presenting the examples here:</li>

<dd>Here is the exact start point the debate:[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tajik#Hephthalites" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tajik#Hephthalites" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>], then [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ali_doostzadeh#Hephthalites" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ali_doostzadeh#Hephthalites" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>], goes on...</dd>
<dd>Funny, they did not realise that Khoikhoi and Hectorian turned out to be my friends. Anyway, I want them to stop this propaganda and personal attacks, cause the users coming to visit the page are starting accusing me without reading my comments and contributions, but keeping the "ultra-nationalistic and vandal" claim in mind.

<p>I have already warned Tajik to be more civil. That is obviously applicable to everybody. These Hun related articles appears to be difficult - there are many opinions and speculations and not many universally accepted facts. The opinions are somehow related to the modern ethnic conflicts. Lets assume good faith to each other and try to separate universally accepted facts, notable mainstream opinions, notable marginal opinions and not-notable crap. Lets keep cool heads and we would find a reasonable solutions <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 13:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, Alex. I strongly agree. I read the Enoki Kazuo's 1959 article mentioned above. He first summaries the old theories of that time based on Chinese chronicles, and continues with that time's modern ones, namely 1. the hun hypothesis, 2. the mongol hypothesis, 3. the turk hypothesis, then 4. the altaic people hypothesis. He also comments on pp.30 that "<i>in any way, the origin of Ephthalites, of which nothing definite has been recorded, should be studied from another angle than an uncertain interpretation of their name. For this purpose, it is necessary to for us to study the history and, if any, cultural characteristics of these people</i>". For this reason, he proposes another claim that there may be an iranian tribe theory also. At the end he concludes as follows "<i>Though my grounds are rather scarce, it is expected that the historical and linguistic materials concerning Ephthalites are to be incread in the future and most of the newly discovered materials seem the more to confirm <b>my</b> iranian-tribe theory</i>". pp.63 "Kazuo Enoki, "On the nationality of Ephthalites 1959". I think the Columbia and Britannica covers updated material concerning this issue, since the online versions are dated 2006. One thing for sure is that nothing definite has been recorded about the origin of the Ephthalites, and more reasearh is needed to identify their origins. In my opinion, the problem related with our wikipedia article is related with lack of reading and patience. If these users, namely <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> would have read the articles, they would immediately realize their claim is not that much considerable. Kazuo Enoki in that article just proposed a new hypothesis dated 1959, that's it.

<li>Hi, do you know if it is allowed to make photographs in Boryspil airport? If no, then we have a good case that the photograph cannot be replaced with a free image since the photography is forbidden there. If the photography is allowed, maybe we can ask a wikipedian from Kyiv to make a photograph for us. There are many Kijans on Wiki 05:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
