<p>Hey Alex. Nice work on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a>. Could you explain the statement that <i>In the past it had always been assumed that there were considerably more transwomen than transmen. However, the ratio is approaching 1:1</i>? I've never heard that before. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimiko_090c.html" title="User:Kimiko">Kimiko</a> 14:39, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Copy of my answer from Kimiko's page; having all those questions on my userpage and no answers looks funny, somehow:</i><br />
I can't find at the moment that nice list of statistics, it is I believe somewhere in the IJT. Anyway, it started with a ration of about 1:100, and then went down something like 1:80, 1:50, 1:10, 1:5.x, 1:3.x, 1:2.x and the latest I found already said 1:1.x. I don't think you need a degree in statistics to see where that is leading. Also, other counts are already up at 1:1 or even have a light overhang of transmen, now that many non-transsexual transmen realise there are options open to them. Those are currently counts from self-help groups or councelers, estimates from judges handling name changes etc. Already the first "scientific" papers estimate that it is 1:1 after all, too.<br />
Also, compare <i>gender variance among female-bodied individuals tends to be relatively invisible to the culture, particularly to mental health professionals and scientists.</i> from the current HBIGDA-SoCs, <a href="http://www.symposion.com/ijt/soc_2001/soc_02.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.symposion.com/ijt/soc_2001/soc_02.htm" rel="nofollow">II.

<p>Hi. Why did you start your user info with something so horrible?</p>
<p>By the way, I think you're right regarding the MtF/FtM ratio. --<a href="../../../e/e/q/User%7EEequor_b13d.html" title="User:Eequor">Eequor</a> 15:53, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Horrible? Not quite so horrible as it sounds - <i>polymorph perverted</i> is classical Freud, simply meaning that sexual preferences are not quite fixed (yet), and <i>Trannyfag</i> means the basic directions they are at the moment - it's also a quite common self-description among gay transmen. Also, I like the face people usually make when I say that. And given that on both the English and the German Wikipedia I am a mayor contributor to these articles, I think it's quite appropriate to mention it on my user page - discreetly of course, as always&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 19:08, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. There is request for mediation I would like to help you and Eequor with. I have scanned the material I think is at the center of the dispute; and have some hope I can help you two, especially as both of you seem to be very nice people. I think we could start like this:</p>
<p><i>You send me E-mail to address (jheiskan "at" welho "dot" com) and include:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>A listing of pages you feel I should have read for context for your dispute (just to be sure).</li>
<li>Stuff you think Eequor may have misunderstood about your position or behaviour and you would like Eequor to understand better.</li>
<li>Stuff you have trouble understanding about Eequors views or ways of acting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I may ask for more later, but let's get started on this.</p>

<p>Hello, I just noted in one of your edit comments that you consider the term "sex change surgery" as prejudicial and infamous. The article on <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_reassignment_surgery.html" title="Sex reassignment surgery">sex reassignment surgery</a> lists "sex change surgery" as an alternative term, without mentioning that some people consider it offensive, and why. Maybe you should add that bit of information, since the term seems to be quite commonly used.

<dd>Done. I wrote the article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_change.html" title="Sex change">sex change</a> a while ago, and it never occured to me to add a link to it elsewhere; I have done so now. Also, the prejudices I mentionend in the comment was refering to other minor things like what was said about western transgendered people, or those neat little quotes around "female" at one point, and similar stuff. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 11:10, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, and I will move it back, because <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=transitioning" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=transitioning" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> gives several more meanings for this word. Even if the disambiguation page for "Transition" point out these meanings, you can be certain that links will appear to this one day which have nothing whatever to do with transgender people. Snowspinner already complained about the "exclusive" usage of Transitioning; even if his comments are not exactly unbiased, I see no reason to have a questionable name for an article when this can be solved so easily. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 11:53, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't think we should "pre-disambiguate" until absolutely necessary (ie when someone wants to disam it they shoud do it then). But it's not <i>that</i> big a deal, and if you think it's best, I won't complain&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 11:55, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given the fact that there are already pretty transphobic people in the WP whom we have to deal with occationally, I opt for giving them as little opportunitiy for attack as possible, when this is possible without sacrifying facts, NPOV and respect. And since I don't think that this particular change is in any way significant, why not being as correctly as possible? Apart from that, though, right now I am wading through internal searches of "transgender" (and will let others follow) so we can make sure no relevant article is missing from the List or my attention. Also, the article von Kate Bronstein seems to be in dire need of attention, among other things, I am not sure at all that it is quite correct to label her as "transsexual". Neverending work here&#160;:-)</dd>

<p>I noticed your edit on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_closet.html" title="The closet">the closet</a> regarding the preferred use of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> over <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgenderism.html" title="Transgenderism">transgenderism</a>, and had a couple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was thinking about reworking that whole sentence (actually, I'm thinking about reworking the whole article), so that it would read something like "<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual.html" title="Bisexual">bisexual</a>, and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgendered</a> persons" - it doesn't have quite the same meaning, as a lot of people will claim that it isn't the <i>people</i> they have a problem with (though I think they're full of it), but it avoids the whole issue of having nouns that aren't quite the same type (like homosexuality and transgender). What do you think?</li>

<p>Re 1. - I was thinking about doing the same thing, but I made the edit while I was busy completing the List of Transgender-related topics with articles I had not yet seen. It is probably the best solution, it reads, even without the trans problem, a bit odd to me. Although actually I have seen "transgender" being used as a noun that way, too. But I do think reworking the article will very much improve it, anyway.<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Great. Well, I'll do the edit tomorrow and let you know if you don't get to it first.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Re 2. - No, I am not, and I don't intend to. Both Sam Spade and Snowspinner are members of that project, and I have seen enough of both for a lifetime. (Although I fear I have not seen the last of them. *sigh*) Have a look at herteronormativity and its history, then you know what I mean. But thank you for the invitation, if there are any questions regarding trans* or trans*-people I am perfectly willing to help out. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 21:01, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It sucks that other members have lessened your interest in the project - I think you'd be a valuable contributor, but I understand, and I'm sure you'll make contributions whether or not you're a member. I've seen the talk page for heteronormativity, and participated a little, and I have to admit I'm a little afraid to go back.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it does suck. But after several months of edit war in heteronormativity I think it is understandabel. I fully understand that you are afraid to go back there, I still breath a sigh of relief when I update my watchlist and don't see this article&#160;;-) And you are right, that is where I saw your name before. Anyway, as I said, I'll help out when I am needed. I keep an eye on all articles regarding trans* anyway; should I miss something, or something new comes up, just let me know. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 10:51, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
