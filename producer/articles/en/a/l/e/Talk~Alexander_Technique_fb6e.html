<p>Start of this talk page: Oct, 2006 Most recent comments at bottom.</p>
<p>I haven't been on this page for a while.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like the page has kind-of degenerated. It is once-again full of what could be called "Alexanderisms", tortured English which only an Alexander Teacher could love.</p>
<p>It is somewhat unfortunate that the whole previous discussion is archived with no new discussion to speak of. I guess this is wikipedia's broad-brush clean-up. I agree the article needs a clean-up. I don't think the multiple for-profits sites listed are spam, though. In the world of alternative medicine, every site is for-profit and trying to get exposure. It's OK or more accurately, it's compatible with the subject matter (much as I might personally like less hucksterism, that is the reality of Alternative Health Practices).</p>
<p>Anyway, if I get time, I might once rewrite this page in English, translating from Alexander-speak as well as I can. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHans_Joseph_Solbrig_5b32.html" title="User:Hans Joseph Solbrig">Hans Joseph Solbrig</a> 05:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, writers tend to change the intro part often. I don't think that people discuss here before editing - they just do it.</p>
<p>If you think that this writing about these ideas are tricky to follow - try reading Alexander himself! Someone who has a linguistics Phd and runs a school on AT came by and reorganized much of the sequence of the sentences, so it reads much better than it did a year ago, but it is slightly different than it was. As a writer you'll find yourself getting very long-winded when you try to explain these ideas without truncating content.</p>
<p>I regarded each of those sites that were listed in links as an endorsement to the agreement of validity of what was written here. Last night I took all the sites out that had no other purpose other than being a billboard or business card. Then someone else came along and nixed every single link, leaving only the reference of Alexander's book that I added. Then today I found that someone had a request sent to change my password. Maybe some irate wikipedist was upset I didn't log in before editing? The completeness of these former links gave a search engine rating and also also motivated people to return to this page to find this resource - so I think they should be reinstated. I wish the person who nixed them would come talk about this here.</p>
<p>I didn't get most of this content for this article from reading but from direct study. I have attended Alexander Technique teacher-training, and was fortunate to be able to learn how to write simply about these very subjective ideas on the advice of many other senior teachers, one of whom was trained by Alexander. Books have been written that agree with content here; however, they are much more long-winded than this article and most do not cover the content that this article discusses in an attempt to be complete. I'm in touch with many of those fellow authors who have written about AT. Many of them have visited to look this over and edit if they desire at my request.</p>
<p>How shall I list these author sources? As endorsements? Franis Oct. 18th 2006</p>

<p>I don't believe the concept of direction in Alexander Technique warrents it's own article, and have flagged that page to be merged into this one. Feedback appreciated. --<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShockeroo_f2c7.html" title="User:Shockeroo">Shockeroo</a> 11:28, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. It's already been merged; see the third paragraph under the heading "In-Depth Principles." I deleted the article, then it came back, with the link at the end in the main article. You're welcome to make the Direction article and quote go away again - but perhaps put a note that it's been merged into the body of the main article in its place? Then the people who put it up again will know that their contribution has been added. I think it reads as an endorsement for the source of the quote, don't you? Unfortunately people don't all that often read the whole article they are adding to. 66.248.87.70 04:21, 30 October 2006 (UTC)Franis Oct 30, 2006</p>
<p>Sorry but the 'direction' article does not seem to me to add much to the discussion. Direction is already explained in the main article. The other one should be cut IMHO. Kccole01 01:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am an Alexander student and I believe that the Alexander technique deserves its own article. The information included in the article is important and describes the information in detail. Perhaps the style could do with some editing, but only the style needs to be changed and not the content. However, if it must be merged, please expand the article on Frederick M. Alexander and include this information in that article. Thank you.</p>

<p>I read the whole bloody thing. I was genuinely interested up to the point where it claimed teachers required "more then 1600+ hours", blah blah blah. I'm sorry. WHAT? That made me distrust the rest of the article, and the whole technique. Now, I'm an American. That might make me a bit quick to call bullshit, but on reading that line I immediately thought that the Alexander Technique was nothing more then a sham trying to gain the respectability of chiropractics. Before saying what the technique does, or at least before saying how respectable it is, tell us what the bloody technique is. And don't feed us the line that itâ€™s hard to write down, Wikipedia has articles on meta-physics. 64.238.49.65 23:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>With all the actual medical "shams" out there these days, I was surprised to see the comment suggesting AT might be a "sham", as that has not been my experience. When I was 7 years old, I had severe head and neck trauma which left me in a brief coma and with lasting moderate neural problems due to neck/whiplash/concussion problems. I am now 43 years old. Over the years the neural problems (like not begin able to see or breathe properly) have become more and more aggravated. However, after 6 months of once-a-week private sessions of 1.25 hours in length with an AT teacher, the symptoms have gradually lessened to the extent that I am feeling much better. Granted, mt experience is not part of a closely controlled double-blind scientific experiment, but my being able to see and breathe properly is an empirical fact. Over the years I have experimented with several different types of body therapies (massage, chiropractic, muscle-strenthening, Feldenkrais) but AT has given the best result, with Fenldenkrais in a close second place. Also, I would say that for me, learning the AT and the type of physical awareness it entails has sometimes been disorienting, which I learned in my reading of the AT literature, is a something commonly reported by people who experience substantial "unwinding/releasing". So, I think AT is a valid therapy, and I am very happy my teacher has extensive training and experience, as I feel myself to be the beneficiary of it. <a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipleitner_d04e.html" title="User:Kipleitner">Kipleitner</a> 18:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)Kip Leitner</p>

<p>I noticed what followed in that objectional paragraph (that has been changed)that shows a professional concern by those in the field for representing their livelihood adequately - perhaps this was the offending "sell." It's a concern that AT teachers want the public to get this information about AT from a brand-name, properly trained AT teacher - sort of additude. I agree this is an opinion or fear among the UK preservationists of F.M. Alexander's work that doesn't belong in this article and it's been removed. (In fact, the AT preservations endorsed this article that was written by a non-member of theirs or any affiliate club.)</p>
<p>I also combed through it and removed superlatives, etc. and other possibly offending characteristics. After I removed the "offending" parts, I took out the "reads like an ad" icon. Then someone re-marked the article again as advertising. Why? Did they even notice that the article had been changed? I guess it only takes one person to have an objection, and once someone focuses on a characteristic it becomes magnified by the fact they are watching for it.</p>
<p>In fact, unlike chiropractice which contains some of the most aggressive selling techinques anywhere, the field of AT is marked by a lack of advertising, with AT teachers usually getting their students solely by personal contact and word of mouth.</p>
<p>In fear that a reader might conclude that an entire of field of study is a "sham" without trying a lesson obviously led someone else in the AT field to add the list of famous people who are or have been students of AT. Perhaps it is this list that continues the make the article seem to read as if it's an ad?</p>
<p>I'm taking off the "ad" icon again. Please talk about where you feel this ad alert should be on if you put it back and I'll be happy to edit the offending parts. Franis 07:30, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The entire article. I'm not stating that it is an ad or is promotional (though I think both), but that the wording is not encyclopedic, and does not present a neutral point of view. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 15:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please answer my question more specifically. I guess it didn't satisfy you to address those specific concerns. Please specify how AT can be explained, without leaving out the salient parts of it, in a NPOV way - please let's do that. Tell me what you think of the list of students. I guess I'll just have to read the NPOV again and see if there is something I could still do for this article. Please, someone who is better at using NPOV, just take out or rewrite the offending language that you believe is at fault and replace it with more neutral wording! I'll be happy to then correct any inherent misconceptions that are in conflict with Alexander's work that pop up in the "translation" process. I guess I could ask some published authors on AT who are my colleagues to improve this for NPOV.. Franis 08:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, that's why I added "students"--this should dispel any notion that the claims this article makes are "sensationalist" according to <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV guidelines</a>.

<p>Okay, here's why the article is NPOV and still reads like an advertisement:</p>
<p>(1) The section "Basic Premesis" is too long, includes infomercial-type rambling and justification about why Alexander Technique is awesome. This section should not be more than two short paragraphs long (perhaps as long as the History section. In fact, most of the sections within the heading "The Technique" are much too long, and can easily be truncated.</p>
<p>(2) There are very few links to other articles in that section, as well as other problem sections. A good encyclopedic article generally is well-linked to other articles that help explain what you're talking about.</p>
<p>(3) Not NEARLY enough sources are cited, ESPECIALLY in the benefits section, which as of right now I'm considering pure propoganda. An article of this length should really have at least 50 sources (none of which are sponsored by Alexander Technique) citing the nature of the premesis, procedures, effects, and disadvantages.</p>
<p>(4) Portions of the article are directly plagiarized from <a href="http://www.franis.org/Alexander/Encyclopedia_Alexander_Technique.html" class="external free" title="http://www.franis.org/Alexander/Encyclopedia_Alexander_Technique.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.franis.org/Alexander/Encyclopedia_Alexander_Technique.html</a> , I have no idea if this is an academic source or what is going on with this. FIX THAT IMMEDIATELY or I will list this article for deletion on the grounds that it is plagiarized.</p>
<p>(5) the section "Scientific Proof" does not belong under the heading "The Technique". Make it its own heading.</p>
<p>(6) The section "Learning Environments" as is right now is pointless, reads like it's stolen from an Alexander propoganda website, and is not at all encyclopedic. This section needs to be completely deleted and re-written from scratch by a neutral third party, NOT someone who is involved with Alexander in some profitable way.</p>
<p>(7) The section which lists famous students of Alexander Technique needs to be verified, or be swiftly DELETED. I might as well list the Queen of England, no one would be able to prove me wrong. Re-think this list.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I'm surprised that this article is even rated B-class. Get to work. --<a href="../../../r/a/h/User%7ERahzel_2354.html" title="User:Rahzel">Rahzel</a> 17:53, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_Technique_fb6e.html" title="Edit section: Alternative Medicine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alternative Medicine</span></h2>
<p>Alexander Technique is not a form of "alternative medicine"; it is a means of attaining greater understanding of one's self (namely, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Learning.html" title="Learning">education</a>). A <i>side effect</i> of AT can be the alleviation of chronic pain, but that isn't the goal of AT in itselfâ€”just like fuel-efficient cars are a side effect of science, but the goal of science itself is an increased knowledge base. It is for this reason that in AT, there is a "student/teacher" relationship, rather than a "therapist/patient" one. I'm sure many Alexander teachers would go so far as to say that Alexander lessons for the sole purpose of alleviating pain constitutes "endgaining", making progress in learning the Technique that much harder.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I plan to remove "alternative medicine" from the categories listing, though I figured I should let this sit on the talk page for a bit first. <a href="../../../c/a/3/User%7ECA387_0e00.html" title="User:CA387">CA387</a> 22:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we need a better way to decide if it belongs in the category, one that relies on verifiable and authorative sources or one that follows what has been done in other articles. From what I've seen of how it's described and categorized elsewhere, it most certainly belongs in the category. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 00:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. What led to suggest the change was the description of the Technique from <a href="http://www.alexandertech.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexandertech.org" rel="nofollow">AMSAT</a>:
<dl>
<dd>It is not a treatment, such as chiropractic or massage. Any treatment has its own unique benefits. The Alexander Technique's unique contribution is a mode of self-management that gives you independence in maintaining your health.<a href="http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>However, Wikipedia defines medicine as "the sector of public life concerned with maintaining or restoring human health", and both "an <i>area of knowledge</i> . . . and the <i>applied practice</i> of that knowledge". I'll cede the point to you: we should keep the label as it seems to fall in line with other Wikipedia articles.

<dd>As the contributor, it's your responsiblity to show that it is, not mine to show it is not. As for your question: WP:NOT#SOAP, WP:NOT#LINK, WP:NOT#IINFO. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 21:25, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I thank you for tagging the section for lack of sourcing, you seem to be mistaken on a few counts:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a>: "an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view". While a list of prominent students certainly advances the cause of Alexander Technique, it can hardly be argued that a list of students is tantamount to soapboxingâ€”how about a list of successful <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_College_b1fc.html#Famous_alumni" title="Harvard College">Harvard alumni</a>?</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#LINK" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#LINK</a>: "Mere collections of internal links". The important part here is "mere": as the list was a part of the article, it fails to meet this criterion.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>: This article fails to remotely resemble any of the eight subsections listed.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">WP:BB</a>: "If you anticipate a disagreement with your version of the article, or you want to change or delete a large amount of the text, it's a good idea to list your objections one by one in the talk page, reasonably quoting the disputed phrases, explaining your reasoning, and providing solid references (if applicable)." Granted, the responsibility falls on me to conform to Wikipedia guidelines as much as possible. But, as an editor, it's also your responsibility to state the reasons behind your edits (don't be <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html#.E2.80.A6_but_don.27t_be_reckless." title="WP:BB">reckless</a>). As long as everyone gives good reasons for what they do, the encyclopedia moves forward. In the future, it might be a good idea to make use of <a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Template:Unreferenced</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That said, I've added the section back with citations. --<a href="../../../c/a/3/User%7ECA387_0e00.html" title="User:CA387">CA387</a> 10:33, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you're comparing Alexander Technique to Harvard? Sounds like a pov problem. With the source given, I think it can stay, though I think we need the advert-tag again. From my perspective, it's obviously non-encyclopedic. Unfortunately, the article is so horribly non-encyclopedic overall that maybe it's not something to bother with at this time. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 15:23, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You keep bringing up this "non-encyclopedic" nature of the article, but haven't yet given any concrete examples. I certainly don't think the article is incredibly well-writen; however, I fail to see any <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">POV bias</a>. As far as the "<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>" example goes, I was referring not to importance, but <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>â€”an effort to demonstrate the point that it's a fallacy to say that Harvard can has a list of famous alumni because it's one of the best universities in the world, because it put the students out in the first place (a form of <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a>). Rather, the article itself should provide information on whether or not its topic is particularly useful, rather than catering to the reader's pre-concieved notions. --<a href="../../../c/a/3/User%7ECA387_0e00.html" title="User:CA387">CA387</a> 02:52, 8 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So you're not arguing that getting a degree from Harvard is similar to taking some Alexander Technique training? What is your rationale then? Got any secondary sources for this pov? --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 03:27, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My only goal here is to describe Alexander Technique to the reader as thoroughly as possible, not to encourage or discourage them from taking lessons. The discussion regarding the list of prominent Harvard alumni was just to show that while prominent alumni certainly advance the interests of Harvard, it doesn't constitute advertisingâ€”likewise for Alexander Technique. I could've easily used another example of a list with a notable people as a part of an article (<a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_orchestra_of_Auschwitz_ce01.html#Members_of_the_orchestra" title="Girl orchestra of Auschwitz">Auschwitz orchestra members</a>?) , but Harvard just happened to be the thing that came to mind at that moment. --<a href="../../../c/a/3/User%7ECA387_0e00.html" title="User:CA387">CA387</a> 06:13, 8 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You didnt answer my questions. Why is the list notable enough for an encyclopedia, rather than here just to promote the interests of trainers? Do you have any secondary sources to show this notability? --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 15:28, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The list is notable because the article is notable, and because its subjects are notable. If you need confirmation through secondary sources, click on some of the links. There are about fifty of them. --<a href="../../../c/a/3/User%7ECA387_0e00.html" title="User:CA387">CA387</a> 17:13, 8 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So we just ignore NPOV and NOR? <s>I'm glad I put the npov tag on it.</s> We can't provide a source indicating that having taken training in the Alexander Technique is notable in some way remotely similar to graduating from an accredited institution of learning, I think it should be removed until we can figure out exactly why it's here, other than to promote the interests of trainers. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 18:47, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I changed the npov tag to an importance tag because it's more specific to this section and how I'm proposing we resolve it. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:13, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
