<h2><span class="mw-headline">An attempt to mediate</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I'm AMIB. Nekosilver asked me to make a comment about Arbcom (similar to a comment I made elsewhere in another dispute), but I've noticed that this dispute has defenerated somewhat. Since I'm a sucker for punishment, I think I'll try and mediate informally (given that there's no real formal or binding mediation process.)</p>
<p>There's an interesting contrast here; Haiduc makes the point that there is significant scholarly commentary on the subject of Alexander's homosexual relationships, and not only that but Alexander is brought up in the larger context of historic homosexuality (separating this from the "Is Hitler gay?" sort of commentary that only ever comes up in discussion of Hitler and not in larger discussions of homosexuality).</p>
<p>The argument against this seems to be that there doesn't actually seem to be a <i>conclusion</i> that Alexander was homosexual in the modern sense of the term, instead that Alexander is a significant part of commentary on Greek homosexuality, whereas Category:LGBT people has typically been for people who self-identify or are identified as homosexual in the modern sense.</p>
<p>There isn't an easy solution to the answer of "Was Alexander homosexual?" nor is it the question we should ask here. The question we should ask is "Is this category for people whose sexuality is a significant subject of commentary or for people who are identified as homosexual by modern standards?"</p>
<p>Can anyone explain to me the existing practice <i>on Wikipedia</i> in this area? I'm less interested in issues outside of Wikipedia; this article already covers the subject (and whether it should isn't in dispute), so we're just fiddling with a Wikipedia practice of how to use categories, not necessarily a larger scholarly practice of covering such subject matter. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 15:22, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think my comments my help you. I initially posted them in the previous discussion, but seeing your edits I brought them here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have not followed this discussion in detail, so, forgive me If I don't exactly follow the arguments of both sides. But I've expressed in the past my opinion, which was against the creation of a Category "Homosexuality in ancient Greece" and against the categorization of Alexander as "homosexual". For two main reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>It is another thing "homosexuality" and another thing "paidikos eros". The term "homosexuality" fails to describe this cultural (and not merely sexual) trait of ancient Greeks. The fact that most male ancient Greeks participated in a "erastis-eromenos" relationship does not mean that they were homosexuals. They had wives and some of them were really womanizers! How can we call a womanizer like Alcibiades as homosexual?! Because he had an intimate relationship with Socrates or other men, <b>the nature of which we do not actually know</b> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cartledge_e16e.html" title="Paul Cartledge">Paul Cartledge</a> in his best-seller "The Spartans" argued that the erastis-eromenos relation did not include anal penetration)? Alexander was also a womanizer!</li>
<li>The article states the "No contemporary source states that Alexander and Hephaistion were lovers." So we don't actually have any solid evidence to call him a homosexual (apart from Hephaistion no other possible male relationship is mentioned). Are we going to categorize him as homosexual based on speculations and on a misinterpretation of the erastis-eromenos relationship?!!! Historically that would be a terrible mistake. Even if there was an intimate relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion this was a erastis-eromenos relationship and not a homosexual relationship as we know it today. But again I repeat that not even this intimate relationship is proved! It is based on speculations.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>My conclusion is that it is a terrible mistake to categorize people like Alexander, Demosthenes, Agesilaus, Socrates, Plato, Alcibiades, Pelopidas etc. as homosexuals. They were not! Such a categorization does not serve historical and factual accuracy. I must also point out that the sections concerning the personal relations of Alexander in this article are over-expanded without an obvious reason. The whole speculations are not an important issue and they are mainly based on the misinterpretation of the erastis-eromenos relation: Even Paul Cartledge and Fox, mentioned in the article do not speak for a homosexual relation between Alexander and Hephaistion, but for an intimate erastis-eromenos relationship ("his great friend was Hephaestion, and surely the sexual element (frequent between young males, or an older and younger male, in Greek city-states) developed already then, ""thus intimated that he was the eromenos ["beloved"] of Alexander, as Patroclus was of Achilles." → <b>not homosexuality, but erastis-eromenos relationship</b>).--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 15:46, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're making the second case again. You're arguing that it's inappropriate to describe Alexander as a homosexual, where the case to include him in these categories seems to be that it's appropriate to mention Alexander in the context of homosexual<i>ity</i>. I think that people are talking past each other on this point; are these categories about homosexual<i>s</i> or people associated with homosexual<i>ity</i>? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Man in Black, thanks for stopping by. I want to say right away that I'd ask the question a bit differently. As has been pointed out many times, the ancient Greeks didn't have a concept of a heterosexual or homosexual identity, so we can't call ancient people gay or straight. No one is trying to identify Alexander as a homosexual, it doesn't make any sense. We can use the term "homosexuality" as a description of sexual activity, though, and that's the sense in which it's used by classical scholarship. (For sources, please see this list I've put together: <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_List_of_classical_scholars_who_use_the_term__homosexuality__52da.html" title="User:Akhilleus/List of classical scholars who use the term &quot;homosexuality&quot;">User:Akhilleus/List_of_classical_scholars_who_use_the_term_"homosexuality"</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, I don't want to label Alexander, the person, at all. I want to categorize the article. There is a difference. A category like "LGBT people" can't be easily applied to articles like <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>, but a category like "history of same-sex relationships in ancient Greece" could be applied to articles about people, like <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sappho.html" title="Sappho">Sappho</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcibiades.html" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>, but also to articles about concepts like <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">Pederasty in ancient Greece</a>, literature like <i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symposium_%28Plato%29_ef34.html" title="Symposium (Plato)">Symposium (Plato)</a></i>, and so on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I'd ask the question this way: "What should we call the category that we place in articles that have material relevant to the study of homosexuality in the ancient world"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as existing practice, I'm not sure there is any consistency. One of the reasons why I've paid so much attention to this is that it could be a model for other articles, and I want to make sure we don't create a category that obscures what kind of relationships we're talking about.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, I'd answer my question with the following potential categories: Category:Homosexuality in ancient Greece (corresponds to the article <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>), Category:History of same-sex desire in ancient Greece, Category:History of same-sex relationships in ancient Greece</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me just add something about what Yannismarrou posted. The term "homosexuality" is used by many, many classical scholars (I linked to a list I put together above). We've got an article, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>, which discusses the differences between ancient Greek practice and the modern concept. So I don't think it's anachronistic to follow a majority of classical scholars, including ones who write about Alexander, and speak of homosexuality in ancient Greece. However, using the phrase "same-sex" gets across the same idea without using the word "homosexuality", so perhaps that's preferable. And if we use a category that's specific to the <i>erastes</i>-<i>eromenos</i> relationship, that might work (but wouldn't help us with <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sappho.html" title="Sappho">Sappho</a>). <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, my opinion based on my history records are that Alexander was neither homosexual or associated with homosexuality. Taking Man in Black's question:
<ul>
<li>"Is this category for people whose sexuality is a significant subject of commentary?" Sexuality or homosexuality, because this article treats Alexander's sexuality in general and not homosexuality (and over-expands according to my opinion).</li>
<li>"Is this category for people who are identified as homosexual by modern standards?" But can we identify him as homosexual by modern standards? My opinion is no, because: 1) his erotic relationship with Hphaistion is disputed, 2) even if such relationship existed again, we cannot identify him as homosexual by modern standads, because then we accept that: erastis-eromenos relationship=modern homosexuality, which is untrue and historically inaccurate.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 16:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And answering to Akhilleus: It is another thing to say that the erastis-eromenos relationship may possibly have had some elements of homosexuality and another to say that these people were homosexuals and generalize by using the modern term "homosexuality".--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 16:12, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. If we figure out the category is about homosexual<i>ity</i> or homosexual<i>s</i>, we'll get to that. Right now, we need to focus on what the category is for, and not get ahead of ourselves. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:23, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a parallel in WP category practice, we don't label people unless they <i>self-identify</i> as such, or unless there is <i>concrete evidence</i> that supports so. I must note that this may not be the case in what regards categories for <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, mainly because of there is a huge POV-push by certain editors. See for a parallel example all Categories for X-Americans (e.g. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Category%7EGreek_Americans_b4c8.html" title="Category:Greek Americans">Category:Greek Americans</a>). Furthermore, the term <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> was coined in the 19th century, making it anachronistic (as Yanni noted). Finally, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> <i>actions</i> that Akhilleus is mentioning are (a) <i>alleged-assumed</i>, <b>not</b> proven (b) vastly outnumbered by the <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> <i>actions</i>, which are <b>not</b> <i>assumed</i>, but <i>proven</i>. Therefore, the correct category for the particular personality would be Category:Proven heterosexual actions and assumed homosexual actions, or better Category:Unresolved sexual orientation. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 16:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're jumping a few steps ahead. Let's stick to the main point first; you're making the case that categories of the form "Foo people" are for people who self-identify as Foo or who have been conclusively shown to be Foo.

<p>By the way, I have a really slow connection, and, until my laptop is fixed, I have a really, really slow computer. Because of this, barring objections, I'm going to abuse page protection on this page as a bit of a gavel when things get hot, so that I can head off some heated tangents (such as the one above between Akhilleus and Yannismarou) and be able to actually moderate this discussion without getting hopelessly edit-conflicted to death and being completely inable to post anything. If you find the page protected, rest assured that I'm right here trying to reply to what's already been said, and if an admin should find this page protected for more than ten minutes, then something has happened with me and the page needs to be unprotected.

<dd>I'm getting pretty frustrated with this. I repeat, over and over, that classical scholarship uses the term "homosexuality" in a particular way, and that we should follow the practice of authoritative, reliable sources, and people keep on saying "you can't use modern terms!" I still don't understand why we can't follow the lead of David Halperin, Paul Cartledge, Bruce Thornton, Marilyn Skinner, K.J. Dover, Thomas Hubbard, etc. etc. etc. and use "homosexuality" descriptively (but not as a personal identity). Or are Yannismarrou and NikoSilver saying that we should delete the article <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>, since we can't use that word? Because that is the logical conclusion of what they're saying, as far as I can see.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>On the same point, NikoSilver, do you have a problem with the content of the article as it stands now? Since you feel so strongly that nothing has been <i>proven</i> re:A.'s relationships with Hephaistion and Bagoas, and that Fox and Cartledge are merely making assumptions, isn't the logical conclusion that we should remove those sections from the article? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>(to Akhilleus) See? that's exactly where you're wrong!

<p>The extensive disquisition on whether or not the term is used for people who self-identify or not, or anything else whatsoever is an unauthorized tresspass into territory we have no right to tread. It is part and parcel, unintentionally I assume, of the endless debate which has no place here and merely postpones the conclusion. It is a debate in which users have tried to disqualify sources on the basis of their presumed sexuality, palpable nonsense of course since then we would have to seek sources which were neither heterosexual nor homosexual. We are not here to do gender studies, we are here to categorize Alexander, not to praise him, or to blame him. We have to follow standard practice in the scholarship. That has been demonstrated to have placed him in the center of discussions on homosexuality in antiquity. Thus, <b>as of right</b> we are entitled to place him in "LGBT history." But we have been trying here for a very long time, in the face of focused abuse and deception, to accommodate users uncomfortable with the LGBT monicker. So let's leave the inappropriate and ultracrepidarian gender studies discussion aside and let's try to find an accurate wording for a category that will not be custom-fashioned to accommodate a single purpose, and let's get on with our lives. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 17:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I appreciate the work that AMIB is undertaking in leading this meandering discussion, but I hope that he will take into account the concern posed by Akhilleus and Haiduc: the search for a category that will accomodate not Alexander, the man, but Alexander, the subject of extensive scholarly research into homosexual <i>activity</i> in the ancient world.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interpretation of Plutarch</span></h2>
<p>I want also to point out some further inaccuracies in "Personal Life section":</p>
<p>In the begining of this section we read:</p>
<p>"A number of ancient sources have reported on Alexander's attachments to both males and females. While the object of his affection may have varied, he was admired for treating all his lovers humanely. Plutarch has argued that Alexander's love of males took an ethical approach, inspired by the teachings of his mentor, Aristotle. He gives several examples of Alexander's morality in this domain:" So by this paragrpah we get the impression that Alexander was regarded as bisexual (not "homosexual") by ancient sources. But then the paragraph quoted by Plutarch proves exactly the opposite:</p>
<p>"When Philoxenus, the leader of the seashore, wrote to Alexander that there was a youth in Ionia whose beauty has yet to be seen and asked him in a letter if he (Alexander) would like him (the boy) to be sent over, he (Alexander) responded in a strict and disgusted manner: "You are the most hideous and malign of all men, have you ever seen me involved in such dirty work that you found the urge to flatter me with such hedonistic business?"</p>
<p>So, when Philoxenus proposed to send a boy to Alexander, the King felt "digusted" and refused the offer. So how is the homosexuality or the bisexuality proved here? The "disgust" indicates quite the opposite.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 17:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I quote Plutarch's 22, because I want to know where Plutarch exactly speaks about Alexander's homosexuality as the currest text of the article implies:</p>
<p>"When Philoxenus, his lieutenant on the sea-coast, wrote to him to know if he would buy two young boys, of great beauty, whom one Theodorus, a Tarentine, had to sell, he was so offended, that he often expostulated with his friends, what baseness Philoxenus had ever observed in him, that he should presume to make him such a reproachful offer. And he immediately wrote him a very sharp letter, telling him Theodorus and his merchandise might go with his good-will to destruction. Nor was he less severe to Hagnon, who sent him word he would buy a Corinthian youth named Crobylus, as a present for him. And hearing that Damon and Timotheus, two of Parmenio's Macedonian soldiers, had abused the wives of some strangers who were in his pay, he wrote to Parmenio, charging him strictly, if he found them guilty, to put them to death, as wild beasts that were only made for the mischief of mankind."</p>
<p>This is the exact quote and it proves quite the opposite: That Alexander was disgusted by homosexual propositions. I really want to know where the allegations in "Personal Life" that "<b>A number of ancient sources</b> ( the expression prepares us for a variety of sources here!) have reported on Alexander's attachments to both males and females" are based, because otherwise I'm going to tag this particular section for factual inaccuracy.

<dd>Yannismarou, that passage may be read in more than one way. It is certainly possible to read it, as you do, to suggest that Alexander was horrified by the prospect of sex with boys. However, it is also possible to read it as suggesting that Alexander was horrified by the prospect of non-consensual sex with slaves. The latter is certainly consistent with Plutarch's account of Alexander's treatment of the Persian slave women. The article should present the evidence, and perhaps offer cited examples of how Plutarch has been interpreted by reputable modern scholars. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 18:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, yes — I agree that the Plutarch quotes don't support the phrase "a number of ancient sources". I think that's a relic from a time when the section was much smaller, and discussed only his (moderately well-attested) relations with Hephaestion and Bagoas. The article now has citations from Plutarch, Aelian, Dicaearchus, Curtius, Justin and Diodorus Siculus for Alexander's relationships. Isn't that a number of ancient sources? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 18:39, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I come back again, because reading this particular section I find out how badly written it is. It is a section full of confusions! Let's see what Aelian says. Well, Aelian does not speak about "homosexual relations". Listen to what the article says:</dd>

<dd>Aelian makes a parallelism with the Patroclus-Achilles relationship and speaks about an erastis-eromenos relationship between them. Do I have to speak again about the differences between the terms "erastis-eromenos relationship" and "paidicos eros" from one side and the inaccurate for this cultural phainomenon modern term "homosexuality". So, my conclusion is that not even Aelian speaks about a "homosexual" relation between Alexander-Hephaistion. "Erastis-eromenos relationship"="homosexuality" is not historically and factually accurate.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:28, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yannismarou, despite your opinion about this, the consensus in English-language scholarship is that the erastes-eromenos relationship was sexual in nature. Sources are scattered all over the talk archives, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>, and other articles. However, if for whatever reason you don't want to call this "homosexuality", why can we not call it a "same-sex relationship"? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 19:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it gives emphasis on the sexual element which is wrong and inaccurate. The erastis-eromenos relationship was basically intellectual and usually ended in a long-lasting friendship. I was now reading Ioannis Sykoutris' introduction to Plato's <i>Symposium</i>. Listen to what this great scholar says: "Paidikos eros (not "homosexuality" as you want to name it) refers to something completely strange to the habits and the moral conceptions of our contemporary society". He also points out that the "pedagogic character of paidikos eros differentiates it from other homosexual phainomena of other eras and other nations". I fullly agree with these remarks and that is why I regard the use of any term emphasizing on the sexual element of the erastis-eromenos relationship (which sexual element by the way is not yet fully clarified whatever you say) as inaccurate and misleading. Particularly, as far as Alexander is concerned, I insist that no homosexual relationship of his of any kind is undisputably proved.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:47, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, in ancient Greece they had a broader meaning and not primarily sexual but pedagogic.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that there was some variety in how the eromenos-erastes relationship was practiced in different regions and times; in some circumstances it was chaste, in others, it was unambiguously sexual. It is also true that we don't know where Alexander's relationships with Hephaestion and Bagoas fell on this continuum. But that's not a reason to deny that the <i>paidikos eros</i> relationship was, even in its naming, <i>erotic</i>. (And, of course, the Hephaestion relationship is problematic in the context of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">pederasty in ancient Greece</a>, since the two were of a similar age — but that's another matter.)</dd>

<dd>Nobody is trying to tag Alexander with the modern term "homosexual" — and indeed, the article does not do that. What the article should indicate is that ancient sources show Alexander as having emotional, and perhaps erotic, relationships with both males and females. Plutarch and Dicaearchus both mention the incident in which he kissed Bagoas; I have trouble seeing how that is not an "attachment" (the term the article currently uses).</dd>

<dd>The context on how ancient Hellenes viewed erotic relationships between males is at <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a>. (Akhilleus has provided an extensive bibliography justifying the use of the term "homosexuality" in that article's title.) We don't need to use the modern term "homosexuality", but our duty to historical truth demands that we acknowledge that, according to both ancient sources and modern scholarship, it is <i>probable</i>, though not certain, that Alexander had sexual and/or erotic relationships with at least two males. We can try to find a better wording, if you like, but this must be acknowledged. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:50, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, the article mentions about Bagoas that "No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers." And, excuse me, but a kiss is not a proof for homosexual relationships. In certain societies men or women may kiss each other in the mouth without this indicating "homosexual attachment". Let's not use our standard for this historical period! Again all the ancient evidence is incoclusive about Alexander's possible "homosexual" (how wrong is this term!) relationships and I still not accept as accurate the terms "homosexual" or "homosexuality" for "paidicos eros". I think that If ancient Greeks were asked they would also disagree (personal assumption!)! Unfortunately I must leave this interesting discussion now. Hopefully, I'll be back tomorrow and I'll comment on the comments I may have missed.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 20:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I repeat: nobody is trying to label Alexander as "homosexual". However, the context of the Plutarch story about Bagoas, which emphasizes his beauty and has Alexander <i>embracing and kissing</i> him, is clearly erotic, and I think that it takes a very forced reading of the text to deny that. Furthermore, which is more important than my interpretation or yours, it has been interpreted as erotic by notable scholars such as Robin Lane Fox. Whether the relationship went beyond a kiss and an embrace is immaterial: it is a historically attested erotic link between Alexander and another male.</dd>

<dd>You are correct that the evidence is not conclusive; however, as Wikipedians we are not in the business of interpreting the evidence ourselves. We are in the business of reporting how reputable scholars have interpreted the evidence. And there is a consensus among such scholars: that it is <i>likely</i>, but not <i>definite</i>, that Alexander's relationships with Hephaestion and Bagoas had a sexual element. This does <b>not</b> mean that Alexander was "homosexual" or even "bisexual" in the modern sense of these terms, as cultural identifiers. However, it <b>does</b> mean that it is appropriate to acknowledge that reputable historians have associated Alexander with same-sex <i>eros</i>. We can debate what the most appropriate wording for this acknowledgement is, but we should not attempt to deny it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 20:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the entire quote from Plutarch:</p>
<p><i>"As soon as he came to the royal palace of Gedrosia, he again refreshed and feasted his army; and one day after he had drunk pretty hard, it is said, he went to see a prize of dancing contended for, in which his favourite Bagoas, having gained the victory, crossed the theatre in his dancing habit, and sat down close by him, which so pleased the Macedonians that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss Bagoas, and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him"</i></p>
<p>This says Bagoas had won a contest, and Alexander congratulated him. It doesn't mean it was erotic. Peter Green writes that Bagoas had won the contest, and the Macedonians urged Alexander to kiss the winner, and Alexander "duly obliged." Plutarch makes only <b>one</b> reference to Bagoas in his entire biography of Alexander. I don't get it: how is this "clearly" erotic?</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Maradona_6cd9.html" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>, after scoring his "<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_of_God_goal_7cb7.html" title="Hand of God goal">hand of God goal</a>" in 1986, told his teammates to "embrace him" or the ref isn't going to call it. He used the word "embrace". Does this mean Maradona and the entire Argentinian soccer team is gay? Plutarch's use of the word kiss could be the same as "embrace"-not necesarily sexual. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 22:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm. The Greek text of Plutarch (<i>Alexander</i> 67.8) reads: <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">λέγεται δ’ αὐτὸν μεθύοντα θεωρεῖν ἀγῶνας χορῶν, τὸν δ’ <u>ἐρώμενον</u> Βαγώαν χορεύοντα νικῆσαι καὶ κεκοσμημένον διὰ τοῦ θεάτρου παρελθόντα καθίσαι παρ’ αὐτόν· ἰδόντας δὲ τοὺς Μακεδόνας κροτεῖν καὶ βοᾶν φιλῆσαι κελεύοντας, ἄχρι οὗ περιβαλὼν κατεφίλησεν.</span></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that Bagoas is called Alexander's <i>erōmenos</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As enjoyable as this discussion is, I'm pretty sure that when the interpretation of primary sources is disputed, we're supposed to turn to authoritative secondary sources. Thus saith the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">no original research policy</a>: "Primary sources that have been published by a reliable source may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it's easy to misuse them. For that reason, edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a secondary source." The content of the article should be based on secondary sources: "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible. This means that we publish the opinions of reliable authors, and not the opinions of Wikipedians who have read the primary source material for themselves." So I think we'd better rely on what experts say about Bagoas, rather than try to interpret this passage ourselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, I don't have anything about this specific passage at hand, but here's what Robin Lane Fox <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/fox.html" class="external text" title="http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/fox.html" rel="nofollow">says</a> about Alexander's relations with Bagoas (I've quoted this before, but whatever): "Alexander did not have a one-way homosexual orientation, in the prevailing modern use of the term. He had sexual relations with males (including a eunuch) but also with a Persian mistress, his first wife Roxane (mother of his child) and two more Persian wives, too." Elsewhere (<i>Alexander the Great: a Biography</i>, p. 42), Fox describes Alexander as "a man who was to sleep with at least one man, four mistresses, three wives, a eunuch, and, so gossip believed, an Amazon." Please note that in these quotes Fox doesn't say "likely", "probably", or "possibly". He says that Alexander had sexual relations with men, women, and a eunuch. Fox is probably the most prominent expert writing about Alexander in the English language, so I believe we can safely say that this is a mainstream opinion. It's certainly a better source for the article and its categorization than the personal opinions of Wikipedians. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 23:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that this discussion has been done before as well... Robin Lane Fox is a well known historian, very important and respected, <b>but</b> there is "dispute", Akhilleus. Noone knows for sure if Alexander had affairs with men. What is not "disputed" at all is that Alexander was not a 'pederast'. and do not mention Bagoas again... Even if he had sexual relations with him, he was not a child! and, please, noone say again that <i>the time of childhood in ancient Greece was different</i>, bla bla bla... Everyone in the world knows what 'pederasty' means, and listing Alexander among the 'paedophiles' is just pov-pushing. <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 02:16, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for this exemplar of hectoring, in which all the familiar red herrings are duly dragged out only to be misrepresented. It reminds us - as if we needed reminding - of the absurdity of anyone here (myself included) presuming to second-guess the scholars. And yes, Bagoas <i>was</i> a boy, and Alexander had his way with him (though from what we can glean about Bagoas, I'd wager that it was <i>he</i> who had his way with Alexander). More important, Alexander is mentioned in works dealing with pederasty, such as that of Percy and that of Eglinton and that of Kroll on knabenliebe in the Pauly-Wissowa. So in addition the the "LGBT history" cat we really should also include "Greek pederasty." <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 02:53, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hectorian, I don't understand how there's a "dispute". I see Fox saying he definitely had a sexual relationship with Hephaistion and Bagoas, and other people saying he probably did. Not much of a dispute there! If you want to convince me otherwise, a great way would be to provide an example of a reliable source disagreeing with Fox's statement.</dd>

<dd>To Akhilleus: U did not have to present my mid-September edits about that. I never said the opposite. The cat about 'homosexuality' can remain, IMO, based on my previous posts. do i have to make it clearer? ok then: the <b>category</b> can stay, in order to help readers to jump in topics and since there is much evidence that Alexander had such affairs... but <b>not</b> to present it in the main body of the article as an indisputable fact! there are historians who disagree, and linguists who say that the word 'eromenos' in ancient texts did not have such a meaning. btw, the ancient historians are not 100% clear on the matter, allowing everyone else to support or oppose what they say. about 'pederasty', i have made myself clear and i am not backing off from that! such a category, as long as i am a wikipedian has no place in this article. my previous edits (which i am lazy to search for) will enlight any user why. And something else: since Fox has been "upgrated" as a <i>divine source</i> for Alexander in this article, am i free to add in the very first paragraph or line that Alexander was un-f***ing-disputably Greek? Fox says so, ancient historians say so, most modern say so... <b>So</b>, why it is not there? will i be reverted if i add <i>also known as Alexander III, king of the Greek kingdom of Macedon</i>? <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 19:39, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember you tried to illustrate how biased I am in this because of my Greekness! I had responded that I would expect Greek gays to support your arguments. Well, what matters most? One's ethnicity or one's sexual POV? I'll let the other editors judge that. If you are ashaimed of such contributions, don't make them in the first place, instead of accusing others for insulting you because they point them out.</p>

<li>"Eromenos" was analytically explained by Yannismarou above, but you keep twisting its meaning.</li>

<p>Niko, your problems with the documentation of pederastic practices are a personal matter and do not belong here (or anywhere in the Wikipedia). Your "argument" against me, based on some confused notion of guilt by association, is bizzarre and troubling for what it reveals about your notions of proper behavior here, among other things. Much more could be said but it is not my place or purpose to deal here with your problematic behavior or its roots. Let's just leave it at a reminder that we are all subject to personal bias, regardless of its causes, self-proclaimed heterosexuals no less than others. So let's focus on the proper description of existing scholarship rather than succumb to personal projections about others. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are we absolutely certain that raising the issue of sexual orientation in this article isn't an anachronism and a west-centered POV? Did the ancient Greeks draw a distinction between heterosexuals and homosexuals (assuming the concept of sexual orientation even existed then - even in the minds of the more liberal ancient Greeks)?

<p>Above, Yannismarou says that he would support Category:Ancient Greek paidicos eros. Category:Greek Pederasty exists; "pederasty" is the English translation of "παίδικος ἔρως". Would this existing category be acceptable? It would seem to describe the Bagoas relationship accurately, even if Hephaestion is still problematic. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 16:26, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pederasty has also a modern meanig which is problematic for me. I personally believe that again we should not use a term like "pederasty" causing confusions.

<dd>I've said before that I could support a category like "ancient Greek sexuality"; "ancient Greek eros" is fairly similar, so for the sake of consistency I'll say that I can support that as well. I also think the idea of having an article Eros in ancient Greece is a good one, and perhaps it can be started by moving <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eros_%28love%29.html" title="Eros (love)">Eros (love)</a> to that title. Someone recently created the category <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexuality_in_the_classical_world_df99.html" title="Category:Sexuality in the classical world">Category:Sexuality in the classical world</a>, so consider that one too.</dd>

<dd>I'd like to be clear, though, that I don't want "ancient Greek eros" to replace the category "Greek pederasty" in other articles. "Greek pederasty" (really ought to be "ancient Greek pederasty"), just like "homosexuality in ancient Greece", reflects how this topic is discussed in secondary scholarship. That's what I've been advocating this whole time: WP articles, both content and categories, should reflect how secondary sources discuss these topics. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an aside to my aside about "pederasty" vs. "παίδικος ἔρως": I know that in the modern world "pederasty" is stigmatized and often confused with "pedophilia", but does modern <i>scholarship</i> make a distinction between the terms? Is there a case for renaming Category:Greek Pederasty?

<dd>I must also point out, that, after giving some second thoughts to the matter, I think that an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_eros_d17a.html" title="Ancient Greek eros">Ancient Greek eros</a> article is a necessity and something missing from this encyclopedia. This article could also include broader matters like the Platonic conception of eros etc. When I'll have more time in about 10 days from now I'll hopefully focus my attention to this article among other things I have in mind. And again I apologize but I must leave; so I'll not be able to follow the further course of the discussion for today.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the "known world"</span></h2>
<p>a sentence in the lead paragraph currently reads: "conquering most of the <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy_world_map.html" title="Ptolemy world map">world known</a> before his death; he is regarded as one of the greatest military strategists and tacticians who ever lived." What this means, of course, is that he conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks. There's been a few edits/reverts on this sentence. Is the phrasing "conquering most of the <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy_world_map.html" title="Ptolemy world map">world known to the ancient Greeks</a> before his death; he is regarded as one of the greatest military strategists and tacticians who ever lived." acceptable? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:13, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>&#160;:-) If not even Ancient Greeks had an idea about the rest of the world, then we can imagine what the other Ancients thought! In any case, the addition <i>"to the ancient Greeks"</i>, although not disagreeable, is a wordy <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleonasm.html" title="Pleonasm">pleonasm</a>, because of the exact following 3 words: <i>"before his death"</i>, which signify both timeframe (<i>before</i>, ie also ancient), and ethnicity (<i>his</i>, ie Greeks, as he was their leader, and self-identified as a Greek). The wikilinked <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy_world_map.html" title="Ptolemy world map">Ptolemy world map</a> (c.500 years later) is also illuminating in this, should anybody have further unjustified doubts. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 12:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To address the pleonasm, how about this: "<b>Alexander the Great</b> (Greek: Μέγας Ἀλέξανδρος,[1] Megas Alexandros; July 356 BC–11 June 323 BC), also known as <b>Alexander III</b>, king of Macedon (336–323 BC), was one of, if not the most successful military commanders in history.

<dd>I see both your point now. You mean in case <i>before his death</i> is not taken as descriptive of the words <i>known world</i>, but instead of the word <i>capturing</i>. In that regard, I like Akhilleus' second proposal better, as it splits the sentences in a more readable way (which is what mostly annoyed me in the first version). <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 15:19, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll make this change, but now things seem repetitive--"was one of, if not the most successful military commanders in history." and "he is regarded as one of the greatest military strategists and tacticians who ever lived." are very similar statements.

<p>Wow, I leave to go back to work and there's all this. Some of the tangential discussion is jumping a couple steps ahead on me. I do want to point out that I'm going to remove personalization of this debate on sight, however; it isn't relevant if an editor is interested in Greek history, homosexuality, or people whose name begin with A, clearly everyone has the best interests of this article at heart.</p>
<p>So, we've established that "Category:Foo people" is only for self-identified or overwhelmingly identified as Foo, and that Alexander the Great is definitely not self-identified.</p>
<p>I want to ask this question in the most narrowly-construed way possible: is Alexander overwhelmingly identified by the historic community as homosexual (or bisexual; whether he had heterosexual relationships isn't relevant to this)? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:20, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, in the sense that he is not identified as having a homosexual sexual orientation. In fact, almost everyone who studies ancient Greece would say that no one in the ancient world can be called homosexual (or bisexual or heterosexual); ancient Greeks didn't use these categories, and their conception of sexuality (most historians say) was different than ours. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:42, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Probably I am late in this response, but it will definitely help clear all misunderstandings. First off, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Category%7EAncient_Greek_eros_3d41.html" title="Category:Ancient Greek eros">Category:Ancient Greek eros</a> (and a relative article) are the best descriptors for the situation, and I am glad you all seem to have come to an agreement about this proposal.</p>
<p>To continue, I'd like to clear out what I meant (I know, not very clearly) when I said that certain articles are <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>S: It is widely accepted that <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_eros_d17a.html" title="Ancient Greek eros">Ancient Greek eros</a> included much much more than the (alleged) homosexuality: It included extreme friendship and love, paedagogic functions, and extremely frequent heterosexual actions. I am not trying to hide those homosexual allegations under the carpet. I am trying to say, that homosexuality could just be <i>one</i> aspect of a huge broader relationship! To separate and discuss <i>only</i> one aspect (the most disputed one) of these relationships, no matter how sourced, is unfair for the total of information, and creates semiological confusion. Again, of course, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece_c34a.html" title="Homosexuality in ancient Greece">Homosexuality in ancient Greece</a> as a separate article, deserves to exist due to size and sources, <b>but</b> to my humble opinion, it needs to belong within the broader spectrum of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_eros_d17a.html" title="Ancient Greek eros">Ancient Greek eros</a> (and, yes, be {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}}ed out, separately as it already is).

<dd>Except for the word "allegations", which sounds like an accusation of a crime, I agree with NikoSilver's comment. An "ancient Greek eros" with links to other articles through {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} sounds good. Obviously same-sex relationships were only one of the manifestations of <i>eros</i>; I never said anything different. Nor did I ever mean to say that A.'s relationships w/Hephaistion and Bagoas were the sum total of his relationships. It's obvious that Roxana and Barsine are important here too. Nor was the category was ever meant to sum up Alexander's sexuality in a single word or phrase; it was meant to tell readers interested in the subject of same-sex relationships in antiquity that there is relevant material in this article.</dd>

<dd>No one ever studies, or writes about, ancient Greek eros. Only specific aspects of it are of interest, as might be "Lesbian relations in ancient Greece" or "Prostitution in Thebes." Such a vague title, encompassing all possible aspects of sexuality and affection for a region which spanned three continents and for a period which spanned two millennia is bound to be useless and confusing. It just adds another, unnecessary, layer of hierarchy in the categorization scheme and puts off to another day the serious work of properly categorizing this article, and any other which will have the misfortune to be therein included.

<dd>To answer Akhilleus' concern about Pindar and other articles: presumably Category:Greek Pederasty (and why is that capitalized, anyway? Shouldn't it be "Category:Greek pederasty"? But I digress) would be a subcategory of the proposed <a href="../../../a/n/c/Category%7EAncient_Greek_eros_3d41.html" title="Category:Ancient Greek eros">Category:Ancient Greek eros</a>, which in turn would be a subcategory of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexuality_in_the_classical_world_df99.html" title="Category:Sexuality in the classical world">Category:Sexuality in the classical world</a>. Since the Pindar article is clearly sourced with a standard scholarly work supporting its inclusion specifically in the "pederasty" category, there should be no reason to "move him up" to the more general category (although an argument could probably be made for including him in <i>both</i> categories). I, at least, would not see this as a <i>substitute</i> for the pederasty category, but as a <i>more general</i> category, incorporating pederasty and all the other manifold forms that <i>eros</i> took in the Hellenic world. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 00:59, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since there seems to be good support for this category, I went ahead and created it--a bunch of redlinks should have gone blue. Right now it's empty--it has no members, no parent categories, and no subcategories--so if changes need to be made (including a name change, or even a deletion) it should be easy. Since discussion about the category is no longer specific to Alexander, may I suggest that we continue discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/c/Category_talk%7EAncient_Greek_eros_3b91.html" title="Category talk:Ancient Greek eros">Category talk:Ancient Greek eros</a>? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 14:39, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Still red?

<dd>I started doing it myself, but changed my mind, as I was an active part in this debate. As this consensus appears to be final, I suggest that the mediators <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a>, make a summary of the debate and a conclusion in that page, so as to initiate further discussion on details. I was also going to post a question regarding the capitalization of <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eros_%28love%29.html" title="Eros (love)">Eros</a>, but that can wait. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 23:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second NikoSilver's suggestion, if Keitei and AMIB are willing to make such a summary. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
