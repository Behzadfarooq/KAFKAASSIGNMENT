<p>Hi Alex, i have a question in regards to the article on <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a>, previously i added to another user's comment from Joseph De Guignes and of Xiong-nu. I added that they were of Turkic origin due to using research from this website " <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hiung-Nu" class="external free" title="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hiung-Nu" rel="nofollow">http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hiung-Nu</a> " and the fact that they actually referenced from Joseph De Guignes text . And i cited the the texts from this website as reference thorugh this website. But the user Crculver keeps reverting it saying the references are secondary sources and cannot be used etc. Would you be able to tell me whether i can include that in the text or not with citing like that?. Here is a previous edit of mine with my referencing " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huns&amp;oldid=85654489" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huns&amp;oldid=85654489" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huns&amp;oldid=85654489</a> "</p>

<p>Hi, user <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> is systematically searching and changing Turkish related articles with wrong and unsourced informations. WikiArticles are not improving because of his/her wrongly editings. He/She is searching 'turk' or "turkic" words in an article and deleting or deforming sentence or changing with 'persian' word in a baseless way. And he generally makes this secretly. He/She is making these changes with 'minor edits'.<br />
A check to the minor edit box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the current and previous version: typo corrections, formatting and presentational changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, et cetera. A minor edit is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute. By contrast, a major edit is a version that should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors. Therefore, any change that affects the meaning of an article is not minor, even if the edit is a single word.<br />
However, Tajik's systematically minor editings hardly affects of articles. And he/she always uses this illegal method. Please have a look at his/her contributions;<br />

Secondly, if he/she is frustrated in editing he/she is inviting to article other wikipedians. What can be the evidence for teamworking else. He/she is not seeing wikipedia as an culture and information organization. He always deforms sourced turkic related articles and infos.

<p>Dear Alex.</p>
<p>Vital changes to the Transnistria main page were agreed by negotiation just prior to it being locked, These include very significant changes to the opening paragraph and also changing the heading Domestic Terrorism to Violent Incidents. I know the page is locked but can we have these agree compromises inserted.</p>

<p>Hi. User:Timor Stultorum has admitted that User:Timur Stultorum (it wasn't that mysterious...) is his sockpuppet (on <a href="../../../p/e/l/User_talk%7EPelleSmith_f036.html" title="User talk:PelleSmith">User talk:PelleSmith</a>).

<p>Hi Alex. Thanks for contacting me. I think the comment made is rather insulting; here are some excerpts translated:</p>
<p><i>You should know that you're not in your full mind [i.e. you are out of your mind]: you stay 12 hours or more at the computer, write everything that goes through your head, are irrational, arrogant and arbitrary.</i></p>
<p><i>You prove yourself to be just a boy who stays too much at home, at the limits of being a psychopath - or maybe you're already a psychopath?!</i></p>
<p><i>Go out to the fresh air, find yourself a girlfriend, to something concrete in real life, write something real. Don't waste your neurons with sterile efforts and lowly games.</i></p>
<p>He then finished off by saying:</p>
<p><i>So, remember: these are the opinions of someone from outside, uninvolved in your debile [childish] little games. I chose you, because you still have potential, ...</i></p>
<p>I hope this helps. <b>UPDATE:</b> The author does not mention anything about any article. I presume he may be referring to <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mircea_Eliade_f0a3.html" title="Mircea Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a>, even though Dahn has also been involved in other disputes. He also says multiple times that he is an "outsider" and, indeed, <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.127.74.88.html" title="User:216.127.74.88">User:216.127.74.88</a> does not have any prior edits to Romania-related topics.

<dd>Sir, you asked me if this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73982596" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73982596" rel="nofollow">personal attack</a> comes from me. <b>No Sir, I am definitely not the author of this edit</b>. Though I am currently engaged in a debate with <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> on the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Talk%7EMircea_Eliade_da56.html" title="Talk:Mircea Eliade">Talk:Mircea Eliade</a>, this doesn't automatically qualify me for being the author of this attack <i>ad hominem</i>. To clear this accusation, I would strongly welcome a request for a checkuser procedure. Since Dahn already accused me on the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Talk%7EMircea_Eliade_da56.html" title="Talk:Mircea Eliade">Talk:Mircea Eliade</a> to be <a href="../../../a/z/o/User%7EAzotlichid_d9a5.html" title="User:Azotlichid">Azotlichid</a>, I would like to request a checkuser for this accusation as well.</dd>

<dd>My contributions so far might have been sometimes straight or ironic, never uncivil. I might be but a sporadic WP-user, yet I would like to enjoy the right of freely expressing my opinions. Repeatedly accusing me of trolling and vandalism and denouncing me as a sockpuppeteer and author of personal attacks is a strategy which exerts a real pressure on me. I don't think that intimidating dialog partners is the best strategy to make this project progress. I hope that a checkuser procedure would bring clarity into this issue.

<dd>I am a user (Littlebig) - take a look at my past contributions - who had his account unjustly blocked because I made two or three edits that were in agreement with User:Ahwaz and so was assumed to be the same user. But there has never been any proof that we are the same user. The IP checks were on dynamic IPs. As I made clear to one admin, I am on one of Europe's leading internet providers and this probably explains why we might have had IPs in the same range. The assumption of bad faith has been made against me on the basis of no proof. As for editing in a way that makes out we are the same person. As an Arab, I have now taken further interest in the Iranian articles as I have found tremondous racial bias that is enforced by the same group of people. I think others have also experienced this. There are more than just one or two people with the same opinion on sources and content, but it looks like they are always over-ruled by the same people. If you want to end these problems, please investigate the matter for yourself. You do not have to take my word if you think I am a liar, just judge for yourself.</dd>

<p>Да я сделал вроде. Закон Украины от 23 Августа 2001 года я смотрел (на английском, правда). От 1993 года - не смотрел, но там вроде все ясно. О приеме в Бернское согдашение - смотрел.

<p>Hi, Alex. Sometimes i want to refer directly to the sources or references in the discussion pages. If i copy and paste some sections of published documents to the talk page directly, does it make a problem (copyright...etc)?

<p>Please unprotect this article. I am going to nominate for deletion as it is a racial template that Turkish users are putting on <i>every single article they feel is connected to Turkic or Turkish history</i>. Turkic is not the same as Turkey and there were/are many different Turkic peoples, but this Turkish (Turkey) nationalisms is getting out of hand. This is like someone creating a template called "White History" or "Aryan History" or "Nordic History"!

<p>Hi. I'm sorry that you took it the wrong way, but if you look carefully, I put scores of <i>content-only</i> posts on that TfD, and that was only a poor attempted humor&#160;:))) So it was only some sense of humor after hours of content-related debate. I don't know if you have been following the discussion carefully, but please be aware of people coming to admins and complaining about the behaviour of some users. Don't fall into this trap. I am sorry to say this, but there are some out there who are trying to impose their views by trying to get other users banned by reporting them at every single opportunity. Most of these users themselves have been repeatedly blocked for 3RR, disruption and edit-warring. If you will notice, I have never been blocked, and since I am a very vocal critic of their POVs, there is this huge campaign to get me blocked even for the slightest excuses. Seriously. The same people have also made many bad-faith noms for AfDs articles about many prominent Kurdish scholars and templates. In any case, please, please by my guest and look at my posts in that particular TfD, other AfDs, my contribution log.. You will see that I am contributing in a manner that is not disruptive. I am very vocal, that's true, but please also make a note of the fact that I am continously being subjected to insults of being racist, ignorant and nationalist by a wide variety of users, including some who have compared "Ottoman Muslims" to "Nazi Germans" in the AfD for <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Muslim_casualties_bfe0.html" title="Ottoman Muslim casualties">Ottoman Muslim casualties</a>, and in that very article I was blatantly <b>blackmailed</b> by another user into not contributing to the AfD and taking back my content-related posts in exchange for him not reporting for PA, the PA in question being me calling the person who compared the "Ottoman Muslims" to "Nazi Germans" racist. Obviously, he took back his threat and PA report.. I didn't want to take so long, but all I am trying to say is that there is some really heavy-duty campaigns going on here, both against articles and ad hominims, and my comment about Gollum was just a poor attempt at some humor.. Also note that, those users have been confirmed for vote-stacking campaigns in that particular TfD. But I hear your concern, so I will try to keep my sense of humor a bit less sharp&#160;:))) Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I hear your concerns.. It is true that in such cases the disputing parties get carried away in their own worlds, sadly&#160;:)) Well, I also hope to go back to actually writing articles, I find it more rewarding and relaxed.. I wonder why??&#160;:))) Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alex, could you check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_I_of_Russia&amp;diff=89054478&amp;oldid=88367946" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_I_of_Russia&amp;diff=89054478&amp;oldid=88367946" rel="nofollow">these edits</a>? The guy seems to mean well but his last quotation that "such men are hated" seems to me like a POV ending to the article. I don't understand such additions as "Peter Alexeevich Romanovna", too.

<p>As a checkuser, I don't usually get involved in the enforcement of cases I look into. This is both for reasons of speed, and because just having the technical ability to check IPs doesn't give me any more of a say in simple administrative decision like interpreting and blocking based upon the result. In this case, I only reblocked because the claim that anything was "disproven" was unfounded and undiscussed. However, all the evidence has already been given by me, and administrators are free to decide how they wish. I don't mind, I just ask that there be support for the move before it's done, as with all admin reversals.

<dd>The situation is this: the IP evidence shows they've been using shared IPs in the same IP range, a university one at that. They could still plausibly be different people, but the coincidence is highly unusual, especially the fac that they were reverting to each other n the same article. However, all I'm trying to say is that I'm not the only one with all the information. That's all the information right there. It's a judgment call we just have to make based on limited evidence. That's why I'm not comfortable making the decision myself; I really have no reason to weigh in than others.. For me, the coincidence is to much to be merely coincidence, but that doesn't mean I'll mind if people want to decide otherwise. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is groundless.. I don't know if as an admin you can see which pages I have on my watchlist, but if you can, you will see that I had all those articles on my watchlist. Please look at my contribution log, I edit and engage in up-keep tasks in many articles.. The fact that I ran into Mardavich doesn't mean that I am wikistalking. I am sorry to say this, but I have better things to do with my time then stalk him.. I have told you before about being aware of this trap: please do not fall for this. I had "Military of Armenia" on my watchlist for months, it had nothing to do with Mardavich. I made a very legitimate edit to that page, please have a look. I guarantee you, I was not stalking him. There are instances where I am contacted by e-mail about certain articles, but none of them are <b>ever</b> person-specific. And I was not contacted by anyone for any of the pages mentioned above. Three coincidental edits doesn't prove the gravity of the charges laid: harassment. I am also having enough of this, blatant blackmail, insults, vote-stacking campaigns.. In any case, just be assured that I was not stalking Mardavich.. I will try to be more carefull about "perceptions" then.. I just would have wished that he had contacted me before to ask me if I was actually doing so. Pff.. Have a good day in any case.

<li>He is very knowledgeable in many subjects, especially in Russian history. In my experience in 80% of cases him reverting me he was later found to be right and in the other 20% it was reasonably possible to find a compromise). I am not an expert in the early Russian history but I have heard that Normanism is not the only acceptable theory. Since I learnt to trust Ghirlandajo's judgement then in an argument I would believe his words unless your version is supported by good references. BTW.

<ol>
<li>I put this template to articles only directly,closely related with Turkey/Turkish.
<ol>
<li>I never put this template to any place which is under the another country's sovereignity even if the condition at 1 exist.

<li>For examples,It would be disputable if I add,
<ol>

</li>

</li>
<li>For <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_language.html" title="Azerbaijani language">Azerbaijani language</a> ,two reason;please see how it is related with Turkish.It is a dialect of Turkish.App.80% Understandable by a average Turkish person.100% understandable by educated people.(Azeri Tv is one of my favour).And this language has native speakers in Turkey.
<ol>
<li>I put my comments in Talk page. I put WPTR template in alphabetic order.No delete previous any one.</li>
</ol>

It is a compilation, with an "Part One (consisting of an "Introductory Statement"), followed by a middle section which onsists of the actual "<i>Protocols</i>," and ending with "Part Two" (an analytic epilogue or postscript). So the MIDDLE is really THE HEART of our notorious <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>--and it is this which has the title: "Protocols of the Meeting of the Zionist Men of Wisdom,"
<dl>
<dd>Final description of this book:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>(1) It has a title page, in English - no question about it.
<ul>
<li>(2) It, allegedly, reproduces a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facsimile.html" title="Facsimile">facsimile</a> of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serge_Nilus_8614.html" title="Serge Nilus">Serge Nilus</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> edition of his now famous <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> book. BUT THIS PAGE IS ALL IN RUSSIAN, CYRILIC ALPHABET, WHICH I DO NOT READ.
<ul>
<li>(3) Next, on the other side, a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recto.html" title="Recto">recto</a> to the verso, it has a TRANSLATION of the RUSSIAN.
<ul>
<li>This <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> book--if it exists at all--is extremely rare--even more so than the <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> edition. SO I AM TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THE TRANSLATION IS ACCURATE. The person responsible for this American edition, which is said to be based on the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> edition, scholars say was the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Russian_6684.html" title="White Russian">White Russian</a>, and Leutenant in the military of the former {{Tsar]], by the name of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Brasol_f39d.html" title="Boris Brasol">Boris Brasol</a>.</li>

<p>Hi, Alex. The translation you asked is as follows: TR:Baris, benim katkilar listesine bir goz atsana. Benim editleri revert edene bir bak, kime yardim ediyor. Ben konusma sayfasina o herife not dustum, sen de bir goz ativersene. Bu adamlar ortak calisiyor. Bir de Turk Ordusu sayfasini karistirmaya calisan biri var. ENG:Baris, take a look at my contribution list. See who's reverting my edits, and who's the guy he's helping. I wrote a note to the guy on his talk page, take a look at this. These guys are working together. The is also another guy trying to dispute the army article.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was wondering whether Euthymios is Tekleni or not. Baris also knows him. Since Euthymios was stalking my movements, i wrote in Turkish. However, if he's Tekleni, he probably understood what i have written, cause Tekleni understands Turkish. That's the trick, i've done to recognize him. This note is not related with iranians but just for Tekleni. I was wondering whether he would jump into the army article or not. On the other hand, i'm not an army expert, but Baris knows these issues better.

<dd>Hi, Alex. The list is not that much important. The issue arised from the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a> article edit. One of the editors, <a href="../../../s/b/o/User%7ESborsody_63e3.html" title="User:Sborsody">Stacey Doljack Borsody</a> removed the links <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ikh_Bayan_24ee.html" title="Battle of Ikh Bayan">Battle of Ikh Bayan</a> which is related with <a href="../../../x/i/o/Xiongnu.html" title="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Turks_24c7.html" title="List of Turks">List of Turks</a> which includes <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attila.html" title="Attila">Attila</a>.

<p>Guys, whatever hot topics you discuss try to be civil and assume good faith. Tajik, your tone prevents other people to digest the constructive info in your message and inflames the edit war. Just now we are heading into a large Arbcom case over these Turkish-Iranian edit wars. The Arbcom would probably apply long bans to couple of editors from the both sides and put on probation the others - and who would benefit from this? Better find some middle grounds yourself. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 23:38, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Tajik. I'm offering compromise before editing/reverting the articles. That's better.

<dd><a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a>, I do not expect any good faith from you. You have proven many times that you are neither able to contribute in a positive way nor to have any knowledge of the theme you are trying to talking about. Besides that, you are also a liar, because in here you wrongly claim that you "agreed with Sikanderji's compromise version" in the <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hephthalites.html" title="Hephthalites">Hephthalites</a> article, while in reality you disputed his opinion from the beginning on, and recently you have also started to vandalize the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Huns_e9b7.html" title="White Huns">White Huns</a> page (which usually redirects to <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hephthalites.html" title="Hephthalites">Hephthalites</a>).</dd>
<dd>In your latest edits in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Turks_24c7.html" title="List of Turks">List of Turks</a>, you purposely reverted to a very obviously nationalistic-motivated POV. You try to hide your POV-ideology behind pretended civility, although every intelligent person in here knows that NONE of your edits are based on <i>good faith</i>. I have provided sources in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Turks_731a.html" title="Talk:List of Turks">Talk:List of Turks</a> page, and now it's your turn to appologize for supporting nationalistic-motivated POV. It's totally hillarious that you asked me to <i>prove</i> that the 16th century Emperor of India was not a citizen of modern Turkey!</dd>
<dd>There can't be any compromise because your edits are 100% false! If someone claims that <i>1 + 1 = 44</i>, then there can't be ANY compromise, because that's simply WRONG!</dd>

He purposly removed tons of sourced information, from Encyclopaedia Britannica and Columbia Encyclopedia. He is attempting to destroy Afghanistan's article. He also vandalized <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmud_Ghaznavi_493e.html" title="Mahmud Ghaznavi">Mahmud Ghaznavi</a>'s article, removed Encyclopaedia information and stated that it's not important to write where <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmud_Ghaznavi_493e.html" title="Mahmud Ghaznavi">Mahmud Ghaznavi</a> was born.

<dd>I've reverted Afghanistan's article to User:Pashtun's, which was the original way before User:Tajik began reverting Pashtun's edits. I've been busy reading everything User:Pashtun edited and all is verified work, no need to be removed or delted from the Afghanistan's article. I've also noticed that both user's caused the 3RR's but only User:Pashtun was blocked.

<dd>As for Afghanistan: it's not me who is "vandalizing" the article, but others, who put wrong information into it, use wrong sources (for example, they claim that Britannica supports their view, while Britannica does not have any particluar info on the subject). They also removed and insult reliable sources (such as the work of <a href="../../../e/l/p/Elphinstone.html" title="Elphinstone">Sir M.

<p>Thanks man. I mostly edit articles about places I been to and people that originated from there. I have various books and police records if you are interested.</p>
<p>Where are you from?</p>
<p>I live in St.Petersburg, Russia right now near the metro station Academicheskaya. Where in Russia do you live? I am 34 years old. How old are you?</p>
<p>Nice to meet you</p>

<dd>Anyways sorry about that. My bad, he is a student. I was just adding various Russian people to Wikipedia. Are you retired?

<p>Hi Alex, I read your comment on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Chowbok_02b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Chowbok">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Chowbok</a> and felt that I agreed immensely with what you said. What do we need to do to stop them from deleting the promo images? It just seems as if they're going forward with it and not stopping, despite the lack of concensus. I've never dealt with a problem on Wikipedia as broad as this. Is there a more official debate going on somewhere that I haven't seen linked yet? Wondering and eager to do something to keep fair use alive on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffness_f8de.html" title="User:Jeffness">Jeff</a> 09:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me add a voice to this...I have been attacked wholesale by the GFDL "jihadi" after disagreeing with them on the use of promo photos and press photos at Chowbok. Dozens of images were marked, every image I had was scrutinized by an organized group of people who have stalked every image I added, and I have so far lost 32 promo/press images, many of which were provided by the artists themselves, none of which has been replaced. I hope you'll review what's been going on with those of us that have disagreed at Chowbok, our experiences are largely the same. <a href="../../../t/v/c/User%7ETvccs_eb8b.html" title="User:Tvccs">Tvccs</a> 17:14, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So far, of the images challenged...I have lost 32 of 35, and am preparing an appeal on one or more. I also had to provide extremely detailed FUR for dozens of others immedidately after posting at Chowbok. Etc. etc. And of course I got to try and defend more than 60 images at once in a seven day period, which was utter lunacy and and of itself.

<dd>I was just reviewing your user page, by the way, and I have to commend you for being the only admin I have ever seen that provided a ready link for a recall. That text should be standard on all admin pages - well done. If I ever became an admin, god forbid, that would be the first thing I'd add. And for the record, I didn't click it...lol. <a href="../../../t/v/c/User%7ETvccs_eb8b.html" title="User:Tvccs">Tvccs</a> 06:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately there is no use in disscussing the issue with people who have a portrait of stalin on their page, and sadly it seems as though even some liberal Russians have no problem marching shoulder in shoulder with such people when it comes to the nations which Russians consider the "canonical territory". As for the edit it has been explained in an edit summary earlier.</p>
<p>Now this man Yevgenij Guzyeyev claims to be a diplomatic representative of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, is this in any way incorrect?, he is quoted to have said: "Представить, что это было сделано специально, - невозможно. Тогдашние руководители были умными людьми, поэтому невозможно представить, что это была запланирована акция" this was covered by virtually all printed media here and caused a huge outrage, in there something that would indicate he did not utter those words?, has the Russian Federation distanced itself in any way from this?. Could You explain why you consider a link to some article and the paragraph written by some guy who has a portrait of stalin on his page (but claims not to be a stalinist) to better represent the position of the RF? Can You explain why do you belive claiming Ukrainians are "politicizing the issue" by demanding the recognition of a crime commited against our nation. And last but not least, please do tell me why does a certain group of people here so desperatley seek to prevent others from finding the Holodomor in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Category%7EGenocide_a1e2.html" title="Category:Genocide">Category:Genocide</a> (while for example on Your wikipedia it's there <a href="../../../../ru/%D0%B3/%D0%B5/%D0%BD/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%7E%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B4_7b17.html" class="extiw" title="ru:Категория:Геноцид">ru:Категория:Геноцид</a>). --Vernyhora 23:08, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First I appologize for taking so long to reply, due to some underhanded activity of which You may or may not be aware I was unable to post this here yester day.</dd>
<dd>Second I find the fact that you equate commerating victims of a genocide with glorifing a mass murderer really distastefull. As you should know stalin murdered much more of your own people people then he did of any other nation (more then anyone has before him and hopefully then any one ever will). Yet amazingly in Russia there seem there seem to be public permission of his cult which would be unthinkable most anywhere else.</dd>
<dd>Now for the article itself, sadly, unlike for example the crimes commited by national socialist which are well known in the Western World or the crimes commited by the young turks which are exposed by the vast and well educated Armenian diaspora, the crimes commited by communist remain largely unknown to the general population of English speaking countries, and there are very few Ukrainians present there. Thus a group of Russian nationalists can easily manipulate Ukrainian topics filling them with soviet propaganda. You'd notice that on the Russian Wikipedia, while some rudimentary systematic bias is present, many topics are actually covered much more neutrally because a fringe group couldn't just write patent nonsense.</dd>
<dd>I also noticed that that You tried to pull a red herring at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Talk%7EHolodomor_cf32.html#Heading" title="Talk:Holodomor">Talk:Holodomor#Heading</a>, cleverly avoiding how the section title <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html#Politicization_of_the_famine" title="Holodomor">Holodomor#Politicization of the famine</a> is meant to imply that the Ukrainian demands for official recognition of the crime are an issue of politics and how You were unable to in any way comment on the scandalous quote in which the Russian diplomat in Ukraine expressed the official position of his country. --Vernyhora 12:15, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I have not blocked you and saw your block then it was already half-way trough. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is intended to be an electrified fence and you reverted five times in 24h period despite the numerous warnings.</dd>
<dd>You are welcome to propose better titles for the article while I would still suggest to collect referenced data rather that stylistic spin doctoring.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the Stalin on the user page of Kuban Kazak, you are welcome to ask him to remove it. As far as I know he put the portrait as a form of some point proving exercise. At any rate he contributed a big deal to this project including Ukrainian topics (in particular to the Kiev and Kharkiv Metro project). You so far contributed much less.</dd>
<dd>Collectivization and caused by it the Famine of 1932-1933 was a terrible tragedy and indeed a crime. Obviously it was not a genocide - a specially engineered event to kill most of Ukrainians. As it was in the Lower Volga region, Northern Caucasus, Crimea. In Kazakhstan the famine was much more terrible than on Ukraine. There was never found a single act demanding to treat Ukrainian peasants, differently from Russians, Poles, Germans, Tatars. There were absolutely no famine in Ukrainian cities. Never in the history of the Soviet Unions Ukrainians were a persecuted, discriminated or untrusted ethnicity (unlike Poles, Germans, Jews, Chechens, Kalmyks, Balts, Koreans, Armenians, Azeris - you name it).</dd>
<dd>In short, Holodomor was a typical classocide. Personally I find revolting the speculations on the dead people, but your tastes may differ. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 09:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As for your colleague his user page isn't the problem only a manifestation of it, in fact keeping the portrait there is very usefull as it serves as huge warning sign for everyone who would interact with him. By the way I did point out to him how this is inapproriate the moment he appeared on my talk page and in reply he laughed in my face.</dd>
<dd>For the 3RR, you can yourself check that I did no such thing, simply the above mentioned person posted a spoof report (with out even openly claiming I violated the rule, just lining to 5 edits and writing nonsense below it) in order to trick some administrator.</dd>
<dd>Now back to the article, are you able to provide anything that would in any way indicate the article in a respected newspaper (and the same was covered in many other) is wrong and your diplomat did not say what is attributed to him?</dd>
<dd>The fact there was no famine in the cities works against your cause not for it, as the cities were at the time already heavily russified, while in the countryside the situation remained much better, as stalin put it «Национальная проблема, в самой своей сути, это крестьянская проблема». And finaly the argument "there was no genocide against Ukrainians, because we also killed Kazakhs, Tatars, Balts and many others and even our own" is bluntly absurd. And I find it deeply revolting how some elements in Russia try to portray honoring vicitms of soviet crimes as politics. --Vernyhora 13:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Russian, do you have these (above) two words? So which is the correct translation of 12/XII???</p>

<dd>In Russian there is a word Глава = Chapter and Часть=Part. I would guess that 20..100 page sections should be Chapters, but nothing in the TOC shed any light on it: there are only numbers.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Since there seems to be some misconception regarding my review of how I typically review an editor's contributions, I would like to provide an example of a review:</p>
<ol>
<li>In this situation I am monitoring (on my watchlist) an article on a biography of a living person: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Williams_e0e5.html" title="John Williams">John Williams</a>.</li>
<li>A editor (User:Suicune tudor) makes an edit to the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Williams&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93834374" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Williams&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93834374" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) introducing a new image (<a href="../../../j/w/s/Image%7EJWSW.jpg_bd95.html" title="Image:JWSW.jpg">Image:JWSW.jpg</a>).</li>

<p>What a baloney, Oden. A number of times you have taken this course of action against anyone who disagreed with you for whatever reason. When Ghirla did it, you immediately attacked dozens of his images from years ago. When I did, not only you attacked images I uploaded, but you even attacked the articles I wrote, especially disgustingly, putting the "unreferenced" tag on the top of the short article with 5 refs listed. (Guidelines suggest to put it to the bottom or to the talk page and not when you find a single fact unreferenced, there is a "fact" tag for that)</p>
<p>You similarly attacked other people who disagreed with you on no matter which matter. This makes it obvious that you were motivated not by the policy enforcement but by the desire to cause distress to the editors in revenge for their valid criticism. For policing purpose, you go after the newbies and vandals, not the established editors who just happen to disagree with you. ArbCom confirmed that stalking motivated by the desire of distressing your opponents is harassment and has been strict with such users.</p>
<p>Fortunately, your actions were noted by the number of admins and I now I feel relieved that I don't need to spend time writing up an ArbCom case. Your activity has become notorious enough and your continuing of it will result in blocks, at it has been clearly explained to you now. As for turning your activity into contributing content, this is a very sound advise by Alex but I doubt you will take it. From what I've seen at Wikipedia, people here do not change. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your contributions.<br />
Please note that, I agree with you completely. I sent message to Khoikhoi for consensus, here;</p>

<dd>Dear Khoi, Of course I saw that film (also all other films). In Turkey there is a consensus about these people and their art works. They help to the general political athmosphere/humanity by their works in Turkey. Without regarding Turkish-Kurdish ethnicity all people(except fascits and fanatic nationalists) loves and supports them. Güney is( at that moment also) called as Kral-King(of the cinema). Güney and Erdoğan never bring to front the ethnic roots of themselves. If we put this root to the front we would disturbed their memories/works. This is the main point. Please consider in this manner. Regards. MustTC 07:20, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am ready to find a compromise way in all conditions except personal attack like as Ozgurgerilla(<i>free guerilla</i>, he declare himself as a member of <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a>) did. <i>Allah belanı(zı) versin</i> is used as a worst speach and at the ultimum point of a quarrel, after this word no way back. Also note that; there is a plural target (bela-nı; singular, bela-nı-zı; plural). Word by word translation no make sense in english, and my English is not perfect to find an equal idiom in english. Maybe another native turkish speaking user can do.

<p>Hi Alex, first of all I would like to say that I am aware of the diversity in Wikipedia and I am part of it and happy about it. Moving on to, Yilmaz Guney, he is not only a blasphemy for devoted muslims but for other people too; he got a couple of important awards in Eupore too. It is true that both Turkish and Kurdish people read the article but keeping the truth on issues is the real matter here. For example his ethnicity; Yilmaz Guney is a Kurdish director I could even prove this by uploading a video of him talking about his ethnicity. When we have such evidence about his ethnicity isn't it right to mention this on the article? I think it is. Just like we mention Isaac Newton's ethnicity or Einstein's. Such fact should be in the article because his film "suru" is in Kurdish and I don't know if you know about the Turkish &amp; Kurdish cinema but doing a Kurdish film in 70's 80's in Turkey instantly tells your ethnicity. I have no problem mentioning that the majority of his works were in Turkish but there is reasons for that. I want to keep facts on articles but some have problem when we talk about the ethnicity of some artists in Turkey. and please tell me how did I offend anyone? is stating facts on articles offending others?</p>
<p>Secondly, Mustafa did exactly what I did, he reverted the article more then 3 times that day that's violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> more then 3 times now for him. When I didn't and he tries to put a warning in my talk page about been aware of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Now that is preposterous, I am aware of it and need no warning from a user that has violated the rule more then 3 times himself. But I would like to ask you what to do in such situations when users like Mustafa try to change facts. The fatc is there he's Kurdish and he keeps changing - it I mean that is going into vandalism now. Please help me sort this issue on articles of Kurdish artists. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 14:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Out of curiosity, what did he say that offended you so much? As for the article, can't you call him "a film director, scenarist, novelist and actor from Turkey who self-identifies as a Kurd"? //Dirak 18:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been busy and couldn't look into this earlier. Apparently, the sentence in question was "Allah belanızı versin", which translates (more or less) as "May Allah curse you".

<dd>I am sorry to continue writing about his issue on your talk page Alex but I have to. Dirak, Yilmaz Guney is an important figure for the Kurds — he has produced nearly all his work in Turkish because of the language restriction in Turkey but his content contains the Kurdish culture; thus it is important for such persons Wiki article to clearly state his ethnicity and the identity he accepts. This is done in all the English, German, Greek people's articles. I am still not happy with the current statement in the article it follows "Yilmaz Guney was a Turkish language film director..." I mean yes we need to mention the language of his works and how important it is but I'm asking you all if it right to start an article stating his works language?</dd>

<p>This user made an edit in the article <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_music.html" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic music</a> which has sparked debate in the past, as can be seen on his talk page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Venu62#My_reverts|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Venu62#My_reverts|here" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>].

<p>He has replied with a warning of a personal attack, warning me of blocks and suggesting I do not keep a cool head when editing, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ncmvocalist&amp;redirect=no#Your_reverts_to_Carnatic_music|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ncmvocalist&amp;redirect=no#Your_reverts_to_Carnatic_music|here" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>].

<p>Thanks for your message and looking into it. I've served my block time of 24hrs, but the admin who gave me the block should have given both me and Venu62 blocks. I just don't see the fairness if I alone got a block for it, when he's been gaming the system (and deserves an equal, if not longer block). <a href="../../../n/c/m/User%7ENcmvocalist_3811.html" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> 07:32, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Technically, if I was blocked, then why isn't the user in question being blocked for the same? I have to carry a block in my block log while he has a completely clean record, even though he should have at least one, as a record for gaming the system (on more than one occasion)... <a href="../../../n/c/m/User%7ENcmvocalist_3811.html" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> 14:27, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aye, fork alert! I slapped some merge tags to at least contain the problem...

<dl>
<dd>Alex, there seems to have been something lost in translation here between Mustafa Akalp and I. What happened was that I removed some anon's comments as vandalism from a TfD page on a template of former Armenian capitals (which Mustafa had nominated for deletion) without logging on (I wasn't sure if I could log on to Wikipedia at work or not). I then asked moderator <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Tyers_a973.html" title="User:Francis Tyers">Francis Tyers</a> to close the TfD on no consensus because it was going nowhere (most of those voting to remove the template were Turks and most of those voting to keep the template were Armenians). Francis responded and said to wait it out. But then Mustafa wrote a long-winded and hard-to-understand message on the TfD in response to my removal of the anon comments and a response to my private discussion with Francis. I acted in response by restoring the anon's comments, replying to them, removing most of Mustafa's comments on the anon (which was mostly a copy-and-paste quote of the anon comments), and then moving the remainder of his comments on my discussion with Francis to Francis's talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mustafa was apparently outraged by this move and so he and I engaged in a back-and-forth dialogue via talk pages. I became frustrated by his apparent lack of knowledge of English which caused miscommunication and I'm afraid only made the situation worse. He then resolved to place his comments back on the page. He did so and I replied, but not before removing his re-quote of the anon (which if kept intact would only confuse the reader) and the quote of the message I left with Francis (which was already linked to the article). I also then moved to rename the template once and for all from "Armenian capitals" to "former Armenian capitals," thus resolving the most pronounced issue of the dispute - its name. Mustafa became enraged and wrote another long-winded message roundly denouncing my actions to administrators and users and then re-quoting his original message again. I replied again and then he wrote this message to you. So, naturally, I am now defending myself. I take full responsibility for my actions and I apologize. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 17:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, you are certainly allowed to improve the page during XfD. If renaming of the template is a suitable compromise for both Armenians and Turks then it is the best possible outcome of XfD. Removing somebody else's messages then working as an IP looks very suspicious. If it is an isolated fact I would <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> but if it is a routine way of actions it is a gross violation.

<p>Hello Alex! You are probably familiar with Stomakhin article. I left my message on the notice board about living persons. There is nothing else I can do. Other users are editing at this moment article about Human Rights in Russia. I would not mind if they added more staff, found some factual errors in the writings, or provided alternative points of view on the subject. But they simly deleted all texts with references on certain people they do not like, such as Politkovskaya, Kovalev, etc. Unfortunately, I do not have time to argue with them about every simplest question, such as what is freedom of speech. One of my possible options would be to stop writing about any topics related to Russia. Would that be the best way to proceed? Of course I can struggle a little with Human Rights, but these people seem do not uderstand any arguments.

<p>Dear Alexei. Sorry about complain at the verge of the New Year, but I would like to bring your attention to the fact that Biophys uses third-party blogs as sources in Boris Stomakhin article, he edits citations of Stomakhin from the official court sentence and adds his personal explanations and comments to the citations. Today Biophys began revert war by reverting the whole article at once. He also repeatedly tries to reedit the redaction of Maksim Sokolov which was made by you. He deletes citations by Boris Stomakhin from article 'Death to Russia' claiming it is not reliable source. He also deleted my source-supported addition that statement of NGO, added by him, contains false facts. The problem with Biophys, in my opinion, is that he is a stereotyped person. He views that free speech cannot be limited by anything, which is weird to normal person, or wtf? If he sees someone prosecuted - it's only state and nothing else, and therefore criminal is a political prisoner. I am a lawyer having graduated three law faculties including Warsaw University and Oxford University. And my specialization is international law and international commercial arbitration in particular. I knew Stomakhin personally (not a friend, of course).<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 06:24, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many thanks for the thingie; I've never had one before! I'm going to position it inconspicuously on my user page, which I think is the Chekhovian thing to do, but that doesn't mean I'm not thrilled.(I've still got endless small details to check for that article, plus a summary-style group of articles to build up around it, and so I might actually get somewhere by about April.
