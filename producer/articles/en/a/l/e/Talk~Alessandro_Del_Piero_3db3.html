<p>"Del Piero, the Eternal Captain of Juve, is known as Pinturicchio, as Fenomeno Vero, as the Prince... he's adored all over the world as one of the best players ever to play the game. Despite an amazing amount of success on the club level, Del Piero had some bad luck playing for the Italian national team though he was still brilliant, just unlucky. Coming into the 1998 World Cup with huge expectations, he competed with fan favorite Roberto Baggio for a spot, and had some troubles because of a recent injury. Del Piero then became the scapegoat for Italy's loss in Euro 2000 final, missing a clear-cut chance. Although he was blamed, it wasn't his fault since he only came off the bench very late and wasn't fit. He then played in the 2002 World Cup, and scored a crucial World Cup goal against Mexico, but Italy once again exited early. This was very unfortunate since Del Piero was Italy's best player in the tournament."</p>

<p>Removed the following. Needs to be redone by a non-Del Piero fanboy.</p>
<p>"World Cup 2006&#160;: Despite bring the best player in the squad Del Piero finds himself starting on the bench for the World Cup: Del Piero entered as a sub very late in game in the first match vs Ghana. Del Piero entered as a sub at the 54th minute in the second match vs U.S.A, and was Italy's best player almost scoring twice with beautiful shots. It wasn't enough as Italy drew and many are hopeful Del Piero will play even more in the last match of the group stage vs The Czech Republic"</p>

<dd>Well, yes there is a need for a POV clean up, as well as quite a lot of sourcing to be done...let me just grab from the first few paragraphs here, all things that need cleaned up, sourced, or removed.....</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>but is certainly one of the most creative forwards in the world, rather than being a "goal poacher.</i> --most creative according to whom?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>He is an expert in dead-ball situations as he is among the world's best in taking freekicks and penalty kicks. Particularly famous for inside-curling, dipping shot that he takes in the area that is up to 10 yards outside the penalty box, which is known as "La Zona Del Piero" meaning "The Del Piero Zone."</i> --again, where are the sources for this? The "Del Piero Zone," surely if he's so famous for this type of stuff then somebody has written about it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Many people claim that Del Piero has never fully recovered from this injury, and therefore never quite fulfilled the potential he had shown at a very young age.</i> --these many people are quoted where? Surely in a news article that meets all criteria for <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> right?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Even if Del Piero was one of Italy's best players in the tournament he was never really given the chance that he deserved.</i> --that's pure POV right there.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Experts agree that Del Piero is back to his best in the 2005-2006 season having already scored 19 goals in all competitions as of April, 2006.</i> --where can I find the sources for the claims by these "experts?"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Apart from his football skills, Del Piero is also widely regarded highly for his character. He is one of the few players that everybody seems to like. He is humble in a unique way for footballers. It is of no wonder then that Del Piero has won numerous personal awards such as the Associazione Soomaaliya Special Award for Fairness , the Prisco award for contribution to the up-keeping of moral sporting values, and the Coppa d'Argento' Premio Speciale Gentleman Award. Many believe that these extra qualities of the player make him so beloved and adored among other players.</i> --Surely we can find sources for the awards, but the rest of it is purely pov.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Del Piero is regarded as being able to articulate himself extremely well and in an inspiring fashion. Some have argued that he has the heart and mind of a poet.</i> --then I'm sure this could also be found in some newspaper or magazine somewhere?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then there are all the quotes about Del Piero, i'm sure they can all be properly sourced too?</li>
</ul>
<p>This article needs a MAJOR cleanup, simply saying that there is no need for one does not mean there isn't a need. This is an encyclopedia, not a page on hero worship. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 01:28, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

====many of the sources are acutally there in the quotes section. many of the other things you "metnioned" are very well known. It'll be more complete with the sources, but it's still correct as it is, and it's objective, it's all correct information. I'll help add all the citations in time. It's all on the web. 22:31, 6 July 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>1) you can't use the quotations section to source statements in the main article as the quotes aren't sourced themselves. 2) Very well known to whom? die hard Del Piero fans? This article is not written specifically for them. To the rest of the world "very well known" takes a backseat to verifiability, we're not writing for the fanboys, we're writing for everybody, thus all statements that make bold claims like "he's widely regarded highly for his character" need to be sourced, if no sources are found, they need to be removed. 3) we'll judge the "correctness" of the article as soon as it has been thoroughly cleaned up, trivial and unimportant information removed, all possibly divisive or questionable material is either removed or properly sourced via <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. 4) It's objectivity is suspect as well, as is this article is highly hagiographical and reads like a fanpage, NOT an encyclopedia, the clean up tag will prompt other users to come and edit out quite a bit of the "Del Piero-cruft" which will ultimately lead to a much more neutral and objective article that is properly sourced. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 20:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no, it's not different from any other footballer's entry. These are all well known facts to the football community in large. Many of the facts stated here have sources (in the quote section there are sources, they related to the quotes and not to the main article as you wrongly tried to say, but not in the canon way of wikipedia - all this should and will be fixed in the future). Other than that , no problem at all. Good day. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a></dd>

<dd>Well, here we go again, yes...it is different from the entries of other players, the majority of entries are not hagiographical...this one is. You said "<i>many of the sources are acutally there in the quotes section,</i>" referring i'm guessing to the 4 quotes out of 13 that have sourcing material. The only other two references on this page refer to his caps/goals for club and country. Again, since you didn't read <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, "<i>well known facts to the community at large,</i>" does not matter in wikipedia. EVERYTHING that could be questioned in the article needs to have a valid source, there are currently ZERO sources in the main body of this article, which is quite unlike the entries of other footballers. The article is highly pov, poorly written and needs cleaned up. I'm sorry that you (obviously) disagree with this assertion, but any halfway competent editor will also look at this page and come to the same conclusion that I did. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 01:01, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can only repeat my previous statements. This article is very similar to most footballer entries, you can have a look around instead of just inventing stuff. What needs citations will be added in time, like I said, in the proper way and not the way it is now which is not the standard way. You added the "citations needed" very excessively and quite weirdly even foolishly, but for some, it is true, and citations will be added. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a></dd>

<dd>I added the citations needed quite appropriately, in places where claims are made that are not substantiated by sources. I'm sorry you don't understand that this is the proper way to do things. In fact I have looked around, and for quite a while now have been a frequent contributer to a vast number of entries on footballers, so no need for you to assume that I don't know what i'm talking about. You may continue to call my adding of requests for citation foolish if you wish, however EVERYTHING that I requested a source for is something that could be questioned and thus needs to be sourced. Until you actually show some action and start to add citations where requested I'll consider this conversation finished, in a few weeks if there are still outstanding issues i'll revisit the page and remove the non-sourced information. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 23:59, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added 3 sources so far... by using <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.com.html" title="Google.com">Google.com</a>.

<dd>indeed Deathrocker. Alas, I still believe Batman2005 lacks perspective on this issue. I will do as he requested though and attempt to add all the citations "needed" in the next few weeks, perhaps with yours and others help as well. I will do most of the work on it one week from today when I have the time. I will agree however that a St. Del Piero Day isn't a bad idea&#160;;) Cheers, to you too Batman2005. 04:15, 8 July 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a></dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Batman2005 on this issue of the article's tone being very subjective in places. A trivia section is by no means exempt from having to have valid sources. I see there are sources for the trivia bits now, but I do find this puzzling:</dd>

<dd>"Apart from his football skills, Del Piero is also widely regarded highly for his character. He is one of the few players that everybody seems to like. He is humble in a unique way for footballers. It is of no wonder then that Del Piero has won numerous personal awards such as the Associazione Soomaaliya Special Award for Fairness , the Prisco award for contribution to the up-keeping of moral sporting values, and the Coppa d'Argento' Premio Speciale Gentleman Award." This is not encyclopedic text, so it is presumably a quote, but from whom? The source is supposedly a blog in Finland, but there's no mention of such a text, and a blog with the name of "asshole's diary" (my translation) in English hardly seems proper source material.</dd>

<dd>as for the ads, I thought it's nice to know which ads he featured for, I thought it was excessive to put a source for every single one since there are many. As for what you mention, the article mentioned they opted for Cassano I think as a change... for years Del Piero featured for FIAT of course... then again I think it's all right to omit it since it's obvious players like him feature for many ads Amoruso</dd>

<p>Question about the number of goals for Juventus listed in the infobox... is this supposed to be for league goals only, or goals from all competitions? From all competitions, 194 is correct. The source used is footballdatabase.com, which uses only league goals. Also the Del Piero article and the Juventus article mention 194 goals. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigdottawa_f881.html" title="User:Bigdottawa">Bigdottawa</a> 21:22, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is retarded to request citations on what Del Piero's mother said or what his father job was. All these are either part of football lore or publicly well known facts. All these citation requests have tarnished this well written entry and need to be removed. For God shake, is a citation really needed to verify that the knee ligament damage of Del Piero has hindered his carrer from summiting? Or aren't the 19 scored goals in a season (most of them coming from the bench) enoough proof that his form is back in the best. All these citations are not needed and the article has received enough Wikification already. Come on...seriously!!!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.218.7.146 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.218.7.146_1087.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.218.7.146">contribs</a>).</small></p>

No, wikipedia is about verifiability, if it cannot be verified the information herein cannot be verified then it needs to be removed.

<p>====you are very much correct about this unsigned|88.218.7.146... what can I say, you're spot on. But I will still add the citations because there are higher levels than us that demand it as you can see and it needs to be respected. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 13:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps he is right in a football fan sense, but certainly not in an encyclopedic sense. Seeing as how this is not a football fan forum or Del Piero fan page, it needs to be encyclopedic, and in an encyclopedia, football lore or well known facts don't suffice. Either find the citations or it'll be removed. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 15:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd suggest some major article revamp:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>One of Del Piero's greatest strengths as a footballer is his versatility, which allows him to play in a variety of attacking positions. While he started his club career playing as a full-fledged striker, he settled into a more deeper role as a support-striker. [...]</i> --Shouldn't this paragraph be put outside his bio?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>After Euro 2004, Del Piero faced another tough moment after Juventus replaced their Coach Marcello Lippi with Fabio Capello. Capello was not convinced of Del Piero's abilities and favoured the new signing from Ajax, Zlatan Ibrahimović. [...]</i> --What is this paragraph doing inside the international football section?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why is the "2006 Season" section outside the bio?</li>
</ul>
<p>Article still in need for NPOV check. Gb1291 17:46, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
