<p>Hi there: I am sorry that my placing a notability tag on this article upset you, and am also sorry to take so long to reply; I have been away. The tag does not mean that the article is bad, it just means that you need to explain why the subject deserves an encyclopedia article. Usually this means that you have to expand the article, which you have now done, and I see that the tag has gone. You, as an editor, have the right to remove tags of this type, although it is expected that in doing so you will address the problem - which of course in this case you have done. Friends?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 07:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, on 12 November 2005, you edited <a href="../../../g/%C3%A9/z/G%C3%A9za_Lakatos_f992.html" title="Géza Lakatos">Géza Lakatos</a> article and inserted " <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, My 24, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> " for place and date of his death. I wonder if you could check your source and confirm. I have a different place and date (Sydney, May 21, 1967) Ref. Kursietis, Andris J. <i>The Hungarian Army and its Military Leadership in World War II</i>.</p>
<p>On a separate note - Do you have any information or sources on Miskolc's history during the 1956 uprising and the role played by the army <i>vis a vis</i> the AVO. (I understand that the military barracks were across the road from AVO headquarters.) I am researching various aspects of Hungarian military history and am anxious to get my facts right.<br />

<p>Szia, nem tudnád feltölteni esetleg a magyar wikiről az angolra azt a képet, ami a Vitkovics Mihály szócikket illusztrálja? Én nem nagyon értek hozzá, meg nem is vagyok regisztrálva a magyaron, úgyhogy le se tudom tölteni magamnak. Azért kellene, mert Panonian írt egy szócikket a magyarországi szerbekről és Petőfit rakta be illusztrációnak. Sikerült meggyőznöm róla, hogy ez így kicsit gáz, és elfogadná Petőfi helyett a Vitkovics képet. Ha van egy kis időd a dologra előre is köszi. <a href="../../../z/e/l/User%7EZello_a94f.html" title="User:Zello">Zello</a> 18:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Szia Alensha, the 1956 Hungarian revolution is on the Article Creation and Improvement Drive (shortcut: WP:AID) in the hopes that we can get it all cleaned up nice and ready to be the featured article on Oct. 23, the 50th anniversary of the uprising! The thing is, it needs votes. (This whole campaign was actually <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvan_1d4e.html" title="User:Istvan">user:Istvan</a>'s idea but I'm helping him out.) I'm just randomly typing messages to various Hungarian Wikipedians encouraging them to go vote. Would you please help up out? Hajrá Magyarország!&#160;;) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lastochka</a> 00:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you Alensha and Lastochka, I caught your post re: the Hungarian aricle - I wouldnt say its without merit, there are quite a few valuable but disjointed facts listed which could be brought over to the English site - perhaps doing this first, before backtranslating the En:article would at least allow you to say it actually had the Hungarian input first. BTW, Im happy this has your attention. <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvan_1d4e.html" title="User:Istvan">Istvan</a> 13:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Szívesen! I love barnstars....thinking of creating an even more prestigious Hungarian one for when the article gets FA and we can all bask in our own glory.&#160;:) Love, Lastocska <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

<p>I basically moved these articles because they were located at NN, Archduchess of Austria, which isn't the right title for princesses. I think it's actually used for grand dukes and some kings, ie, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Louis%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Hesse_2a65.html" title="Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a>, and not used to title princesses or archduchesses. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorhange_6c2c.html" title="User:Morhange">Morhange</a> 03:56, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Alensha, Your report of <i>Szonda Ipsos</i> poll forecasts for the upcoming local elections are very interesting.<br /></p>
<pre>
 + * In towns having less than 10,000 inhabitants: Fidesz 38%, MSZP 19% 
 + * In larger towns: Fidesz 30%, MSZP 26% 
 + * In cities with county rights: Fidesz 35%, MSZP 19% 
 + * In the capital: Fidesz 27%, MSZP 27%. 
 +  
 + (Source: MTI Report, September 22, 2006.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>)
</pre>
<p>These figures confirm the impression I formed on a visit to Hungary earlier this year that there is a significant divide, in many respects, between the capital (Budapest) and rest of Hungary. Do you have any information / statistics / etc., or your own views, why MSZP is running neck and neck with Fidesz in the capital, but trailing significantly in the rest of the country? In what way does the electoral demography of the capital differ from the rest of Hungary?<br />
On a different note - your excellent reports on what’s going on there might not be reaching their target audience cose wiki page "2006 protests in Hungary‎" is not integrated into any of the 'mainstream' Hungary pages, where one would naturally look for info. I came across your reports by chance.<br />
Regards (and take care!), Bardwell 23:39, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Many thanks! BTW - are you aware of wikinews? See: <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.

<p>Jó napot Alensha! I do indeed love Hungary--basically I'm Hungarian like Liszt Ferenc was: hardly any actual ethnic Magyar blood, but patriotic Hungarian to the core.&#160;:) I'd love to contribute to the Hungary portal--can't promise I'd be able to do stuff every week but I'll gladly help out if I'm needed. I can be of most use on culture-related stuff, especially music as that is my area of expertise.&#160;:) By the way, how about that vote of confidence, eh? I thought for sure Gyurcsi was political dead meat!! Is the rest of the country as annoyed as I am?&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K.

<p>Excellent! Glad to see NCurse is an admin too!

<p>Regarding your comment on my talk page, my recent moves of the Budapest station articles were motivated by the prior work done on articles akin to the likes of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Hauptbahnhof_fb4d.html" title="Berlin Hauptbahnhof">Berlin Hauptbahnhof</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praha_hlavn%C3%AD_n%C3%A1dra%C5%BE%C3%AD.html" title="Praha hlavní nádraží">Praha hlavní nádraží</a>. Whilst I would normally agree with your argument that on the English Wikipedia English placenames should be used, it is a slightly different matter with railway stations. Most railway operators in continental Europe use the original names for the stations their trains pass through (i.e. a train going from Brussels via Munich to Prague would likely be labelled as Bruxelles-München-Praha), so I believe this to be an exception to the rule.</p>
<p>There's also been a discussion on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Trains_045c.html#Station_naming_scheme" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Trains">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Trains#Station_naming_scheme</a> which might be of interest regarding this subject matter.</p>
<p>Regarding your comment about the name being "grammatically wrong", I used <a href="http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/bhftafel.exe/dn?seqnr=3&amp;ident=fs.01702326.1160249875&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/bhftafel.exe/dn?seqnr=3&amp;ident=fs.01702326.1160249875&amp;" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://jizdnirady.atlas.cz/Route.asp?cl=C&amp;tt=2&amp;i=42486&amp;s1=5129&amp;s2=12850" class="external autonumber" title="http://jizdnirady.atlas.cz/Route.asp?cl=C&amp;tt=2&amp;i=42486&amp;s1=5129&amp;s2=12850" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which both list the station as "Budapest keleti pu". It is also commonly found on destination indicators abroad. If there is any official MÁV station naming scheme, I'm interested to hear of it, but I highly doubt that even MÁV omits the "Budapest". --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoco_571b.html" title="User:Doco"><b>doco</b></a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoco_8f82.html" title="User talk:Doco">(<font color="red">☏</font>)</a> 19:47, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It may be odd but I can't really take sides in this matter.</p>
<p>Arguments for using English:</p>
<ol>
<li>easier to browse and identify for 99.99% of readers</li>
<li>(could be) universal through the English-language Wikipedia.</li>
</ol>
<p>Arguments for preserving the Hungarian:</p>
<ol>
<li>translations may sound silly or unusual for native speakers (just imagine <i><a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccadilly_Circus_f55e.html" title="Piccadilly Circus">Piccadilly Körönd</a></i> – example from <i>Problem English,</i> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9631833240</a>, p. 126), due to the mixed associations and/or the different naming conventions in different cultures</li>
<li>translations almost always can be debated; often as many guide books, as many translations; one may express the basic idea more faithfully while another version may be more widespread etc.</li>
<li>they don't help the reader identify the <i>actual</i> name of the place in question</li>
<li>if someone is really interested in a country, they can pick up the words for "street", "square", "railway station" in about one minute; constraining the translated form may become somewhat affected afterwards</li>
<li>it's hard to draw a line between things common enough to be translated and less important things where a translation can only be occasional and arbitrary.</li>

<p>Hello. I've been inserting the tables found on Hungarian political parties that show the number of seats and votes won, etc. If you could sort of go through them, maybe translating the footnotes from Hungarian, that would be nice. More importantly, though, there's a problem with Fidesz. The Hungarian version says that it won 266,689 votes in 1990 and 279,686 in 1994; the English one says 439,481 and 379,295. If you happen to know the actual numbers, please tell me so that I can make an accurate table for Fidesz as well.

<p>Hi Alensha, I have some interesting 56 political posters that could help your page - authors unknown - do you know the copyright status of political posters and gov't proclamations??

<p>Hey, how are you? Having a look at the discussion of the article in question I could notice how you congratulated and supported the SACN. I just wanna thank you for your nice words and your feeling for South America as a whole. Unfortunately, I cannot see the changes we were supposed to experience with the Union. Recently, there has been a meeting in which every associate member agreed to revoke the so-called visa. This visa, as you may know, was a compulsory and expensive document required when travelling from one country to the other. I'm pretty sure this fact is really important for us as a subcontinent, because it allows everyone to cross the border for a maximum of 90 days without showing any documentation. Anyway, there are still many things to do. I hope we can see the difference in a couple of years time.

<p>Szia! I'm sorry I haven't been helping out on the portal, I've been pretty busy and actually I'm not entirely sure how to manage a portal.&#160;:) So if you need/want help on anything, just let me know and I'll do whatever I can. I'm still pretty busy for the next few weeks but will be able to do some work here.&#160;:)</p>
<p>BTW, I noticed on the portal talk page that there is a big list of articles that need lots of work--Magyarization, KoH, Trianon etc.....I completely agree that they are a big mess. (I made the mistake of getting involved in some weird nationalist arguments a few weeks ago, sent my <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikistress.html" title="Wikistress">wikistress</a> level through the roof!) I've noticed that those articles are usually monopolized by a certain alliance of Slovakian and Serbian wikipedians who are very vigilant to let their own rather POV version of events dominate the article, and any time any of us comes along to try and balance it or correct misleading statements, we get jumped on and discredited just for being Hungarian. I'm well aware that we have our own obnoxious POV-pushers, but even those of us with no "bad nationalist" agenda get slammed along with the obnoxious ones--leading to a stalemate.&#160;:( It was mentioned on the problem article list that a Wikiproject might be needed to clean up the mess. I think that's a good idea--but i came up with an idea of my own last night, thought I might run it by you: a lot of the charges leveled against us on those articles are obviously ones of blind nationalism, saying that "of course, no one, and especially not the Hungarians, can be trusted to see their own history in a balanced NPOV way." There is indeed <i>some</i> truth to that, for every country. So what I was thinking is, how about we form some sort of informal "alliance" with a bunch of wikipedians from somewhere else? I was considering asking the Poles--we've historically been friendly with them, and the Polish wikipedians (especially Piotrus!!) are <b>amazingly</b> well-organized and professional (have you SEEN their portal and noticeboard?!). What I'm thinking is they could help resolve some of our disputes, they could be a friendly-yet-critical, reliable source of copyediting, information from more neutral sources etc., and in return we could help them with whatever similar problems they encounter. (Just think: "The Alliance of Polish and Hungarian Wikipedians"!)</p>
<p>I know it might sound a little silly!&#160;:) It was just a random late-night idea I had, and I've always wanted to play diplomat and forge some great alliance. Why not here on Wikipedia, all for the good of the encyclopedia?&#160;:) Just a thought.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lástocska</a> 18:15, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Szia! I thought of that too, if we do try and start a little "alliance" we should make it <b>very</b> clear it's not some sort of Anti-Slovak-and-Serbian Society.&#160;:) That's not my intent in the slightest. My idea really was just to have a reliable, friendly but also critical group of people to help us out if our credibility is questioned (by anyone, not just the Slovak-Serb group), help resolve disputes (again, with anyone), neutrally let us know when we DO get too POV, etc. And of course we would help them however we can. I remember back in August when the 56 project was just barely starting (still on the AID drive!), <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvan_1d4e.html" title="User:Istvan">István</a> suggested that we could enlist a group of Czechs to help us with 56, then when it came the Prague Spring's turn for an FA anniversary celebration, we would return the favor. But I couldn't find any big organized groups of Czechs, so that didn't happen. I imagine doing something similar with the Poles--and it wouldn't be all dispute resolution and arguing with annoying nationalists either, our countries have historically been pretty close and there is a lot of good we could jointly do on ordinary history and culture articles.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lástocska</a> 21:06, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jeszcze Polska nie zginiela!&#160;:) I don't have any Polish blood (as far as I know) but I completely adore the country and the people, for all their eccentricities.&#160;:) Poland and Hungary seem to have a lot in common--mainly how we've both been kicked around and caught in the crossfire every single time the big European powers start fighting. Arrrgh...&#160;:) anyways yes, I'll ask the Poles. I might leave a talk-page message for Piotrus first, just to see if it is a good idea from his perspective, and then maybe post something about it on the Polish noticeboard.&#160;:)</p>

<p>Hello there:</p>
<p>Glad you liked the blog entry about the visit to Berlin, and the Ägyptisches Museum there. Am very much a museum enthusiast, and was just lucky that a business trip landed me in a hotel that was just up the street from "Museum Island". I have another business-related trip to Boston in February and am hoping to make a visit to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Fine_Arts%2C_Boston_df1d.html" title="Museum of Fine Arts, Boston">Museum of Fine Arts</a> while there. The previous week I made a point of photographing the Egyptian exhibits at the local (to me) <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Ontario_Museum_7b1b.html" title="Royal Ontario Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a>, and I plan to upload those over the next few days, so there will be more to come on the Commons. The organization efforts of the images there are really just part of trying to tie together all of the usable images documenting Ancient Egyptian history.</p>
<p>As for the English <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ancient_Egypt_feed.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ancient Egypt">Egyptology wikiproject</a>, please just add your name to the list! Of those listed there, the contributors I run into most are <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkh_0545.html" title="User:Markh">Markh</a>, and more occasionally <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a>. Thanatosimii and I worked on bringing the <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmose_I_3a5d.html" title="Ahmose I">Ahmose I</a> article up to Feature Article status, I have lent a hand to Marhk's efforts on the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_of_the_Kings_e6c8.html" title="Valley of the Kings">Valley of the Kings</a>, and I am also helping to add to the <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thutmose_III_7b25.html" title="Thutmose III">Thutmose III</a> article prior to submitting it for peer review. The collaborations tend to be informal, but together we have been able to improve a significant number of articles on the topic of Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>As for the templates, best thing is to simply start with a template of interest and use your own sandbox to play in. Probably the most useful thing to do would be to head to the page of a given pharaoh, such as <a href="../../../a/y/_/Ay.html" title="Ay">Ay</a>, and look at the use the "Pharaoh Infobox" template —which is arguably the most useful template currently in use — and consider applying it to articles of pharaohs using the "old style", such as <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepseskare_Isi_5a38.html" title="Shepseskare Isi">Shepseskare Isi</a> for example. This will give you a bit of a feel for how the templates are used in general.

<p>Szia Alensha, I've got a sort of stupid request. Yesterday I left a message for NCurse about a slightly disturbing statement somebody made on an article talk page, asking if it was something we should worry about. He replied, but entirely in Hungarian. You know me, I'm only half-magyar, born in <strike>exile</strike> the United States, and my Hungarian is atrocious.&#160;:( I tried translating it but I'm not sure I got it right. When you have some spare time, can you take a look at it, my reply to NCurse's reply and tell me if I've missed something? Nagyon szépen köszönöm....<a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 15:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Köszi! That's what I thought he said but I just wanted to make sure, I really appreciate your help.&#160;:) (I promise, I'm studying magyar, soon enough I'll be able to translate on my own...)<a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

<p>Hi! Thanks for your note, I'm going to break my wikibreak for a while to respond.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Yeah, I am female. I know the football stuff, plus the military history of 56, is kind of a "guy thing"--I get that a lot, also because I rarely indulge in "girl talk", I always surprise people online when I reveal my true gender. I put that "this user is female" box up there after one too many people called me "Mr. Lásztocska".&#160;:)</p>
<p>"Pusztalakó" still makes me laugh. He doesn't mind, does he? You should have a nickname just based on the word "város", to contrast the city with the great big empty Alföld. And don't worry, when I ever make it back to the old country I'll visit Miskolc AND Debrecen. But given my current unfortunate situation I should maybe be nicknamed "Külföldi"&#160;!!!</p>
<p>István really wants to see the Puskás article as FA on April 2, for what would have been his (Puskás, that is) 80th birthday. I'm with him (István) as usual, only I'm totally useless so far because I really don't know much about him that isn't already in the article. I'm trying to get a copy of his autobiography "Puskás on Puskás" but it seems to have totally vanished from every bookseller in this godforsaken country...if I find it I'll be back to help out, otherwise will still be obscure for a while. Keep an eye on the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Franz Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> article for me in my absence, will you please? Lately he's been the target of vandals and trolls asserting he was REALLY Slovak, or Austrian, or German, or anything but magyar. Knowing how much he loved Hungary, it's quite an insult to say otherwise--see my rant on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Austrians_d8a4.html" title="List of Austrians">List of Austrians</a> talk page.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Anyway, hope everything goes well here, on HuWiki and in real life! I'll be back soon (and probably still around sporadically in the meantime.)</p>

I <i>wish</i> I was planning to visit Hungary.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've noticed you was the editor who added the split request to the Jerusalem article. Was that list moved to somewhere or was it simply deleted by the anonymous user who edited it at 17:24, 9 January 2007? I noticed this quite accidentally (I was searching for that section of the article in the page history because I need the template that arranged the list into nice columns), and now I don't know whether I stumbled upon unnoticed vandalism or the list is safely moved to somewhere. – <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlensha_9238.html" title="User:Alensha"><span style="color: #008ea1">Alensha</span></a>&#160;<strong class="selflink"><span style="color: #008ea1"><sup>talk</sup></span></strong> 15:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I'm not sure what happened to it either. I saw the list had suddenly disappeared, but not moved to another article. I just didn't say anything about it because I didn't think it was necessary for the article anyway and surmised that someone else had agreed with me on that point. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 15:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason I removed the Artatama Mitannian info. is that absolutely nothing is known about her origins. That is why Aidan Dodson--who is a true professional Egyptologist--says nothing about her background in his book on Egypt's royal families. No one can prove if she was linked to the family of Yuya--or not because no text or document mentions her paternity! If her son hadn't become king, she would have remained an obscure minor wife of Thutmose IV. The O'Connor &amp; Cline book just quotes Betsy Bryan's book the reign of Thutmose IV in stating that claims that Mutemwiya was from Mitanni are likely unfounded and merely an attempt to add colour to her unknown origin. The same goes for claims that she was linked to Yuya since this is pure speculation without proof. When nothing is known of one's origins, anyone can dwell and speculate on her true origins but Wikipedia shoult dwell on the facts. Thank You. 24.87.136.31 03:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Madam, I have Nicolas Grimal's 1992 book titled 'A History of Ancient Egypt'. Grimal--who is also a professional scholar--writes that Mutemwia is "wrongly identified as the daughter of Artatama I" as once thought. (p.221) Frankly, many people would like to say that King X or Lady Y was the son or daughter of this person or that when we know absolutely nothing about King X or Lady Y's family history from the historical texts. In this vacuum, people make all sorts of guesses--whether they are absed on facts or not. I should stress that king <a href="../../../s/i/p/Siptah.html" title="Siptah">Siptah</a> was once thought to be the son of Tiaa, one of <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seti_II_17cf.html" title="Seti II">Seti II</a>'s wives even though no historical document mentioned his parentage. Some Egyptologists just guessed that it was Tiaa! But then 4 years ago, scholars found a relief from the Louvre museum which establishes that Siptah was actually the son of an unknown Canaanite woman named <b>Sutailja</b>. She was probably a king's concubine. So, now, all the previous theories about Siptah's mother have been discredited! This shows that it is safer to say that nothing is known about Mutemwia or Siptah's parents rather than to speculate because a new discovery could make everyone look foolish. I hope this helps. Fabian 24.87.136.31 09:25, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not remove the reference to <a href="../../../y/u/y/Yuya.html" title="Yuya">Yuya</a>'s possible Mitannian ancestry because no Egyptologist that I know of can dispute this theory. In contrast, both Betsy Bryan--who wrote a 1991 biography on Thutmose IV and knowsmore about the situation here, Nicolas Grimal and Aidan Dodson--by omission in the later case state or imply that Mutemwiya was not a daughter of Artatama. You have to read Betsy Bryan's book to see all the reasons why she rejects the previous assertion that she was Mitannian. Yuya, however, is a major problem. His name can be rendered in several different ways--not just Yuya but Iouiya for instance. Someone once gave me 4-5 different spellings of his name. This is not normal and MAY suggest that Yuya was a non-Egyptian though not necessarily from Mitanni. I've always thought he was Egyptian since he came from Akhmin in Upper Egypt which was mostly native Egyptian but his name is rather rare. So far no scholar can dispute Yuya's foreign origins; so, I prefer to leave the reference to Yuya's alleged Mitanni background in place and just cite the source fror this belief--Gaston Maspero's analysis in Theodore Davis' 1907 book on the discovery of Yuya's tomb. Imagine, its now 100 years and we still don't know if Yuya was Egyptian or not. This shows just how far Egyptology has come in this matter! Regards.</p>
<p>There are 5 different spellings for Yuya. (I found the message) The variations are "<b>iAy</b>", <b>ywiA</b>", <b>ywA</b> [reed-leaf with walking feet], <b>ywiw</b>" and, in orthography, usually a sign of something foreign, "<b>yiA</b>"[man with hand to mouth]. The spellings all come from Maspero's comments on <a href="../../../y/u/y/Yuya.html" title="Yuya">Yuya</a> in Davis' 1907 book. My contact says that "it is not usual to have so many spelling variants" for an Egyptian name which hints at a non-Egyptian origin for Yuya. However, she states that there are many known foreigners from Upper Egypt since the famed Brooklyn Papyrus lists 95 servants. "A list of them is included which states their titles, names and surnames, and their occupations. Of the seventy-seven entries which are presented well enough to enable the individual's nationality to be read, twenty-nine appear to be Egyptian while forty-eight are 'Asiatics' . . . Although the foreign names were not precise enough to enable the exact homeland of these Asiatics to be identified, it can be said that they were from a 'Semitic group of the north west' . . . The Brooklyn Papyrus is important here because it shows that one household employed a large proportion of Asiatics and this household was situated in Upper Egypt (the south) and not in the Delta; therefore it is apparent that Asiatic servants were by now disseminated throughout the community."

Flembes is the one you want; he has added hieroglyphics for other Egyptian articles too, I notice. You should contact him.

<p>Dear Alensha, I notice you frequently cite Aidan Dodson's useful 2004 book on Egypt's royal families in your posts regarding various Egyptian personalities. You probably have a copy of it in your home. Does Dodson make any comments concerning Beketaten--ie: her identity, etc? Beketaten does not appear as one of Akhenaten's 6 daughters. I strongly doubt that she is Nebetah for one reason. Unlike Amenhotep III's other 3 daughters, she is only attested once in the historical records by a colossal statue. She is not mentioned in small items, unlike her three sisters. This suggests to me that she had a brief life. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 10:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Beketaten was the daughter of Amenhotep III? That's strange. Maybe it is based on new information. I have a photocopy of Cline &amp; O'Connor's comprehensive 1998 book on Amenhotep III's reign and they state that Amenhotep III had only 4 known daughters with Queen Tiye: Sitamun, Henuttaneb, Isis or Aset and Nebetah. I gave my reference in the 'Family' section of <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amenhotep_III_1ba0.html" title="Amenhotep III">Amenhotep III</a>. On the theory of a Amenhotep-Akhenaten coregency, I reject the idea because the tomb of Amenhotep III always his prenomen written as Nebmaatre Amehotep--a situation which is imposible in a 19+ year long coregency. In contrast, in Akhenaten's reign, Amenhotep III's name was always written as 'Nebmaatre Nebmaatre' to avoid mentioning his father's Amun affiliated birth name. Also, a diplomatic letter addressed to Akhenaten is now believed to date to Year 2, rather than Year 12, of Akhenaten's reign as Aldred once thought. I wrote an Amazon.com review on Nicholas Reeves book "Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet" and it is still online there concerning these points. You can look it up.

<p>As an Aside, I recently expanded the article on <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramesses_IV_67dd.html" title="Ramesses IV">Ramesses IV</a> by including more information on this king's various expeditions and providing a short list of attestations for him under my anonymous 24.87, etc log in No. Someone wrote here previously that his Queen was a certain Tetopet but I know nothing about her. I assume it is true but I don't even know if her name is spelled Tetopet? If Dodson's book includes any comments on her, I invite you to add in some information on her currently blank Wikipedia web page--if you wish--since you have done the same for other Egyptian personalities. With kind Regards. Fabian <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 02:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. I will change the reference to Beketaten being Akhenaten's daughter in the <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebetah.html" title="Nebetah">Nebetah</a> page if you haven't already. Reeves book is very good on the reign of terror of Akhenaten's reign as well as the paranoia which afflicted his reign. He also correctly rejects a long coregency. But Reeves proposed identification of the male mummy in KV55 as Akhenaten is wrong; it is the body of a young man between age 19-20 years old. I have Bob Brier's 1998 book on an Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt who confirms this based on the kings bones. This is far too young for Akhenaten since the latter had 6 children in his reign and was obviously a mature adult at his accession. Secondly, his proposed identification--based on John Harris GM 1973 paper--that a ruler named Neferneferuaten was both Nefertiti and later king Smenkhkare is wrong--since several epithets given to her have the words "effective for her husband." So, the king Smenkhkare would be the young man in KV55 who died by age 20. I plan to post some information on Smenkhkare one day. PS: James Allen, in a forthcoming book in memory of Bill Murnane, thinks Nefertiti died before her husband's name and that the ruler Neferneferuaten was one of Akhenaten's five living daughters; see his article here: <a href="http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/Allen%20-%20Amarna%20Succession.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/Allen%20-%20Amarna%20Succession.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Regards, <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 20:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>About Lunca/Lonka, see also <a href="../../../b/o/c/Bocicoiu_Mare_983f.html" title="Bocicoiu Mare">Bocicoiu Mare</a>. The Romanian administrative system "peculiarity" is as follows: a <i>comune</i> consists of 1 or several villages (in this case four or five, incl. Bocicoiu Mare and Lunca la Tisa), which have a single common mayor and administration. This is because some small villages (like 100 to 1000 people and only 10 to 30 sq km of land) do not have resourses to keep a school, services, officials, etc, separately. The councilmen would be elected from villages separately, e.g. two per village, so that each one's voice be heard. The villages have the option to organize a local referendum and separate. But usually the opposite happens, they want to join to achieve more together. According to <a href="http://www.searchromania.net/maramures/bocicoiu_mare/" class="external text" title="http://www.searchromania.net/maramures/bocicoiu_mare/" rel="nofollow">this</a>, there are 4 streets in the comune, called:</dd>

<p>"Hungary lost its suzerainty, was forced to accept the Habsburg emperors as rulers, and has already lost Transylvania in 1690, when the Diploma Leopoldinum made it a Habsburg territory independent from Hungary." - Ez így konkrétan baromság. A szuverenitás megmaradt, elvesztésére csak korábban került sor a Wesselényi-féle mutyizás miatt, de Thököly miatt aztán inkább hagyták a magyarokat elkanászodni. Erdély elvesztését meg hülyeség szegény Lipót nyakába varrni, akkor már inkább Szapolyaiékat kéne megrugdalni, meg a Diploma előtt kb. 150 évig regnáló fejedelmeket. Megnézem a magyar cikket, hogy érdemes-e lefordítani egyáltalán. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathae_ce61.html" title="User:Mathae">Mathae</a> 18:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You once asked where I got James Allen's article on <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smenkhkare.html" title="Smenkhkare">Smenkhkare</a>. It is from a Univ. of Chicago web site which will publish a series of book featuring these series of online articles in honor of the late--and great--William Murnane (d.2000) sometime this year, I believe. Anyway, several more articles have been posted on this web site including an interesting new one by Van Dijk on <b>Meketaten</b>. This site basically has the latest research on Egyptological matters. Here is the link: <a href="http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/" class="external autonumber" title="http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Regards, <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 07:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Madam, I am happy that you liked Dijk's article on Meketaten. May I ask what sections of Egyptology you are mostly interested in: is it the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, the Third Intermediate Period or the women of Ancient Egypt? I notice you have posted much good information on Ancient Egypt's many women. Personally, I am quite interested in Ancient Egyptian Chronology--I hope to see the new book by Erik Hornung and his team of specialists soon at my University--and also like the New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period. Do you have easy access to specialised Egyptian serials like GM. Here in Vancouver Canada where I live, Egyptology is a minor subject--my University only recently ordered GM in 2005--and we have no Egyptology courses and only one real Egyptologist--Thomas Hikade. Before 2005, we only had JEA, BASOR, Orientalia and JNES, but little more serials that covered Ancient Egypt but little else.

<p>I too am an amateur on Egyptology. But my University has the second largest collection of books in Canada after the Univ. of Toronto. So, I have all the best books all the periods on Ancient Egypt. I just live far from my library and am no longer a regular university student. I have posted this review of Kitchen's TIPE book. Did you know Kitchen will publish a 4th updated edition of TIPE in April 2007. Thsi is unprecedented but show the popularity of his TIPE book.

<p>Dear Alensha, Thank You for your comments. No, I don't plan to be an Egyptologist but a few years ago I was on a certain Egyptological Forum where one of the participants was Frederic Payraudeau, an Egyptologist who has written articles on thew Third intermediate Period in BIFAO, Rde, GM and JEA. He taught me a lot of important information about this era. That is why I know much about Kitchen's interpretation of the evidence as well as some major problems with his view. Since Kitchen will published a 4th edition of TIPE soon, I hope he has corrected his errors here. Today almost all scholars accept that king Takelot II was never a king of the 22nd Dynasty; he was rather a king of the 23rd Theban dynasty in Upper Egypt. And his son Osorkon B did indeed become king as <a href="../../../o/s/o/Osorkon_III_6819.html" title="Osorkon III">Osorkon III</a> contra KItchen's view that Osorkon B was outmaneuvered to the throne. Kitchen maintains taht the Thebans would never accept Osorkon B as their king but he fails to understand that if Thebes was involved in a civil war which lasted for 20+ years, most people would get weary and be willing to accept him as their king if he did indeed defeat 'his unnamed enemy' <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoshenq_VI_b90b.html" title="Shoshenq VI">Shoshenq VI</a> as Osorkon claims in a Karnak Quay text dated to Year 39 of Shoshenq III. They would do so to gain stability and peace in their lives. Today, Egyptologists have found the Tehna stela; this document actually calls Osorkon III a <b>High Priest of Amun</b>. That person can only be the High Priest Osorkon B. This means Osorkon III=the HPA Osorkon B. All Egyptologists including Aidan Dodson, Gerard Broekman, J. <a href="../../../v/o/n/Von_Beckerath_0f1f.html" title="Von Beckerath">Von Beckerath</a>, Jansen Winkeln, Rolf Krauss, etc have accepted this view--except Kitchen for the reasons I gave you.

<dd>I put in a pronunciation note for Labiş - at least I think that's how you do it. He is indeed a fine poet, and his article is one of my targets for expansion. I need to mention that the "accident" that killed him was almost certainly the work of the secret police, as he had opposed the regime during the protests in Romania in late 1956 and witnesses saw him being pushed under. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 17:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, Priskin is a good footballer and plays for the national team (the HUNGARIAN one, I might point out--grr!) and even plays in the English Premier League now, so he definitely deserves a Wiki article. I did see all that mess on HuWiki--pretty stupid. Where does Mt7 get off, saying I and whoever else are "against Slovak-Hungarians"? I'm not against anyone, I was just trying to clean up what I thought was a silly-sounding sentence, and then this dumb war breaks out...</p>

<p>Szia Alensha. I've been helping <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> correct the spelling of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Union_of_Hungarians_in_Romania_fd30.html" title="Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania">RMDSZ</a> politicians at <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_Templates_e59e.html" title="User:Dahn/Templates">User:Dahn/Templates</a>. However, I'm still unsure about a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Laszlo Borbely" — I can say for certain that the correct seplling is <a href="../../../l/%C3%A1/s/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3.html" title="László">László</a>, but I'm not sure about the surname. Is it "Borbély"?</li>
<li>Hajdu Gábor — has two articles about him on the Romanian Wikipedia: <a href="../../../../ro/m/e/n/Menyh%C3%A9rt_Hajdu_Gabor_9d4b.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Menyhért_Hajdu_Gabor">Menyhért Hajdu Gabor</a> and <a href="../../../../ro/m/e/n/Menyh%C3%A9rt_G%C3%A1bor_Hajdu_5507.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Menyhért_Gábor_Hajdu">Menyhért Gábor Hajdu</a>. "Gábor" is probably his given name, as it translates to "Gabriel" in English. However, it <i>might</i> be his surname, what do you think?</li>

<li>Francisc Baranyi — now this is an interesting one. I knew someone called Feri (pronounced "fedie", right?), so I assumed that his name was Ferenc. However, I remember seeing his name spelled "Francisc" somewhere, which I assumed was simply a typo for Francisco (he moved to Mexico). However, is Francisc a Hungarian name?

<dd>I see. What confuses me is that an RMDSZ member can have a Hungarian surname (Baranyi), but a non-Hungarian given name ("Francisc").
