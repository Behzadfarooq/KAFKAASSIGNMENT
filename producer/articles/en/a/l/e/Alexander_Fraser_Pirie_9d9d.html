<p>He was born in <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guelph%2C_Ontario_ed32.html" title="Guelph, Ontario">Guelph, Ontario</a>, Canada on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>. Mr. Pirie's father was <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Pirie_e418.html" title="George Pirie">George Pirie</a> (1799-1870), a native of the city of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, Scotland. His mother was Jane Booth<a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=booth&amp;GSfn=jane&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=11883232&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=booth&amp;GSfn=jane&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=11883232&amp;" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (1825-1895), born in Lonmay <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire.html" title="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a> to a family from <a href="../../../n/o/s/Noss.html" title="Noss">Noss</a> Island in the Shetland Islands.</p>
<p>Mr. George Pirie emigrated to Canada with a group of Aberdeen merchants and businessmen. The family arrived in 1838 and joined the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Accord_03d4.html" title="Bon Accord">Bon Accord</a> settlement located in the vicinity of <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elora%2C_Ontario_f783.html" title="Elora, Ontario">Elora, Ontario</a>. He brought with him his first wife, Mary Robieson, and their children. She died not long after her arrival in Canada, and Mr. Pirie married Miss Jane Booth.</p>
<p>In 1848 George Pirie became the publisher of the <i>Guelph Herald</i> newspaper after his attempt at farming in the Bon Accord community. The farm was sold and the family moved to <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guelph%2C_Ontario_ed32.html" title="Guelph, Ontario">Guelph</a> and ran the <i>Guelph Herald</i> publishing and printing office on Wyndham Street. The elder Pirie was a staunch conservative and Scottish Canadian poet. <a href="http://groups.msn.com/CanadaWorldWarOnetheFirstContingent/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=938" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.msn.com/CanadaWorldWarOnetheFirstContingent/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=938" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>As a young man, Alexander Fraser Pirie assisted at his father's newspaper office. The paper struggled to maintain circulation and relied upon job printing work. <i>Imprint</i> magazine later described these early days in a profile of Mr. Pirie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He first saw the light of publication day in his father's office, the Guelph Herald, in 1849, and was brought up to the sound of the mallet and planer, the hammering of wooden quoins in the chases and the incessant cry of "Color!" on the part of the man who pulled the lever of the Washington press. The principal event of his early life was stirring the glue and molasses over a hot fire when the foreman decided to cast a new roller, the making of a new roller being at that time regarded as an epoch in the history of all well-regulated country printing offices."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After his father's death in 1870, A. F. Pirie, at 21 years of age, became publisher of <i>The Herald</i>. During this time he took on the numerous duties of a local newspaper which included the issuing of marriage licenses. At this time he received a letter from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Macdonald_c0d0.html" title="John A. Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a> authorizing him as the local agent for these licenses. However, Mr. Pirie had a great desire to work as a journalist in a larger city, and two years later moved on to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. <i>The Herald</i> was in 1924 absorbed by the <i><a href="../../../g/u/e/Guelph_Mercury_f3bf.html" title="Guelph Mercury">Guelph Mercury</a></i>.</p>
<p>By 1874, Mr. Pirie was working at the <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Sun_5f34.html" title="Toronto Sun">Toronto Sun</a></i> as a columnist. From a circa 1876 article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Sun...still retains one of the most fertile humorists in Canada in the person of Mr. Alexander Pirie, commonly known as the "Sun Skit Urchin". This gentleman, who is still very young, finds plenty of work for the scissors of his contemporaries in a daily column of "Sun Skits." They abound in reckless humor, sparing no one, and have just the pleasant bitterness of a dry curacoa. They have now flowed forth in an uninterrupted stream for nearly two years, and neither the supply nor quality shows any signs of falling off".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A caricature of Mr. Pirie as the "Sun Skit Urchin" appeared in <i>Grip</i> magazine at this time. <i>Grip</i> magazine was Canada's version of the satirical British magazine <i><a href="../../../p/u/n/Punch_%28magazine%29.html" title="Punch (magazine)">Punch</a></i>. Mr. Pirie was also a contributor to <i>Grip</i>, however, these contributions were submitted anonymously. He also penned several articles for <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_%28magazine%29_c199.html" title="Saturday Night (magazine)">Saturday Night</a></i>. "Rambles About Rimouski" was a story of the history of <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimouski%2C_Quebec_90df.html" title="Rimouski, Quebec">Rimouski, Quebec</a>.</p>
<p>He was a popular editorial columnist, as well as social figure and public speaker. During the 1870s he lived with his mother and other family members on Mutual Street in Toronto. This house is now demolished but is in the vicinity of <a href="../../../r/y/e/Ryerson_University_318f.html" title="Ryerson University">Ryerson University</a>. He was in demand as a public speaker, and known for his use of political humour. Throughout his years in Toronto he was present at many of Toronto's social events, such as an 1885 reading by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kirkland_Kernighan_bf15.html" title="Robert Kirkland Kernighan">Robert Kirkland Kernighan</a> (“The Khan”). His speaking engagements ranged from reviews of his European travels to speeches in support of Liberal political candidates.</p>
<p>Mr. Pirie was accepted as a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Mason</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a> at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Lodge_1278.html" title="Grand Lodge">Grand Lodge</a> at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Ontario_a636.html" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>. This would have enhanced many social connections in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> Toronto.</p>
<p>In 1876 Mr. Pirie joined the <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Telegram_a5d8.html" title="Toronto Telegram">Toronto Telegram</a></i>. He was best known as the second editor of the <i>Telegram</i>, a role he held until 1888. The <i>Telegram</i> was founded in 1876 by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ross_Robertson_5aeb.html" title="John Ross Robertson">John Ross Robertson</a> as a paper devoted to Toronto's interests, and, as Mr. Robertson described it, devoted to "today's news to-day"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mr. Pirie spent his first year at the <i>Telegram</i> working under the historian <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Charles_Dent_6a20.html" title="John Charles Dent">John Charles Dent</a>. After that he took on the role of editor which he held until 1888. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 1923 review of the history of Toronto newspapers commented on Mr. Pirie's time at the <i>Telegram</i>: "Then came Mr. A. F. Pirie, one of the wittiest and most companionable of men, whose paragraphs, straight-flung and barbed at the point, enlarged public interest in the enterprise". <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1886 A. F. Pirie participated in a literary debate relating to Canada's role in North America and her relationship with the United States. Articles under the heading "Canadian Prospects and Politics" were submitted to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_North_American_Review_4b83.html" title="The North American Review">The North American Review</a></i> for the January 1886 issue (Volume 142, Issue 350) by the Marquis of Lorne and A. F. Pirie with a brief note from Sir John A. Macdonald. <a href="http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/sgml/moa-idx?notisid=ABQ7578-0142&amp;byte=103370172" class="external text" title="http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/sgml/moa-idx?notisid=ABQ7578-0142&amp;byte=103370172" rel="nofollow">A. F. Pirie, pp. 45-49.</a></p>
<p>In February 1893, Mr. Pirie was elected president of the Canadian Press Association <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. In this capacity he spoke on behalf of Canadian interests at the World Press Conference in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois. According to an article in the <i>Toronto Mail</i> entitled "Good Words for Canada - Plain Talk at the Press Convention" (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>), it was reported that Canada had the "honor of closing the proceedings of the ninth annual convention of the National Editorial Association" with the last address delivered by A. F. Pirie. Mr. Pirie also represented the Canadian Press Association at the World's Press Congress. The reporter felt that "He said some good words for Canada, reminding his hearers that there were a hundred thousand Canadians in Chicago alone..." Also, that Mr. Pirie had noted the role women had been taking in the press congress and stated that as the public journals were made for men and women, ..."there seemed to be no good reason that women as well as men should not bear a part in making them". Finally, he made a strong plea for closer trade relations between the U.S. and Canada: "...holding it to be a shame and an outrage that Canadian workmen should be shut out of the United States, and Canadian products subjected to a high duty, after all the Canadians had done for the United States at the time of the civil war, when 40,000 took up arms for the union, and all that Canadians in the States are still doing in building up that country". He appealed to the journalists of America for fair play for Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Pirie's work attracted many admirers. <i>Imprint</i> magazine, in profiling the new President of the Canadian Press Association wrote in reference to his 1889 <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Notman_4a8a.html" title="William Notman">William Notman</a> portrait which was published within the article: "The portrait does not do justice to its subject: to do so it would require to be a "speaking likeness", for our friend is just as handy with his tongue as he is with his pen - he is a born orator as well as journalist." Commenting on his career, Imprint noted: "Mr. Pirie is a writer of great versatility, a capital speaker, one of the best-natured men in the profession, and publishes a model country weekly..."; and on his popularity: "He is one of the most popular of our Canadian journalists, a believer in his country and its future, and is a good representative of the men who make Canadian newspapers." <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>He married Hester Emma McCausland<a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=mccausland&amp;GSfn=hester&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=11799733&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=mccausland&amp;GSfn=hester&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=11799733&amp;" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (1858-1901) in Toronto on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a> at her father's home on Jarvis Street. Miss McCausland's father Joseph McCausland<a href="http://groups.msn.com/CanadaWorldWarOnetheFirstContingent/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=2245" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.msn.com/CanadaWorldWarOnetheFirstContingent/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=2245" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> had been in Toronto since the 1820s and was a native of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armagh.html" title="Armagh">Armagh</a>, Ireland (today's N. Ireland), and founder of a successful Toronto stained glass window firm. The newly married couple moved to Montreal where Mr. Pirie briefly worked as an Editor at the Montreal Star. At this time they were photographed by Canada's top portrait photographer <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Notman_4a8a.html" title="William Notman">William Notman</a>. By 1889 they returned to Dundas (Ontario) and purchased a home on Sydenham Street that they named "Sydenham Lodge". Four children were born in Dundas during the 1890s - Russell Fraser, Elsie Gowan, Jean Booth and Goldwin McCausland. This home still stands and in recent years was used for the filming of one episode in Season Six of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_Wing_%28TV_series%29_5872.html" title="The West Wing (TV series)">The West Wing</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1895 Mr. Pirie lost his mother, Jane (Booth) Pirie, who fell ill after a visit to Dundas from her Toronto home. Jane Pirie had actively assisted in her husband's publishing and printing business in Guelph, and in the 1890s had drafted an account of her travels to Western Canada which Mr. Pirie published in the <i>Dundas Banner</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Pirie was interested in politics and during the Parliamentary session of 1888 he had represented The <i>Montreal Star</i> in the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Press_gallery.html" title="Press gallery">press gallery</a> at Ottawa. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Provincial General Election of 1898 Mr. Pirie had had received a Reform normination as a candidate for North Wentworth.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>This was not successful, and afterwords he worked for the Liberal Party of Canada, often appearing as a public speaker, or editing work destined for publication. He appeared in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brantford%2C_Ontario_451a.html" title="Brantford, Ontario">Brantford, Ontario</a> on behalf of the Hon. William Paterson for the election of 1900<a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/bio.asp?Language=E&amp;query=16404&amp;s=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/bio.asp?Language=E&amp;query=16404&amp;s=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. At that time the audience rose to its feet in a standing ovation. Mr. Pirie began his speech noting that his reputation as a humorist preceded him, however, in this case, he had some serious issues to cover.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs. A. F. Pirie died of pneumonia in 1901 after a brief illness. She was only 43 years old. After this time, Mr. Pirie's health broke down and he limited his public engagements. He continued some of his work for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a>, and public speaking engagements. According to newspaper accounts after his death, his relatives noted that he began to stay indoors for much of the time. His cousin Robinson Pirie of Hamilton began to visit him to urge him to get out. In 1901 he attended a conference for the Canadian Press Association held in Charlottetown, P.E.I. A. F. Pirie wrote to his sister-in-law in Toronto (Mrs. Boyce Thompson) that many events had lost their lustre. He wrote that he made a regular visit to his wife's grave on Sundays.</p>
<p>In August 1903 Mr. Pirie visited relatives in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon%2C_Manitoba_68f4.html" title="Brandon, Manitoba">Brandon, Manitoba</a> in conjunction with some work for the Liberal party. Relatives hoped that this trip might improve his state of mind. After his return to Dundas, he died at home on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>. This event shocked the community. In a letter preserved at the Whitehern museum archives, Mrs. McQuesten wrote to her son Rev. Calvin McQuesten in Montreal about the event. <a href="http://www.whitehern.ca/result.php?doc_id=W5074&amp;keyword=pirie&amp;subject=--All%20Subjects--&amp;type=--All%20Document%20Types--&amp;creator=--All%20Creators--&amp;date=--Any%20Date--" class="external text" title="http://www.whitehern.ca/result.php?doc_id=W5074&amp;keyword=pirie&amp;subject=--All%20Subjects--&amp;type=--All%20Document%20Types--&amp;creator=--All%20Creators--&amp;date=--Any%20Date--" rel="nofollow">M.

<p>A. F. Pirie's pallbearers included <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ross_Robertson_5aeb.html" title="John Ross Robertson">John Ross Robertson</a> of the <i>Toronto Telegram</i>. He was buried in Grove Cemetery next to his wife. Four children were left without parents. The children's guardian was their paternal aunt, Mrs. Ada L. Murdoch, who had been assisting Mr. Pirie since the death of her sister-in-law. Mrs. Murdoch had no children of her own and was no longer living with her husband, Mr. Walpole Murdoch, also a newspaper editor.</p>
<p>A. F. Pirie's youngest son, Goldwin McCausland Pirie<a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/virtualmem/Detail&amp;casualty=363368" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/virtualmem/Detail&amp;casualty=363368" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>(1894-1915), was to die of wounds received at the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Ypres_86d3.html" title="Second Battle of Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a> during the first World War while serving with the 1st Battalion, Western Ontario Regiment. Pte. G. M. Pirie sent several articles back to Dundas for publication in the <i>Dundas Star</i>. Although not a writer, the younger Pirie wrote his articles with a humorous bent in the tradition of his father. <a href="http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/transcripts/transcriptDisplay.asp?Type=L&amp;Id=1" class="external text" title="http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/transcripts/transcriptDisplay.asp?Type=L&amp;Id=1" rel="nofollow">Four Letters from Valcartier Camp, 1914</a></p>
<p>In 1918 <i>The Hamilton Review</i> published an article on Mr. Pirie by Sir John Willison (of <i>The Globe</i>) who had been profiling political and public personalities from Canada's past. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But Mr. Pirie was more than a jester. He had qualities of heart and mind which were seldom revealed and only to those who had his affection and confidence. These were few, for beneath an apparent openness and spontaneity there was a reserve which was not easily penetrated. He got much out of life, but not all that he desired. Happy but often anxious and foreboding...when I think of Pirie I recall what was said of Shelley: 'He passed through life like a strange bird upon a great journey, singing always of the paradise to which he was travelling, and suddenly lost from the sight of men in the midst of his song.'"<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
