<p><b>Alexander in the Qur'an</b> is a theory that holds that the character of <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhul-Qarnayn_4857.html" title="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</a>, mentioned in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, is in fact <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>. The name Alexander itself is never mentioned in the Qur'an. Dhul-Qarnayn (in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> Ø°Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø±Ù†ÙŠÙ†) is a figure who was well-known in the lore of the early <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> dwellers of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, and is mentioned in the Qur'an, the sacred scripture of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Dhul-Qarnayn is regarded by some Muslims as a prophet. The Qur'an indicates that the people (at least Jewish <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbis.html" title="Rabbis">rabbis</a>), during <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s time, already knew tales of a person of great power by the name of Dhul-Qarnayn.</p>
<p>It is almost universally held, among Western scholars, that the character of Dhul-Qarnayn corresponds to Alexander the Great. The reason for this is that the story of Dhul-Qarnayn as described in the Qur'an follows very closely some passages of the <i><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Romance_1ce3.html" title="Alexander Romance">Alexander Romance</a></i>, a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander's exploits from Hellenistic and early Christian sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_history.html" title="Ancient history">Antiquity</a> and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Historically, Muslim scholars have endorsed the identification of Dhul-Qarnayn with the Alexander the Great, although competing theories have been proposed, some recently (see <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhul-Qarnayn_4857.html" title="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</a> for details). <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalist.html" title="Orientalist">Orientalist</a> scholars, studying ancient <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> legends about Alexander the Great, independently came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epithet.html" title="Epithet">epithet</a> for Alexander the Great. As a result, the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn has become a matter of great controversy in modern times.</p>

<p>Very little is written about Dhul-Qarnayn in the original sources of Islam, but he features prominently in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, the sacred scripture believed by Muslims to have been revealed by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">God</a> to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. He is commonly regarded as one amongst the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">prophets of Islam</a>, but does not feature nearly as prominently in the Qur'an as prophets such as <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and other major <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical.html" title="Biblical">Biblical</a> characters. For this reason, there is uncertainty in Islam as to whether he is a prophet of Islam or only a person of power who was favored by God. The story of Dhul-Qarnayn appears in sixteen verses of the Qur'an, specifically verses <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Holy_Qur%27an" class="extiw" title="wikisource:The_Holy_Qur'an">18:83-98</a>.

Ibn Ishaq's Sira reports that the eighteenth chapter of the Qur'an (which includes the story of Dhul-Qarnayn) was revealed to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">God</a> on account of some questions posed by the Jewish Rabbis residing in the city of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a> - the verse was revealed during the Meccan period of Muhammad's life. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad's tribe, the powerful <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quraysh.html" title="Quraysh">Quraysh</a>, were greatly concerned about their tribesman who had started claiming prophethood and wished to consult Jewish Rabbis about the matter. The Quraysh sent two men to the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> Rabbis of Medina, reasoning that the Rabbis had superior knowledge of the scriptures and about the prophets of God. The two Quraysh men described their tribesman, Muhammad, to the Rabbis. The Rabbis told the men to ask Muhammad three questions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"They (the rabbis) said, `Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, and if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story? For theirs is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who travelled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story? And ask him about the Ruh (soul or spirit) -- what is it? If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.'" <a href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=18&amp;tid=29908" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=18&amp;tid=29908" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The famous story, in the Sira, goes that when Muhammad was informed of the three questions from the Rabbis, he declared that he would have the answers in the morning. However, Muhammad did not give the answer in the morning. For fifteen days, Muhammad did not answer the question. Doubt in Muhammad began to grow amongst the people of <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>. Then, after fifteen days, Muhammad received the revelation that is <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surah.html" title="Surah">Surah</a> <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Kahf_0307.html" title="Al-Kahf">Al-Kahf</a> ("the Cave"), the eighteenth chapter of the Qur'an. Surah Al-Kahf mentions the "People of the Cave," a strange story about some young men in ancient times who slept in a cave for many years. Surah Al-Kahf also mentions the Ruh, or soul/spirit. Finally, the surah also mentions "a man who travelled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth" - namely, Dhul-Qarnayn.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Ishaq_cd6c.html" title="Ibn Ishaq">Ibn Ishaq</a>'s original work is lost, but it has been almost completely incorporated in <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hisham_f7c9.html" title="Ibn Hisham">Ibn Hisham</a>, another early Muslim historian. Ibn Hisham collected Ibn Ishaq's <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sira.html" title="Sira">Sira</a> and added his notes to it; in regards to Dhul-Qarnayn, Ibn Hisham noted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Dhu al-Qarnain is Alexander the Greek, the king of Persia and Greece, or the king of the east and the west, for because of this he was called Dhul-Qarnayn [meaning, 'the two-horned one']..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The theme, amongst Islamic scholars, of identifying Dhul-Qarnayn with Alexander the Great appears to have originated here. Why Ibn Hisham made this identification is not entirely clear. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotelian</a> Muslim philosophers, such as <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Farabi_ebc1.html" title="Al-Farabi">al-Farabi</a>, <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avicenna.html" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Kindi_85de.html" title="Al-Kindi">al-Kindi</a> enthusiastically embraced the concept of Dhul-Qarnayn being an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">ancient Greek</a> king.

<p><a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalist.html" title="Orientalist">Orientalists</a>, studying ancient <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> legends about Alexander the Great, have come to conclude that the Qur'an's stories about Dhul-Qarnayn closely parallel certain legends about Alexander the Great found in ancient Hellenistic and Christian writings. There is some <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeology.html" title="Archeology">archeological</a> evidence to identify the Arabic <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epithet.html" title="Epithet">epithet</a> "Dhul-Qarnayn" with Alexander the Great.

<p>Alexander the Great was an immensely popular figure in the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_antiquity.html" title="Classical antiquity">classical</a> and post-classical cultures of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Near East</a>. Almost immediately after his death a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the <i>Alexander Romance</i>, and some recensions feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise.html" title="Paradise">Paradise</a> or journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble.</p>
<p>As the <i>Alexander Romance</i> persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighboring peoples. Of particular significance was its incorporation into <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> and later <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a>, representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favor to an unrighteous ruler? This <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodicy.html" title="Theodicy">theological need</a>, plus acculturation to <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenism.html" title="Hellenism">Hellenism</a>, led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentrism.html" title="Ethnocentrism">ethnocentrism</a>. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a righteous gentile or even a believing <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheist</a>. The Christianized peoples of the Near East, inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the <i>Alexander Romance</i>, further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a saint. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander <i>"the Believing King"</i>, implying that he was a believer in monotheism (contrary to known historical facts).<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Britannica"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Alexander_in_the_Qur%27an_0ffd.html#endnote_Britannica" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Alexander_in_the_Qur%27an_0ffd.html#endnote_Britannica" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>As said before, the <i>"Dhul-Qarnayn"</i> literally means "the two-horned one." Alexander the Great was often depicted as one possessing horns, in particular the <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonite.html" title="Ammonite">horns of Amon</a>. Ancient Greek coins minted in the name of Alexander the Great depict Alexander with the distinctive horns of Amon on his head. <a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198805/siwa-oasis.extraordinary.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198805/siwa-oasis.extraordinary.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> The influence of Alexander the Great spread even to the coinage of ancient Arabia; in the late <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century_BC_e028.html" title="2nd century BC">2nd century BC</a>, silver coins depicting Alexander with <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram_%28animal%29.html" title="Ram (animal)">ram</a> horns were used as a principal coinage in Arabia and were issued by an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> ruler by the name of Abi'el who ruled in the south-eastern region of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Coinage"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Alexander_in_the_Qur%27an_0ffd.html#endnote_Coinage" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Alexander_in_the_Qur%27an_0ffd.html#endnote_Coinage" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The reason that Alexander the Great was depicted with the horns of Amon in ancient Greek coinage is that in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> Alexander was received as the son of the ancient Egyptian god <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amun.html" title="Amun">Amon</a>, and the god Amon was depicted as ram-headed.

He said: "(The power) in which My Lord has established me is better (than tribute): Help me therefore with strength (and labour): I will erect a strong barrier between you and them: Bring me blocks of iron. At length when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain-sides, he said, "Blow (with your bellows)".

<p>The building of gates in the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> Mountains by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance.

<p>In order to understand the legend of the <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhul-Qarnayn_4857.html#The_Caspian_Gates" title="Dhul-Qarnayn">Caspian Gates</a>, that is in order to understand how a single gate between two mountains could prevent the Gog and Magog hoard from invading the world, one must understand that the Christian legend was written in a time when most people believed that the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">flat Earth</a> is true. The Earth was described as being flat and surrounded by great mountains, and these mountains were in turn surrounded by some land followed by a treacherous, fetid ocean sea. It is this tract of land between the mountains and the ocean sea that Alexander enclosed Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes "the old wise men" explaining this <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmology.html" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a> of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander subsequently setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:</p>

And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ...

<p>A peculiar aspect of the story about Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Qur'an, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to the "the rising place of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>" and the "setting place of the Sun." Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the "rising place of the Sun," and explains that these people have no shelter from the Sun:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Then he [Dhul-Qarnayn] followed a way until, when he reached the rising of the Sun, he found it rising upon a people for whom We had not appointed any veil to shade them from it ... " (Qur'an 18:89-90).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Qur'an also describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to the place where the sun sets into a murky spring:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"... Until when he [Dhul-Qarnayn] reached the setting of the Sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water. Near it he found a People ..." (Qur'an 18:86)</dd>

<p>It may not be clear what these verses refer to.

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, an almost identical discourse is found in the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac.html" title="Syriac">Syriac</a> Christian legends about Alexander the Great. The Christian legend about Alexander explains that when the Sun sets into the fetid sea, it enters into heaven and immediately bows down in obedience to God, In the legend, Alexander travels to the fetid sea at the end of the Earth. As mentioned the previous subsection, this legend was understood from a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">flat Earth</a> point of view. The legend explained that "the old, wise men" told Alexander that at the ends of the flat Earth is a sea in which the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> rises from the west and in which the Sun sets in the east. The waters of this sea were imagined as being fetid place and intensely hot from the heat of the Sun when it rose from the waters. Upon hearing about this <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmology.html" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a> from the wise men, the legendary Alexander sets out to the end of the flat Earth and witnesses the Sun rising from the fetid sea. According to the Christian legend, at this place, where the Sun risies out of a terrible sea, Alexander found a people who have no shelter from the Sun which is literally rising out of an intensely hot sea;</p>
<dl>
<dd>" The place of his [the Sun's] rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of heaven to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves ... And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he [it] straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he [the Sun] rises ... So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea to the place where the Sun enters the window of heaven; for the Sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Pseudo-Callisthenes"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Alexander_in_the_Qur%27an_0ffd.html#endnote_Pseudo-Callisthenes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Alexander_in_the_Qur%27an_0ffd.html#endnote_Pseudo-Callisthenes" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></sup></span>(p.148.)</dd>

<p>The Qur'anic and Christian legendary accounts both have it that Alexander the Great travelled to the ends of the Earth, in particular to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). This allegory served the legendary accounts to convey the theme of Alexander's great exploits as a conqueror. In the context of the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">flat Earth</a>, travelling to the places of the setting and rising of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> would imply having travelled across the entire world. However, many modern Muslims insist that the Qur'an's descriptions of Dhul-Qarnayn travels are just allegorical references to Alexander's travels towards the east and the west, and do not imply Dhul-Qarnayn travelled to the ends of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">flat Earth</a>. Naturally, the stories about Alexander's travels to the eastern and western extents of the world are a legendary tradition, which built up over centuries throughout the lands conquered by Alexander and beyond, after his death.</p>

<p>As it has been noted, the early Muslim scholars generally identified the Dhul-Qarnayn of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> with Alexander the Great. In the centuries that followed, Dhul-Qarnayn was often thought of by Muslims as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophet of Islam</a>. Early Islamic civilization would produce its own legendary traditions about Alexander the Great, particularly in Persia.</p>
<p>With the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_conquest_of_Persia_936d.html" title="Islamic conquest of Persia">Muslim-Arab conquest of Persia</a>, the <i>Alexander Romance</i> found its way to an honored place in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_literature.html" title="Persian literature">Persian literature</a>â€”an ironic outcome considering pre-Islamic Persia's hostility to the national enemy who not only destroyed the glorious <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaemenid_dynasty.html" title="Achaemenid dynasty">Achaemenid Empire</a>, but was also directly responsible for centuries of Persian domination by <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucid_dynasty.html" title="Seleucid dynasty">Hellenistic</a> foreign rulers.

<p>Though many Muslim scholars have traditionally identified Dhul-Qarnayn with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, this identification has today become subject among Muslim scholars of numerous attacks.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Most of the factual details of the <i>Alexander Romance</i>, as those that appear to be included in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> (Alexander's fantastic deeds as well as his implied monotheism), have little or no basis in historical fact; and if Dhul-Qarnayn is Alexander, this confusion between fact and legend could possibly be a source of embarrassment to some Muslim scholars, even if not to all.</p>
<p>The historical personality of Alexander the Great was co-opted by the legendary traditions of both Judaism and Christianity, which chose to portray Alexander as "the Believing King" â€” a devout monotheist. It was in this Judeo-Christian context that the legends of Alexander the Great reached the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>. Thus, it is not difficult to understand how the pagan Alexander may have ended in the Qur'an's list of Islamic Prophets.</p>

Ancient Muslim scholars of the Islam were unaware of such theological controversies, but even in modern times, some influential mainstream Muslims (such as <a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusuf_Ali_175f.html" title="Yusuf Ali">Yusuf Ali</a>) have endorsed the traditional Islamic view which identified Dhul-Qarnayn with Alexander the Great, judging the theological problems that could be posed surmountable. Most secular scholars studying Islam have been concord in their view that there is strong evidence supporting the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is none other than Alexander the Great. However, belief in the infallibility of the Qur'an has made this position untenable in the opinions of many modern Muslim scholars.
