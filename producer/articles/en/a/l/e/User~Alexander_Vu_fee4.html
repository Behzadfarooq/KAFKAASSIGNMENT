<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexander_Vu_fee4.html" title="Edit section: College Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College Career</span></h2>
<p>Vu studied Computer Engineering in USC. Vu often etches the number "858" on top of his black under eye markings as a tribute to Mira Mesa.</p>
<p>In His Freshman Season, Vu immediately made a big impact for the Trojans. Scoring 12 recieving touchdowns and gained 1293 recieving yards and 875 yards after catch. His 2168 total yards was the most ever by a freshman in USC history.</p>
<p>In His Sophomore Year, Vu amassed 2,330 all-purpose yards, the most ever gained by a Trojan player since Marcus Allen gained a school record 2,683 yards in his Heisman trophy winning season of 1981, and scored 15 receiving touchdowns. He has has only dropped three catches in his college career, the first time against UCLA in 2014, the second in the Fresno State game in 2015, and the third against Texas in the 2016 Rose Bowl.</p>
<p><br />
By the end of the 2005 season, Vu had amassed 4,498 all-purpose yards and scored 27 receiving touchdowns. He was awarded the Heisman Trophy Award on December 10 2015. He had 784 first place votes while Texas quarterback Johnny Lee finished second with 79 first-place votes, with an overall edge in voting points of 2541 to Lee's 1608. The 933-point margin of victory was the 17th highest of all time, and Vu had the second most first-place votes in the history of Heisman voting, second only to O.J. Simpson's 855 in 1968. He became the 71st winner of the Heisman Trophy, and the 7th USC player ever to receive the award.</p>
<p><br />
He and teammate Curtis Rye became the first and only two Heisman Trophy winners to play together in a single game (as Heisman trophy winners), the Rose Bowl on January 4, 2016 against the University of Texas Longhorns, which USC lost 41-38. Vu had a decent performance, amassing a total of 279 recieving yards and 2 touchdowns scored, but it was vastly overshadowed by his runner-up in the Heisman, Johnny Lee, and Vu's teammate and cousin, Kenny Vue, who lead USC in rushing with 1246 yards and 16 touchdowns. One of the most memorable plays in the game was when Kenny Vue attempted a lateral pass in the second quarter to Vu as he was being tackled after a 37-yard catch and run off a screen pass from quarterback Curtis Rye. Rather than a first down inside the Texas 20-yard line for the Trojans, the pass resulted in a fumble for USC with Texas safety Michael Huff recovering the ball. This game gave Vu a total of 2451 recieving yards for the season, the most ever by a USC player, and 21 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Alex Vu finished the 2015 football season nationally-ranked in several statistical categories:</p>
<p>Recieving Yards per Game: 1st</p>
<p>Yards After Catch per Game: 4th</p>
<p>Points Scored: 12th</p>
