	    <p>Bzuk, Thank you for your kind reply and attention. Sorry, alas I am really not very good in Web-design and these things about use of computer instruments for editing the webpage... just wanted to share the factual info on the topic i have.. so, sorry if it caused any inconvenience. I will appreciate it if your would find a possibility to consider this information (about National Geographic movie, their expert, the Bolam theory etc.) and include it somehow into the article... just "for the benefit of the truth and factual correctness", nothing else.</p>
<p>Also, please note that the little chapter about the "paranormal" things disappeared at all from that section of fringe and paranormal theories.. i guess it can be just some casual technic mistake of somebody who also tried to edit the article? Merry Christmas - kind regards, Alex Mandel, PhD.</p>
<p>YOU WROTE:</p>
<p>Alex, the comments were not chaotic, it was the presentation format that you chose that made them very difficult to read. There is a style or format to writing Wikipedia articles that is the normal convention adopted by editors. For example, observe the section headings and use of reference citations in the body of the Amelia Earhart article for a "common" style. Forgive me for seeming testy, but this article has been under attack for the last few weeks by people who can charitably be called "vandals," so I was merely ensuring that the article was able to be developed in a systematic way. I welcome your very valid comments and will try to incorporate them along with other submissions so that the Amelia Earhart article is a well researched and accurate document.

<p><br />
Bzuk, Just saw your last updates on the AE page, including the reference to the "USS Amelia Earhart" project... Again, thank you very much for your kind attention to my "inputs"! Kind regards - sincerely, Alex Mandel, PhD.</p>
<p>Bzuk, Please are you also the author/editor of the "Irene Craigmile Bolam" article in Wikipedia? If yes, please look there... i just posted some research information about this person, and maybe you would consider as possible/worthwhile to include it into the article, and in "civilized way" - not like I did (very sorry again for my stupidity in Web-design things!) Happy New Year! - with best wishes, sincerely - Alex Mandel, PhD.</p>

<p>Alex, no, I am not the author of the "Irene Craigmile Bolam" article in Wikipedia.

<p>BTW, would you support the concept of moving the Earhart "myths" to a separate page or article? The reason for my suggesting this is that the main article should be an accurate and scholarly work while the speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the disappearance of Amelia Earhart are interesting, they belong in a unique section. Most researchers, as you know, discount the many theories and speculation that has arisen in the years following her last flight. Go onto the Earhart discussion page and register your vote/comments...and a Happy New Year to you as well. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 16:15 2 January 2007 (UTC). Bzuk, thanks for your kind message and kind attention to my material and propositions! About the separate page for Earhart-related myths - the idea is interesting... however, i can see a sort of "special aspect" here, that prompts me to be a bit cautious about this. Because of the high authority of the Wikipedia - and the huge number of people using it - to devote the specially created page for this kind of things, i'm afraid, may automatically "grant" these myths with additional "promotion", possibly even some seeming "credibility" (at least in the eyes of some readers who can be too fascinated by all these "mystery theories".. and then, they can became a "sources" about Earhart for other people, etc.). So, i'm somewhat afraid it may attract to these "fringe theories" the unnecessary public attention - attention that this anti-historic, anti-factual, just confusing stuff simply doesn't deserve. As result, it may lead to unnecessary "prolongation" of the public life and circulation of these misinforming myths and legends... and that's a reason of my "concerns"...just the concept of "public responsibility of the historic researcher" that i am subscribing under. I do support completely - and enthusiastically share! - your goal to make the article as scholar and historically accurate as possible... so hope you easily can understand the motives "behind" my somewhat "cautious" attitude to the "Earhart myths" webpage idea. Kind Regards! - very sincerely, best wishes - Alex V Mandel 18:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bzuk, please did you receive the material on Amelia Earhart that i send for you (to your personal Email) a few days ago? [ I did not receive any "confirmation" that it reached you, so just thought it could be "filtered out" by your spam protection or so... If something like this happened, of course i can try to send it again]. Please let me know... Kind Regards! - sincerely, Alex V Mandel 16:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
