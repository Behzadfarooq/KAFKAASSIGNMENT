<p>$167,298,192 <i>worldwide</i> gross on a <i>155,000,000</i> movie (according to Boxoffice Mojo) is success? I don't think that even breaks even after everyone gets their cut...?</p>

<dd>Not even close, as advertisement investment for a movie that is this big usually costs around 30-100 million dollars.

<p>Just a little observation that propably is not important enough to be mentioned in the article: when Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) tells the story of Alexander's fathers death (after about 34 min. of the movie) there is a statue of a sitting Buddha on the table. But at that time (about 280 BCE) the Buddha had not been depicted in human form yet (see <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_art.html" title="Buddhist art">Buddhist art</a> for details). The oldest statues date from the 1st century CE. --80.109.63.190 01:47, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, its no documentary. Also, was anyone mad that the so called gay or bi-sexuality of Alexander was actually depicted on a very boring way?. Farrell looked at Leto with dreamy eyes (wich you knew he was badly faking) and then... they huged... and they hugged a lot through all of the movie (yet when Alexander goes straight, its all steamy and sexual). Now, were those 2 the most boring homosexuals in history or what?.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oliver Stone must be very fascinated by homosexuality since it's his main topic of a film which should be about the greatest military srategy in history. Very sad indeed, malaka Stone.</p>
<p>I'm suprised no one has mentioned the issue of race in the "criticisms" section. I know for a fact that many Persians were deeply offended over the casting of Rosario Dawson, an Afro-Hispanic as Roxanne.</p>
<p>This site goes more into detail: <a href="http://www.ghandchi.com/iranscope/Anthology/KavehFarrokh/farrokh6.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ghandchi.com/iranscope/Anthology/KavehFarrokh/farrokh6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghandchi.com/iranscope/Anthology/KavehFarrokh/farrokh6.htm</a></p>

<p>I find it odd there isn't more about either of these in the article. Alexander is already in category with The Postman and Ishtar as far as legendary bombs go.</p>
<dl>
<dd>tis weird indeed. The article is a little bit too "pro Alexander", wich is actually very interesting, mainly because that means that it has a reduced number of loyal followers, considering that the movie is not a "good one" per se, one could almost say it has cult status.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It was a failure in the U.S. but quite successful worldwide. That said, the U.S. domestic failure of such a big project certainly merits more mention, along with the contrast to worldwide performance.</dd>

<p>I think the sentence in the original article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Completely contrary to primary source history, Bucephalus is killed at the Hydaspes.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>is both a wrong interpretation from historical sources, <b>and simply displaced in the discussion of a film that chose to stick to <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&amp;layout=&amp;loc=61.1" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&amp;layout=&amp;loc=61.1" rel="nofollow">Plutarch, 61.1</a></b>, or e.g. when (contrary to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucephalus.html" title="Bucephalus">Bucephalus</a>) <a href="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book5a.asp" class="external text" title="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book5a.asp" rel="nofollow">Arrian, 5</a> isn't sure himself what to believe, 5.19 contradicts 5.14.</p>
<p>If whoever wrote this means the statement by the <a href="../../../o/n/e/Onesicritus.html" title="Onesicritus">Onesicritus of Astypalaea</a>, who Arrian called incompetent and in other cases his account absurd (<a href="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/indica1.asp" class="external text" title="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/indica1.asp" rel="nofollow">Arrian, 8</a>), and falsely claiming he was an admiral (<a href="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book6a.asp" class="external text" title="http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book6a.asp" rel="nofollow">Arrian 6.2</a>) – <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strabo.html" title="Strabo">Strabo</a> even called him the "<i>master fabulist ... of Alexander</i>" (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15" rel="nofollow">Strabo, 15.28</a>):</p>
<p>If such a source is believed to be trustworthy, yet dismissing the majority of authors including what Plutarch considered, or <a href="http://websfor.org/alexander/minor/aulus_gellius.asp" class="external text" title="http://websfor.org/alexander/minor/aulus_gellius.asp" rel="nofollow">Gellius 5.2</a> citing <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chares_of_Mytilene_762c.html" title="Chares of Mytilene">Chares of Mytilene</a> (which is primary), then Stone might as well including Onesicritus as Alexander's admiral, or shooting Colin Farrell against Amazon Queens (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&amp;layout=&amp;loc=46.1" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&amp;layout=&amp;loc=46.1" rel="nofollow">Plutarch, 46.1</a>) – this would happen, if every "primary source" accounts are taken for granted,</p>
<p>The film might have a R. Lane Fox handwriting, but in light of the ancient authors, his reasoning that an officer's memoire would be undoubtly biased isn't that farfetched to refrain from overvaluing Onesicritus' version (<i>Alexander the Great</i>, Chapter 25, in the 1986 edition on p. 361, line 13):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Buchephalas had been gravely wounded and within hours of the battle the old horse was reported dead; others, loyal to his invincibility, maintained that he had only collapsed of extreme old age.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Therefore I think the initial conclusion is wrong, and also missing the point how people are warned regarding the primary sources, whether this is Onesicritus, or <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callisthenes.html" title="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a>, or <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy_I_Soter_da53.html" title="Ptolemy I Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a>, all of them not completely trustworthy. <b>And then it is not that wrong for a film to prefer what Plutarch called as the version of the majority.</b> – Ylai 11:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC) [corrected: Ylai 15:43, 31 January 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<p>Does anyone know what kind of ring was given to Alexander by Hephaistion and possibly the name of the stone? (Looks like a sunstone to me, but I'm not sure).</p>
<dl>
<dd>oh its just a symbolism, thats all, the ring didnt really had anything else to go for. Usually rings mean infinity or allegiance, so in that scene Hephastion gives him a symbolic present of his love to Alexander, letting him know that he would love him forever despite the fact that he married Roxana (or something much around those lines).</dd>

<dd>Ive read some reviews about the game, and aparently in the game you commanded an already made army in Alexander's most famous battles. So far so good, except that the game is boring and easy, accorindg to what i read, all that was needed for the win was to attack-move with all the troops, thus, battles required no micro-management whatsoever.</dd>

<dd>The game is as boring as the movie's boring parts. However if you're looking for a more action packed game and a challenge based on Alexander's conquests, better get the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> expansion pack <i><a href="../../../t/o/t/Rome%7E_Total_War_7ac1.html" title="Rome: Total War">Rome: Total War Alexander</a></i>. In fact, <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> said that in this expansion,<i>"This latest, download-only addition to The Creative Assembly's long-running series of historic epics is so spectacularly difficult that even the legendary Macedonian conqueror would have a rough go of subduing those pesky Persians. The game provides an illuminating lesson on just how tough of a task the monarch set for himself when he journeyed out to conquer the known world in 335 BC, and it's a splash of cold Grecian wine in the face of Total War-series veterans who think they've done it all."</i><a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInGenX_991d.html" title="User:InGenX">InGenX</a> 08:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This movie in my honest opinion is the most underrated movie of all time. It's one of my favorite movies. I think many people that hated the movie (especially from America) are to homophobic for their own good. It wasn't perfect but if you say this movie was horrible or one of the worst films, in my opinion it is because you were nitpicking at the little bit that you didn't like. That's my opinion. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachorious_df65.html" title="User:Zachorious">Zachorious</a> 08:57, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>im not homophobic, and i like the movie a lot actually... but its a bad movie, Stone mixes sappy soap opera acting with battles, and an overall message that doesnt really fit well with the story (plus, someone didnt passed symbolism 101). In my opinnion its a movie to watch, but its probably the most boring epic picture in year, you actually gotta know your Alexander to understand anything that happends on the screen.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I have a real problem versus the 'films critics' about Alexander. My answer could be something like this: 'OK, and you how do wuold made it'?</p>
<p>I have watched this movie just at home (with the huge handicap to not have the big screen of the cinema) and even with this handicap, i have enjoyed it. It's a complicated movie, and even if i have at the first not been really impressed, re-wathicing x-times the 2 DVDs of Alexander i have started to respect and like it really very much. In other words. it's perhaps a movie that cannot be deeply appreciated by all, and often not in a single time.Make a movie with over 20 characters, with a lot of situations, dialogue, battle, is a <b>great</b> problem to solve.</p>
<p>But: to make a film on historical person is never easy. I look to a lot of other 'historical movie', and i really fail to see another movie so full of history like Alexander is.</p>
<p>Now we must consider, <b>that a movie isn't a documentary</b>. The cinema don't work on that manner. And given the immense work needed to adapt a life like Alexander in a movie, how hell one could expects to see 'all the true, and only the true'?.</p>
<p>Stone wasn't 100% on the story? Yes, already heard XXX times. Cinema is working differently. If Stone had realized a trilogy of Alexander, now we could have seen also the battle of Isso, Egypt and so on. Matrix, Lord of Rings, Star wars had have it. But if you cannot have enough money to put Alexander in several films it's un-pratical.</p>
<p>As for the history, yes there are several changes respect to the original history, and so? Bravehart, The Gladiator, The Last Samurai also did this. We must understund that this is the cinema way to show the reality. Don't like hte plot, the movie, the bi-sexuality looked in the film? Your problems. Few days ago i whatched a movie of Ceasar and the Gaul conquering. It was a famous movie in it's days. Compared to Alexander it's just rubbish in every sense.</p>
<p>Alexander is, in my opinion, and despite the 'defects' and 'teh historical inaccurancies' , the most accurated historical movie ever made, perhaps toghever with Tora-tora-tora.</p>
<p>But wait, when guys like Tarantino made their movie they are so genius that nobody shouldn't criticize them, right? --S.M.</p>

<p>to think that this movie says that Alexander the Great, was in a love relationship with <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hephaistion.html" title="Hephaistion">Hephaistion</a>, and that he is greek.
