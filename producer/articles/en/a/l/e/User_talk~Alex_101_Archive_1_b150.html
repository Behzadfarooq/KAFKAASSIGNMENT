Alex, I was the guy who wrote up all that new article stuff on The Offspring page. You didn't like my titles, which isn't a big deal... but don't get mad if I enhance yours, it isn't ment to be rude... I think it looks betterwith a couple capital letters, it looks less important when the start of subject words are in a lower case. I'm gonna put it back the way I had it, if you don't like it, then in stead of accusing me of vandalism -- write an actual reason. Thanks for your interest.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, OK. I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you. I was not mad at you all. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_101_9f64.html" title="User:Alex 101">Alex 101</a> 02:48, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not mad, and no longer anonymous -- never thought I would be interested in signing up. I do think it looks better with Capitals on the major words -- also, grammatically it is more correct. These are titles not sentences. I've just been working away on this thing all day. I must say, I was not happy with how little info was on this site when I came upon it a day ago... I've been a fan of this band for 10 years now, and after viewing the one they have built for Nine Inch Nails... I thought this one needed to be redone. Hopefully people will appreciate me completely redoing the biography from scratch -- I think it is 10 times better now.</p>

<p>Hi! On every site about BR, including their official, I found that this album was released in 1990 not 1991. Could you show your source of this information or stop reverting my changes? <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietaster_dd31.html" title="User:Pietaster">Pietaster</a> 14:25, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean to keep changing the date to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. There are some sources that say that year (including CDUniverse.com, Tower.com, etc.). Also, the year <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> was printed on the back of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> remastered version. I wasn't only trying to say that it's correct. Again, sorry and I didn't mean to reverting your changes. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_101_9f64.html" title="User:Alex 101">Alex 101</a> 22:54, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

After all I think that 1990 is correct year cause it can be found on <a href="http://www.badreligion.com/titles/" class="external text" title="http://www.badreligion.com/titles/" rel="nofollow">BR official page</a> and on <a href="http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/358/" class="external text" title="http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/358/" rel="nofollow">Epitaph site</a>.</dd>

<p>Dear Alex, About the release date for this album there has always been a kind of discrepancy. I remember having in late 1988 a copy of that album, Still, it was not legal as it was a tape a friend's older brother copied to me .. whatever, I don't have a copy of the album on CD, just an old tape from 1990 I got in 1995, so I don't have a proof to give you, just my memories.... Still, I can tell you in those days the albums used to be very underground and they were usually found before they were officially launched. I know you think the official launch and release dates are the same, but to give an example, The Chronic was released in early september 1992, but it was launched in late november that same year. The same goes for Straight outta Compton... So it is just a couple of months what we are discussing about. At the light of the proofs you might have your copy which says 1989 while I have a tape that says 1990, in this matters It is you who has the reason... but be BOLD in identifying your sources, because I was listenting to that album When you had not been born (if your personal data is to be believed). To conclude, for now, Let it 1989.</p>
<p>AnD the next time you have something to discuss, PLEASE, use the discussion field for the specific article.</p>

<p>I explained on one of the talk pages that I rediected them because they were either utterly unencyclopedic, unsourced tripe, or basically just saying "So and so is a memebr of this band" which the redirect makes abundantly clear. A good thing to keep in mind is don't have five articles where one will do. If there is any useful information (DOBs marginally qualify, I guess) it can be mentioned in the band article, which is far from being too long. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:30, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't change blink-182 to "blink-182 are" or "Green Day are". Those articles have "blink-182 is" and "Green Day is" and they are correct so I did not change them. If you were to do some research, however, "Green Day are" would be correct in British English (which I don't support). I am a speaker of American English by the way. I am not going to go on a debate about this like I had with 2 other users because it is no longer worth it. Most people do not know how to use collective nouns correctly and they think they should use plural because the name of a band is plural. Whatever their names are, they are still one entity. I hope you will learn this when you get to college. English can be complex and not everyone is familiar with complex rules in the English language. I don't use sloppy English and that was an insult. If you must know, I am a copyeditor of a local newspaper and I had consulted with my former college English professor and she confirmed the usage is indeed correct with regards to bands having plural names (they are still one entity &lt;--- singular). Yes the usage is rather odd to you and some people, but is indeed correct with the rules (most people aren't aware of this). I don't expect you to understand this. There are band articles that I have not touch that use "Nine Inch Nails is," etc. I am not the only one using "sloppy" English as you would say. Very few people know how to use this correctly. Maybe you should consult this with your English teacher once you return to school (if you haven't already done so) and make sure you let them know that these are band names. --<a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">RJN</a> 19:57, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For example, Williams is a last name. The correct usage would be "Mr. Williams was at the meeting" not "Mr. Williams were at the meeting." Mr. Williams (even though the last name has "s" does not mean it is plural). Mr. Williams is one person or do you argue with me that since his last name has "s" so we should use "Mr. Williams were"? Band names are the same! Not everyone on here know how to write correctly. My usage is no where near "sloppy." I also don't appreciate that you are wiki stalking me on here either. I am not the only person on here that will correct to "XXXXs was" or "XXXXs is". As far as blink-182, it is correct to say "blink-182 is" and I would never change it to "blink-182 are". You are already accusing me of editing articles that I have not because they are already correct. Go ask your English teacher when you return to school. <a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">RJN</a> 20:08, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let say your name is Alex Adams. If we were you use this in a sentence, it would be, "Alex Adams was a skateboarder" not "Alex Adams were a skateboarder". If you were to form a band and call it "Alex Adams," the sentence would be "Alex Adams is an American rock band" or "The Alex Adams band is from the United States". Do you disagree with this? Do you understand what I am trying to explain to you regarding band names? It is okay for you or anyone to not be familiar with all the rules and usage in English (no one is expected to know all of them and some are very tricky like the case of band having plural names—yet they are still a single entity and therefore must use singular). Some rules are weird and don't make sense. Remember humans make rules—they don't have to make sense. Do your own research/look into things closely before you call someone's corrections "sloppy". <a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">RJN</a> 20:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AMG is contradicting itself because the text in the article itself says 1986. 1990 may have been a reissue date for the CD version as that title first came out on vinyl only in '86. The three songs on it are three songs that first appeared only on the cassette and CD versions of <em>Who's Got The 10 1/2?</em>.--<a href="../../../c/j/m/User%7ECjmarsicano_e47e.html" title="User:Cjmarsicano">CJ Marsicano</a> 03:41, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You shouldn't have let the anon upset you... he really should have worked with you to come up with suitable wording instead of just reverting. But I have to say I found the original wording somewhat unclear too (eg, "when he's ever released from prison" sounds like he might never get out... but it's only a 21-month sentence).

<p>According to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>, we can't really block over content or editing disputes. Try not to let the other person make you lose your temper, see <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. If you show your anger to them, they might dig in their heels and become more stubborn (and your anger may make you become more stubborn too). The differences in wording aren't really that major, there ought to be some compromise wording that everyone can accept (it's not like this is an article about Israeli-Palestinian disputes or some other major controversial subject). You can try <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a> to get a neutral person to try to help both sides reach agreement. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Vandalism is a strong word. I, Knotgoblin, made the edit to <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_at_Stubb%27s_%28Matisyahu_album%29_47b4.html" title="Live at Stubb's (Matisyahu album)">Live at Stubb's</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_%28Matisyahu_album%29_8a62.html" title="Youth (Matisyahu album)">Youth</a>. Sorry, for not being loggin in. I was on another computer and forgot that I was not logged in.</p>
<p>If you are familiar at all with Matisyahu, Youth is his third album. That can obviously be seen by look at his <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matisyahu.html" title="Matisyahu">discography</a>. Youth may not be his third studio album but it is most certainly his third album. To say that it is his second is incorrect and would misinform some one that would be reading that article. If you would like say that it is his second STUDIO album that would be correct.</p>
<p>You can't ban someone for making an edit to a page. That is how Wiki works.</p>
<p>Thanks, Knotgoblin 22:48, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A live album is still an album. If someone that knows nothing about Matisyahu is reading that article they would be misinformed. Live at Stubb's is an official release (not a bootleg), so it is an album. Knotgoblin 22:59, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
