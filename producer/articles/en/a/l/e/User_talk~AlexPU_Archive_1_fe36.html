<p>Vitay! Sorry, I hadn't noticed you're a newbie. Welcome to wikipedia and enjoy! The problem I had with your NPOV notice is that at the moment I erased it there was no mention of the dispute: neither at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_controversial_issues_fbb2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of controversial issues">Wikipedia:List of controversial issues</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccuracy_dispute_97fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute">Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute</a> nor at the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Talk%7EUkrainian_language_ba40.html" title="Talk:Ukrainian language">Talk:Ukrainian language</a>. So, from my point of view there was no dispute at the time. Remember to state your problem with the article in the discussion before you add a template. The {{NPOV}} is sort of a last resort when all hope is lost.</p>
<p>Now that you started to use the talk page the warning is where it should be. Perhaps you could even use the {{long NPOV}} template, it seems much better in this situation. Anyway, please state what is wrong with the article, not with some user. There are lots of unfriendly/stupid/nationalist people out here and you'd better learn to cope with them. Truth is the key here and facts are your weapons. By offending them (even if they deserve it) you want convince anyone. And stating that someone is a POV-pusher or nationalist is considered highly offensive here (not only by the persons involved). BTW, it's good to see some Ukrainians around here, this wiki badly lacks info on Ukraine. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibutt</a> 15:54, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Welcome to Wikipeda! A word of unsolicited advice... Your statement in the Ukrainian language topic to an opponent that "If you can documentally prove that Ukrainian was "being used" in USSR in the fields you specify - so do it on the page, cite. And even if you do - your anyway would be lying or misinformed because Sovdepia was purely Byzantine system of lying, hiding and falsing." is equivalent to "Prove it, except I'm not going to believe you". You won't win many arguments this way, and, as I hope you will find very soon, Wikipedia is NOT about winning arguments. You may find it useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEVER to erase ANYTHING anyone else has put in. Change article text "turtles fly" into "X has stated that turtles fly", and make sure the article text draws no conclusions: let the reader decide. If someone erases your own text "the sky is blue", reinsert it as "Y has observed that under the following conditions, the sky looks blue".</li>
<li>NEVER to say or imply "My point of view is correct, yours is wrong". NEVER say samething is outrageous.</li>
<li>ALWAYS to avoid politics except in an inherently political argument.</li>
<li>NEVER to accuse anyone or anything, no matter how unpopular, of lying or falsifying. By doing so, too many will think YOU are the one lying or falsifying.</li>
<li>NEVER use the word <b>propaganda</b>.</li>
<li>NEVER to say "this ideology is wrong". You may find it offensive; others find yours equally so. Let ALL ideologies live side by side.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are, for better or worse, the items in this monastery's order-book. Good luck!! <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._Shetsen_6733.html" title="User:A. Shetsen">A. Shetsen</a> 23:48, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Olex, some further advice! What you have just received is generally quite good! It applies to the gentlemen and the honest! However, there is no filter on Wikipedia to obstruct the non-gentlemen and the dishonest! And Wikipedia is far from being a monastery! While people who are honest, even if mistaken, will be repelled by the word, "propaganda," there are people here whose interests are simply propaganda. It will be your job to sort out the people you encounter. Don't be so ideological as to think that the tendencdy to propaganda doesn't exist, or that it applies with perfect evenness across nations! Keep your eyes open and be discerning! <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenyo_5057.html" title="User:Genyo">Genyo</a> 03:49, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mr. Shetsen, it was interesting to read your advices. Let me answer you step-by-step citing your writing.</dd>
<dd>"Your statement in the Ukrainian language topic to an opponent that "If you can documentally prove that Ukrainian was "being used" in USSR in the fields you specify - so do it on the page, cite. And even if you do - your anyway would be lying or misinformed because Sovdepia was purely Byzantine system of lying, hiding and falsing." is equivalent to "Prove it, except I'm not going to believe you".
<dl>
<dd>I agree my wording was inaccurate but anyway logic. It is commonly recognized that <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> regime was systematically hiding and destroying documental evidences of it's illegal policy. E.g. <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_SSR_3da5.html" title="Ukrainian SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a> documents on death rates and executions in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> are mostly burnt or stored in Moscow. As well as secret <a href="../../../c/p/s/CPSU_4352.html" title="CPSU">CPSU</a> decisions on Russifying higher education in Ukraine. So millions of Ukrainians may not have appropriate documents but they would never agree that nothing happened to them or their relatives. Hovewer, there few other ways to prove that <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monedula.html" title="Monedula">Monedula</a> is wrong (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistic.html" title="Statistic">statistics</a>, foreign reports, comparative analysis of witness testimonies). That's what I meant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"NEVER to erase ANYTHING anyone else has put in."
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly what your compatriot <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monedula.html" title="Monedula">Monedula</a> is doing. Where have you been intil we put that propaganda into light?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Change article text "turtles fly" into "X has stated that turtles fly", and make sure the article text draws no conclusions: let the reader decide. If someone erases your own text "the sky is blue", reinsert it as "Y has observed that under the following conditions, the sky looks blue".
<dl>
<dd>No, sir, we must have something to start with. Lawlessness of Soviet regime and its shauvinistic national policy are <b>internationally proven facts</b>. While I let you dispute the statements that Ukraine is "a birthplace of elefants" or that Alexander the Macedonian was Ukrainian. If someone persistently writes that turtles fly - I will persistently oppose him.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"NEVER to say or imply "My point of view is correct, yours is wrong". NEVER say samething is outrageous."
<dl>
<dd>I never did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"ALWAYS to avoid politics except in an inherently political argument."
<dl>
<dd>Since I'm a professional political analyst, let me assure you that <b>anything</b> is a political issue. Because <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> is a "<i>universal</i> system of regulating social relations using mechanisms of state power". Как говорил мой военрук, "политика, она везде... Ты девушке в трусы лезешь, обещая на ней жениться - это тоже политика". So I think you're pretty demagogic in this item.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"NEVER to accuse anyone or anything, no matter how unpopular, of lying or falsifying. By doing so, too many will think YOU are the one lying or falsifying."
<dl>
<dd>Again, I never did. What I'm accusing <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monedula.html" title="Monedula">Monedula</a> of is a brutal violation of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality.html" title="Neutrality">neutrality</a> rule.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"NEVER use the word propaganda."
<dl>
<dd>No, sir, I will. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">Propaganda</a> is a sholar term, not an offensive jargonism. And let us call cat a cat.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"NEVER to say "this ideology is wrong". You may find it offensive; others find yours equally so. Let ALL ideologies live side by side."
<dl>
<dd>My fight against Monedula has nothing to do with ideologies. Read my writings thoroughly and you won't find that. Except one: the Wikipedia ideology of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality.html" title="Neutrality">neutrality</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And most important. As I understand, all your advices are regarding my discussion notes, not contributions. So I don't think you should dispute those notes.</dd>
<dd>Also, please apply your vision of policy to other "WIkipedians" too. Be neutral and universal.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, thank you for advice. Best wishes, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a></dd>

<p>Hi Alex. I think there might be some confusion over my edits to the above pages. On my talk page, you expressed concern that some of my edits introduced factual errors to the entries in addition to grammatical and spelling corrections? You don't seem to have fixed the problems you found with my edits and you didn't indicate what it was that I did wrong. Can you please just give me some idea of the problems with either of them because it has me absolutely puzzled? Apart from <i>possibly</i> breaking some links, I'm quite sure I made no factual editing particularly since I have no position or even background on the issue. Upon review, I can see I haven't fixed all the grammar but I can assure you what I did do was grammatically impeccable although it may not seem like it to a non-native speaker. Best regards though and I hope you can help clear up the confusion. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGest_ef44.html" title="User:Gest">Gest</a> 06:11, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gest, the most important error was deleting the word "supposedly" regarding the "voice of president <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_Kuchma_667f.html" title="Leonid Kuchma">Leonid Kuchma</a>" (<a href="../../../s/b/u/SBU_e0e8.html" title="SBU">SBU</a> article). This is a key issue of that scandal as well of modern <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian.html" title="Ukrainian">Ukrainian</a> history. If you study that case thoroughly, you'll see the difference. Stating that Kuchma did say those words would lead us to question why he is not yet arrested and convicted by Ukrainian or US authorities. No court has yet ruled the authenticity of Mel'nychenko's tapes. Remember that nobody is guilty unless convicted.</dd>
<dd>Your edit on <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgiy_Gongadze_4172.html" title="Georgiy Gongadze">Georgiy Gongadze</a> is less problematic. I actually meant <i>two</i> local languages: Ukrainian and Russian. It can be seen from the subsequent text.</dd>
<dd>Actually, I also doubt your using of "overseas" instead of "abroad" but that's not a problem worth fixing. Generally, I find some of your grammar edits too academic for web English so I woudn't follow it. Let me assure you that I know the rules but don't like using them as well as milions of native speakers&#160;:). In short, I agree with the majority of your edits.</dd>
<dd>I'd appreciate your checking all my contributions for possible serious mistakes (like those I made in original SBU text). Best regards, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a></dd>
<dd>Forgot to tell everybody that I contempt Mr.Kuchma deeply. So please do not consider me as advocate of his dignity (despite the fact that he's elected head of my country). Those familiar with Ukrainian politics would probably understand the reason of making this remark. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, now I understand. To avoid making unproven allegations, it is necessary to hedge with <i>supposedly</i>. You are correct and the distinction must be made. The problem is that <i>supposedly</i> is still <i>grammatically</i> incorrect in that context and sounds bizarre and confusing to a native speaker and subsequently counterproductive to the goal of the article. In this case, I would suggest; <i>publishing numerous <b>supposed</b> records of the President's secret conversations and calls</i>. <i>Web</i> English might be OK for these talk pages, blogs or in chatrooms but it is completely unacceptable for an encyclopædic style whether it is on the web or not. <i>Correct</i> English, (or Ukrainian, German or any other language) with all its rules, is the objective for the articles here so even though you don't like using it, you'll need it to write a good Wikipedia article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the issue with abroad/overseas is worth addressing as you are unclear on why the change was made. True, both are adjectives as well as adverbs but only <i>overseas</i> is correct in the attributive position. However, I <i>should</i> have been bolder and rewrote it as, <i>including spying on both Ukrainian opposition politicians and German television journalists outside Ukraine</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry my edits strike you as <i>academic</i> but I <i>am</i> an academic and value clear, concise writing because I make my living with it. Consequently, I appreciate your invitation to proofread further contributions from you. For various reasons, I think Eastern European related articles are an important area for Wikipedia to expand upon and your input will obviously be invaluable and more authoritative if it is well written in a formal style.</dd>

<dd>Yes Michael, it would be great. I really need help with navboxes and redirects. Also, I've messed a little at Cherkasy page and failed to correct&#160;:(. Would you please revert it to previous state for a while? As you've seen, I made a general article for these things (<a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdivisions_of_Ukraine_cac9.html" title="Subdivisions of Ukraine">Subdivisions of Ukraine</a>). But it's uncomplete yet without a table of comparison and translation, which is also ready but not placed cause I didn't know how to upload tables. Hope to add it soon. Thanks for your support.

<p>Hi alex. I posted your first table at <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdivisions_of_Ukraine_cac9.html" title="Subdivisions of Ukraine">Subdivisions of Ukraine</a>. I added a column with romanized names. The second has to wait until the regions' articles titles are updated; I hope to do it tomorrow or on the weekend. In the meantime, you can see the table at User:Mzajac/subdivisions.</p>
<p>Okay. It's done now. I'm checking for redundant or circular redirects. I added some redirects, which might have to be updated later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomous Republic of Crimea -&gt; Crimean Republic</li>
<li>Kryms'ka oblast' -&gt; Crimean Republic</li>
</ul>

<p>Whew!—I simplified about 30 double-redirects and updated a whole bunch of links. Updated the links in <a href="../../../o/b/l/Template%7EOblasti_29e5.html" title="Template:Oblasti">Template:oblasti</a>. I left a few links with different names, where the context seemed to dictate it (e.g. a couple of links to "Zaporozhye" in Russian-oriented articles on Crimean history).</p>
<p>There are still <b>many</b> links to the old names like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poltava_region.html" title="Poltava region">Poltava region</a>. And I have to update the table at List of capitals of subnational entities another day. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael Z.</a> 20:58, 2004 Sep 23 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Hello AlexPU, I understand your english without (bigger) problems. I only forgot too many words in written english. I can speak quite well, but writing is my problem. So I will translate the map within some days to an english version. That's not a big work, but I'll please you to take a look on the version and give me some help. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteschke_078d.html" title="User:Steschke">Steschke</a> 16:31, 2004 Sep 28 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Map looks great! Thank you. But let me point at two little bugs: misspelling of Ternopil' and Chernihiv (see list just below your map). Would you correct them? Best wishes, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a> 12:01, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fixed the bugs (I hope all). Some days ago I insert this map in the ukraine article but it was taken off very fast.

<p>Hi Alex. I gave your history section a quick copy-edit; I'll have another look when I have a bit more time, but I think it looks okay. Good work.</p>
<p>Have a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Ukraine_47c8.html" title="List of cities in Ukraine">List of cities in Ukraine</a>. Someone has done a good job updating all the Ukrainian names. I've found a couple of mistakes, and checked all of the English names, and put the results on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_cities_in_Ukraine_3799.html" title="Talk:List of cities in Ukraine">talk page</a>. Please have a look, and correct/add/delete as necessary. When we're done, I'll merge the results into that page.</p>

<p>Before threatening to accuse something in POVism, I suggest to look into person's history of edits. In this particular case, I am one of the few who systematically adds <b>factual</b> articles about political repressions in the USSR and maintains the consistency of the category:Soviet political repressions (I added its reference to <a href="../../../n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a>; did you happen to look into it?). As for the deletions, I deleted all what was erroneous in this chaotic babble about how bad NKVD was. In particular, deportations of tatars etc. were put into section that speak about "liberated territories", which is nonsense. Deportations deserve a special section. In fact, this is the whole article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union_d6fd.html" title="Population transfer in the Soviet Union">Population transfer in the Soviet Union</a>, which shows that there was a whole politics of the Stalinist state, rather than deeds of these NKVD villains. As for explanations, I am not going to explain every nonsense an anonymous contributor adds to wikipedia. But I am pretty tolerant to other editors' point of views in cases of disputes. Like I said, I prefer to work with <b>factual</b> material, which, unlike various political rant, is usually impossible to contest. I believe this is the true goal of an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 17:35, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
