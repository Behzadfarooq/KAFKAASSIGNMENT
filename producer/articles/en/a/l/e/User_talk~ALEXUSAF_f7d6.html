	    <p><b>Alex Novak</b> is a US Air Force National Guard service member, and Northeastern University college student from Boston, Massachusetts. He is a student of Military Science, Islamic &amp; Domestic Terrorism Studies, Public Affairs, Criminal Justice, Political Science, National Security Studies, US-world history, US Presidential Executive Office Studies, Martial Arts - Asian Studies, Middle Eastern Studies- and American Aviation - Airplane &amp; Flight Studies.</p>
<p><b>EARLY LIFE:</b> Novak was first introduced to the system of political science, US history, ethical philosophy, and Anglo-American culture at a young age. Some of his earliest lessons came from friends, and family members who served in the military during WW2 and Korea. He tried out for sports originally but gave the practice up because his bad near sighted vision, and later found by Doctors that he needed to wear eye glasses. Doctors had also noticed he had early learning and attention disabilities, a common element among modern young children. Novak held a deep hatred for violent crime, and sympathized with victims because he himself was a victim of minor assault violence stemming from gangster thugs, tied with an even deeper hatred for his dishonest - unscrupulous and criminal uncle that was sentenced to life in prison because of actions associated with being a career criminal. Novak looked toward the "Batman" comic and movie series as a vessel to model after against people who behave like criminals.</p>
<p>In the late 80's Novak moved to Boston from New Jersey because his family was transferred there due to employment reasons. During the period of the first 1991 Gulf War, Novak was concerned for the safety of American Soldiers, and wished them success in a quick decisive victory over the invading armies of Saddam Hussein. During the Gulf War period, and soon to follow with the decade of the 1990's, Novak ran into serious and tough controversy. Because his black &amp; white view of the world, his anti-crime pro-American nature, and love for fantasy movies where heroes defeat villains, he was harassed and heckled endlessly by other students. Many of those students were influenced by illegal drugs, moral relativism, and a new phenomena in America called "Gangster rap music". Novak was forced to act tough around these kids, and engaged in school yard fist fights against those who he perceived harmed him. Novak was ignorant of the nature of the beast he was dealing with, and fell toward the dark way side of hatred and violence where for a short period of time he himself became a bully towards other students, in order to gain respect from the tougher "gangster rap influenced" kids. He got in serious trouble in school, and was expelled from the 6th grade, and almost expelled from high school for school yard violence. He was forced into a special education class room where some of the toughest kids, mostly from dangerous parts of the Boston area, were students. Novak's main teacher of this class was a rough hoodlum from south Boston (known as Southie to the natives) who became a radical far left activist during the Vietnam War era, and also a deserter who fled the United States for Ireland to join the IRA (Irish Republican Army). It is unknown to this day what actions this teacher was actually involved with in regards to the IRA or the extent of his militantness toward the governments of the US and the United Kingdom, but he returned to the US and became a teacher for troubled youths. The teacher accused Novak of being a far right neo-Nazi because, even though Novak was too young to know the difference between left or right, Novak did not feel sorry for criminals and supported the US military when they fought the Ba'athists during the first Gulf War. Novak was also personally angered about being branded a "Nazi", because his family fought very bravely against Nazi Germany in WW2, and helped freed numerous Jewish victims. After a difficult relationship, Novak acted out in a negative manor towards teachers and students, so the teacher saw his chance to get into a fist fight with Novak. The fight had been nasty, and Novak lost due to only being 14 years old at the time. Novak received a bad reputation from this man that followed him into High School, and trouble between "Gangster rap thugs" and "far left zealots" continued until things calmed down in 1995. But this experience tied with the Oklahoma City Bombing, problems from the OJ Simpson trial, (along with other forms of societal decay that defined 1990's America) and listening to Conservative radio jock Rush Limbaugh, helped shape Novak's views into one that was more positive and conservative.</p>
<p>Novak at age 14 attempted to try his skills as an airplane pilot but was first too young, and lacked discipline and maturity to really learn the advanced science of aviation. He later returned to that field periodically and bettered himself in the skills and knowledge needed to be a pilot, but has yet to get his license. At age 17 Novak also tried out martial arts, weight lifting, and high school football and found to excel on top of enjoy those sports.</p>
<p>Novak first studied military sciences when he was 19 years of age and joined the US Marine Corps Infantry 0311 - 0331.</p>
<p><b>CURRENT LIFE:</b> After serving 5 and a half years in the Marines, Novak was honorably discharged and because of post 9-11 "War on Terrorism" continuation, joined the National Guard. In 2003-2004 period Novak's largest contribution thus far in the War on Terrorism was his service in "Camp Delta" Guantanamo Bay Cuba, where Terrorists from both the Al-Qaeda and Taliban organizations were detained. After returning from Cuba and suffering from a minor back injury, Novak was transferred over to work in Massachusetts’s National Guard Security Forces guarding F-15 Eagle fighters on Cape Cod.</p>
<p>Novak is apart of a New England political science study forum that focuses on post 9-11 Independent &amp; Conservative political-cultural ideologies run under political science strategists known as "K-Man", "Dr Hodar", and banking economist "Lord C". Novak also was influenced by some intellectual geniuses in modern Boston area academia. These experts included Military Science &amp; Intelligence - Computer Crime &amp; Homeland Security specialist "Dr M", Criminal Justice &amp; Organized Crime Expert "Dr T", and professor of the history of World War 1 &amp; 2 "Dr S".</p>
<p>Novak became an Independent Conservative after the brutal horrors of September 11th 2001, when 19 Al-Qaeda secret agents hijacked civilian airplanes and used them as suicide missiles against the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The influence that greatly shaped Novak's cultural ideals on top of 9-11 were the problems of illegal aliens stealing jobs from middle class level Americans, and attributing to the violent crime inside the United States. Novak had stressed his deep concern for victims rights tied with full support of local and state police officers. Novak also is an advocate in the need to support 2nd Amendment issues that stress the importance, in his mind, of honest professional Americans owning and using handguns for defense from violent criminals when and if the police are not around to help. Novak also supported issues involving "aid to poor homeless people" and the need to help out disinfranchised veterans. Both the NRA (National Rifle Association), and Massachusetts AMVETS had seeked Novak for membership, a year after 9-11.</p>
<p>Novak loves and cherishes (like most heterosexual men) attractive beautiful women, especially the Playboy types, but has seen the damage extreme pornagraphy, frivolous divorces, tied with militant feminism has done to sexual relations between men and women in modern western society.</p>
<p><b>Sworn Enemies and Adversaries:</b> Novak's sworn enemies are members of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban which include Osama Bin Laden, Dr Ayaman Al-Zawahiri, Mullah Omar, the blind Shake, and Khalied Shake Mohammed. His other deadly adversaries include the Hezbollah organization of Iran and Syria, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejab, Shiite cleric Muqtada Al-Sader of Iraq, the late Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, the militia responsible for the Oklahoma City Bombing whose members include Terry Nichols, and certain members of the terrorist wing in the red army of North Korea.</p>
<p><b>Political &amp; Cultural Opponents:</b> Novak's ideological opponents include Massachusetts’s Senators Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, film maker Michael Moore, Senator Robert Byrd, former governor of Massachusetts Michael Dukakis, former UMASS President William Bulger, former NFL star OJ Simpson, radio star Al Franken, anti-white people extremist Louis Farikhan, anti-black people extremist David Duke, MIT professor Noam Chomsky, CNN founder Ted Turner, radical-controversial University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill, Congressman Jack Murtha, anyone in the ACLU tied with billion dollar far left financier George Soros.</p>
<p>Novak has defined these people, in his personal opinion and thus disputable, as being America's biggest most harmful losers in the 21rst century.</p>
<p><b>Positive Political &amp; Cultural Influences:</b> Other influences on Novak, who he looks up to includes the late President Ronald Reagan, the late Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Vice President Richard Cheney, late Israeli leader Areal Sharon,Fox News star Bill O'Reilly, radio star Rush Limbaugh, political scientist Patrick J Buchanan, scholar William F Buckley, radio star Laura Ingram, Boston radio jock Jay Severn, AM talk radio's Howie Carr, Independent Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, intellectuals Charles Krauthammer &amp; Victor Davis Hanson, and AM talk radio star Michael Savage.</p>
<p>Novak is a fan of NFL Football, and other sports.</p>
<p>Novak is a major fan of Star Trek, super hero movies, Indiana Jones and 007 James Bond movies, and the Star Wars franchise.</p>
