<p>How difficult was it to make <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar-Triangle_transformation.png_4f0f.html" title="Image:Star-Triangle transformation.png">Image:Star-Triangle transformation.png</a>? I've experimented with dia and couldn't get anything useful out of it.</p>
<p>We have SVG support now, so we can theoretically make high-quality schematics that others can then edit. I tried drawing an example in <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a>:</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/a/Image%7EExample_circuit_with_labels.svg_049d.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/10/Example_circuit_with_labels.svg/200px-Example_circuit_with_labels.svg.png" alt="" width="200" height="347" longdesc="../../../e/x/a/Image%7EExample_circuit_with_labels.svg_049d.html" /></a></p>
<p>The fonts look different, of course. &#160;:-\ Also I drew each component by hand, which is a pain. Now they're in groups that can be copied and pasted, but Inkscape's not really meant for blocks-connected-by-wires-on-a-grid type drawing.

<p>Hey, I read the two things you wrote me on my talkpage. I absolutely agree about creating a a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a> for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Electronics_cc86.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Electronics">Electronics</a>, it would be useful for a sort of unification of the style and planning of the further work.</p>
<p>The main problems are: 1) decide a common style and create some templates, but we can start from an existing <a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElectro-stub_ca9d.html" title="Template:Electro-stub">stub template</a> 2) we'll have to suggest a common programme to draw circuits, to export in SVG.</p>
<p>I have few ideas, if you agree I'll start writing the article about the wikiproject now, then we'll discuss all the other improvements.</p>
<p>About using Dia for drawing: I tried using it once, but as you can see I made all the other circuits after that with Xcircuit. Dia has some strong limitations: most of the devices are not in the library (I drew only resistors with it!) and you can't rotate objects. In my <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar-Triangle_transformation.png_4f0f.html" title="Image:Star-Triangle transformation.png">Image:Star-Triangle transformation.png</a> I made a draft with Dia and I postprocessed it with Gimp (rotating and connecting the resistors, etc.). Drawing something more complicated would be crazy.</p>
<p>I took a look at the <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a> you told me about: it's the most promising programme, but there are few issues. There is a lot to say about this topic, and if you agree I will write properly on the page of the future wikiproject about electronics. I thought about contacting the developers of the programme, too: wikipedia is important and to be a programme suggested by wikipedia could be important for them, so I think they won't mind adding a few features for us, hopefully with our help.</p>

<dl>
<dd>As for the Wikiproject, I just see it as a nice place to discuss things and organize our efforts. "Standardizing" on the electronics articles could be useful, too.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the interface for Dia is very poor. Inkscape has a pretty good interface and nice output, but it's meant for artistic drawing and not diagramming. I was reading around and they plan to introduce some more diagramming features in the future, but don't want to go too far in that direction for fear of bloating past their primary art focus. They've just added the ability to create program extensions, though, which could be very useful. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 04:42, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I noticed that you added SVG versions of the plots in <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessel_function.html" title="Bessel function">Bessel function</a>. In principle, this seems like a good idea to me. However, I have a couple of requests/suggestions.</p>
<p>First, do not use color as the sole way to distinguish between curves. This is problematic for the color blind, and for monochrome display devices. One way to fix this is to also use dashed/dotted lines, etcetera, an even better way is:</p>
<p>Second, it is much better to attach labels to curves directly (see the original versions of the Bessel plots, for example), rather than having a second "legend" box. This avoids an indirection, where the user has to look back and forth between a "key" and the data rather than just at the data; see e.g. Tufte, <i>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</i>.</p>
<p>Third, I notice that your y-axis label for <a href="../../../b/e/s/Image%7EBesselJ_plot.svg_d17e.html" title="Image:BesselJ plot.svg">Image:BesselJ plot.svg</a> falls on top of the tick numbering; please be careful of small glitches like this.</p>

<dd>I absolutely agree with you. First I have to improve my knowledge about gnuplot, then I'll work on it. Just in case I could post-process the image with <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodipodi.html" title="Sodipodi">Sodipodi</a> or something like this (as I did for the picture of the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_function.html" title="Gamma function">Gamma function</a>), but I want to get the best I can from gnuplot first, then I'll make smaller changes with other programs.

<p>Hi there. Sorry to be slow to get back to you.</p>
<p>I made the timing diagrams from the command line and then spent a while tweaking the export options regarding exporting before the final image was useful. The labelling of it I did all in Powerpoint (I think I exported a .eps version from Matlab) since the labelling feature in Matlab is a bit poor and fiddly to use. So I don't have the code I used, although with some legwork I guess I could reconstruct it. I think I'd prefer not to, though, since the .png files we already have are ok enough. The constellation diagrams I made entirely in Powerpoint; Matlab can do that (I believe the Comms toolbox has specific functions for it), but I didn't like the output as much as what I could get in Powerpoint. Using Powerpoint also avoided the need to write any code at all — I just positioned things using the default snap-to-grid things. Unfortunately, neither Matlab nor Powerpoint can export in .svg so I had to settle for .png -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:19, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. That's actually really helpful and explains why it was so <i>damned</i> hard to make the images not scramble when I resized them. I had to spend quite some time playing with the export options so that the timing diags looked ok once they were the size I reckoned they should be. (The constellations weren't problematic; I suppose this is because I made them very big and only use them smaller.) When I find the time, I'll turn them into .svg images...once I work out those two pieces of software you mention. As for posting the Matlab code; I'll think about that case-by-case because I can imagine there are some cases where I would not want to GFDL the code (e.g. if it's part of my PhD or something). Thanks for the insight. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:38, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi.

<p>Hi I was interested in your comments on Edsanville's page re: Gnuplot and SVG. Do you know of a reference that explains (i.e. teaches) how to make images and animations with the Gnuplot and SVG? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 04:44, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I know, there isn't any howto for making SVG with Gnuplot in particular. Gnuplot is a program for plotting, and it exports in several formats; one of them is SVG. That's it. Any tutorial is fine. Anyway I didn't find anything simple when I was looking for it, so all I can suggest you is this: take a look at the pictures other users did, make your own modifying the code other people used. In particular, I put in <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_Pictures_SVG_4fd8.html" title="User:Alejo2083/Pictures SVG">User:Alejo2083/Pictures_SVG</a> all the SVG pictures I made with the code I used (just click on them): you could start from that.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You can't create animations with Gnuplot. I don't know any (free) program to do it, but I don't think Wikipedia supports it, yet. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 19:06, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alessio, thanks for your comments! I actually wasn't aware that SVG images could be uploaded, so I converted it to PNG first. I've uploaded the file now to <a href="../../../s/i/n/Image%7ESingle-phase_transformer.svg_2399.html" title="Image:Single-phase transformer.svg">Image:Single-phase transformer.svg</a> on the Commons. It appears that some of the formatting hasn't come across quite right: the flux symbol for example has disappeared, and the subscripts on the number of turns look a bit funny. I guess these can be sorted with a little work and I can reload the file. Is there a particular reason that SVG should be preferred over PNG? regards, --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 20:15, 19 December 2005 (UTC)<br />

<dl>
<dd>Okay, I have uploaded a new version of the file; it is the one currently at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">Transformer</a>. I had to separate the text with the subscripts into two blocks to get it to show properly. The flux symbol Ø is now just an ellipse with a line drawn through it. The image looks 'crisper', though.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your questions, no, I worked the image from scratch and from memory. It was the first full image I had ever drawn with Inkscape. I'm still learning; here is an animated image I'm working on now to illustrate three-phase power-flow: <a href="http://img527.imageshack.us/my.php?image=360deganimation2sm.gif" class="external free" title="http://img527.imageshack.us/my.php?image=360deganimation2sm.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img527.imageshack.us/my.php?image=360deganimation2sm.gif</a>.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For some reason, the flux symbol disappeared altogether first time round, so I redrew it as a circle with a line through it. There might have been a problem with mixing font symbols in the same line of text. I have now given it a second go, this time creating a new text entity. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 22:29, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nope, it's not working. A black rectangle keeps appearing in the image. It's not present in the file I'm working on. One of the arrowheads is going missing, and the flux symbol is becoming much smaller as well. For the time being, I have reverted <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">Transformer</a> back to using the original PNG file. Perhaps you could offer some advice. I can e-mail you the SVG file if you're interested. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 22:51, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello again. For your info, I finally sorted the problem with uploading the SVG file. (There's a new one now at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">Transformer</a>.) There was a strange entity hidden in the file called "svg:FlowRegion". I had to remove it with Inkscape's XML editor as it was not selectable (or viewable) on screen. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 00:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. I got rid of the black rectangle as I say in my message above. The problem with the Greek Phi appeared to be because I was trying to mix both Latin and Greek fonts in the same text object, something Wikipedia's SVG engine obviously didn't like. With the new drawing, the 'Magnetic Flux' is one text object, and the Phi is another. I'm not sure what was happening with the arrows, but the problem seems to have gone away. My latest work is <a href="../../../3/-/p/Image%7E3-phase_flow.gif.html" title="Image:3-phase flow.gif">here</a>, started with Inkscape and animated with Adobe ImageReady, but it needs a little more work at the moment.

<dd>Sorry for taking the time to get back to you. With regards to changing the arrow direction on the secondary, I guess I was succumbing to peer pressure on the FA page. However, I have been searching the web today, and the pages I could see showing a similar circuit diagram seemed to be fairly evenly divided as to whether the secondary current is showing entering or leaving. Of course, it can easily be changed in the image. If you think it is important, I guess you could say so on the featured article page and a new version be uploaded. With regards to The Commons, there was no real reason to not upload it there. Can it be done there as well, or does it need to be renamed, or something? --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 17:11, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has been suggested by <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">User:BrianSmithson</a> that the Beer and brewery categories should be renamed. The proposal has been supported by <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">User:Syrthiss</a>, and supported and expanded by myself. The notion is that the regional categories should follow the format of "Beer and breweries in Africa" /Europe/Asia/North America/South America/Oceania. "Brewers and breweries" could also be renamed "Beer and breweries by region". And all the countries should also be renamed (and merged if needed) as, for example, "Beer and breweries of Germany", "Beer and breweries of Britain", "Beer and breweries of Poland". The word in each case would be beer rather than beers to allow for general articles on beer culture in each region as well as individual beers.</p>

It might be clearer if you didn't center the FFT spectrum, however. (Note also that you can use the fftshift command instead of using the (-1)^(i+j) trick, which only works for even sizes.)</p>

<dd>If you were <i>only</i> showing the FFT spectrum, I would agree that you should center it. The reason I don't think you should center it here is because you are comparing it to the DCT spectrum, which is not centered. For purposes of comparison, you should make the two plots as similar as possible. (Arguably, you should also remove half of the FFT image since half of it is redundant for the transform of a real image.) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G. Johnson</a> 16:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your revised image still has three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>You didn't correct the FFT histogram (it is still centered)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You plotted 1/4 of the FFT image instead of 1/2. This is questionable because 1/4 of the image does not show all of the non-redundant magnitudes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You rescaled the 1/4 FFT image so that it is the same size as the DCT image. This is misleading because the DCT image now has a higher resolution. If you want to compare the energy localization, the pixels must be the same size. Thus, if you show 1/2 of the FFT image as I suggest then the FFT image plot should be 1/2 the size of the DCT plot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for your efforts.</p>

<p>Hi, Alejo2083!</p>
<p>I just read your new article on <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soliton_%28optics%29.html" title="Soliton (optics)">solitons</a>, and I'm impressed. It's an excellent article. Thank you for putting so much time and effort into it.</p>
<p>I did notice some little things about the English idiom and style. I'm guessing that English is your second (third?) language. So I just wanted to let you know I'll probably change a few words here and there, and maybe alter some punctuation, in the next day or two. It's no reflection on you ... you clearly know your stuff. I'm just pretty picky about English idiom.</p>
<p>Thanks again for writing such a wonderful article on an interesting topic! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 13:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm happy you liked it&#160;:-) I am studying solitons but I found it a confusing subject at the beginning because any book I have seen discusses them quickly, with few explanations and using ambiguous notations... So I collected all the info I could, I rearranged them using my own clear notation (consistent for both cases) and I wrote the article. Maybe there is too much maths compared to explanations and pictures, but about now it's fine.</dd>

<dd>About my English, yeh I know I'm getting worst. I studied and graduated in UK, but here in Italy I can't find any chance to speak in English with anybody... feel free to fix my English odds, I appreciate it because I can learn from your corrections&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 19:13, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks a lot for the great <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soliton_%28optics%29.html" title="Soliton (optics)">soliton (optics)</a> article! You write "The higher frequency components will propagate a little bit faster than the lower frequencies, thus arriving before at the end of the fiber." Isn't it true that red light is faster than blue light in glass?</p>
<p>Also, since you seem to be good with graphics, I was wondering if you could create a picture for <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soliton.html" title="Soliton">soliton</a>? Maybe an animated picture, a soliton moving from left to right. Or even two solitons meeting and passing through each other. Cheers, <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:57, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the speed of light depends on the refractive index, that depends on frequency. In glass fibers, for <span class="texhtml">λ &lt; 1.3μ<i>m</i></span> (normal dispersion), lower frequencies are faster, then red light is faster than blue. If <span class="texhtml">λ &gt; 1.3μ<i>m</i></span> (anomalous dispersion), then the opposite is true and higher frequencies go faster. We need anomalous dispersion to generate temporal solitons, the range of frequencies we can use depend on the material, the standard <span class="texhtml">1.3μ<i>m</i></span> threshold is valid only for standard SiO2 fibers. If this point is not clear in the article, please fix it adding a clearer explanation!</dd>

<dd>about graphics, I can make still images. The only way I am able to create an animation is by creating each frame as a still image and then merging them together to create a GIF. I can do it anyway: for this kind of graphics you don't need 25 fps, 1-2 fps are enough. I am very busy in this period: if you ask me to make a plot in particular, providing the mathematical formulas to be used, I can do something, otherwise I'm sorry but I have no time. Bye&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a></dd>
