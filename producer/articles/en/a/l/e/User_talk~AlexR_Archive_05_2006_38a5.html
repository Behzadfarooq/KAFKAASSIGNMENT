<p>Hi, Alex,</p>
<p>I hope to be able to make progress on the cross-dressing article, and to do so I want to step around certain distractions that trouble both of us. Could you please respond on the cross-dressing discussion page to my last question to you? (The one above the line where the distracting material appears.&#160;;-) ) Thanks. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 16:17, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder what distraction you are talking about. The only <i>other</i> thing that is being debated seems to be more important than ... errr ... that famous sack of rice in China? The colour of Bush's underwear? Uh, now I am being nasty ... but to some it seems certainly more important than correct and NPOV articles. Oh well ...</dd>
<dd>I did not manage to respond to you in the morning because I was a bit in a hurry to get to my father, and since I helped him repairing the roof today, I am too tired to get together a complete answer. But don't worry, it isn't forgotten, it might just become a longish answer.&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 19:43, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm willing and eager to accept your truce on Heteronormativity and other articles. However, I would ask one thing - please try to assume good faith on the part of other people. I know Hyacinth, and I know he means well. He is not trying to be insulting. He saw a conflict and made a genuine and sincere effort to resolve it. The fact that you find his attempted resolution unacceptable really shouldn't be a cause for calling the effort insulting.

<dd>Are you joking? You were the one who reverted to a POV-pushing version and ranted and insulted me for trying to improve "your" article. And obviously my edits shows much more "intelectual support" for what I wrote than your, too. So maybe you ought to try and to better the next time - like checking facts and not insulting people, for example. However, if you consider my last comment on the talk page as "primary insulting", then obviously there is no basis whatever for a meaningful debate between us, and that clearly shows that you have neither the capacity not the willingness to resolve the problem.

<p>In the interest of stress reduction, I suggest the creation of Template:Transfac (or even Template:Transfacts), which you could then use to post on contributors talk pages with a polite (even when you are not, because its automatic), informative, and useful discussion of common Wikipedia mistakes regarding trans issues and folks. This would hopefully not only facilitate your discussion and editing with individual users, but would also facilitate a more broad discussion involving other editors <i>and</i> it would create a permanent record of the progress made during that discussion (rather than going through the process with multiple users each time it comes up, simply point them to what is already established). This idea comes from <a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEdit_summary_2c4b.html" title="Template:Edit summary">Template:Edit summary</a>.</p>

<dd>Hello, and thanks for contributing to Wikipedia. I hope you continue to enjoy and improve it.</dd>
<dd>However, I am writing in regards to you recent edits to transgender and related articles. I appreciate your interest in the subject, however, there are some common mistakes in regards to these topics, one or more of which you added to an article:
<ul>
<li>[bulleted list, example:] Gender identity is not sexual orientation. Transgender is not a sexual orientation. [short explination] For more information see: [links].</li>
<li>...</li>

<p>I noticed you reverted the lesbian article after I changed prefer to sexually oriented. Why? I disagree with the usage of that term and I believe all neutral organizations do. I've never seen a company or government policy use the wording "sexual preference", it is always "sexual orientation". The reason behind that is mainstream science considers a persons sexual feelings to be not changeable. The only discussion regarding that in mainstream science is why? Why is a person gay or lesbian? Not if they can change, that is only a radical segment that is POV that believes that. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.224.215.134.html" title="User:207.224.215.134">207.224.215.134</a> 00:36, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>One more thing. To prefer women over men would mean you have at least some attraction to men. That means you would be bisexual, not a lesbian. Lesbians are only attracted to women so they cannot prefer. Pefer is highly inaccurate on the lesbian page. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.224.215.134.html" title="User:207.224.215.134">207.224.215.134</a> 00:51, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yours is a decidedly odd reasoning, since "prefer" is established use since don't-know-when. Also, sex is not the only thing being lesbian (or gay) is about, as "sexually orientated" implies, so that is flatout wrong. And furthermore, a few advices to you: Get a username, because IPs are rarely taken seriously - especially not if they edit such highly controversial articles. And don't discuss something like that on somebodys userpage, try the talk page of the article, where it belongs, instead. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 01:50, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That being said, I do consider it appropriate for <a href="../../../s/e/x/Template%7ESex-stub_3981.html" title="Template:Sex-stub">Template:sex-stub</a> as it relates to the usage of sexual characteristics in such a manner as to run counter to expectation, a type of role-playing.

<p>I don't especially care where it goes. I threw it in with sex-stubs not for some political or categorizational or personal reason but for the purely pragmatic reason that there at least it is more likely that someone with the knowledge and inclination to destub it will find it. Check out <a href="../../../s/t/u/Category%7EStub_e06e.html" title="Category:Stub">Category:Stub</a>; its a mess. Category:Sex-related stubs is at least navigable and, as I said, more likely to be browsed by someone who is able and willing to destub the article. Finally, lose the fucking condescending attitude. Not every perceived miscategorization is an attack you need to respond to aggressively. I've read a lot of your work on the wiki, and its great. You obviously know your stuff, and I'll generally acknowledge your authority in your areas of interest. Just saying, "hey, I don't think this should go there" is probably gonna do it. You don't need to get into the whole snotty "Whoever uses that one ought to get a grip on the differences between gender, sex (the equipment) and sex (the action)". -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 19:03, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed your remark in your edit summary to minor changes to the G-I/R article. I think the reason the article is there is to serve as an acknowledgement that according to Money's analysis the two terms "gender identity" and "gender role" are pretty thoroughly intertwined. Probably anything that tends to anchor the understanding (and definitions) of these critical terms should be kept. There are so many people around who use "gender" as a sort of euphemism for "sex" and otherwise indiscriminantly fling these terms around that anything that encourages people to learn the history of the terms, the reasons they came into existence, etc., is a plus. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 05:07, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your remark:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would you kindly stop making those stupid and incorrect edits to transwoman? It is obvious that you have no clue about gender assignments, so stop putting BS into the article, or you might find yourself treated as a vandal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not familiar with the theory, but you're presenting POV as fact and being bold as vandalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example, one is not born in any sex</dd>
</dl>
<p>One is <i>definitely</i> born with a set of sex chromosomes and genitalia. There is established POV that states that sex is a matter of genetics and anatomy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>there are debates whether transgender people are clearly one sex</dd>
</dl>
<p>My edits have never made a factual statement either way about that issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>and intersex people can get assigned another gender at any time, not only shortly after birth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And, the most basic thing: You may have something hanging between your legs, but what gets into the papers is not put there by said thingy, but by people - namely, doctors, midwifes and/or parents.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What gets into the papers, according to your POV, decides or "assigns" one's sex. I assert that in most cases, it is simply an empirical observation of a pre-existing biological condition that is recorded. But this is a matter of POV, not fact--as editors, we must often be careful not to confuse the two. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:14, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>You just said,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"since gender variant behaviour is seen by proponents or reparative therapy as an extreme form of homosexuality (a view that long has disappeared from scientific discourses)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>on the above page. It's most certainly a view which is rapidly losing favour but, as you know, it's one of the two views expounded by Bailey, Blanchard et. al. Now, I'm not a big fan of B&amp;B (at all!!!) but stating what you did isn't totally NPOV. Unfortunately, scientific discourses are <i>still</i> propounding this stance - bogus as it may be.</p>

<dd>One could include a "most" or even a "serious" or "widely accepted" there, if needed - one might also argue, though, that B&amp;B are not exactly part of the <i>scientific</i> discourse - they don't really fit any definition of science I have ever heard&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 11:02, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, true&#160;:-) I'd say in the interests of broad factuality, maybe change it to 'most' or 'almost all'.

<p>I assume you know who he is. What is his reputation in Germany these days? Among LGBT communities? I remember some articles from the gay community in the 70s or 80s lambasting his ideas and research. I assumed he was long-dead, but recently ran across a recent article [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11781536" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11781536">PMID 11781536</a>]. Although he takes pains to disavow prejudice and intolerance, he seems to pretty clearly consider such variations as "transsexualism" a result of pathologic processes to a greater degree than anyone in North America has been willing to express in a scientific publication, attributing them to pernicious environmental influences such as endocrine disrupters like <a href="../../../d/d/t/DDT_2889.html" title="DDT">DDT</a> or stress. On the other hand, to that same reference is appended his resolution to the <a href="../../../w/h/o/WHO_9ed1.html" title="WHO">WHO</a> that "homosexuality not be regarded as a disease or a mental disorder." Since I gather his idea of a biological basis of LGBT conditions has found more favor in those communities than it used to, is he considered sympathetic or an ally despite his calls to "prevent" those? There is no hidden agenda in my question, just curiosity, and I assume this is a topic you are familiar with. He is the only German researcher in the area of sex hormones, brain biology, &amp; sexual behavior that I have heard of, and he has been around forever. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 19:36, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I actually had to do a google search for him - the name rang a bell, but not a loud one. To assess his current standing, you have to be aware that he was working in the GDR, not West Germany. Now, apparently, until the mid-1970s, his biological theories and proposed "cures" were well recieved in parts of West Germany, too, but back then biologistic theories and "cures" were all the rage, anyway. Since the mid-70s, though, LGB questions were considered far more from a social point of view, with those theories pretty much disappearing both from the public eye. (Trans* went a different path, staying until recently firmily in the hands of sexologists, and IS staying firmly in the hands of doctors.)</dd>
<dd>Now, actually, most of Western Europe has not taken anywhere as much interest in the "new" biological theories of the origin of sexual behaviour as the US has done; people regard the question as anything from mildly interesting to mildly amusing, nothing more. However, I did find some rather leftist LGB(TI) comments on him, apparently he got a medal of honor a few years ago, and they were mad about that - the left LGBTI most certainly does not see him as an ally. I have not found anything mainstream about him, but I would be very very very much surprised if anybody in the mainstream would consider anybody with his history and his views an ally - after all, that guy maintains that LGB(TI) has a simple reason, and could theoretically be cured in the womb. Actually, no biological theory is very much in favour, anybody proposing any biological theory would need to have very convincing evidence and a snow-white ethical standing to be even remotely considered as an ally. (Biologistical theories still have that faint - and in this case, not so faint - smell of the 3rd Reich about them in Europe, too.) And of course his theories do belong a) to a different time, and b) to a different society, so he just isn't much talked about at all among LGBTI circles. If he is talked about, though, it is hardly favourable.</dd>
<dd>As for T and I, well, I is known to have biological reasons, but everybody familiar with this knows it is a lot more complicated than that, and his theories on T don't exactly sound as if there was anything behind them, either. Certainly he is not discussed much there, either, although transgender people, especially transsexual people, are far more in favour of a biological explanation than LGB people. However, the focus there is on things like Gooren's (fe)male brain, not so much on how it became that way, but as the ultimate proof that one isn't "just a nutcase". With the move towards simply accepting it as it is instead of "curing" it, which was the previous focus on transgender people, even that becomes less important. So, all together, this guy is not very important to any current discourses, including, as far as I am aware of, most of the medical discourses regarding LGBTI people.</dd>

<p>Re your vote on styles. I understand and agree. But only casting one vote is effectively a vote <i>against</i> Alternative 1 because it means that less opposition is recorded against its nearest rival. Ireland uses an electoral system called <i>Proportional Representation using a Single Transferable Vote</i>. It works on the same principle as the one being used (only less complicated! I never thought I would find a system more complicated than PR.STV!) What you do is give your bottom preference to the people you want to defeat, and spread your vote in a way that boosts the rivals of the alternative you do not want. So if for example, you find Alternative 3 the one you least like, give it your bottom vote so that opposition to it is recorded. And spread the other votes to ensure the weakest get votes ahead of it. If for example in Ireland I want to ensure candidate 'x' of Fianna Fáil is elected, and ensure candidate 'y' of Sinn Féin is defeated, and there are 15 candidates, I give my number 1 to 'x', my number '15' to 'y' and spread my other votes to ensure that all other candidates beat 'y'.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil voters famously used to practice a 'first and only choice' vote by just voting for their own preferred candidate and then stopping. They eventually realised that they were wasting their vote because they weren't using it to block those they were most opposed to, or to build up the rivals to the candidate they were opposed to. To stop Alternative 3 winning, if that is what you want, give it your <i>fifth choice</i> and give your second, third and fourth choices to the weakest options.</p>
<p>Just be careful though not to copy everyone else doing it. If everyone gives the same other alternatives the same order of votes they may win. So if option 4 gets a lot of 2s, give it a 4. Doing a full vote right down the line will have the effect of strengthening Alternative 1 vis-a-vis 3 or whatever. Just voting for 1 and stopping actually weakens it against its rivals if everyone <i>else</i> votes down the line, because while their opposition to different alternatives is recorded, by stopping at 1 your's isn't. That is why though very popular Alternative 1 is being beaten. Remember the winner won't be decided by who has more votes for, but which faces the least opposition. <i>Slán</i> <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">00:13, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<p>Hello Alex. It appears you sent me a message about this earlier, but due to some strange deficiency in my IRC software I only saw it when I disconnected. The helpful facility you are after is called godmode-light and is detailed <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I came across it because it was mentioned on the village pump some time ago. I don't think anyone there condemned its use, but it was said by some people that anyone using it should follow the rule for admin rollback which is to use it only to revert vandalism, and not in content disputes (it doesn't allow you to fill in an edit summary explaining the revert). To use it you just add <code>document.write('&lt;SCRIPT SRC="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/godmode-light.js"&gt;&lt;\/SCRIPT&gt;');</code> to your monobook.js, and rollback links will magically appear in the appropriate places. It is not brilliant by the way, and sometimes fails when the servers are running slowly, but overall I found it a helpful tool. I don't think it is actually secret, it's just not talked about too much so as to avoid broadcasting its existence to the hordes of marauding vandals. <small>(But, of course, it doesn't really exist, and even if it did you wouldn't have heard about it from me....

<p>For example, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> (one of your reversions) doesn't <i>need</i> to be -- and under Wikipedia policy, really <i>can't</i> be -- in both <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a> and the subcategory <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_orientation_8771.html" title="Category:Sexual orientation">Category:Sexual orientation</a>.

And most of the other articles you reverted are already filed under "transgender-related topics", which is <i>also</i> subcategorized under LGBT already. As for <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_ISIS_Survey_dedc.html" title="1983 ISIS Survey">1983 ISIS Survey</a>, I simply typed the wrong category by mistake; my actual intention was to file it under <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_history_48fb.html" title="Category:LGBT history">Category:LGBT history</a>.</p>
<p>Some people seem to think "LGBT" needs to act as a one-stop master list of all LGBT-related topics regardless of where else they're filed, but that's not how categories work or what they're meant to be doing.</p>
<p>And, for the record, it hardly constitutes "widespread changes getting pushed through without proper debate". One doesn't <i>have</i> to debate following Wikipedia policy on category management. The angry tone you took on my talk page is neither an appreciated or an appropriate response to the matter, particularly since I'm almost singlehandedly responsible for the T being <i>in</i> most of the category names in the <i>first</i> place, and I will not even acknowledge any future discussion from you that strikes that tone again.</p>
<p>Later update: I see you also reverted <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe_8.html" title="Tribe 8">Tribe 8</a>. For one thing, <b>one does not have to announce a category change before making it</b>; the assertion that an unannounced change should be reverted just for being unannounced is utter bullcrap. But, since you want to know, here was why I made the changes I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>The category "punk rock groups" is <i>redundant</i> with category "later punk groups"; going back to the stuff about subcategory vs. master category, it's a one-or-the-other case, not both.</li>
<li>Tribe 8 is not an individual; it's a band. "Gay, lesbian or bisexual people" is for <i>individuals</i>. This change does <i>not</i> remove them from a queer context, as they're still filed under "LGBT musicians".</li>
<li>The band should be sorted as "Tribe 8" under the letter T, not as "8, Tribe" under the number 8.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and by the way...the next time you want to accuse me of thoughtlessness, you might want to take a gander at the description of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_orientation_and_identity_c5f0.html" title="Category:Sexual orientation and identity">Category:Sexual orientation and identity</a> before you start typing: <i>The category is for articles that have to do with sexual orientation, sexual identity, labels, <b>and gender identity</b>.</i> So if you think that's wrong or offensive, take it up with the person who wrote that. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I fail to understand where you get the notion that the category <i>is</i> conflating "sexual identity" with "gender identity". Where in anything connected to the category is there even the <i>suggestion</i> that anybody thinks transgender is a <i>sexual</i> identity? The category title doesn't say that. The category description didn't say that. I genuinely fail to grasp how you're interpreting "identity" as inherently meaning "sexual identity" to the exclusion of any other meaning of the word, when the category quite explicitly distinguished two distinct concepts of "sexual identity" and "gender identity", and <i>nothing</i> implied that one was being subsumed into the other. And that doesn't make me a transphobic bigot or a person who should somehow "know better" than anything; it makes me a person who knows how to read what's written and not infer stuff that isn't there. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:02, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You admit that you can't tell if they're shemales, sex-change-men-to-women, or crossdressers. There are also four of them and you say you don't know for every one. Yet you're launching into an edit war with a ton of people, trying to claim they're one thing and not the other.

<dd>Actually, you have been reverting for the sake of reverting. I reverted you once because you used invalid logic. You edited it three times.

<p>I'm thinking of the reader who has not the foggiest idea what's going on. Rather than making them click on 5 links (yes, it's 5, you removed any reference to bi-sexuality twice now), seems harsh. Instead, the <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBTI_75dc.html" title="LGBTI">LGBTI</a> article gives them a nice, short reference to everything they need to know, via a decent article and many citations to other articles. Everything you wanted to list is there plus much more. If you are really hung up on expanding the accronym, then please do so as such: <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI)</a>, which is the correct expansion, and would still point to the one article which has all of the appropriate info (note: if you're going to go that way, there's no need to reference the redirect at <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBTI_75dc.html" title="LGBTI">LGBTI</a>, just go straight (er... well) to <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a>, since the name of the link doesn't show anyway). -Harmil</p>

<dd><b>Reproducing your comment from my talk page</b>: First of all, I would appreciate if you would sign your entries like the one on my talk page; that way, I don't have to go through the history to answer you. Second, I don't think that linking to LGBT is the way to go here, since lots of people probably won't know what that is - lots more people will at least recognise some of the expanded words, though. If you are really worried about bisexual people (who are nowhere else mentioned in the article) then add that word, and don't just revert to the acronym. Not to mention that the article that it links to references intersex people rather sparingly; they are rather important at this place, though. So kindly stop this mindless reverting, since it is nothing but ill thought-through reverting for reverting's sake by now. I may also add that I just restored the previous version, so if you want any changes, change it to something that makes sense at this point. -- AlexR 06:09, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, forgetting the signature was just an oversight, sorry. It seems that you didn't read what I actually wrote, above and are simply replying to the subject, since you conflate "linking to LGBT" with people knowing what the acronym means. To re-quote what I wrote: "<i>If you are really hung up on expanding the accronym, then please do so as such: <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI)</a>, which is the correct expansion, and would still point to the one article which has all of the appropriate info</i>". As for "reverting for reverting's sake", I was not. You changed my use of "LGBTI" to a less-complete collection of words, some of which ("intersex" and "transgender") would be just as unknown to the majority of readers, while removing the reference to bisexuality (I take personal offense at that one), and when I restored my change with a comment to indicate why, you again reverted it. Please, do not accuse me of "reverting for reverting's sake" when you are removing content and context from a page. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 10:48, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the hint - for some reason, jEdit, which I use with the WP plug-in, decided today that it didn't like special characters any more. I noticed a bit later, and I think I have corrected everything, but that is indeed annoying.

<p>Hi Alex, I generally do not stand on little particulars, but your modification of "warp and woof" gains nothing and, as it somewhat vague, loses the sense that the two loves were complementary <i>and</i> integral to male experience. I also am not sure that it is more encylopaedic to favor dry formulations over more expressive ones, within reason. As for the accuracy of the statement, it is not my opinion (alone) but the consensus of the classics. It stands out in the writings of many, if not all, such as Plutarch, Lucian, the poets (both Greek and Roman) and so forth. Oh yes, and in the mythology too. Can you please find an alternative formulation, or even better, leave mine. It is anything <i>but</i> archaic. Cheers, <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 11:01, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Was I harsh? I speak more freely to friends, and I welcome it in return. Interesting, that "warp and woof" was not recognized. I'll second your edit based on that, I would have imagined that it is a phrase intelligible to anyone. Goes to show you that it is not good to be too much inside one's own head.

<p>Somehow, you decided I was one of "them" (I'm really not even sure which "them") back when we tangled over heteronormativity, and you clearly carried the idea along to LGBT and Sexual characteristics. Your insults have been rather scathing ranging from calling me "stupid" to insulting my work to saying that I clearly had "too much time on my hands" (seems a counter-productive desire to want editors with <i>less</i> time available). I've tried several times to bury the hatchet, but you have had none of it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that you would accept that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't hold a grudge against you (my comment about "personal offense" was ill considered, and was not intended to convey a sense that I was upset with you, only with being a member of a group which is so easily discounted).</li>
<li>I agree with you in many things, though I think you feel more strongly than I do in many cases.</li>
<li>I'm not trying to inject a POV into anything on WP, rather quite the opposite.</li>
<li>While I don't agree with your doctor friend on the nature of modern medicine and science, I do agree with the assessment that heteronormative structures present a difficult hurdle for LGBTI people, and that's unfortunate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, there's not much I can do to contribute to Wikipedia in areas where my every edit will be reverted, and given the speed with which you and I could have put together <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_characteristics.html" title="Sexual characteristics">Sexual characteristics</a> if we could work <i>together</i>... well, it's even more sad.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future you will bear these things in mind and perhaps cut me a bit more slack, as I have tried to do for you (and will continue to do so).</p>

<p>Hi, Alex,</p>
<p>I have been monitoring the article on Atypical gender identity. There is some pressure to either improve it or to merge it elsewhere. I believe it was originally spun off from the gender identity and gender role areas because some people were uncomfortable with depicting G-I/Rs that were not the vanilla varieties. Probably that was a wise decision since the original articles contained absurdities on even the vanilla stuff and it was more important to fight those fights and put the even harder to get clear on somewhere else. (Boys naturally prefer blue, they claimed. I naturally preferred green as a child and I naturally prefer orange as an adult, so what does that make me? No, don't answer that.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>As I have time, I'm going to put a brief description of Hijra and any other examples I can find where there are clear "mixed elements" in the clothing and behavior. I figure you probably have lots more examples in mind just reading this note.</p>
<p>One of the strange (to me) requests was that there be section headings -- despite the fact that the article is now very short. So I will put in a major section marker for "Examples" and minor ones for Hijra, Xanith, etc. Since there are major articles already, all these sections need to do is refer readers to the other articles and then give a paragraph or so in which we highlight the specific social signals that go along with the and announce the gender identities or that would create the false impression of a gender identity if someone accidentally used the wrong clothing, e.g., picking up a jacket that buttoned on the wrong side, work boots of the "wrong" color, etc.</p>
<p>Since the title involves identity rather than role, it's going to be a little tricky to get a correct characterization of what it feels like to be a xanith. What makes a person recognize e is a xanith? Have xaniths written about their experience of self? Or do we have to depend on some anthropologist's account?</p>
<p>I think this article could really be useful to people trying to understand "the other."</p>

<dd>You will find an awful lot of misspellings, some of them even more common than the proper spelling. So your point was?</dd>
<dd>Transgender was from the beginning used as both an adjective and a noun. Only a few years ago this abomination of "transgender<i>ed</i>" turned up, without any reason for its existance but pseudo-grammar like "thou shall not split thy infinitive". It is not only unnecessary, it also sounds like a passive - whenever I hear that somebody is transgender<i>ed</i> it makes me want to ask who did that to that poor fellow. Which is the reason that no matter how many actual usages of the word you turn up, as far as I am concerned, this is not a word, but an abomination. So you might wish to turn your attention to other matters now. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 08:56, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One thing I have noticed in this article is that some sections use "transsexuality" and others "transsexualism". I think it would be better to use one term consistently within the article. I have considered renaming the article as "transsexualism", as that seems to be the term in widest use, but I felt like I needed to discuss this change with others before making it. I also left a note about this on the article's talk page, but no one has replied there, so I am asking users who I know have made significant contributions to this article.</p>

<p>Hi Alex, I see that you made a few more edits to this article. Some of them were excellent. I fixed a few typos you made and reworded a few things for clarity; I know you're not a native speaker of English and so I don't blame you for making these mistakes. I removed your statement "This however is not quite compatible with the definition of transgender" as it is unclear what "this" refers to and this statement does not seem NPOV. I also removed a few other statements you added that seemed to border on POV. And you changed a couple of things that I didn't revert, even though I don't particularly agree with them. For one, you edited the opening paragraph to state that a transsexual person "wishes to" establish a permanent identity with the gender opposite their assigned sex. Well, the latter part of this sentence may be unclear to some readers and should perhaps be rephrased to "as a member of the gender opposite their assigned sex". Well, that aside, I really think it is more factually accurate to state that a transsexual person establishes an identity as one of "the opposite sex" than that they wish to. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_identity.html" title="Gender identity">Gender identity</a> is how one sees them self; it has nothing to do with how they present themselves or are seen by others. I, for one, am still in transition and not living as a woman full-time; many people who see me relate to me as a male, but I identify as a woman. That said, I don't think the phrase is any more or less <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> either way. Please explain your reasoning for this edit.</p>
<p>You also added "This however has its own considerable health risks" in reference to the statement that some transpeople obtain hormones from black market sources. I have already reworded this statement slightly, but it seems kind of redundant given that the section on hormone replacement therapy already stated that HRT had risks and that it was considered inadvisable to take hormones without a physician's supervision. Do you think there is a reason for this to be stated twice?</p>

<p>Hi, Alex,</p>
<p>I hope to be able to make progress on the cross-dressing article, and to do so I want to step around certain distractions that trouble both of us. Could you please respond on the cross-dressing discussion page to my last question to you? (The one above the line where the distracting material appears.&#160;;-) ) Thanks. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 16:17, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wonder what distraction you are talking about. The only <i>other</i> thing that is being debated seems to be more important than ... errr ... that famous sack of rice in China? The colour of Bush's underwear? Uh, now I am being nasty ... but to some it seems certainly more important than correct and NPOV articles. Oh well ...</dd>
<dd>I did not manage to respond to you in the morning because I was a bit in a hurry to get to my father, and since I helped him repairing the roof today, I am too tired to get together a complete answer.

<dd>Are you joking? You were the one who reverted to a POV-pushing version and ranted and insulted me for trying to improve "your" article. And obviously my edits shows much more "intelectual support" for what I wrote than your, too. So maybe you ought to try and to better the next time - like checking facts and not insulting people, for example. However, if you consider my last comment on the talk page as "primary insulting", then obviously there is no basis whatever for a meaningful debate between us, and that clearly shows that you have neither the capacity not the willingness to resolve the problem.

<p>In the interest of stress reduction, I suggest the creation of Template:Transfac (or even Template:Transfacts), which you could then use to post on contributors talk pages with a polite (even when you are not, because its automatic), informative, and useful discussion of common Wikipedia mistakes regarding trans issues and folks. This would hopefully not only facilitate your discussion and editing with individual users, but would also facilitate a more broad discussion involving other editors <i>and</i> it would create a permanent record of the progress made during that discussion (rather than going through the process with multiple users each time it comes up, simply point them to what is already established).

<p>I noticed you reverted the lesbian article after I changed prefer to sexually oriented. Why? I disagree with the usage of that term and I believe all neutral organizations do. I've never seen a company or government policy use the wording "sexual preference", it is always "sexual orientation". The reason behind that is mainstream science considers a persons sexual feelings to be not changeable. The only discussion regarding that in mainstream science is why? Why is a person gay or lesbian? Not if they can change, that is only a radical segment that is POV that believes that. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.224.215.134.html" title="User:207.224.215.134">207.224.215.134</a> 00:36, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One more thing. To prefer women over men would mean you have at least some attraction to men. That means you would be bisexual, not a lesbian. Lesbians are only attracted to women so they cannot prefer.

<dd>Yours is a decidedly odd reasoning, since "prefer" is established use since don't-know-when. Also, sex is not the only thing being lesbian (or gay) is about, as "sexually orientated" implies, so that is flatout wrong. And furthermore, a few advices to you: Get a username, because IPs are rarely taken seriously - especially not if they edit such highly controversial articles. And don't discuss something like that on somebodys userpage, try the talk page of the article, where it belongs, instead. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 01:50, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't especially care where it goes. I threw it in with sex-stubs not for some political or categorizational or personal reason but for the purely pragmatic reason that there at least it is more likely that someone with the knowledge and inclination to destub it will find it. Check out <a href="../../../s/t/u/Category%7EStub_e06e.html" title="Category:Stub">Category:Stub</a>; its a mess. Category:Sex-related stubs is at least navigable and, as I said, more likely to be browsed by someone who is able and willing to destub the article. Finally, lose the fucking condescending attitude. Not every perceived miscategorization is an attack you need to respond to aggressively. I've read a lot of your work on the wiki, and its great. You obviously know your stuff, and I'll generally acknowledge your authority in your areas of interest. Just saying, "hey, I don't think this should go there" is probably gonna do it. You don't need to get into the whole snotty "Whoever uses that one ought to get a grip on the differences between gender, sex (the equipment) and sex (the action)". -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 19:03, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I clicked on the first <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormone_replacement_therapy.html" title="Hormone replacement therapy">Hormone replacement therapy</a> link and saw that the article mentioned use of HRT "by transgendered or transsexual people", and so assumed that the second link lead to the same article.

<p>I noticed your remark in your edit summary to minor changes to the G-I/R article. I think the reason the article is there is to serve as an acknowledgement that according to Money's analysis the two terms "gender identity" and "gender role" are pretty thoroughly intertwined. Probably anything that tends to anchor the understanding (and definitions) of these critical terms should be kept. There are so many people around who use "gender" as a sort of euphemism for "sex" and otherwise indiscriminantly fling these terms around that anything that encourages people to learn the history of the terms, the reasons they came into existence, etc., is a plus. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 05:07, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your remark:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would you kindly stop making those stupid and incorrect edits to transwoman? It is obvious that you have no clue about gender assignments, so stop putting BS into the article, or you might find yourself treated as a vandal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not familiar with the theory, but you're presenting POV as fact and being bold as vandalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example, one is not born in any sex</dd>
</dl>
<p>One is <i>definitely</i> born with a set of sex chromosomes and genitalia. There is established POV that states that sex is a matter of genetics and anatomy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>there are debates whether transgender people are clearly one sex</dd>
</dl>
<p>My edits have never made a factual statement either way about that issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>and intersex people can get assigned another gender at any time, not only shortly after birth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And, the most basic thing: You may have something hanging between your legs, but what gets into the papers is not put there by said thingy, but by people - namely, doctors, midwifes and/or parents.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What gets into the papers, according to your POV, decides or "assigns" one's sex. I assert that in most cases, it is simply an empirical observation of a pre-existing biological condition that is recorded. But this is a matter of POV, not fact--as editors, we must often be careful not to confuse the two. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:14, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>You just said,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"since gender variant behaviour is seen by proponents or reparative therapy as an extreme form of homosexuality (a view that long has disappeared from scientific discourses)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>on the above page. It's most certainly a view which is rapidly losing favour but, as you know, it's one of the two views expounded by Bailey, Blanchard et. al. Now, I'm not a big fan of B&amp;B (at all!!!) but stating what you did isn't totally NPOV. Unfortunately, scientific discourses are <i>still</i> propounding this stance - bogus as it may be.</p>

<dd>True, true&#160;:-) I'd say in the interests of broad factuality, maybe change it to 'most' or 'almost all'.

<p>I assume you know who he is. What is his reputation in Germany these days? Among LGBT communities? I remember some articles from the gay community in the 70s or 80s lambasting his ideas and research. I assumed he was long-dead, but recently ran across a recent article [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11781536" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11781536">PMID 11781536</a>]. Although he takes pains to disavow prejudice and intolerance, he seems to pretty clearly consider such variations as "transsexualism" a result of pathologic processes to a greater degree than anyone in North America has been willing to express in a scientific publication, attributing them to pernicious environmental influences such as endocrine disrupters like <a href="../../../d/d/t/DDT_2889.html" title="DDT">DDT</a> or stress. On the other hand, to that same reference is appended his resolution to the <a href="../../../w/h/o/WHO_9ed1.html" title="WHO">WHO</a> that "homosexuality not be regarded as a disease or a mental disorder." Since I gather his idea of a biological basis of LGBT conditions has found more favor in those communities than it used to, is he considered sympathetic or an ally despite his calls to "prevent" those? There is no hidden agenda in my question, just curiosity, and I assume this is a topic you are familiar with. He is the only German researcher in the area of sex hormones, brain biology, &amp; sexual behavior that I have heard of, and he has been around forever. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 19:36, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I actually had to do a google search for him - the name rang a bell, but not a loud one. To assess his current standing, you have to be aware that he was working in the GDR, not West Germany. Now, apparently, until the mid-1970s, his biological theories and proposed "cures" were well recieved in parts of West Germany, too, but back then biologistic theories and "cures" were all the rage, anyway. Since the mid-70s, though, LGB questions were considered far more from a social point of view, with those theories pretty much disappearing both from the public eye. (Trans* went a different path, staying until recently firmily in the hands of sexologists, and IS staying firmly in the hands of doctors.)</dd>
<dd>Now, actually, most of Western Europe has not taken anywhere as much interest in the "new" biological theories of the origin of sexual behaviour as the US has done; people regard the question as anything from mildly interesting to mildly amusing, nothing more. However, I did find some rather leftist LGB(TI) comments on him, apparently he got a medal of honor a few years ago, and they were mad about that - the left LGBTI most certainly does not see him as an ally. I have not found anything mainstream about him, but I would be very very very much surprised if anybody in the mainstream would consider anybody with his history and his views an ally - after all, that guy maintains that LGB(TI) has a simple reason, and could theoretically be cured in the womb. Actually, no biological theory is very much in favour, anybody proposing any biological theory would need to have very convincing evidence and a snow-white ethical standing to be even remotely considered as an ally. (Biologistical theories still have that faint - and in this case, not so faint - smell of the 3rd Reich about them in Europe, too.) And of course his theories do belong a) to a different time, and b) to a different society, so he just isn't much talked about at all among LGBTI circles. If he is talked about, though, it is hardly favourable.</dd>
<dd>As for T and I, well, I is known to have biological reasons, but everybody familiar with this knows it is a lot more complicated than that, and his theories on T don't exactly sound as if there was anything behind them, either. Certainly he is not discussed much there, either, although transgender people, especially transsexual people, are far more in favour of a biological explanation than LGB people. However, the focus there is on things like Gooren's (fe)male brain, not so much on how it became that way, but as the ultimate proof that one isn't "just a nutcase". With the move towards simply accepting it as it is instead of "curing" it, which was the previous focus on transgender people, even that becomes less important. So, all together, this guy is not very important to any current discourses, including, as far as I am aware of, most of the medical discourses regarding LGBTI people.</dd>

<p>Re your vote on styles. I understand and agree. But only casting one vote is effectively a vote <i>against</i> Alternative 1 because it means that less opposition is recorded against its nearest rival. Ireland uses an electoral system called <i>Proportional Representation using a Single Transferable Vote</i>. It works on the same principle as the one being used (only less complicated! I never thought I would find a system more complicated than PR.STV!) What you do is give your bottom preference to the people you want to defeat, and spread your vote in a way that boosts the rivals of the alternative you do not want. So if for example, you find Alternative 3 the one you least like, give it your bottom vote so that opposition to it is recorded. And spread the other votes to ensure the weakest get votes ahead of it. If for example in Ireland I want to ensure candidate 'x' of Fianna Fáil is elected, and ensure candidate 'y' of Sinn Féin is defeated, and there are 15 candidates, I give my number 1 to 'x', my number '15' to 'y' and spread my other votes to ensure that all other candidates beat 'y'.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil voters famously used to practice a 'first and only choice' vote by just voting for their own preferred candidate and then stopping. They eventually realised that they were wasting their vote because they weren't using it to block those they were most opposed to, or to build up the rivals to the candidate they were opposed to. To stop Alternative 3 winning, if that is what you want, give it your <i>fifth choice</i> and give your second, third and fourth choices to the weakest options.</p>
<p>Just be careful though not to copy everyone else doing it. If everyone gives the same other alternatives the same order of votes they may win. So if option 4 gets a lot of 2s, give it a 4. Doing a full vote right down the line will have the effect of strengthening Alternative 1 vis-a-vis 3 or whatever. Just voting for 1 and stopping actually weakens it against its rivals if everyone <i>else</i> votes down the line, because while their opposition to different alternatives is recorded, by stopping at 1 your's isn't. That is why though very popular Alternative 1 is being beaten. Remember the winner won't be decided by who has more votes for, but which faces the least opposition. <i>Slán</i> <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">00:13, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<p>Hello Alex. It appears you sent me a message about this earlier, but due to some strange deficiency in my IRC software I only saw it when I disconnected. The helpful facility you are after is called godmode-light and is detailed <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I came across it because it was mentioned on the village pump some time ago. I don't think anyone there condemned its use, but it was said by some people that anyone using it should follow the rule for admin rollback which is to use it only to revert vandalism, and not in content disputes (it doesn't allow you to fill in an edit summary explaining the revert). To use it you just add <code>document.write('&lt;SCRIPT SRC="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/godmode-light.js"&gt;&lt;\/SCRIPT&gt;');</code> to your monobook.js, and rollback links will magically appear in the appropriate places. It is not brilliant by the way, and sometimes fails when the servers are running slowly, but overall I found it a helpful tool. I don't think it is actually secret, it's just not talked about too much so as to avoid broadcasting its existence to the hordes of marauding vandals. <small>(But, of course, it doesn't really exist, and even if it did you wouldn't have heard about it from me....

<p>There is nothing impolite about using standard English words for things. The standard word for transsexual is transsexual. You can't just rename things because you feel like it. I have never seen the word "cissexual" and nor has (hardly) anyone else. We can do without yet more euphemisms and neologisms at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:12, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah yes I know this game of sexual politics more-politically-correct-than-thou. Every six months new and ever-more-esoteric words are invented for everything to do with sexuality and gender, and anyone who objects is a bigot homophobe hatemonger etc etc. OK darling have it your own way. This old fag has better things to do than argue with you. Happy gender confusion. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:36, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexR_Archive_05_2006_38a5.html" title="Edit section: LGBT">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LGBT</span></h2>
<p>I apologize if my judgement was in error on a couple of articles, but my purpose was simply cleaning up the way some people use <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a> as a catchall even for topics that are <i>already</i> filed in LGBT subcategories. Under Wikipedia's stated policy of category management, the number of categories on an article needs to always be kept to the minimum possible number, and an article should <i>never</i> be simultaneously filed in a specific subcategory <i>and</i> the master category that the subcategory belongs to.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> (one of your reversions) doesn't <i>need</i> to be -- and under Wikipedia policy, really <i>can't</i> be -- in both <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a> and the subcategory <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_orientation_8771.html" title="Category:Sexual orientation">Category:Sexual orientation</a>. One or the other is sufficient, and the <i>only</i> thing I did to that article was to remove the LGBT category; it was <i>already</i> filed in both of the other subcats. And most of the other articles you reverted are already filed under "transgender-related topics", which is <i>also</i> subcategorized under LGBT already. As for <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_ISIS_Survey_dedc.html" title="1983 ISIS Survey">1983 ISIS Survey</a>, I simply typed the wrong category by mistake; my actual intention was to file it under <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_history_48fb.html" title="Category:LGBT history">Category:LGBT history</a>.</p>
<p>Some people seem to think "LGBT" needs to act as a one-stop master list of all LGBT-related topics regardless of where else they're filed, but that's not how categories work or what they're meant to be doing.</p>
<p>And, for the record, it hardly constitutes "widespread changes getting pushed through without proper debate". One doesn't <i>have</i> to debate following Wikipedia policy on category management. The angry tone you took on my talk page is neither an appreciated or an appropriate response to the matter, particularly since I'm almost singlehandedly responsible for the T being <i>in</i> most of the category names in the <i>first</i> place, and I will not even acknowledge any future discussion from you that strikes that tone again.</p>
<p>Later update: I see you also reverted <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe_8.html" title="Tribe 8">Tribe 8</a>. For one thing, <b>one does not have to announce a category change before making it</b>; the assertion that an unannounced change should be reverted just for being unannounced is utter bullcrap. But, since you want to know, here was why I made the changes I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>The category "punk rock groups" is <i>redundant</i> with category "later punk groups"; going back to the stuff about subcategory vs. master category, it's a one-or-the-other case, not both.</li>
<li>Tribe 8 is not an individual; it's a band. "Gay, lesbian or bisexual people" is for <i>individuals</i>. This change does <i>not</i> remove them from a queer context, as they're still filed under "LGBT musicians".</li>
<li>The band should be sorted as "Tribe 8" under the letter T, not as "8, Tribe" under the number 8.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and by the way...the next time you want to accuse me of thoughtlessness, you might want to take a gander at the description of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_orientation_and_identity_c5f0.html" title="Category:Sexual orientation and identity">Category:Sexual orientation and identity</a> before you start typing: <i>The category is for articles that have to do with sexual orientation, sexual identity, labels, <b>and gender identity</b>.</i> So if you think that's wrong or offensive, take it up with the person who wrote that. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I fail to understand where you get the notion that the category <i>is</i> conflating "sexual identity" with "gender identity". Where in anything connected to the category is there even the <i>suggestion</i> that anybody thinks transgender is a <i>sexual</i> identity? The category title doesn't say that. The category description didn't say that. I genuinely fail to grasp how you're interpreting "identity" as inherently meaning "sexual identity" to the exclusion of any other meaning of the word, when the category quite explicitly distinguished two distinct concepts of "sexual identity" and "gender identity", and <i>nothing</i> implied that one was being subsumed into the other. And that doesn't make me a transphobic bigot or a person who should somehow "know better" than anything; it makes me a person who knows how to read what's written and not infer stuff that isn't there. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:02, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You admit that you can't tell if they're shemales, sex-change-men-to-women, or crossdressers. There are also four of them and you say you don't know for every one.

<dd>Actually, you have been reverting for the sake of reverting. I reverted you once because you used invalid logic. You edited it three times.

<p>I'm thinking of the reader who has not the foggiest idea what's going on. Rather than making them click on 5 links (yes, it's 5, you removed any reference to bi-sexuality twice now), seems harsh. Instead, the <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBTI_75dc.html" title="LGBTI">LGBTI</a> article gives them a nice, short reference to everything they need to know, via a decent article and many citations to other articles. Everything you wanted to list is there plus much more. If you are really hung up on expanding the accronym, then please do so as such: <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI)</a>, which is the correct expansion, and would still point to the one article which has all of the appropriate info (note: if you're going to go that way, there's no need to reference the redirect at <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBTI_75dc.html" title="LGBTI">LGBTI</a>, just go straight (er... well) to <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a>, since the name of the link doesn't show anyway). -Harmil</p>

<dd><b>Reproducing your comment from my talk page</b>: First of all, I would appreciate if you would sign your entries like the one on my talk page; that way, I don't have to go through the history to answer you. Second, I don't think that linking to LGBT is the way to go here, since lots of people probably won't know what that is - lots more people will at least recognise some of the expanded words, though. If you are really worried about bisexual people (who are nowhere else mentioned in the article) then add that word, and don't just revert to the acronym. Not to mention that the article that it links to references intersex people rather sparingly; they are rather important at this place, though. So kindly stop this mindless reverting, since it is nothing but ill thought-through reverting for reverting's sake by now. I may also add that I just restored the previous version, so if you want any changes, change it to something that makes sense at this point. -- AlexR 06:09, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, forgetting the signature was just an oversight, sorry. It seems that you didn't read what I actually wrote, above and are simply replying to the subject, since you conflate "linking to LGBT" with people knowing what the acronym means. To re-quote what I wrote: "<i>If you are really hung up on expanding the accronym, then please do so as such: <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI)</a>, which is the correct expansion, and would still point to the one article which has all of the appropriate info</i>". As for "reverting for reverting's sake", I was not. You changed my use of "LGBTI" to a less-complete collection of words, some of which ("intersex" and "transgender") would be just as unknown to the majority of readers, while removing the reference to bisexuality (I take personal offense at that one), and when I restored my change with a comment to indicate why, you again reverted it. Please, do not accuse me of "reverting for reverting's sake" when you are removing content and context from a page. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 10:48, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I specifically will assume that you are approaching this with the same degree of good faith that I am, and feel that you have explained yourself fully. I, on the other hand, do not understand your concerns fully yet. I see you get frustrated when I ask for details, and I suspect that this is just a difference in the way we approach problem solving. Please, assume that I honestly do not yet understand your concerns, and that your explanations have not made them clear to me (no fault there, just different ways of explaining one's self and learning). Please return to the discussion and help me to develop a clear understanding. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 17:03, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is very little on the Internet or on Wikipedia about Homosexuality in non-Western cultures, including India. I was wondering if you would like to contribute towards creating a detailed article about Homosexuality in India, one that discusses historical, literary, cultural and religious attitudes towards homosexuality, as well as the current situation. I know for a fact that India has a significant LGBT community, though a lot of it is underground. I wrote the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights_in_India_fdeb.html" title="Gay rights in India">Gay rights in India</a>.

<dd>Hi there. Just wanted to offer some advice for this. This kind of thing can happen when:
<ul>
<li>Your browser settings force a particular character set (e.g. iso-latin-1)</li>
<li>You do your editing in an external application which uses a non-UTF8 character set.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can check your browser preferences ("options" in Windows parlance) for character encoding. In Firefox, I use View-&gt;Character Encoding and select "Unicode (UTF-8)".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other applications that you may edit in probably have similar controls. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 15:18, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the hint - for some reason, jEdit, which I use with the WP plug-in, decided today that it didn't like special characters any more. I noticed a bit later, and I think I have corrected everything, but that is indeed annoying. I'll check for that in the next time, to be sure. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 15:28, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex, I generally do not stand on little particulars, but your modification of "warp and woof" gains nothing and, as it somewhat vague, loses the sense that the two loves were complementary <i>and</i> integral to male experience. I also am not sure that it is more encylopaedic to favor dry formulations over more expressive ones, within reason. As for the accuracy of the statement, it is not my opinion (alone) but the consensus of the classics. It stands out in the writings of many, if not all, such as Plutarch, Lucian, the poets (both Greek and Roman) and so forth. Oh yes, and in the mythology too. Can you please find an alternative formulation, or even better, leave mine. It is anything <i>but</i> archaic.

<dd>Was I harsh? I speak more freely to friends, and I welcome it in return. Interesting, that "warp and woof" was not recognized. I'll second your edit based on that, I would have imagined that it is a phrase intelligible to anyone. Goes to show you that it is not good to be too much inside one's own head.

<p>Somehow, you decided I was one of "them" (I'm really not even sure which "them") back when we tangled over heteronormativity, and you clearly carried the idea along to LGBT and Sexual characteristics. Your insults have been rather scathing ranging from calling me "stupid" to insulting my work to saying that I clearly had "too much time on my hands" (seems a counter-productive desire to want editors with <i>less</i> time available). I've tried several times to bury the hatchet, but you have had none of it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that you would accept that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't hold a grudge against you (my comment about "personal offense" was ill considered, and was not intended to convey a sense that I was upset with you, only with being a member of a group which is so easily discounted).</li>
<li>I agree with you in many things, though I think you feel more strongly than I do in many cases.</li>
<li>I'm not trying to inject a POV into anything on WP, rather quite the opposite.</li>
<li>While I don't agree with your doctor friend on the nature of modern medicine and science, I do agree with the assessment that heteronormative structures present a difficult hurdle for LGBTI people, and that's unfortunate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, there's not much I can do to contribute to Wikipedia in areas where my every edit will be reverted, and given the speed with which you and I could have put together <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_characteristics.html" title="Sexual characteristics">Sexual characteristics</a> if we could work <i>together</i>... well, it's even more sad.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future you will bear these things in mind and perhaps cut me a bit more slack, as I have tried to do for you (and will continue to do so).</p>

<p>Hi, Alex,</p>
<p>I have been monitoring the article on Atypical gender identity. There is some pressure to either improve it or to merge it elsewhere. I believe it was originally spun off from the gender identity and gender role areas because some people were uncomfortable with depicting G-I/Rs that were not the vanilla varieties. Probably that was a wise decision since the original articles contained absurdities on even the vanilla stuff and it was more important to fight those fights and put the even harder to get clear on somewhere else. (Boys naturally prefer blue, they claimed. I naturally preferred green as a child and I naturally prefer orange as an adult, so what does that make me? No, don't answer that.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>As I have time, I'm going to put a brief description of Hijra and any other examples I can find where there are clear "mixed elements" in the clothing and behavior. I figure you probably have lots more examples in mind just reading this note.</p>
<p>One of the strange (to me) requests was that there be section headings -- despite the fact that the article is now very short. So I will put in a major section marker for "Examples" and minor ones for Hijra, Xanith, etc. Since there are major articles already, all these sections need to do is refer readers to the other articles and then give a paragraph or so in which we highlight the specific social signals that go along with the and announce the gender identities or that would create the false impression of a gender identity if someone accidentally used the wrong clothing, e.g., picking up a jacket that buttoned on the wrong side, work boots of the "wrong" color, etc.</p>
<p>Since the title involves identity rather than role, it's going to be a little tricky to get a correct characterization of what it feels like to be a xanith. What makes a person recognize e is a xanith? Have xaniths written about their experience of self? Or do we have to depend on some anthropologist's account?</p>
<p>I think this article could really be useful to people trying to understand "the other."</p>

<dd>You will find an awful lot of misspellings, some of them even more common than the proper spelling. So your point was?</dd>
<dd>Transgender was from the beginning used as both an adjective and a noun. Only a few years ago this abomination of "transgender<i>ed</i>" turned up, without any reason for its existance but pseudo-grammar like "thou shall not split thy infinitive". It is not only unnecessary, it also sounds like a passive - whenever I hear that somebody is transgender<i>ed</i> it makes me want to ask who did that to that poor fellow. Which is the reason that no matter how many actual usages of the word you turn up, as far as I am concerned, this is not a word, but an abomination. So you might wish to turn your attention to other matters now. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 08:56, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I was wondering if you would like to participate in my classic rock survey. I'm trying to find the most like classic rock song. There is more information on my user page.

<p>Hi! Please put on your userpage a babel template indicating what languages you can speak. Read <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">Wikipedia:Babel</a> for more. This could help immensly by helping to find people who can speak a certain laguage fluently. Please consier putting it on your userpage, even at the end of it, if it looks "ugly". It helps.

<p>Why have you reverted the correction of "India" to "Indonesia"? Columbus was headed for the East Indies, specifically the Moluccas, not for India as we now use that term. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 12:52, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One thing I have noticed in this article is that some sections use "transsexuality" and others "transsexualism". I think it would be better to use one term consistently within the article. I have considered renaming the article as "transsexualism", as that seems to be the term in widest use, but I felt like I needed to discuss this change with others before making it. I also left a note about this on the article's talk page, but no one has replied there, so I am asking users who I know have made significant contributions to this article.</p>

<p>Hi Alex, I see that you made a few more edits to this article. Some of them were excellent. I fixed a few typos you made and reworded a few things for clarity; I know you're not a native speaker of English and so I don't blame you for making these mistakes. I removed your statement "This however is not quite compatible with the definition of transgender" as it is unclear what "this" refers to and this statement does not seem NPOV. I also removed a few other statements you added that seemed to border on POV. And you changed a couple of things that I didn't revert, even though I don't particularly agree with them. For one, you edited the opening paragraph to state that a transsexual person "wishes to" establish a permanent identity with the gender opposite their assigned sex. Well, the latter part of this sentence may be unclear to some readers and should perhaps be rephrased to "as a member of the gender opposite their assigned sex". Well, that aside, I really think it is more factually accurate to state that a transsexual person establishes an identity as one of "the opposite sex" than that they wish to. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_identity.html" title="Gender identity">Gender identity</a> is how one sees them self; it has nothing to do with how they present themselves or are seen by others. I, for one, am still in transition and not living as a woman full-time; many people who see me relate to me as a male, but I identify as a woman. That said, I don't think the phrase is any more or less <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> either way. Please explain your reasoning for this edit.</p>
<p>You also added "This however has its own considerable health risks" in reference to the statement that some transpeople obtain hormones from black market sources. I have already reworded this statement slightly, but it seems kind of redundant given that the section on hormone replacement therapy already stated that HRT had risks and that it was considered inadvisable to take hormones without a physician's supervision. Do you think there is a reason for this to be stated twice?</p>

<p>Hello. (Sorry for the form letter) In my various travels in Wikipedia, I have run across your name as someone who takes an active interest in <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> articles. This is an invitation to check out a new project: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_LGBT_studies_685a.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject LGBT studies">Wikipedia:Wikiproject LGBT studies</a>. The initial goal is to create an within Wikipedia a unicversity-level academic-quality reference encyclopedia for LGBT and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer_Studies_a7e7.html" title="Queer Studies">Queer Studies</a>-related topics. The goal is two fold: 1. bring as many as possible up to Featured Article quality, and 2. prove that LGBT-related topics are as academically relevant to WP as other anthropology subsets. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 21:59, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
