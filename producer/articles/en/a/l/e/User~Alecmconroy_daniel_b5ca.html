<p>Traditionally, the book of Daniel was believed to have been written by its namesake during and shortly after the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_captivity.html" title="Babylonian captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> in the sixth century BC. In this point of view, the book is a work of divinely-inspired prophecy which correctly predicts book's content and world events for at least 400 years after its original composition. Many interpretations hold that some of the prophecies of Daniel will be fulfilled during a future period known as the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_times.html" title="End times">End Times</a>.</p>
<p>The 6th-century prophet theory of authorship is held by most conservative Christian, Orthodox Jewish scholars, and others who believe in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">inerrancy of the Bible</a>.</p>

<p>The consensus of modern scholars is that <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textual_criticism.html" title="Textual criticism">textual criticism</a> argue for a considerably later date. In this view, some, if not all, of the book was written around 165 BC. According to these scholars, the Book of Daniel is is <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphy.html" title="Pseudepigraphy">pseudepigraphical</a>-- written by an anonymous author who falsely claimed to be the historical figure Daniel. This theory of authorship suggests that the second-century author gave the book the appearance of having been written some 400 years earlier in order to establish credibility by including correct "predictions" of numerous historical events which had occurred during the fifth to second centuries BC.</p>

<p>A third alternative is that the book had multiple authors-- some parts of the book being composed as late as the second century, while other portions could possibly be several centuries older.</p>
<p>John Collins finds it impossible for the "court tales" portion of Daniel to have been written in second Century BC due to textual analysis. In his <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary</i> entry for the Book of Daniel, he states "it is clear that the court-tales in chapters 1-6 were 'not written in Maccabean times'. It is not even possible to isolate a single verse which betrays an editorial insertion from that period." Some scholars disagree with this, and still date this section to the Maccabean revolt along with the vision chapters.</p>

<p>Most interpreters find that references in the <i>Book of Daniel</i> reflect the persecutions of Israel by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes_2f84.html" title="Antiochus IV Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> (175â€“<a href="../../../1/6/4/164_BC_4ea3.html" title="164 BC">164 BC</a>), and consequently date its composition to that period. In particular, the vision in Chapter 11, which focuses on a series of wars between the "King of the North" and the "King of the South," is generally interpreted as a discussion of Near Eastern history from the time of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> down the era of Antiochus IV, with the "Kings of the North" being the Seleucid kings and the "Kings of the South" being the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt. This conclusion was first drawn by the philosopher <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porphyry_of_Tyros_77a8.html" title="Porphyry of Tyros">Porphyry of Tyros</a>, a third century <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoplatonism.html" title="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonist</a> whose fifteen-volume work <i>Against the Christians</i> is only known to us through <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>'s reply. Jerome accepted much (but not all) of Porphyry's interpretation of the vision, but held to the traditional view of Daniel's date and held that the similarities to actual history were due to Daniel's being a true prophet, rather than to a late date for the book. Porphyry, then, was the only known critic to doubt Daniel's early date until the seventeenth century. Many historians hold that the book was written to influence Jews living under Antiochus' persecution. They believe that the events described in the visions match well the events during the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Maccabean.html" title="Maccabean">Maccabean</a> era while the book errs on major points of Babylonian history.</p>

<p>Most biblical scholars assume that the four kingdoms beginning with Nebuchadnezzar, mentioned in the "<a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebuchadnezzar%27s_statue_vision_in_Daniel_2_287b.html" title="Nebuchadnezzar's statue vision in Daniel 2">statue vision</a>" of chapter 2, are identical to the four "end-time" kingdoms of the vision in chapter 7, and usually consider them to represent (1) Babylonia, (2) Media, (3) Persia, and (4) Greece (Collins). Some conservative Christians identify them as (1) Babylonia, (2) "Medo-Persia," (3) Greece, and (4) Rome (e.g. Young); others (e.g. Stuart, Lagrange) have advocated the following schema: (1) the Neo-Babylonian, (2) the Medo-Persian, (3) the Greek empire of Alexander, and (4) the rival <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diadochi.html" title="Diadochi">Diadochi</a>, viz. Egypt and Syria.</p>

<p>The final major area of debate regarding the dating of Daniel regards the language used. The two reference points used for dating the Aramaic are the Samaria correspondence (4th century BC) and the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> (2nd century BC-1st century AD). According to John Collins in his 1993 commentary, <i>Daniel, Hermennia Commentary</i>, the Aramaic in Daniel is almost universally held by scholars to be of a later form than that used in the Samaria correspondence, but is regarded by many as slightly earlier than the form used in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Consequently the Aramaic tales in chapters 2-6 are held by some to have been written earlier in the Hellenistic period than the rest of the book, with the vision in chapter 7 being the only Aramaic portion dating to the time of Antiochus. The Hebrew in the book is, for all intents and purposes, identical to that found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, suggesting a second century BC date for the Hebrew portions of the book (chapters 1 and 8-12). <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/3/013mail.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/3/013mail.html" rel="nofollow">2</a></p>

<p>There are three Greek words used within the text which have long been considered evidence for a late dating of Daniel. All three Greek words are used for musical instruments. The existence of the Greek word 'symphonia' was cited by Rowlings as having its earliest use in second century BC, but modern scholarship now knows its use much earlier, both in the sense of a specific instrument and as a term referring to a group of instruments playing in unison. Pythagoras used the term to denote an instrument in sixth century BC, while its use to refer to a group performing together is found in the sixth century BC 'Hymni Homerica, ad Mercurium 51' Despite their early use in Greek however, there is no evidence for the use of these instruments in Mesopotamia in the Neo-Babylonian period where they are said to be used in Daniel, and their mention in the book is generally taken as an anachronism.</p>
<p>There are also nineteen Persian loan-words in the book, most of them having to do with governmental positions.</p>

<p>The book of Daniel uses the term "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldea.html" title="Chaldea">Chaldean</a>" to refer both to a Babylonian ethnic group and to astrologers in general. According to Montgomery and Hammer, Daniel's use of the word 'Chaldean' to refer to astrologers in general is an anachronism, as during the Neo-Babylonian and early Persian periods when Daniel is said to have lived it referred only to an ethnicity. Compare the later <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_Oracles_60ea.html" title="Chaldean Oracles">Chaldean Oracles</a>.</p>
