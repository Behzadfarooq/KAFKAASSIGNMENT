<p>I have added information about the current application to upgrade the listing, which has been made partly because of the possibility that potential developers, Firoka, may demolish the BBC studios in the south-east wing, according to local newspaper reports. The linked Independent article gives the story. Also brief information about how it became a charitable trust in 1900, to safeguard it from just such development. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStraw_Cat_64a1.html" title="User:Straw Cat">Straw Cat</a> 02:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A sign at the wall of the palace also notes that the palace was used as prison during world war 1. It was set as to remember German prisoners and especially those who died in the prison. I wasn't able to find any information about this on the web. 27 May 2006</p>

<dd>I think it's in one of the local history books, possibly Gay - almost certainly Hornsey Hist Soc stuff I <i>think</i>. There is a splendid German Christmas card from something like 1916 or 1917 showing a jolly London bobby directing Santa to the PoW camp - this was made I think by German PoWs to send home. Also, either local folklore or the history books (or both) say that an avenue of trees, perhaps Dr Johnson's Walk, I'm not sure, was replanted by the PoWs during WWI. I hope they enjoyed it up there - I don't think they were badly treated and while not as nice as being at home I imagine it was a very much better bet than being in the trenches. If I can find something more referencable than my random wafflings, I may add it to the article.&#160;:) 138.37.199.206 14:02, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexandra_Palace_35cf.html" title="Edit section: Ally Pally is in Muswell Hill">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ally Pally is in Muswell Hill</span></h2>
<p>I am astonished that someone has seen fit to allege once more that Ally Pally is in Wood Green. It is not, it is in Muswell Hill. It is not possible to make this error if you have actually been there. Their last comment was "Alexandra Palace offically comes under Wood Green, N22= NOT Muswell Hill, Which is N10." Rubbish, I am afraid. What does it mean it "officially comes under"? Who says? Under WHAT does if "offically come" and who "offically" put it there? No-one.</p>
<p>It has an N22 postcode but let's have a think about what that means - ah yes, it means it has an N22 postcode. That's all. Nothing further can be inferred from it. Just like lots of other places round here. There is NO big blue line on the ground in reality that says "end of Muswell Hill, beginning of Wood Green" just around where N10 turns into N22. This approach is so sadly naive it makes me want to weep. Oh yes, and the Palace puts Wood Green in their address. Does this have any meaning? No. Royal Mail does not require that element of the address, it's just someone at the Palace being stupid and proves nothing. If you do not believe me put the postcode into Royal Mail's Address Finder - does it mention Wood Green? No.</p>
<p>Ally Pally being in Muswell Hill - or rather, on it - is a geographical fact. If you ever came here you would know this - it's on a rather large hill-like thing called Muswell Hill, right next door to Muswell Hill's town centre, and is nowhere near the quite separate entity some distance away called Wood Green. And how about some of the Victorian references to Ally Pally cited in the article - how about this one: <a href="http://www.victorianlondon.org/buildings/alexandrapalace.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.victorianlondon.org/buildings/alexandrapalace.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.victorianlondon.org/buildings/alexandrapalace.htm</a> - gosh! They all seem to think it was built in Muswell Hill, and they don't seem to think it's in Wood Green. How strange. Sorry to go on about it but I will not allow this error to be made as it just misleads people, so I will be watching the article and correcting it every time someone who knows nothing about the subject or area reintroduces their mistaken belief. Let's stick to the geographical facts please and not speculation about what it "comes under"! <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.45.248.177.html" title="User:82.45.248.177">82.45.248.177</a> 14:52, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have noticed that the location has just changed to Wood Green, may I suggest that we say it is located between Muswell Hill and Wood Green? This is what the <a href="http://www.alexandrapalace.com/location.html" class="external text" title="http://www.alexandrapalace.com/location.html" rel="nofollow">offical website</a> says. Hopefully this will avoid this stupid argument!

<dd>Please don't change topic headers, it's confusing and unhelpful. Now: I *love* it when people tell me it's a "stupid argument" and that "I need to chill" - please do it some more, it has a wonderful effect on me!&#160;:) Yes, the article changed to Wood Green again but since the person who does it refuses even to discuss it I just treat it as vandalism. Edit edit edit - gone! And indeed will continue to do so - oh dear, is that stupid and unchilled of me? Tsk! &lt;slap!&gt; No, I can't accept your suggestion, as it's - er - wrong. I did deal with all this up there ^ somewhere but you were too chilled and unstupid to read it.&#160;:) And frankly I don't care what the official website says. Firstly, it's strange but some people round here have doubts about their competence in certain fields: I could not possibly comment. Secondly, it is sensible to mention Wood Green when you are trying to get people to come to your lovely venue, as there is a jolly splendid tube station there. But this does not alter the geographical facts. I hope this is stupid enough for you: I am off to chill, or possible have a coronary!&#160;:) <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.45.248.177.html" title="User:82.45.248.177">82.45.248.177</a> 17:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
