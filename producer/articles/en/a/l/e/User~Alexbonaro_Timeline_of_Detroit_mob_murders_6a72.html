	    <p>A little while back someone posted this great list about Detroit mob murders from the 1940s to now, and maybe mcscott or anyone else can give some feedback on it. Here it is:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I've spent the last few years researching the Detroit mob very closely with a particular emphasis on probable and possible mob murders. Below is a list of mob murders, deaths, accidents, and suicides post 1940 connected to Detroit. The ones with asterisks are ones I'm not particularly confident in, but the others I stand by. I wondered if anyone who pays attention to Detroit disagreed with me on any, or wanted to comment on, or if anyone had any that they'd like to add to my list. I've periodically posted my list before on the previous forum and I'm always looking for good discussion. So here's my list with some very brief descriptions:</p>
<p><br />

<p>2001: John Jarjosa Jr. Son of recently imprisoned man who was an associate of Detroit mob.</p>
<p>2002: Vincent F. Meli. Found in Pacific ocean. Probably an accident.**</p>
<p>Then there are nameless possible murders. The ten unknown possible victims of Central Sanitation. Vito Giacalone told someone that they had bumped off a couple of loan sharks who hadn't listened in the 1960s. In Last Mafioso Fratianno relates a story of Frank Bompensiero killing an unnamed man for Detroit mobsters probably in the 1960s. The way its described it sounds like the Salvatore Vitale murder, but the timeframe doesn't seem to fit. Anthony Giacalone was recorded talking about a murder he participated in in the 1940s that involved transporting a strangled body to Wyandotte, but we don't know who he was talking about. In 1974 top numbers operator and good friend of the Giacalones Louis "Rip" Koury was kidnapped by some black numbers operators. Koury was released, and the Detroit Free Press reported that several of the kidnappers wound up murdered, but I haven't found any information other than that one reference. According to FBI documents a California man was called to Detroit for a meeting in 1962 with Black Bill Tocco and the FBI was unable to locate him afterward. There are a few others that are even more questionable than the ones I've marked as the ones I'm not sure of. But I'll hold off on those. Anyway, I'd like to get some people's opinions. Thanks!</p>
