<p>The In Popular Culture sections of this article appear to be <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">trivia</a>; as such I plan to delete them when I get home tonight, unless there are struenuous objections, or unless someone is willing to revise as per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html#Miscellaneous_content_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history#Miscellaneous content guidelines</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeadGoat_cfa7.html" title="User:UnDeadGoat">UnDeadGoat</a> 16:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have removed the following information, becasue it is for the most part trivial, and was only a smattering of facts rather than an integration into meaningful text.02:24, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry I did not see this in time to object; I would have been less sweeping. The list of Alexandrias should exist, here or elsewhere, and be linked to; some of the novels are worth keeping; and some of the rest of this should be See Alsos. <a href="../../../j/c/s/User%7EJCScaliger_7ada.html" title="User:JCScaliger">JCScaliger</a> 03:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My problem with the Alexandrias is that this article is extremely long, and it's just a list; if there is a paragraph within the text that can be made that talks about him as a city founder, followed by the cities, that would make more sense than just having the cities as part of a collection of stuff people felt important to add to the bottom. Also, if the novels can be coherently incorporated into the "Legacy" material, as opposed to part of a list that also includes every song a Wikipedian likes with Alexander the Great in it, that would be good as well. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeadGoat_cfa7.html" title="User:UnDeadGoat">UnDeadGoat</a> 15:27, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>By selecting the right angle of the streets, Alexander made the city breathe with the etesian winds [the northwestern winds that blow during the summer months], so that as these blow across a great expanse of sea, they cool the air of the town, and so he provided its inhabitants with a moderate climate and good health. Alexander also laid out the walls so that they were at once exceedingly large and marvelously strong.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Robin Lane-Fox</span></h2>
<p>I find it to be a little unbalanced to have Robin Lane-Fox as an authority on Alexander the Great on this page, at least in regards to Alexander's personal life. His own biography stub contains a link in which he made a controversial homophobic remark, which I feel casts some doubt on his assertions about Alexander concerning Haephestion and Bagoas. If there is to be a source that is doubtful of these relationships, it should not be him at the very least. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.43.113.2 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.43.113.2.html" title="User talk:69.43.113.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.43.113.2_f658.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.43.113.2">contribs</a>) 09:20, October 11, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Robin Lane Fox is one of the foremost Alexander scholars writing in English. I read the linked story, and his remarks don't seem offensive to me (I haven't heard them in context, however). At any rate, I don't see how this casts any doubt on what he says about Alexander, and in fact, if you read the quotes on this talk page, he says that Alexander probably had sexual relationships with men, and that this was normal in ancient Greece. If he were a homophobe, wouldn't he say the opposite? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:23, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may be correct in your opinion of Fox, but what's really important for the purposes of this article is whether <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have criticized his scholarship for bias. If so, we can note that. If not, it really doesn't fall under Wikipedia's purview to make judgments of that sort — as Akhilleus says, Fox is one of the foremost Alexander scholars writing in English, and it would be remiss of us to exclude him from this article based on a passing remark on a gardening programme. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 16:00, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Christ I'm so sick of people taking it for granted that homosexuality was so common and accepted everywhere in ancient Greece just because some twat found an urn with a gay motive. If I paint a gay painting and hide it does that mean were all gay? 0.01 % or less (no kidding) of all the urns found show homosexuality. Yet hollywood has made it look like it was more like 99.9 %. There are books that say it was common and books that say it wasn't.

<dd>I think it's time to seek some form of dispute resolution. I already tried an RfC on this issue, but that got nowhere because of the rampant sockpuppetry going on at the time. I'm not sure where else to turn. It seems to me that there are a few related issues here (this is my statement of the issues, and not necessarily a neutral one):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1)The "personal life" section in the article is written to make it seem as if no ancient sources or modern scholars think that Alexander had sexual relationships with men, when several ancient sources imply that he did, and at least two modern scholars, Robin Lane Fox and Paul Cartledge, believe that Alexander had same-sex relationships (as was typical then). Both scholars are quoted on this talk page, with references. The article is especially misleading in that it quotes Fox in a way that misrepresents his views.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2)Even though the "personal life" section is written in a biased way, WP readers who are interested in the topic of ancient Greek (homo)sexuality might be interested in reading it. It would be appropriate to have some category in the article to help those readers find the section. Several categories have been proposed: LGBT people from Greece, Greek pederasty, Greek homosexuality. Despite some editors' objections, both Greek pederasty and Greek homosexuality are terms that are widely used in scholarship, and when properly understood are not anachronistic. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 02:38, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree for the very good points raised by Apro in his above comments. Placing sexual orientation categories in biographies for ancient peoples, particular when the facts are not clear and disputed, is not warrented since none of the ancients identified with modern LGB categories and nowhere are we told that Alexander participated in pederasty relationships. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a> 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Quotation_from_Robin_Lane_Fox" id="Quotation_from_Robin_Lane_Fox"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Quotation from Robin Lane Fox</span></h2>
<p>The "personal life" section quotes Robin Lane Fox in a way that is misleading. The article currently quotes Fox as someone who questions whether there was a sexual relationship between A. and Hephaistion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This assertion of a sexual relationship between Alexander and Hephaiston is questioned by some historians. Robin Lane Fox writes that while "later gossip claimed that Alexander had a love affair with Hephaestion", no contemporary history states this. However, Fox adds, "the facts show that the two men’s friendship was exceptionally deep and close." Following Hephaestion's death, Alexander mourned him greatly, and did not eat for days.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But here's the full quote from Fox's <i>The Search for Alexander</i>, pp. 67-68: "Among the Pages, one name stands out, the Hephaistion with whom later gossip claimed that Alexander had a love affair. No contemporary history states this, but the facts show that the two men's friendship was exceptionally deep and close. Contemporaries called Hephaistion the Patroclus to Alexander's Achilles, the Homeric friendship which men of Alexander's age assumed to have a sexual element. Later, Alexander planned his court marriages so that Hephaistion's children should be his own nephews, a special honor. When Hephaistion died prematurely, Alexander's grief burst all lesser limits. There is much gossip about his mourning, but a hard core attests its scale. There is no doubting Alexander's normal affairs with women at the same time. It is probably mere rumor that he once refused a woman whom his parents had tried to force on him. Most sane young men, anyway, would have followed suit. But an affair with a man of similar age was quite accepted in Greek society. The topic was viewed with a charming inconsistency. Old or excessive homosexuals were disliked, but young men could love and learn from each other without social disapproval. The custom ran deep in Greek culture, fed, perhaps, by the small role which many fathers played in their young sons' lives. Among Macedonian kings, the love of boys was nothing unusual. But only the contemporary pamphleteer Theopompus claimed mischievously that the whole court at Pella was mad for it, beards and all."</p>
<p>Fox doesn't say that A. had a sexual relationship with Hephaistion, but says that it would have been normal if he had; clearly, he believes that A. and Hephaistion might have been lovers. This opinion is similar to the opinion he expresses in the <i>Archaeology</i> interview, quoted above. In his book <i>Alexander the Great</i> Fox is more definite: "At the age of thirty Alexander was still Hephaistion's lover although most young Greeks would have grown out of the fashion by then and an older man would have given up or turned to a young attraction." Fox has never expressed any serious doubt that Alexander and Hephaistion were lovers, and in fact has said that they likely were. I'd say that the article's distortion of Fox's views is a good example of suppression of information. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 20:33, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article did not suppress information, it gave accounts on both sides of the issue and showed how uncertain the whole matter is by scholars. It quoted Fox's own words, if anything the article suppresses and takes more of a one sided view now. Fox plainly states that most of this theory is based on late gossip and not with contemporaries accounts, which he follows up with that hint on the matter regarding the "close friendship" comment, as if that is evidence of anything. Fox uses the term <b>assume</b> when he talks about any supposed "Homeric sexual friendship relationship", meaning its still not known for certain. Plus not one of our ancient historians on Alexander ever use the terms <i>eromenos</i> or <i>erastes</i> which some translate to means "lover" to describe either Alexander or Hephaistion. If as some theorizes that such a Homeric "sexual" friendships were the norm of ancient Greece, why would these ancient historians, who's work most late authors base their material on, omitte in adding this little fact if its true as Fox and some other modern historians claim that Alexander's "romatic physical" feeling were so strong for Hephaistion? Fox states very clearly what was written originally in the article and it is by his own admission that he says this, he was not misquoted. What I do find interesting though is the fact that you omitted Fox's own quote of:<b>"No contemporary history states this, but the facts show that the two men's friendship was exceptionally deep and close."</b> for a more one sided view in trying to portray some sort of sexual relationship between the two being is certain when in fact it was not, again its Fox's own words that state this even when he trys to justify some sort of physichal relationship when not contemporary historian ever says this. <a href="../../../a/p/r/User%7EApro_77cd.html" title="User:Apro">Apro</a> 12 October 2006</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of having 3 different quotes from Fox, I have rephrased the beginning sentence of the paragraph to read: "No contemporary source states that Alexander and Hephaistion were lovers." which is equivalent to the quote "No contemporary history states this,..." The last sentence of the paragraph now reads "Alexander and Hephaistion remained, in Fox's words, 'exceptionally deep and close' friends until Hephaestion's untimely death, after which Alexander mourned him greatly, and did not eat for days." This corresponds to the quote "the facts show that the two men's friendship was exceptionally deep and close." Nothing's left out.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you can find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary source</a> that argues that the relationship of Alexander and Hephaistion was definitely not sexual, it should be included in the article. But that's not what Fox thinks. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 22:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No that is deliberate omitting and rewording Fox's personal quote to slate the article a certain way and promote one point of view. As it was said above, I find it interesting that the quote which was reworded is one of the ones which points to evidence that Alexander's supposed sexual relation is not clear. If this article is suppose to be fair and balance as it claims then his words should not be omitted. <a href="../../../a/p/r/User%7EApro_77cd.html" title="User:Apro">Apro</a> 12 October 2006</dd>

<dd>Apro, nothing from that quote that you added back in has been omitted. The paragraph begins "No contemporary historian states that Alexander were lovers" and ends "Alexander and Hephaistion remained, in Fox's words, 'exceptionally deep and close' friends". Please read the whole quote from Fox above before alleging that the article is slanting things, because I don't think there's any way you can interpret the passage as arguing against the possiblity that A. and H. had a sexual relationship. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apro, I agree with Akhilleus on this: I've got another book of Lane Fox, his biography <i>Alexander the Great</i>, in which he openly and strongly argues that the Hepaestion-Alexander relation was also sexual. This doesn't mean that Lane Fox's arguments are The Truth™; only that you can't twist his arguments so to make his views seem yours. There are historians who don't agree with Lane Fox; quote from them, opposing their povs to his pov.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:08, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
