<p>Hamilton conceived of the Federalist Papers and orchestrated their creation, recruiting Madison and Jay. Considering Hamilton also wrote the preponderance of the published tracts (well over 50%) there seems to be no justification to belittle this collective accomplishment by highlighting Madison's contributions here (he has his own Wiki entry, doesn't he?). While there is not much arguement that Madison's contributions were significant, nor is there much arguement that Hamilton's were at least equally so and, perhaps more poignently, there is still no absolute agreement as to whether is was Madison of Hamilton that wrote some of the most important entries (#51, for example). Therefore, removal of unjustified and misleading references of Madison in relation to the Federalist Papers that imply some sort of superiority should be removed.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoreranger_a8b3.html" title="User:Shoreranger">Shoreranger</a> 21:52, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree in part, and disagree in part; claiming that Madison was predominant is a POV; c;aiming that Hamilton was predominant is also a POV; this article should say neither (or both, but the place for that is <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_Papers_06c6.html" title="Federalist Papers">Federalist Papers</a>, not here). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>Hamilton proceeded to set up an army, which was to guard against invasion and march into the possessions of Spain, then allied with France, and take Louisiana and Mexico. His correspondence further suggests that when he returned in military glory, he dreamed of setting up a properly energetic government, without any Jeffersonians. Adams, however, derailed all plans for war by opening negotiations with France.[21] Adams had also held it right to retain Washington's cabinet, except for cause; he found, in 1800 (after Washington's death), that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself and fired several of them.[22]</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As for this paragraph, I don't think it's POV; the conclusion that Hamilton was considering a bold stroke after his return is Morrison and Commager's, as cited in 21; the reason Adams fired McHenry and Pickering is well-known. I sourced it to <i>ANB</i>, but I do not know of anyone who disagrees (on either point). If Shoreranger has a source, he should add and cite it. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This passage is original research from primary sources, and has the resulting flaws. It suggests, without source, that Hamilton's opposition to the French Revolution arose from its mob rule, which is clearly false: he opposed it before the reports of the May Days of 1793 reached the United States. I do not understand the intended meaning of "<b>as</b> Hamilton witnessed first hand how instrumental politically, financially, and militarily France had been in the United States securing independence through the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>". <i>As</i> cannot mean "while"; the French instrumentality ended well before Bastile Day, much less "mob rule".

<p>The article states: "He worked to defeat both John Adams and Jefferson in the election of 1800 (although he himself didn't run because he was ineligible due to being born outside the US);"</p>
<p>I'm not disputing whether he SHOULD have been president but whether or not he was constitutional barred from the presidency. I don't think he was barred.</p>
<p>The U.S Constitution, Article Two, 1.5 Clause 5: Qualifications for office, says "No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States."</p>
<p>Was not Alexander Hamilton "a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution"? He attended King's College in the 1770's (now Columbia College, Columbia University) and was an officer in the Continental Army. By my count, he would have resided in what became the United States between 15 and 20 years when the Constitution was adopted.</p>

<p>Seems to me that this section is a bit sympathetic to Burr and fails to even hint about the wealth of abundant primary sources that demonstrate Hamilton's intent to die at this duel in order to spare Burr's life. Aside from preparing his Last Will and Testament, Hamilton also wrote to his wife and friends explaining that he would not attempt to kill Burr since it went against everything he believed in.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there is no current debate among scholars on this topic, but I believe a fairer rendering of this section could be achieved to demonstrate the two views of this duel. As it currently stands, only one citation exists depicting one view, and that one basically refers to Hamilton as a liar, and this is a comment made by Burr. How unbiased and POV is that?!

<p>Hello. I am a basic Wikipedia user and like to skip through the history pages. As such, I was astonished to find absolutely nothing in Hamilton's executive summary about the famous duel that took Hamilton's life. As a student of history and casual observer of other's historical awareness, I believe the duel to be not only one of the most important parts of Hamilton's life (for obvious reasons) but also the major fact about Hamilton that the widest segment of the world's population knows about or will be looking for at Wikipedia. It's as if I arrive at Lincoln's summarizing entry and not know whether or not he died a peaceful death of old age! Aaron Burr's entry surely mentions the fact that he killed Hamilton, so shouldn't Hamilton equally have at least one sentence in his opener mentioning the fact that he was violently killed with a handgun by the then Vice President of the United States??? Just my opinion. 210.20.86.85 05:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I regret to see that my post here on Nevis did not register. I continue, however, to deprecate Shoreranger's insistence on saying that Hamilton "immigrated" to North America.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevis.html" title="Nevis">Nevis</a> is in the <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesser_Antilles_57e3.html" title="Lesser Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>; it is perverse to call it North America; it may well be closer to South America.</li>
<li>Hamilton did not "immigrate"; Nevis was a British colony, just like New Jersey. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 22:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> for what is considered in or out. "Immigration", to my understanding, applies from one colonial possession to another, say from India to Canada. If so, then Nevis to New York is just as much so. If it makes anyone feel better, change "immigrate" to "migrate", but Nevis is still in North America, "perverse" or not.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoreranger_a8b3.html" title="User:Shoreranger">Shoreranger</a> 04:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not English. <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> begins by defining ts subject as a "continent", which means a continuous body of land before it means anything else. The Lesser Antilles are not even on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Plate_8b63.html" title="North American Plate">North American Plate</a>. The Straits of Cuba are 90 miles wide. As for "immigration", Shoreranger's understanding is both wrong, and insofar as it will suggest that the Thirteen Colonies had an INS to guard against entry from Nevis or Jamaica, very seriously mioleading. Reverting on both grounds. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 17:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nevis is certainly "English" at the time. The point is to make differentiating "British North America" as specifically the 13 colonies, when Nevis was both a British colonial possession and also in North America. See <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevis.html" title="Nevis">Nevis</a>, specifically:</p>
<p>"On August 30, 1620, James I of England asserted sovereignty over Nevis by giving a Royal Patent for colonisation to the Earl of Carlisle. However actual European settlement did not happen until 1628 when Anthony Hilton moved from nearby Saint Kitts following a murder plot against him. He was accompanied by 80 other settlers, soon to be boosted by a further 100 settlers from London who had originally hoped to settle Barbuda. Hilton became the first Governor of Nevis. After the 1671 peace treaty between Spain and England, Nevis became the seat of the British colony and the Admiralty Court sat in Nevis. Between 1675 and 1730, the island was the headquarter for the slave trade for the Leeward Islands, with approximately 6,000-7,000 enslaved West Africans passing through on route to other islands each year. The Royal African Company brought all its ships through Nevis.[3]"</p>
<p><br />
Again, see <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> -- I will save you the effort and quote the most pertinent section here:</p>
<p>"There are numerous islands off the continent’s coasts: principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, the Alexander Archipelago, and the Aleutian Islands. Greenland, a Danish self-governing island and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but is an oceanic island formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and it is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent."</p>
<p>See <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_migration.html" title="Human migration">human migration</a>, since "immigration" seems to be too specific and requires nation-states and may not include migration from one colonial possession to another. No inference of an INS was reasonably infered or in the slightest bit intended.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoreranger_a8b3.html" title="User:Shoreranger">Shoreranger</a> 21:09, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Removing revert on these grounds, with correction to "migrate".</p>
<dl>
<dd>And Nevis, unlike <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenland.html" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, is not part of the North American Plate; see <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean_Plate_9fc6.html" title="Caribbean Plate">Caribbean Plate</a>. (I hope Shoreranger is not extending these innovations to Greenland, btw.; saying that Nevis is North America is merely silly; saying Greenland is can be offensive.) Since Hamilton is neither a tribe nor a bird, he didn't "migrate" either. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 20:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for the unusual requirement that Hamilton be a bird or a tribe to migrate, again, please see <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_migration.html" title="Human migration">human migration</a> to broaden those unexplained limitations, particularly (bolds added):</p>
<p>"Different types of migration include:</p>

<dd>Hamilton was anti-slavery <i>in New York</i>, where almost every prominent man was; only one member of the New York legislature voted against all versions of emancipation in 1785.

Hamilton was active for years in fighting the slave trade, which was based in part in his NEw York City. He even crossed very bitter party lines to cooperate with his archeenemy Burr to fight slavery. Franklin was a slaveowner who supported slavery during the Revolution when Hamilton was trying to arm the slaves; Franklin indeed changed late in life and lent his name to other people's petitions but his Pennsylvania had few slaves. Here's Ben explaining away slavery in 1770:
<dl>
<dd>Franklin, "A Conversation on Slavery" Jan. 26, 1770. in Library of America edition: "New England, the most populous of all the English Possessions in America, has very few Slaves; and those are chiefly in the capital Towns, not employed in the hardest Labour, but as Footmen or House-maids. The same may be said of the next populous Provinces, New-York, New Jersey, and Pensylvania. Even in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas, where they are employed in Field-work, what Slaves there are belong chiefly to the old rich Inhabitants, near the navigable Waters, who are few compared with the numerous Families of Back-Settlers, that have scarce any Slaves among them. In Truth, there is not, take North-America through, perhaps, one Family in a Hundred that has a Slave in it. Many Thousands there abhor the Slave Trade as much as Mr. Sharpe can do, conscientiously avoid being concerned with it, and do every Thing in their Power to abolish it. Supposing it then with that Gentleman, a Crime to keep a Slave, can it be right to stigmatize us all with that Crime? If one Man of a Hundred in England were dishonest, would it be right from thence to characterize the Nation, and say the English are Rogues and Thieves? But farther, of those who do keep Slaves, all are not Tyrants and Oppressors. Many treat their Slaves with great Humanity, and provide full as well for them in Sickness and in Health, as your poor labouring People in England are provided for. Your working Poor are not indeed absolutely Slaves; but there seems something a little like Slavery, where the Laws oblige them to work for their Masters so many Hours at such a Rate, and leave them no Liberty to demand or bargain for more, but imprison them in a Workhouse if they refuse to work on such Terms; and even imprison a humane Master if he thinks fit to pay them better; at the same Time confining the poor ingenious Artificer to this Island, and forbidding him to go abroad, though offered better Wages in foreign Countries. As to the Share England has in these Enormities of America, remember, Sir, that she began the Slave Trade; that her Merchants of London, Bristol, Liverpool and Glasgow, send their Ships to Africa for the Purpose of purchasing Slaves. If any unjust Methods are used to procure them; if Wars are fomented to obtain Prisoners; if free People are enticed on board, and then confined and brought away; if petty Princes are bribed to sell their Subjects, who indeed are already a Kind of Slaves, is America to have all the Blame of this Wickedness? You bring the Slaves to us, and tempt us to purchase them. I do not justify our falling into the Temptation. To be sure, if you have stolen Men to sell to us, and we buy them, you may urge against us the old and true saying, that _the Receiver is as bad as the Thief._ This Maxim was probably made for those who needed the Information, as being perhaps ignorant that _receiving_ was in it's Nature as bad as _stealing_: But the Reverse of the Position was never thought necessary to be formed into a Maxim, nobody ever doubted that _the Thief is as bad as the Receiver_. This you have not only done and continue to do, but several Laws heretofore made in our Colonies, to discourage the Importation of Slaves, by laying a heavy Duty, payable by the Importer, have been disapproved and repealed by your Government here, as being prejudicial, forsooth, to the Interest of the African Company."

<p>"Lie" is a strong word and, when used in the context of anonimity on Wiki, its use as an accusation in edit comments amounts to cowardice in my opinion. I will not be goaded into sinking to similar depths, but I do recommend that such freely made accusations be avoided and that some Wiki administrator take notice of it when it occurs.

<p>The depiction of the duel is also inaccurate in that it places the shooters to close to each other. Each walked ten paces-at least three feet from center-which would make a distance of at least 60 feet between them, something not accurately depicted in the illustation, meaning they would have been at least twice as far apart.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Cod_0038.html" title="User:Tom Cod">Tom Cod</a> 05:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found no explicit mention of Hamilton's offspring. He apparently had 10 children! I should think that would merit some mention! I will add something just to remedy that. Bigmac31 17:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
