<p>Thats a good idea - I dont know how to go about this whole thing. I guess i could tell you about myself and wikiediting. Im in university studying psychology - i have virtually no experience with formatting. i know how to bold sign my name, create sections, redirect, revert (i think?) and thats all i can really think of. I personally like editing articles, usually adding more info especially psychology, neuroscience related and probably some in ethology. I really like editing grammar. ive done it in <a href="../../../c/i/c/Cicada.html" title="Cicada">cicada</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_housewives.html" title="Desperate housewives">desperate housewives</a> aswell as a few others. Im not into wikipedia for vandal watching but when i do edit something i usually watch the page for edits from then on, partly because if someone changes my edit id like to know why, partially because I dont want my work to be vandalised. Ive been thinking about starting to redirect canadian spellings to americanized -(pun intended) articles but im not sure if i will. I go on little vacations during exams they usually last 1-2 weeks. The main thing i need help with is perhaps guiding me to make my posts better, teaching me basic formatting (oh i can do this little thing too { - }) and perhaps checking in on me to make sure im not doing stupid things. Anywho its bed time, give me a shout if you like the cut of my gib (i may not know what this expression means). <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuglas_a91e.html" title="User:Thuglas">thuglas</a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuglas_be5d.html" title="User talk:Thuglas">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_thuglas_5d0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/thuglas">edits</a></sup> 04:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Alex43223, Thank you for your suggestion about my account creating. I've tried the way you suggested but it still didn't work. Then what should I do next? Can anyone help me to create an account?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">YSIT</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Alex. I'm the one who made the Yellow Submarine Improv Troupe article (currently being considered for deletion), and I thought I might advocate a bit to save it from deletion; any of your attention and time you're willing to offer, I'm grateful for. The thing about improvational theater in general is that, unless you're Second City or something, it has a tendency not to show up on the radar. Some of the most successful troupes from Improv Boston and Improv Asylum don't show up at all when you use Google. Improvisational theater in general can be a tad incestuous, and you often see the same faces popping up over and over again. In this particular instance, no less than three troupes composed of entirely YSIT members have made their rounds at the Brattle Theater, Improv Boston, and Improv Asylum, which are pretty much the biggest local venues for improv here. The Jane Curtin bit was included mostly as interesting tidbit (she was not paid, by the way, but volunteered to do a session). I'll grant you that it isn't earth-shattering, but considering that its tendrils have reached everywhere from New York theater directors to Boston improvisors who have since moved to Chicago, I feel it has enough interest to justify an article. Because of the troupe's size and its membership's liklihood to go on to college theater, I get no end of questions about it. I can understand how this would create problems with verifiability or pointless edit wars, but I think the same thing could be said of any niche topic, and part of why I keep coming back to wikipedia is because of the information available on things that have a lot of specificity. I see that Irishguy and someone who is likely a current member of the troupe have had some edit wars and it is likely that Irishguy was in the right, but I don't think it justifies wholesale deletion of the article. If there are any specific changes you believe should be made that would improve the article's reliability or importance, please let me know and I will be happy to help however I can. Sorry for rambling on a bit. If you could contact me at jferrisjr_at_gmail.com, I'd be happy to have a conversation with you without cluttering up your page any further (I can also respond to e-mails a bit more quickly). I may be a bit late getting back to you tomorrow night, and I humbly request that the admins refrain from not deleting the YSIT article until at least then, if that's at all possible. Thank you again for your time and consideration -- Universal Traum 04:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well for starters I would consider fixing up my userpage. I happen to have a userboxes page which I organized by tables (because I was practicing using tables and also because i was too greedy and leaving the pages with a userboxtop/userboxbottom tag was making the whole thing super messy). The downside to this was that I have many conspicuous empty cells because some columns have too many userboxes. Is there a way I can hide those? Similarly, is there a way I can force the size of specific cells so that the cell isn't too big for the userbox? Is that too many questions?&#160;:P Thanks anyway. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExacerbation_8b89.html" title="User:Exacerbation">Exacerbation</a> 09:42, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just became a user and added "Lambing chair" to Wikipedia. It is an obscure chair and I am one of the few people that have an interest in it. It was difficult for me to find out what it was for years. I have had lambingchair.com up for about 4 years to market my version of the chair but it seems to have become more of a public service site relative to the history. What I have entered in Wikipedia is rather sloppy. ‚ÄúWindsor chair‚Äù in Wikipedia is another style of chair that is well known as apposed to the lambing chair and its entry is great. I would like to give the lambing chair the recognition and dignity that it deserves. I function well in the three dimensional world but not in the two. Could you help me in any with my endeavor?
