<p>is that serious enough to make it into an encyclopedia? it's obvious even if there were no secrets "left" and nothing to be revealed, it would be a good motive for discouraging others doing the same. --<a href="../../../l/e/l/User%7ELeladax_3529.html" title="User:Leladax">Leladax</a> 02:17, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. It's quite a substanially point. Would Putin/whoever bother to risk the problems associated with assasinating such a high profile target make it worthwhile? Obviously you could discourage others (indeed arguably more so since he was so high profile and it had been so long (where ever you are, however long it's been we'll get to you eventually) and you would obviously get revenge (the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Wrath_of_God_24a8.html" title="Operation Wrath of God">Operation Wrath of God</a> FA does make one think). On the other hand, it is a rather risky move.

<p>No, I lied. However, MI5 believes that Russian intelligence services were responsible for the assassination, yet there is no mention of this in the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sally Lievesley</span></h2>
<p>Please stop adding the quote by Sally Lievesley (a risk consultant in the UK) where she claims "Those who administered the poison were apparently experts in the subject, as precisely the right amount was used to cause a prolonged death; too great a dosage would have resulted in immediate convulsions and death, and too light a dosage would have resulted in a possible recovery though with a good likelihood of subsequent long-term health problems.". She is obviously speculating based on the same information everyone else has on the subject at this point and has no particular expertise in the area of radotoxicity. To add her statements here as if they are some kind of conclusive proof that Litvinenko was poisoned in a particular way is irresposible and unsupported by fact. In addition, her claim that "a large dosage would have resulted in immediate convulsions" belies an obvious lack of understanding of the mechanism of radioisotpe contamination poisoning. The quote MIGHT belong in the media speculation section but certainly nowhere else. --<a href="../../../d/e/g/User%7EDeglr6328_f293.html" title="User:Deglr6328">Deglr6328</a> 07:48, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't think it was inappropriate at all. It clearly illustrated why such a poison was so dangerous in such small doses and how it would be detected using spectrometers. interesting details that I haven't seen correctly explained in any other news article out there. not "over the top intricate" at all, and the polonium page DID already have the information when you moved it there.--<a href="../../../d/e/g/User%7EDeglr6328_f293.html" title="User:Deglr6328">Deglr6328</a> 21:10, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would not view the section on Po-210 to be too technical, I think that nuclear crime is very poorly understood and this is becuase it is a very new topic (I have only come across one other case of a radioisotope being used as a posion {internal exposure} by a criminal to harm another person). I think that the reader need to know how it is possible to distingish one isotope from another. With radioactivity it is not simply a case of waving a geiger counter like a majic wand at the "thing" before getting the answer to what has happened, there is much more that needs to be done in such a case. To my mind the radiochemical/health physics work done to measure the level of radioactivity and to trace where it came from in this case is as important as the balistics work done to bring to justice a gunman. I think that none of the larger and commercial news services like the BBC have failed to explain how it is possible to distingish between thallium-201 and pollonium-210 (We can do better as at wikipedia we have several people with an understanding of radiological/nuclear matters).<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a>

<p>Has there been anyone suggesting anything about the posibility of another political body (ie. not russia) being involved in the poisoning in order to discredit russia? Considering Litvinenko's critisism of russia for this kind of thing being one of the main reasons russia's being blamed, it would be quite ironic if that turned out to be the case. --87.112.35.77 20:05, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>About the Po-cow, it is oftein the case that many users of open sources of short lived radioisotopes use a longer lived precursor isotope as a source of the shortlived isotope. If a easy chemical separation can be made then it is possible to milk the isotope cow on a regular basis. For Tc-99m it is normal to use Mo-99 on Al2O3 (eluted with saline to get the Tc), for radon-222 it is normal to use radium-226. While the chemical and physcial design of the cow will vary according to the isotope required overall it is the same general method. If someone was to work out a good way of making the Po/Pb separation then a cow is possible.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a>

<dd>I also would like a few comments regarding my additions to the "See Also" section. Are all of those links appropriate for this article? My only concern is the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgi_Markov_5672.html" title="Georgi Markov">Georgi Markov</a> link. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 19:44, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest to rephrase section: "Litvinenko publicly attributed his death to decisions made and acts performed by Russian government officials, which has attracted widespread international attention."</p>
<p>Reason: Litvinenko did not make public statements; he just signed his death message. All public announcements were made by Alexander Goldfarb.</p>

<dd>Also, your statement sounds a bit awkward. "Litvinenko publicly attributed his death"...while he was still alive. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 00:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Litvinenko was found guilty June 25, 2002 by <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naro-Fominsk_7ac4.html" title="Naro-Fominsk">Naro-Fominsk</a> garrison <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_court.html" title="Military court">military court</a> (<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: <span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Нарофоминский гарнизонный военный суд</span>) and was sentenced to 3.5 years <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probation.html" title="Probation">probation</a> in his absence.
