<dd>You don't really have to <i>create</i> category pages, as such. Just put a new category link at the bottom of an article. Then go to that category, which now has your article in it, and put one or more category links to parent categories in there. The new category is now part of the hierarchy. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-01-22&#160;16:54&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<dd>One more thing: when the category is still an orphan, the links above generate a URL that goes to the page for editing.

<dd>My fight against Tobias was purely the matter of ethics (and <b>not</b> the question of content) - as well as my other Wikiconflict with Russian propagandists. If a guy is renaming 25 <i>typical</i> and large-subject articles without any discussion, "fighting" the wide-spread Wikipedia term, he <b>deserves a massive censure</b>. And I'm eager to repeat such actions against every other defiant vandal (no matter how much time would I spend for it). If Tobias voluntarily reverted his own (those still unreverted) changes, it would be the best demonstration of his tolerance, co-operativeness and contributing objectivity.</dd>

<p>Hi Alex, I invite you to find out the best basic ukrain map to show the position of cities. We discuss <a href="../../../../de/s/k/l/Benutzer_Diskussion%7ESkluesener_5f3c.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer_Diskussion:Skluesener">here</a> --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteschke_078d.html" title="User:Steschke">ST</a> <font size="+1">○</font> 06:58, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I try to explain: We try to find a construct to represent Ukrainian cities. The first point is to find a map to point the position of a city (independently if it's actually on it's correct place). We thought about oblasts with named cities first. That has the disadvantage that you only can use it in the deWP. And the oblasts are not useful to orientate. So we discuss now, if we shouldn't use simple maps of Ukraine only with dots on them. That would have the advantage, that we could store the images at commons and all WPs can use them in their language. And they would have a similar look (like the Image:Location berlin in germany.png, which are used in all german articles of cities and towns). Because of this idea, I asked you to take a look and take part at the discussion if you think this idea could be success- and useful also for you. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteschke_078d.html" title="User:Steschke">ST</a> <a href="../../../../de/s/t/e/Benutzer_Diskussion%7ESteschke_2538.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer_Diskussion:Steschke"><font size="+1">○</font></a> 23:22, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you guys. I'm fastening my preparations for the joint attack. For the start, I suggest both of you (especially the professional Epopt) to consider where could you harvest the info on particular ships of the Soviet/Ukrainian (and also, if you want, Russian) navies. I mean there must be some English -language military guides (Jane's or what is it called?) where you can find the:

<dd>Hi Epopt. I've tried to look into Jane's. there's a lot of info there, and it seems to be largely pay-only. So I need some time (and hepl may be) to harvest something here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By "labes" I meant the digit-letter combinations painted on the boards of the surface ships. Not sure for subs. I guess that combination is unique and important. Isn't it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Ukraine possess a small old diesel sub named "<a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_ship_Zaporizhia_ea41.html" title="Ukrainian ship Zaporizhia">Zaporizhia</a>" (Cyrillic Запоріжжя). Don't know the class/project - can you harvest it knowing the name?. And no&#160;:(( we don't operate it - the sub is in permanent repair since it was commisioned form Russian guys - that's why she is a constant hero of journalist stories. But the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Navy_6c01.html" title="Ukrainian Navy">Navy</a> comand demonstrates the willing to operate it someday.</dd>

<p>Hi Alex, please look at the note I left at the Arsenal Mutiny article talk page. Also, may I suggest you to avoid using Kyiv in Wikipedia as the primary name of the city. I understand that you may want to promote the usage of Kyiv by using it yourself. But at Wikipedia, I think, the choice of the term should reflect the current usage rather than promote some terms over the others. Regards, <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:12, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alex, I am responding to the note you left at my talk page. I don't have a big problem with FC Arsenal called either way. Save few exceptional cases, I usually don't go to the page just in order to change a single term when it is as contentious as Kiev/Kyiv. Mostly, I only do this change in the course of some other page edits. Unlike when used for the name of the city itself in English WP, the argument you made for the FC name has merit and I am happy to have it the way you changed it back.</p>
<p>I don't feel good, though, about the tone of the note you left at my talk page and about your calling my edits outrageous. Please don't become short-tempered when you disagree with others. I work on all articles in good faith and I don't think I deserved to be addressed in such a tone. Now, lets put this matter behind and go back to business of improving the WP. Please don't take this personally, but I think your should reconsider your usage of <i>Kyiv</i> for the name of the city in your edits. I left a note on the talk page of one of the articles and there is enough said on this heated discussion elsewhere. Please note, that I agreed with your moving the Irpen river article into Irpin, which I think made perfect sense for today's day. You may notice, that I created the article a while ago, and now I would have created it as Irpin as well. I hope, our discussions will remain civil, and I really appreciate your contributions to WP, including those I disagree. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:34, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi everybody. I dropped in for a minute - just to see what's happening in this great project. Unfortunately, I'm still on Wikibreak and have no time/energy for contribiting. Sorry if I didn't answer someone's message.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can now scan and send some not very large Ukraine-related images (since I have a scanner). E.g., Sven Teschke requested a bank note scan.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've got a large multimedia collection depicting our <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Revolution_51c9.html" title="Orange Revolution">Orange Revolution</a> (TV newscasts&amp;footages, animated clips, photos, photodesign, scanned <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaflet.html" title="Leaflet">leaflets</a>, music etc.) Some of this stuff is copyrights-free or anonimous. If someone would like to post it at the respective Wiki pages - I can also send it.</li>

<dd>Hi. I've already noticed you're an active editor of Ukraine pages. (I've been on a long Wikibreak.) And you seem to be fighting Russian gingoists - as I sometimes do. Tak trymaty! <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a> 19:10, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alex, yet again, I urge you to avoid name calling. In no time after your return to Wikipedia you resumed using this practice all too much. Maybe you forgot, but your first ever message to me (shortly after I've just started here) was a rude one. At that time, I was almost a newbie and you were an aged Wikipedian so welcoming me. Now, that I am also an aged Wikipedian, the first message from you after your wikibreak is even more rude.</p>
<p>I understand that, as you put it, you are now <i>"too busy now to study Wikiethics pages thoroughly"</i>, but even if you apply any common sense ethics and civility rules you would have not done that and you don't need to read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> to be aware of that.</p>
<p>I hope you said "tak trymaty" above without really studying the contributions of the above user which by now have included disruptive behaviour, lack of civility, extreme POV pushing, multiple 3RR violations, effective vote falsification by using forums to recruit socks/absentee votes see (<a href="../../../o/l/e/Talk%7EOleg_of_Chernihiv_1b5d.html" title="Talk:Oleg of Chernihiv">talk:Oleg of Chernihiv</a>), personal attacks on and off Wikipedia, multiple copyright vilations and moving articles by cut and paste when he could not get his way by an accepted procedure. If you are interested, you can read his talk, especially starting from <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndriyK_309a.html#Discussion_at_maidanua.org" title="User talk:AndriyK">User_talk:AndriyK#Discussion_at_maidanua.org</a>, my talk, particularly starting from <a href="../../../i/r/p/User_talk%7EIrpen_8b93.html#Discussion_on_maidanua.org" title="User talk:Irpen">User_talk:Irpen#Discussion_on_maidanua.org</a>.

<p>I remember many good contributions you made before your wikibreak and we do need contributors around here. I hope you will help to make several more Ukrainian articles <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a>.
