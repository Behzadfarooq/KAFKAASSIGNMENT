<p>I've out the bit as describing Sir Alex as an alcoholic! HOW DARE YOU cast such libel/slander on the greatest manager the English game as ever had...</p>
<p>MAN U is not Glazer's club...its the fans...and we WILL get rid of you!</p>
<p>I'm thinking that the content here looks suspiciously like a copyvio - will try to check that out in the near future.

<p>This article needs a heavy edit. To dismiss Alexs Fergusons life pre 1986 (the year he joined Man U) is unforgivable. Arguably his greatest achievement was winning the European Cup Winners Cup with Aberdeen in the pre-Champions League era. He also enjoyed considerable success in the lower Scottish leagues at a time when they were producing truely world class footballers (and managers!). Surely his colorful Govan upringing, and early non football careers of shipyard apprentice, and later, glasgow publican merit analysis.</p>
<p>Post 1986, Fergusons successes are well documented elsewhere and should be here as well. However, Alex Fergusons achievements are not synonymous with those of Manchester Uniteds. Additionally, the above point that the information on this area could be a copyvio seems justified.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree - most of the text of this article is concerned with Manchester United, rather on Alex Ferguson. An edit needs to be made to move it to a Manchester United article. - <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Of_Ninja_e6ab.html" title="User:Master Of Ninja">Master Of Ninja</a> 07:02, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Agree - Fergusons period as Scotland manager not covered or his declining the England manager job in 1995 and 1999. Also issues over business relationships with Man U stockholders and his son's work as an Agent and reasons for uturn over retirement in 2001. Most importantly needs some character profile for bust ups with other managers and key players.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Agree - this is an excellent recent history of United but most of this should be merged into <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Manchester_United_2790.html" title="History of Manchester United">History of Manchester United</a>. It could be awkward though as those articles already duplicate each other and there'll probably be a lot of disagreement about what should go where. Some more stuff on his personal life would be more relevant here (things like falling out with Coolmore over Rock of Gibraltar, growing up in Govan etc.). If I get time I'll dig out one of his biographies and expand it a bit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Does anyone want to volunteer to help merge the three articles? I'd like to do it but I'm new to Wikipedia and would like to hear what people think before deleting/moving large amounts of stuff. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">Cantthinkofagoodname</a> 11:29, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree - There's bugger all about SAF in here. It's all Man U.

<p>I've merged the section on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Manchester_United_2790.html" title="History of Manchester United">History of Manchester United</a> after 1986 with that page, and removed it from this. I also think the section on managing Aberdeen is of the same nature - focused more on the achievements of the team than the manager, and maybe this needs to be edited too. --<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_def4.html" title="User:El Pollo Diablo">El Pollo Diablo</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_1f7c.html" title="User talk:El Pollo Diablo">Talk</a> 22:46, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that this needs improving, but deleting it all and leaving the article with barely anything on his time at United was too much. It's better to have something on it, even if it's not great, than to just ignore the last 20 years of his career. I think it would be best to go through the article replacing/improving a part of it at a time, and leaving what's here alone until it can be improved. I've been offline for a couple of weeks (moving house) but have written a load of notes on his time at Aberdeen and earlier years at United (up to about '93) so I'll get it into the article as soon as I can.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote the stuff that's in the article on his time at Aberdeen. I'll see if there's any more personal stuff I can add.</dd>

<dd>I've trimmed the Man United stuff down quite a bit.

<dd>Good job - the deletion was a step too far in hindsight. After a lot of time spent editing the notes for the other article, I suppose I lost some rationale lol. Definitely need something on his time an Man U here - I'll see if I can add anything myself.--<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_def4.html" title="User:El Pollo Diablo">El Pollo Diablo</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_1f7c.html" title="User talk:El Pollo Diablo">Talk</a> 23:03, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd like to do a rewrite of the Manchester United section at some point soon, make it so it's less sectioned (periods of seasons rather than season by season), rejig more of the paragraphs so that any non-SAF bits are removed, and so on. Hopefully I can do this in the next week...--<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_def4.html" title="User:El Pollo Diablo">El Pollo Diablo</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_1f7c.html" title="User talk:El Pollo Diablo">Talk</a> 12:56, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are slabs of text with details on ManU's season that don't mention Ferguson. A summary of what the team has achieved each season is fine but this article is on Ferguson not the club )we have others articles for that!). I should like to thin it out.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The season was characterized by highly dramatic matches. In the Champions League semi-final, United conceded two early goals away to Juventus in the second leg (after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford in which United scored a last-minute equaliser). Inspired by Roy Keane, who would later miss the final through suspension, United came back to beat Juventus 3-2 and reach their first European Cup final since 1968. In the FA Cup semi-final, United faced close rivals Arsenal and appeared to be heading for defeat when Keane was sent off and, with the score at 1-1, Arsenal were awarded a last-minute penalty. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved the penalty, and in extra time Ryan Giggs ran the length of the pitch to score a memorable winning goal. They then defeated Newcastle United 2-0 in the FA Cup Final at Wembley thanks to goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes. The European triumph was the most incredible of all. With 90 minutes on the clock they were 1-0 down to Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp in Barcelona thanks to a Mario Basler free kick, but in 3 minutes of injury time allowed by referee Pierluigi Collina, Teddy Sheringham, a substitute, equalised and extra time looked certain. But with just seconds left on the clock, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, also a late substitution scored the winning goal and history was made.</dd>

<p>I'm a massive United fan, but I have to say that there is still too much of it in here. Good work so far, but there's more to do. I don't think that this is the place for a detailed record of transfers. I think that the season-by-season analysis should be moved to a separate article ("The Managerial Career of Alex Ferguson" with similar details for East Stirlingshire, St Mirren and Aberdeen too?), with maybe three or four abridged sections here to cut it down to a decent size. It needs to be replaced by all the stuff that is missing - racing, his personality and so on. I'll try to get to writing some of it when I have a bit of time.

<p>I have just read the article, and it seems that all he does is football. There's only one mention of his wife, one of his son, one horse mention, etc - and yet if we went out on the High Street, and asked people to name a racing horse owner, I think he'd easily be in the top three. If I read this article and the one on Manchester United, the only differences at present are a cursory glance at his playing careeer and Aberdeen - and the rest is pretty much the same (I do think the Aberdeen section is in proportion - its the Man Utd bit that is over blown in detail). I see someone above mentions a CopyVio - I wonder if much of the base is taken from a Biography? As a Liverpool suporter, much as though he is part-devil to me, this is not an article to reflect the greatest manager so far of the FA Premiership era. I only came here because I added details of a campiagn Sir Alex is running on behalf of restoring paintings by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Spencer_98ea.html" title="Stanley Spencer">Stanley Spencer</a> - this article as a Bio is a disapointment!

<p>I think the Third paragraph of this article is rather negative, to suggest that the most important information about SAF is his fallings out with a list of players who didn't like his management style is a bit awry, I'd say. Certainly this information there could/should be moved down into the main article, if it's kept at all. --<a href="../../../g/a/v/User%7EGavinio_6f72.html" title="User:Gavinio">Gavinio</a> 20:23, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd second that! It maybe warrants a sentence somewhere, but as it stands you could just as well list dozens of players who were happy to be managed by him for as long as circumstances allowed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.70.155.252 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.70.155.252_98d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.70.155.252">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I am confused too. There are Google results saying that he can be called Sir because he has a CBE and OBE, and that he is actually a KBE... But he was knighted in 1999, which gives the title Sir. Perhaps it is <a href="../../../o/b/e/OBE_5508.html" title="OBE">OBE</a> that needs some correcting. <span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt;"><a href="../../../x/4/2/User%7EX42bn6_9d4f.html" title="User:X42bn6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">x42bn6</span></a> <a href="../../../x/4/2/User_talk%7EX42bn6_bd12.html" title="User talk:X42bn6">Talk</a></span> 22:19, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
