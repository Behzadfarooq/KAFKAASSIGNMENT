<p>Thanks for a very useful image. I think it is excellent for the <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurikid.html" title="Rurikid">Rurikid</a> article, but I took a liberty to remove it from <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan Rus'</a> which is too broad for it and there are so many images that potentially fit to it, and so many are there now, that we should be careful in selecting. Let's discuss it if you disagree.</p>
<p>As far as Holodomor is conserned, true enough several govs and some scholars view it as Genocide but, at the same time, some academics think otherwise and such view is not restricted to the fringe outcasts in academia. As such, the applicability of the term is not assured. That's why the article has a separate chapter on the issue where the reader is presented with facts and opinions. Stamping a cat over the whole thing means prejudging the issue in advance. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alex, I absolutely agree with you about the cat:genocide vis-a-vis Holodomor, but the nature of Wikipedia necessitates your active participation not in just editing but in discussion of your position. People with different background and different conceptions of History edit here. You may continue to insert the cat or you may work towards a consesus whereby the cat will be the accepted categorization. Why don't you give it a try on the Holodomor talk page and present a cogent argument for why the Holodomor is genocide. Best regards, --<a href="../../../r/i/u/User%7ERiurik_844b.html" title="User:Riurik">Riurik</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/u/User_talk%7ERiurik_f270.html" title="User talk:Riurik">(discuss)</a></sup> 18:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Guys, let me state first that, persoanlly, I am undecided on whether H was a Genocide. There are strong arguments in support of such view but the evidence of the applicability of the Genocide (not of the fact that Famine was artificial, which is not seriously disputed) requires a <i>Genocidal intent</i> of the authorities. We have only circumstantial evidence for the latter, that it even once archives were opened, not a single document popped up about Stalin's intent to target Ukrainians specifically, just because they were Ukrainians.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for presenting the arguments at talk to support that H was a Genocide, this is not our job. The arguments in favor and against are already presented by scholars and our job is to summarize them. We should put aside political statements by the governments because they may (or may not) be politically motivated and restrict the analysis to the scholars, or (as per the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>) to the Western scholarship. Respected representatives of the latter still disagree on the term's applicability and that's what makes the issue different from the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, where there seems to be no disagreement among the academics. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:23, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, it was me who wrote <a href="../../../s/v/y/Svyatopolk_I_e190.html" title="Svyatopolk I">Svyatopolk I</a> in February 2005 and uploaded real (not imaginary) trident-like symbols to this article. On the other hands, your images are factually incorrect, because exact attribution of symbols to one or another of Yaroslav's descendants is purely speculative. Even with seals, which normally bear an image of the ruler's patron saint and his name, attribution frequently presents insurmountable difficulties. What makes these images even less acceptable for an encyclopaedia, is that the symbols are clothed in the Ukranian heraldic colors, which had not been attested before the Galician period of Ukrainian history. In short, unlike the images in the article about Svyatopolk, the modernised interpretations which you uploaded are speculations with a nationalist background.

<p>Look why are you revert warring? What difference does it make to you when Cossacks were founded. Most important is their historical prominance. For Russian Cossacks this was the 15th and 16th centuries, when you had the colonisation of Siberia, the wars during the time of troubles, the Russo-Turkish Wars. Zaporozhian Cossacks became prominant only in mid 17th century (which is explained in the paragraph preceding) during the Khmelnitsky uprising. Then during the 18th century Russian Cossacks take over again as being most famous, Napoleonic Wars, Balkans, Caucasus and up until the Russian Civil War. In the 20th century Soviet World, the Ukrainian Cossacks are re-established as the dominant image whilst we are kept out of public view. Now we have Abkhazia, Chechnya, ex-Yugoslavia where we Russian Cossacks made the world recognise our prominance, whist Ukrainian Cossacks, as such do not exist (in terms of military). So its 3:2 in Russian Cossack's favour. I agreed to take out <i>the most prominant and fomous</i>, for consesus sake leave the article as it is. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 19:51, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Do not divide Cossacks into nations. There was no national state when they emereged. Thus dispute about "Russain" and "Ukrainian" is nonsense. We can speak only abou the Cossacks who lived on the teritory of modern Russia or Ukraine.</li>
<li>Cossacks from Zaporozhya were know in Europe in the 15-16 centuries. Habsburgs and French kings hired them before the Khmelnitsky aprising took place. French, Swedish and Prussian politicains of the 18 century used Cossacks of Zaporozhia in their strategical plans against Russian empire. Only after the Sich was destroyed, and Napoleon decided to blow on Russia, Europeans learned about Don, Yaik and other Cossacks. I dont want to minimize the role of Don Cossacks in conquering Siberia, but for most of Europeans they were unknown. Russia had been seen as non-European state (culturally). So 3:2 in Ukrainian Cossack's favour. However, I dont want to divide them into nationalities.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Kov_4f0b.html" title="User:Alex Kov">Alex Kov</a> 09:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is exactely what the first paragraph is about:
<dl>
<dd><small><i>Cossacks became first widely known in western Europe in the mid-seventeenth century as a result of the great revolt[1][2][3][4] of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the Zaporozhians in Ukraine against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which shook the geopolitical foundations of eastern Europe.</i></small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>However this is not article about the perception of Cossacks to European people, but this is about a general Cossack article. There is a <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Cossacks_d2d6.html" title="History of Cossacks">History of Cossacks</a> which expands on this. I am not trying to downplay the significance of the Zaporozhian Host (after all they are my ancestors), but the overall tone of the article has to be neutral. It is true that Cossacks had no ethnicity, but they called themselves Ruthenian - which we continue to do so. (i.e. we are not Veliko- nor Malo- russians, but Russkiye Kazaki). However in that case your Ukrainian to Russian debate loses point, as you have cotradicted yourself. For sake of consensus lets leave the paragraphing like it always was. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 13:24, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well it depends on the naming convention, so lets begin with that. Russian for me = Rossiyanin = Citizen of Russia. Ukrainian = Ukrainits = Citizen of Ukraine. Ruthenian = Russkiy = Ethnic Eastern Slavic. The latter group consists of numerous subethnical groups: White Ruthenians = Belorussy = Belarusians; Small Ruthenians = Malorossy = Ethnic Ukrainians; Great Ruthenians = Velikorossy = Ethnic Russians. However, in addition to that there are also Carpathian Rusyns, Pomorians ... and Cossacks which do not fall under the great or small unmbrellas, but under the main Ruthenian peoples' umbrella. The biggest confusion is that in modern terminology Russkiy = Velikoros, which incorrectely "privatised" in the 20th century by the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>Now then that aside. Let's return to Cossacks. Cossacks are Ruthenian people that do not have ethnicall association with Great or Small Ruthenians. So what is the difference which paragraph goes first. Well from the NPOV (not European one mind you). The one that played the biggest historical role should precede. What have we got for Russians, as I said before, activity takes off in late 13th century and the colonisation of Siberia (Yermak) all the way until the Time of Troubles. The impact of the Zaporozhian Cossacks at this time is not exactely that massive until mid-17th century, when arrives the Khmelnitsky uprising, the Pereyaslavl Rada and the Russo-Swedish war. At this time Don Cossacks make themselves famous with numerous uprisings, in particular Pugachev's. Russo-Turkish wars give both Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks equal prominance. Then with the end of the Sech, the split of the Zaporozhian Host, and the Ukrainian Cossacks after that have no impact on History at all. (For what they are worth and for Michael's analysis on <a href="../../../c/o/s/Talk%7ECossack_e120.html" title="Talk:Cossack">Talk:Cossack</a> only the Danube Cossacks can still be called Ukrainians, however the Azov-Black Sea and the Kuban are from now on Russians). At this time you have Napoleonic Wars, Balkans, Caucasus etc, where Russian Cossacks play a massive role. Russian Civil War, World War II, Modern local conflicts. There are no Ukrainian Cossacks there at all, in none of those pages of history books. So in any case I still see why you choose to put Ukrainians first, as the chronology argument loses value and the European POV is not NPOV. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 17:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello to you here as well. Please stop restoring links to a hate-site like you've done at Ingria.</p>

<p>Thank you for the message. I've used word "vandal" towards Ghirlandajo because of his rude manner of reverting articles. My thoughts concerning his behavior have already been written down at the "accusations noticeboard by other users whom he accused in making "personal attacks".
