<p>Someone added a bit about Anaxarchus pointing to Alexander's blood as a sign he was mortal.

<dd>I don't particularly have a problem with Macedon/Macedonia, but don't the naming conventions suggest that articles be named based on their most popular usage, rather than their most correct usage (if there's a difference)?

<dd>My native language is Greek and I can assure you that Macedon and Macedonia is the same thing. Macedonia is the "modern" way to say Macedon.

<p>Just a note about the relationship between Aristotle and Alexander. Those two were two different personalities and they used to clash a lot but Alexander did something that makes me wonder if their relationship was as bad as people think today. While he was invading Asia he would send to his teacher all new and interesting animals that he would incounter in his expedition because he knew that old Aristotle was almost obsessed with the classification of things. The result was that Aristotle formed a kind of a zoo back in Macedonia from the gifts of his student. Now, if young Alexander was so sick of his teacher why did he bother? --<a href="../../../e/a/n/User%7EEanorel_8863.html" title="User:Eanorel">Eanorel</a>, 08:45, March 5, 2002</p>

<dd>Good point. I think Alexander was complicated enough that trying to determine who he liked and who he didn't (and which was safer) isn't all that easy. He was known to treat his enemies rather well and to kill his friends when they ticked him off. I think he might have respected Aristotle and just not wanted to spend time around him anymore.

<dd>His name is Alexander the Great, regardless of what you actually think of the man. At the time, different kings of the same name were not given numbers as they are now, but were given sobriquets. For instance, Demetrius the Besieger, Seleucus the Victor, Ptolemy the Savior. It would be silly to argue that Demetrius wasn't really a capable besieger or that Ptolemy wasn't actually a savior, and the same situation applies here. It should be noted, though, that the other kings are typically referred to by number, so perhaps Alexander should be moved for consistency sake - but not because "the Great" is NPOV. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh Grosse</a> 20:38, March 2, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why would i want to move Charlemagne to Charle?? Anyway I still think it should move ok, to me it does not mean anything but native people of those areas don't consider him "great." There he's not called Alexander the Great. I can't remember exactly what they call him. But names like Edward the Confessor are not as (abit?) an issue, as it's not really implying anything.

<dd>I am afraid the reference is again Plutarch. He states that Alexander was born at the same night Herostratus burned the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Since that event is placed on June 21 , 356 in wikipedia's timelines so does Alexander's birth. See if placement needs correcting.

<dd>He did not conquer Sparta. Sparta was not part of Philip's League of Corinth, but was quiescent. Upon Alexander's accession, he marched north to deal with some northern tribes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transliteration</span></h2>
<p>What do people think about transliteration? I'd like to get Alexander entirely in one system. Having one part of the bio talk of "Isokrates," and another "Cleopatra" gives me the willies. The prevalent system in this article is the "conventional" English-through-Latin scheme, eg., Athens (not Athenai), Ptolemy (not Ptolemaios), etc. This is still the dominant way--probably in academia and certainly on the Web, where public domain translations from earlier eras abound. The rule can have exceptions--I prefer to make a "minor" Ptolemy into a Ptolemaios to avoid confusion--but there would still be a rule.</p>
<p>Any objections?

<dd>Yes. Wikipedia policy is to use the naming that most English speakers know. Cleopatra is not Kleopatra. Isokrates is not Isocrates.

<p>That's jumbled. "Isocrates" is the better known (Google 20,600 vs 4,760). The K is Isokrates is the same letter (a kappa) in Kleopatra; these went into Latin as Cs, and this is the better-known form. Forms like Isokrates, Kleopatra, Alexandros, Ptolemaios, etc. reproduce the Greek spelling better, at the expense of being unfamiliar (and a bit exotic) to most readers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.94.133.143 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.94.133.143.html" title="User talk:209.94.133.143">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.94.133.143_97ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.94.133.143">contribs</a>) 13:15, June 29, 2004 (UTC).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greek etymology, Albanian nationalism</span></h2>
<p>I reverted with slight changes the Albanian-language changes of 81.242.229.199. Alexander was half Epirote, the probable ancestors of the modern Albanians, but "Alexandros" is a perfectly normal, explicable, common and extremely ancient Greek name. (Not only was "Alexander" a Macedonian dynastic name before Epirotes married in, but the Trojan individual known to most Westerners as "Paris" was generally known in Greek as "Alexander.") By contrast the Albanian explanation ("born like a dream") is a folk etymology, and based on modern Albanian. Ancient Epirote--about which we know almost nothing--was surely quite different from modern Albanian. 2,300 years is a very long time, particularly as Albanian was not fixed in written form until the Renaissance.</p>
<p>To be fair, I also moved the Greek etymology "Defender or Men" down the page. As stated, the etymology is not particularly important. Greeks no more thought "Oh, he's a defender of men" when they met an Alexander as Germans think "Oh, he's a forest of fir trees" when they meet a Tannenwald, or American's think about barrel-making when they meet someone with the last name "Cooper." <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectiodifficilior_4a42.html" title="User:Lectiodifficilior">Lectiodifficilior</a> 00:15, July 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- Beyond that everybody knows that Alexander's native language wasn't the greek but an uknown language that the greeks called 'barbaric language'. Which kind of language was?</p>
<p>In Balkan there are only two old and unic languages, Albanian and Greek.</p>
<p>Greek nationalism considere Macedonia as part of Greece, even thought they know that the ancient Macedonians didn't speak Greek, they still don't speak Greek, and also there are no Greeks living there. According to Albanian etymology 'Emadhia', the great land, seems to be Macedonia. This is like 'Shqiperia', the country of Eagles, is called Albania.</p>
<p>The facts are that the majority of people living in Macedonia are ethnic Albanians, an nation as old as the Greeks at least, and the second majority of people living there are Slavics who came in Balkan about the 7-8 century A.C.</p>
<p>Still today some greeks keep calling Albanian language 'barbaric language' because they don't know it, many people don't know it and ignore it, it is easier like that. As we still don't know today what was the native language that Alexander the Great used to speak to his troops before the battels...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">misstatements, misrepresentations and presentations of speculation and/or unreliable source accounts</span></h2>
<p>There are so many misstatements, misrepresentations and presentations of speculation and/or unreliable source accounts as fact in this entry that it's difficult to know where to begin correcting them - and, at the moment, I'm unwilling to make the effort at correcting them, given the amount of time that would be required. Nonetheless, if this is representative of what a Wiki encyclopedia has to offer, it's a damning indictment of the whole notion of open source history.</p>
<p>Here are just three examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Early Life section, the contention that Alexander was responsible for spreading the "legends" (more properly "logos" or stories - legends are folklore, not propaganda) about Zeus fathering him. (Virtually this entire section is from Plutarch, btw.) The evidence for this viewpoint is shaky, mostly relies on hostile sources and is not generally accepted by historians. The most likely original sources of these stories are Callisthenes, his official campaign historian, or, especially, Onesicritus, his chief helmsman and author of a lost work entitled "The Education of Alexander" that was infamous for its many inventions and wild exaggerations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the Period of Conquests section, it is stated as fact that Alexander was proclaimed Pharoah by the priests of Amon. In fact, no such statement is attributed to the high priest of the Libyan deity Ammon by any of the sources, although, according to several of the source historians, the high priest greeted him with the words "O Paidos", which translates as "O Son of God". He is specifically said to have been crowned as Pharoah at Memphis ONLY in the Alexander Romance, which is not considered a reliable source in any way by any one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the Death section, the absurd speculation of the unnamed New Scotland Yard detective is presented as definitive. In fact, the described symptoms of Alexander's death do not in any way conform to those of hellebore poisoning and the poisoning theory is universally deprecated by modern historians. In the article "A Mysterious Death" in The New England Journal of Medicine, 38:1764-1769 (June 11), 1998, Eugene N. Borza (one of the most respected scholars of Alexander and Macedon of the 20th Century), David W. Oldach, M.D. (then Professor of Pathology at the University of Maryland Medical School), Robert E. Richard, M.D., Ph.D., and R. Michael Benitez M.D. (both also of the UM Med School) present a compelling case for Salmonella typhi enteritis, complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis as the cause of Alexander's Death. Oldach's analysis notes, "If ascending paralysis developed during the course of Alexander's fatal febrile illness (presumably typhoid fever), this paralysis may have given the impression of death before it actually occurred," in addressing the stories in both Curtius and Arrian that Alexander's body showed no signs of corruption after several days of being locked in his bedroom at the height of the Babylonian summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are any number of other, similar problems with this article - far too many for me to correct at the moment. However, I think you should definitely add Plutarch's "Life of Alexander" (particularly in view of the fact that the Early Life section is drawn almost entirely from that work), as well as the Roman rhetor Justin's "Epitome of the Phillipic History of Pompeius Trogus" and the Roman geographer Strabo's "Geography" to your list of Ancient Sources. - Thom Stark <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.40.158.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.40.158.127_2c76.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.40.158.127">contribs</a>) 15:32, September 17, 2004 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Response: Callisthenes was comissioned to write by Alexander and he spread stories of Alexander's divine parentage at Alexander's behest so I feel obliged to correct you on that one. The Pharoah was the son of god so I think you are being slightly faceatious. Many historians have chosen to interpret the high priests words in that manner.

<p>I just couldn't stand the misinformation on this page, so I made time to correct most of the errors. I have also cited Plutarch's actual text for the discussion of Alexander's birth and origins, expanded the discussion of the Central Asian campaign and the death of Darius, added two of the primary sources and fine-tuned some of the grammar.</p>

<dd>No, anonymous. It's 98% certain that Alexander the Great was bisexual, and he most likely preferred men. A number of sources discuss this.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alexander sources and legend</span></h2>
<p>The sources and legend sections were removed somewhat earlier without discussion. Considering how major the revision and how many people worked on those sections I'm surpirsed this slipped by. I think they should be reinstated, and have done so. I think we should also reconstitute the "Alexander in Popular Culture." Stripped of the sources, legend and cultural impact, this is merely a narrow biography, full of errors and arguable claims. Wikipedia will never be perfect, but it shouldn't be narrow.</p>
<p><a name="Sources" id="Sources"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Sources</span></h3>
<p>Without a section on the sources, we are left with a bare list of two sources, one only in Latin. But Plutarch, Diodorus, Arrian and Justin are *all* now fully online in English translations. More importantly, you simply cannot write a "biography" of Alexander--indeed of most ancient figures--without some reference to the source tradition. Alexander isn't Napoleon or some other absurdly well-documented modern; what we know about him is intimately tied to what ancient authorities said about him. The removal of the any sense of a source tradition is particularly bad in light of some of the decisions, eg., that Roman-era schoolboy exercise the "Letter of Diogenes" given as if it were a contemporary document. For shame! We might as well include Lucian's conversations with the dead Alexander.</p>
<p><a name="Legend" id="Legend"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Legend</span></h3>
<p>Alexander is one of the world's great culture heroes—a hero to Jews, a prophet to Muslims, subject of one of the most widely-read works of literature, the Alexander Romance, etc. etc.. To eschew mention of this in favor of a lengthy and variably reliable list of his actions is myopic.</p>
<p><a name="Popular" id="Popular"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Popular</span></h3>
<p>Again, Alexander is more than a laundry-list of historical factoids, but a major subject of art, literature and music from his death until now. For starters, are we actually going to have an entry on Alexander that doesn't mention the movie?</p>
<p>Lastly, I move that we remove most of the "legacy" section. A survey of Hellenistic history down to the 270s is not Alexander's concern, the battle of "Kurypedion" [sic] notwithstanding. Shall we add Civil War battles to the biography of John Adams?</p>

<p><a name="Sexuality_changes" id="Sexuality_changes"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Sexuality changes</span></h3>
<p>I changed a few things in the sexuality section and will change more unless citations are forthcoming. There is some very sketchy evidence being put forward as gospel. For example, where does Athenaeus say that Alexander was a "wild paederast"? Give me chapter and verse here.</p>
<p>Changes to Aelian: (1) Hephaestion did not "show" that he was Alexander's lover, he "intimated" it. The verb is ainittomai, to speak in riddles, to intimate. Wilson's Loeb translation is as follows "Note that Alexader laid a wreath at Achilles' tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus', hinting that he was the object of Alexander's love, a Patroclus was of Achilles." In Greek "Hoti Alexandros ton Achilleos taphon estephanose kai Hephaistion ton tou Patroklou, ainittomenos hoti kai autos en eromenos tou Alexandrou, hosper Achilleos ho Patroklos." (2) "Alexander's lover" to "the object of Alexander's love." Aelian uses the word "eromenos." In conventional Greek pederasty, the "erastes" is the older guy, the "eromenos" the younger. The erastes "does the loving" (use your imagination here), the eromenos receives it. Now, it may well be true that Hephaestion and Alexander had a more equal love. It is often suggested that the scandal, if there was one, was that Alexander had a "lover" his own age, the implication being that Alexander both gave and *received* sexually, the latter being shameful, particularly from an inferior. Or it may be the case, as some have argued, that Macedonians engaged in same-age homosexual relationships without the stigma usually attached to that in southern Greek regions. The fact is,however, that Aelian uses a word with a specific meaning, eromenos.</p>
<p>The Letter of Diogenes. This one is making the rounds a lot. It must be stopped. Classicists are united in thinking the letter a much later rhetorical exercise, not a real letter by the Cynic Philosopher. The whole collection of Diogenes' letters falls into that category. See, for example, OCD2 on "Letters, Greek": "(2) Letters, for the most part spurious, attributed to persons of note, which owe their survival to the general interest of their contents or the reputations of their supposed authors. The spurious letters are sometimes real forgeries; more often they are school exercises or ivnentions intended to illustrate the characters of famous men. … the second sort is chiefly the product of the period 100 BC - AD 200, amongs them those of Anacharsis..., Hippocrates, and Diogenes the Cynic." Now, these letters reference current opinions and may contain contemporary information, but they are not direct sources on the matter.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you want the quotes by Eumenes of Cardia and Athenaeus to stay in, please provide a citation. I think they are, at best, quotes describing something in these authors.</p>
<p>Generally, I am not being hostile to those who claim Alexander was homosexual. I basically agree, so long as ancient sexual mores are understood. But I don't think anything is gained by twisting evidence.</p>
