<p>I like Marius Oprea and all (btw, we should have an article on him in the future), but a link titled "Let's piss on their graves" has a major problem, no matter how preciously detailed and impartial its content actually is. I'm afraid we'll have to compensate by tapping into other resources. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 03:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure who he is, but I found his article quite informative. And, yes, it took me a while to understand what the title meant (the diacritics were mangled) -- I shied away from translating it. On the other hand, what he's talking about can elicit strong reactions (yes?). Actually, this reminds me of the tile of a novel, <a href="../../../../fr/j/27/i/J%27irai_cracher_sur_vos_tombes_%28roman%29.html" class="extiw" title="fr:J'irai_cracher_sur_vos_tombes_(roman)">J'irai cracher sur vos tombes</a>, by <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Vian_6595.html" title="Boris Vian">Boris Vian</a>... <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 04:26, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I found an article where all the information on his biography is backed, although not in as many details. Don't get me wrong, Oprea's is informative, but we can avoid the entire potential debate by simply not linking it (it did bring Vian to my mind as well...); I'm guessing that, in case Oprea were a witness to the events or a victim, the title would not pose as much problems. Btw, I'll b removing the reference to his book in the process, as we should not reference what we have not consulted. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(I propose dropping references to alternative or original names of persons other than Nicolski himself in the article, as they would be clarified in the respective articles - despite the fact that a large number of sources still mention "Pintilie" by his original name, we shpuld stick with what he chose for himself; this also spares us the potential trouble of whether to transliterate it from Ukrainian or from Russian, which is a big deal for similar cases on wikipedia... don't ask...) <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree, Oprea's online article is not up to standards -- if nothing else, the typography is atrocious. But the facts appear to be rather coherently presented, and most likely true, especially when most were backed up by other sources. (In the meantime, I also looked at the Tismaneanu report, and it all gibes). My hunch is that Oprea's article is a (rather poorly executed) cut-and-paste from his book. But unfortunately, as you guessed, I could not access his book, so I only mentioned it as an external source (the book was mentioned in other places, too.) At any rate, good point -- better to leave it out till someone can actually check it. As for the transliterations, I wasn't aware of the potential trouble (it's also done on the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securitate.html" title="Securitate">Securitate</a> page). The main reason I wanted to have the alternate names was to make it possible to quote Corvin Lupu, who only mentions the names those people had at birth. This issue will keep posing a problem, looks like, but not insurmountable. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 05:09, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe we should have an article under "Pintilie", and redirect all versions to there,which should leave us with a neutral result. Of course, all of this is in the future - I have a limit of one torturer per day, as I actually want to avoid having nightmares about them&#160;:). I admit I have not looked into the Securitate article, <s>but I'm betting it is full of errors and POVs</s> (IMO, refrencing the "foreign names" ad nauseam is a side effect of the xenophobia that has sadly triumphed on Romanian wikipedia... it really serves no academic purpose). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 05:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(For direct quotes with ambiguous potential, might I suggest turning "blah blah blah Pantelimon Bodnarenko blah blah" into "blah blah blah [Gheorghe Pintilie] blah blah"?) <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 05:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, wow! Article looks very thorough and researched to me (I wish I had all those books to consult, too -- sigh...). As for the plan with the naming conventions, sounds good to me. Generally speaking, one refers to public figures (including writers, actors, whatever) by their professional/adopted names, not by the names they carried at birth, as long as the chosen names are well-established. One little thing: I put the Lupu reference since I did not have many sources available (eg, to confirm Nicholschi's birth name). But now with all the other detailed sources you quoted, it may not be necessary to include this article? I still found it rather informative as general background on some aspects of the era, maybe it can be put to better use as a reference in another article? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 13:49, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. I'm afraid I hadn't looked through the article in question, and, having done so, I find it to be below the quality expected from a source. It is also spurious. Yes, I will remove it, and, hopefully, we will not be debating whether to source it on other pages. I see, for example that it is <a href="http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2005-06-15&amp;art=1808" class="external text" title="http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2005-06-15&amp;art=1808" rel="nofollow">branded as negationist</a> by Lupu's peers, and I fully agree with the assessment. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:55, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Allright. Sorry for not reading the article more carefully before referring to it. I was in a bit of hurry to get the Nicholschi article off the ground, and it's not so easy to wade through the mass of data from the internet, a lot of which is ob dubious quality or reliability. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 15:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Now that <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> has brought it up, this formulation does sound kind of odd, and perhaps even demeaning to the country and its people: Did Romania really belong to Ion Antonescu in May, 1941? He was indeed the dictator at the time, but that, in and of itself, did not make the country belong to him. So, while I agree it may be relevant to indicate who was in power at the time, I'd be in favor of a more factual (and neutral) way to say it. (I, for one, would never use an expression like, say, "Ceauşescu's Romania", but rather, "Romania during Ceauşescu's time", or some such construct). And, by the way, Antonescu was appointed Prime-Minister by King Carol II on September 6, 1940, a date that precedes Nicholschi's becoming a Soviet citizen, and starting training as an NKVD agent (in December, 1940). Thus, if one wants to emphasize who was in power in Romania at that time (though I'm not quite sure to what degree, if any, that would explain Nicholschi's actions in 1941), perhaps mention of Antonescu's rise to power should be made earlier? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 01:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, I think that's demeaning and POVish in a sense that can be used as an excuse "he didn't spy Romania, he spied <i>Antonescu's</i> Romania". "Romania during the Antonescu regime" could be use instead of demeaning "Antonescu's Romania" that would still sound a little POVish, but at least is not demeaning. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 01:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that was my concern, too. I'm sure this is not the intention of the current formulation, but I'm concerned that others may construe it that way, and I would find that unfortunate. "Romania during the Antonescu regime" is a perfectly neutral formulation in my opinion (as long as it's put in the right place, with the right balance and emphasis). By the way, I've seen discussions on other talk pages about whether the word "regime" itself is neutral -- and, while my personal opinion is that it's not quite, though again it depends on context -- in the context of Romania during World War II I think it is well-established, and appropiate, if used judiciously. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 01:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will answer to Turgidson's concerns, I will not answer to AdrianTM's (since his interpretation is solely based on the speculation that, given he could read a "hidden intent" in a text, the text had a hidden intent). I would first like to ask Turgidson to include in his assessment the fact that the sentence does not in fact directly involve Antonescu or Nicolschi, and that I used it merely as a necessary instrument in editing an article to serve the casual reader. This <i>is not</i> a question of "neutrality", and I'm rather surprised that we are discussing the matter from this perspective.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. For one, I think good editing should include all links that set the scene for events described. Secondly, it is always preferable for a reader to link to a regime, and not to a country (<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Directory_cc21.html" title="French Directory">French Directory</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_French_Empire_8d79.html" title="First French Empire">First French Empire</a> instead of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>; <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> instead of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>; etc.). Note, please, that there is no such article for Antonescu's regime, and there cannot be one (creating one for the sake of it would simply be forking content from the Antonescu page, would be redundant to the overview of WWII in Romania, and would not be legitimized by scholarly usage). Yes, I too would have preferred using something like "Romania during x's time", but you tell me if the phrase it was encapsulated in would be intelligible if I were to use that. I simply went with an alternative that seemed to be perfectly reasonable (I still think it is).</p>
<p>Furthermore, formulations such as "Winston Churchill's Britain" are widespread for similar concepts; to make an "academic" point, I would like to stress that, if the latter is used without fear of it being understood that "x owned y", then it could clearly work for Romania (in whatever scheme, Antonescu "owned" Romania more than Churchill did England). With this in mind, "in Antonescu's time" could mean, using the same arguments ad absurdum, that Antonescu owned time itself... <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:07, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are several arguments within arguments in here (like <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matryoshka_doll.html" title="Matryoshka doll">Matryoshka dolls</a>), but let me just address one narrow issue -- I'll need to think more about the rest. Perhaps it's just me, but I never heard the expression "Winston Churchill's Britain" -- though I'm a great fan of Sir Winston. To my ears (and, I suspect, to the ears of many other readers from the U.S., at least those born more than 35-40 years ago), the instinctive association would rather be with Senator Ted Kennedy's speech on the floor of the Senate in 1987, in opposition to Ronald Reagan's <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bork_b6b7.html#Supreme_Court_nomination" title="Robert Bork">nomination of Robert Bork</a> to the Supreme Court: "Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of government." (There is now a word in American English for such an ad-hominem attack: <i><a href="../../../b/o/r/Bork.html" title="Bork">to bork</a></i>, or <i>borking</i>.) So, it's not just a matter of misunderstanding whether a country belonged to a person (though that's one of the reasons); the formulation clearly has, at least in my mind, a negative connotation, most often for both the country and the person, when used in such a way. It all depends on the context, of course -- take for example <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_era.html" title="Elizabethan era">Elizabethan England</a>. Now, that was an interesting time. Speaking of which, how about the following for a neutral formulation: "the Antonescu era"? The term "era" is used in both positive and negative contexts just about equally, and it avoids the possesive from "in Antonescu's time", which, I agree, has its own internal logical problems (though not as marked as "Ion Antonescu's Romania", I'd say). <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 02:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You know, I could be mean and say "<a href="http://www.information-britain.co.uk/showPlace.cfm?Place_ID=5440" class="external text" title="http://www.information-britain.co.uk/showPlace.cfm?Place_ID=5440" rel="nofollow">yes, it's just you</a>"&#160;;). I find "era" to be a rather odd phrasing (especially for such a short era - thank God for that), but I could go for it. In fact, if you want to change phrasing in any way to include the words "time" or "regime" or "era", feel free to so. Btw, I'm allergic to people linking the word <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, so I would use something that features (and links upon first mention) the man's full name. My main concerns were that a POV was deduced where there was none, that there was nothing inherently wrong with my phrasing, and that the practical concerns I had tried to deal with in the process (legibility, wikipedia conventions, flow, not fragmenting the reference) were not being noticed. Granted, I also think that the term "x's y" are rather rare in comparison with their synonyms, and that the latter are usually better suited. However, I do not think that there was that much room for interpretation (and especially for the "it was ok to spy" argument, which was arguably a projection).</dd>
<dd>Hey, I just very much amused that the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securitate.html" title="Securitate">Securitate</a> article (which I have avoided looking into up until just now) uses something called "Ceauşescu's <i>reign</i>".

<dd>Changed that to "Ceauşescu's dictatorship" also it's worth to mention that the expression "end of Ceauşescu's dictatorship" or "end of Ceauşescu's reign" is not equivalent with the "Antonescu's Romania" expression, I hope you see the difference: the dictatorship (or reign) is something that belongs grammatically and logically to Ceauşescu, Romania didn't belong to Antonescu. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 03:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

Please stop projecting yourself before you accuse people of "pure projections". Thanks.

<dd>Winston Churchill's Britain: OK, I buy the existence proof, but let's agree to disagree on how widely it is used. Era: I think in modern American English, at least, the term has lost much of its original Latin meaning (which is retained though by the Greek word <a href="../../../e/o/n/Eon_%28geology%29.html" title="Eon (geology)">eon</a>), and can refer to relatively short periods of time, certainly something like 4 to 5 years as was the case with Antonescu's regime. For example, the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_Era_1800.html" title="Vietnam Era">Vietnam Era</a> refers to a period of about a decade, whereas the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,447761,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,447761,00.html" rel="nofollow">Camelot Era</a> refers to the presidency of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> (Jan. 1961- Nov. 1963). Hitler vs Adolf Hitler: agreed.

<p>For the past two month (since I started at WP) he removed ALL my contributions. His lack of manners is astonishing. Lately he simply reverts, with a dismissive note "rv vandalism". I noticed that he basically does the same to all of you guys, whoever touches "his" pages. He has all the <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> symptoms. Moreover, to me it looks like he has an enormous anti-Romanian POV. Is this also your oppinion? (Icar 14:38, 20 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>One persistent annoying POV of Dahn is misusing the word "Romanian". You have this NKVD general, born in Russia in what is now Moldova, of ethnically non-Romanian parents, speaking no Romanian at the time of his mission in Soviet-occupied Romania. But Dahn resots to edit wars to call this person a "Romanian communist". (Icar 14:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<li>The comment of revert claimed "he was Romanian" while the text didn't claim otherwise, so, why revert something that's <b>not incorrect</b> using an argument <b>that doesn't apply</b> and a fishy argument too as you'll see in my next point.</li>
<li>Secondly: that "he was Romanian" is an incomplete and misleading claim. While the Manual of Style recommends to list the nationality of the person when the person gained public notoriety, it provides a coveat: "in <b>normal</b> case". This is not a normal case: born in Russia (therefore Russian national or "subject") gained Romanian citizenship automatically and then the Soviet one and spied for Soviets against Romania. <b>Do you know if he gave up Soviet citizenship?</b> The fact that he lived in Romania is not important when we talk about citizenship, I'm not aware of anybody taking his Soviet citizenship away and I'm not aware of any expiration period for Soviet citizenship, at most he held <b>dual</b> citizenship and manifested allegiance to Soviet side.

<dd>Another misleading statement, I'm not refusing to apply a guideline, I interpret them in other way than you do.

<dd>It is obviously irrelevant if he gave up his Soviet citizenship, since he was given back his original Romanian one. If you are a citizen of two countries, you are no less a citizen of each, unless you follow some special law that only applies in your world.

<p>3 you hide behind the absurdity "my lead does not say he was not Romanian" - whereas, as you read for yourself, the lead should clearly indicate what he was, not leave it to interpretation (I also "don't see" any indication that he was not from Sierra Leone, <i>but the lead is about what we all can see</i>). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 09:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's so absurd about it? Since I think I proved this is a complicated case about a guy with '<i>dual</i> citizenship and Soviet allegiance, that statement that he was Romanian is at very least misleading, the variant that I supported didn't claim anything about his citizenship. I would agree with you for clarification though exactly because the initial variant was unclear and misleading, but I don't support replacing a neutral statement that doesn't make claims about his citizenship with a misleading one (per my repeted explanations) -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 14:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea what text you were reading, but you may clearly see that no version I endorsed said "only" that. Furthermore, I have already explained that I could not have made mention of his rank, since I could not find it in the sources I used (unlike him being an agent, which was present in several and mentioned in all my versions); the moment I did find a mention in a source, I introduced it -- while I still believe that ranks (general, colonel), unlike occupations (secret service officer or some other phrasing), are not material for leads. Why? Because one is generic, the other transient (while one also includes the other). To accuse me of whitewashing is the same unsubstantiated theory you have pushed about me in the past days, and I have already answered why such allegations, aside from being intentional libel, are utterly absurd. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AdrianTM, I provided below a link to an article by Pacepa where he clarifies the NKVD rank of these brave "Romanians" and their level of knowledge of the Romanian language. (Icar 07:17, 21 February 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>Let me try and say something about this discussion (regarding the lead of the article), hopefully without fanning the flames. I tried to follow best I could the arguments back and forth, but at some point I got lost -- it's no longer clear to me what the argument is about, at least regarding the specifics of this article. So here's something that may help unblock the situation: When the article was selected for <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a>, on January 2, 2007 (see <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_115_d522.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions 115">here</a>), following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Did_you_know&amp;diff=97092471&amp;oldid=97091549" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Did_you_know&amp;diff=97092471&amp;oldid=97091549" rel="nofollow">nomination</a> by <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a>, the announcement said, and I quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[Did you know] ... that despite being a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> citizen and a confirmed <a href="../../../n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a> agent, <b><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandru_Nicolschi_da66.html" title="Alexandru Nicolschi">Alexandru Nicolschi</a></b> served as head of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Romania_f8e9.html" title="Communist Romania">Communist Romania</a>'s <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securitate.html" title="Securitate">secret police</a>?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, does anyone disagree with any of the information in this announcement? (Well, technically, Nicolschi was only deputy director, not director, but I don't think this is where the bone of contention is.) If not, how about trying to follow (more-or-less) the wording of the announcement in the lead of the article?</p>
<p>By the way, my natural inclination is to stay away from fights, for a variety of reasons. But I got jolted by the comment one of you made today on one of the talk pages: "in our (Romanian) mentality when confronted with such situations: we mark a big Cross sign and keep away". How very true. So let's not do that, but instead, let's just get the job done, rigorously and in good faith, and move on.

<dd>Great! So far, we agree that Grunberg was not born in Romania and that he was not ethnically Romanian with Romanian not his mother tongue; that he was a spy for SU against Romania; that he was an NKVD general. Now it is also true that he lived part of his youth in Romania and that he may have been at some point a Romanian citizen, although his citizenship by choice was Soviet. Does this make him "Romanian"? For me it is a strong NO. (Icar 07:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree. Moreover, we have no proof that he gave up his Soviet citizenship at any point in life (or that USSR took that away from him). -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 07:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you go back to the very top of this discussion page, you will see that one of the very first sources I used for starting the page on Nicholschi was <a href="http://www.tiuk.reea.net/9/oprea.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tiuk.reea.net/9/oprea.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> by <a href="../../../../ro/m/a/r/Marius_Oprea_d290.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Marius_Oprea">ro:Marius Oprea</a>. From what I can tell, he is a quite respected Romanian historian (probably deserving his own entry on en.wiki). Kind of unfortunately, though, the title of his article (reminiscent of Boris Vian's well-known novel) is not quite suited for encyclopaedic usage, so the reference had to go. But the article itself is a treasure-trove on info on the subject--I wish I could use it for the related article on <a href="../../../g/h/e/Gheorghe_Pintilie_4a75.html" title="Gheorghe Pintilie">Gheorghe Pintilie</a>, which was started recently by <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">Dpotop</a>, and which I've been busily editing lately (I will need to get hold of other books and articles published by Oprea, but I don't have the time right now). At any rate, let me bring at least to this talk page a quote from Oprea's readily available article, which pertains directly to one of the heated arguments on this talk page -- what exactly was Nicholski's (and, incidentally, Pintilie's) role in the Soviet intelligence services (mainly, the NKVD, but the names changed over time, so one needs to be careful if using a specific name such as this one):</p>
<dl>
<dd>In cazul lui Pintilie Gheorghe, mai mult decit atit: ca si Alexandru Nicolschi, el nu era un agent al serviciilor de spionaj sovietice, ci era ofiter rezident al acestora.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So how to read this info? First of all, I think this is yet another confirmation that Nicholschi was an NKVD officer, not just merely a low-level agent. More importantly, it says he was a "rezident" (in well-established Soviet terminology, the word is also used now in English, exactly the same way, as is "rezidentura"). This was a much higher -- and more important -- level in the organizational scheme. I think this aspect is worth looking into more carefully. (Not sure whether he was only a colonel, or whether he did indeed reach the rank of general, but that's not that important, although it would be good to have exact confirmation on this sticky point.) By the way, I added on the Pintilie page another reference by Oprea, which in turn is mentioned in a book published by <a href="../../../../ro/s/t/e/Stej%C4%83rel_Olaru_e115.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Stejărel_Olaru">ro:Stejărel Olaru</a>, yet another Romania historian who seems quite knowledgeable (and may deserve a wiki page, too). I put a link to the pdf file of Olaru's book, if anyone wants to look at it more carefully, I think there may very well be more relevant info in there. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 16:30, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you. That could certainly clarify stuff. Nevertheless, I don't see any connection to his citizenship isue - to which, btw, Oprea also makes references. Him being a Soviet resident officer/agent/colonel/general/clown still does not involve the fact that he was also (and for longer) Romanian. I have made references to both allegiances in my version, and, no matter how one changes, the other will still be valid and consistent with NPOV. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I cannot comment on the citizenship issue -- my guess is as good as anyone's else. But it seems to me that too much effort is put in that direction, and not enough in other matters pertaining to the subject. My main interest in starting this article was the connection of Nikolski (that's how I remembered the name being referred to many, many years ago) to the infamous Piteşti experiment, and the realization that he was a bigger fish than I'd thought, having not been just involved at Piteşti, but also at the Canal. (Incidentally, that article, you may remember, basically did not even mention the biggest forced labor camps in Romanian history, an omission which seemed so outrageous to me, that it was one the main reasons I joined wikipedia -- it's a bit like having an article about the village of <a href="../../../o/%C5%9B/w/O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim.html" title="Oświęcim">Oświęcim</a> and only mention in one sentence that there used to be a camp nearby; and, by the way, there still is no separate article on the Canal camps, which is something I plan to correct at some point if I get the energy). At any rate, back to Nicholschi: my personal opinion is that the focus should be on his leading role in the repression apparatus, and what he did at Piteşti and at the Canal (something he was never taken to task for, as the article briefly mentions). This, more than anything else, defines the man and his impact on countless lives at the time (I know personally survivors of those camps, and I heard from them some of what happened there, which was really terrible). In all these discussions, I would urge everyone involved to keep this fact in mind, and not lose track of it. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 15:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I personally see nothing wrong in that. Generally, I expand leads in proportion to the articles: if you feel this is incomplete, you can and could've added to it at any point. The issues I have with the article so far concern not what has not been added to the lead as much as what was subtracted from it - based on various appeals to emotion. I suppose neither this article or those related to it are complete (or existing), but I deal with this things one at a time (and have done all that I could do so far). I want to add again that I based this article on what sources had to say in the way they said it, so both emphasis and lack of it are to be understood in the light of that. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 16:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I also hope you are not implying that it is my fault for not having used all available sources: as you may see by actually reading the article, information on Nicolschi's implication in both crimes is already clearly present (not to say that this is exhaustive, just wondering what you're talking about). Much of that is my direct or indirect contribution (for one, as Turgidson was kind enough to admit, it was one of my edits in another article which first made mention of Nicolschi's recorded presence at the Canal).

<dd>Thanks for the additional info -- and really, I'm not looking here for any fight, or to assign blame, or to claim credit, or to argue about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, or anything like that. The whole point of my remarks has been completely the opposite -- to try and move forward, get more info on the subject, and round up the picture, in a scholarly fashion. Can we please take that as a given, assume good faith all around, and focus the discussion, so that we can all get back to doing something more productive as regards this encyclopedia?</dd>
<dd>So let me comment on the one concrete new fact presented in the above paragraphs: the testimony of Adriana Georgescu. Yes, I also became aware of that (independently) last night, and added a paragraph about it in a newly-created section in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_anti-communist_resistance_movement.html" title="Romanian anti-communist resistance movement">Romanian anti-communist resistance movement</a> (called Repression). I used a different source: a book (in English) by Dennis Deletant (which surely can be complemented by the reference that <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> brings -- it's always better to have more sources). By the way, Deletant also mentions Nicolschi giving the order to kill 7 prisoners in transit to Gherla prison, in July 1949. I would have liked to add this info to the article on Nicolschi, but unfortunately further editing of the article is prohibited <i>sine die</i> by the powers-that-be. Is there any way this situation can be resolved, or is the page locked till hell freezes over? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 22:29, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexandru_Nicolschi_5b54.html" title="Edit section: Dahn's arguments about Nicolschi citizenship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dahn's arguments about Nicolschi citizenship</span></h2>
<p>Let me clarify the points for those users reading this, and establish what is relevant here, once and for all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolschi was a Romanian citizen from the age of 7 to the age of 23 (or thereabouts). A resident of Imperial Russia, he was probably a Russian citizen from his birth and until the age of 2 (if Jews were indeed granted citizenship in Imperial Russia), and probably had no clear status from the age of 2 until the age of 7. He was a resident of Bessarabia throughout the period, and, when Bessarabia joined Romania, could not have obtain his citizenship if he wanted to - the law in place prevented Jews from obtaining it, and all people of all other ethnicities became Romanian citizens in the space of those years. This changed by the time he was 7, when the law was discarded. His citizenship was withdrawn from him through an abusive measure that involved all Jews of this country (this is not meant to justify him in any way, but abusive is abusive). He was again a citizen from ca.1945 to the moment of his death.</li>
<li>as mentioned, he was ethnically Jewish. However, this is already present in the text in its proper place (per wikipedia conventions) and is entirely irrelevant to the debate - lest for small details such as the ones above, which no source finds relevant enough to list. My fellow Romanian contributors do not make a distinction between nationality (Romanian, Soviet) and ethnicity (Jewish) - somebody is not less of a Romanian citizen for being ethnically Jewish, Hungarian, etc. It is largely irrelevant how much of the language he could speak, since this was not a requirement in his receiving his citizenship. Again, his citizenship is a neutral fact, voiced neutrally, and not subject to personal assessments.</li>
<li>he was <i>also</i> a Soviet citizen, as the text in the way I wrote it <i>clearly indicates</i>. Invariably, he was a Romanian citizen for much more than he was a Soviet one (about fifteen years more). He had double citizenship for the final 50 years of his life, and continued (unfortunately, one would have to say) to reside in Romania during that period. As was noted, he achieved his sinister notoriety in this country, not any other. Nicolschi was a high ranking member of the Romanian Communist Party in the 1930s (currently, the text has an error - it should be "1930s" instead of "late 1920s" - the source describes a succession of events, and I got confused in the chronology); in 1940, he and all other Bessarabians became de facto Soviet citizens - in the Soviet Union's view, they were so de jure.</li>
<li>the mention of his ranks in the NKVD/SMERSH/MGB relies on a vague mention in a single source. I am not saying that the text is inaccurate, just that it is unclear - it specifies he was a colonel in the NKVD, but simply mentions him as "by then a general" in a subsequent paragraph that refers to a period when <i>we know for sure</i> Nicolschi was a Securitate general. The text could just as easily contrast this mention with another one made just above it, according to which Nicolschi was a local troop leader in the Romanian police force.</li>
<li>much of the other arguments brought up against me here, aside from the crude personal attacks, refer to untenable assumptions and logical fallacies. Arguments such as "x killed y number of Romanians, therefore he cannot be Romanian" are not worth answering to. Arguments such as "the mention of his citizenship is meant to badmouth Romania and its people" are not worth answering to. Arguments such as "he also had another citizenship", "his language skills were poor", "his original name was not Romanian-sounding", are equally non sequiturs.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing: a DYK entry that centered on a particular, if arguably intended, paradox (a person with double citizenship heading the internal secret service of another country) cannot be cited as a template for a lead, and cannot avoid the fact that he was a Romanian citizen for most of his life. That is the topic of the debate, and not finding a formulation in the mention of basic truths about Nicolschi is avoided, no matter what that formulation will rely on!</p>
<p>If one feels the need to reply to the above, I urge that person to do it separately, and not to split my message. Thank you. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 09:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please use this advice yourself, so far you inserted your comments wherever you liked. You cannot expect many people to read your novel here. You are surely a good reasearcher, please choose a history journal for your prose. Just to solve your paradox a few lines above: Grunberg (fraudulently called Nicolschi) had nothing Romanian except for allegedly holding Romanian citizenship by accident a few years before 1940, and then for being a NKVD general sent to Romania. Do you have proof that he was a Romanian citizen at all?! Whatever papers the occupation government-disguised as "Romanian" (in fact, a NKVD government) - gave to agents like him cannot be seriously considered. You may not have noticed but in december 2006 Romania's president declared the communist regime "ilegal" and "criminal". This applies first of all to the likes of "Nicolschi" and "Pintilie". You believe that length of arguments can compensate for lack of substance. Many other editors expressed their point of view. None agrees that "Nicolschi" was Romanian. Your "arguments" have been already refuted. (Icar 14:00, 22 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Wikipedia seems to work by ad populum, LOL... anyway I agree it's not important how many people think that, what's important is that some arguments were refuted or so I think, for example "he was <i>also</i> a Soviet citizen, as the text in the way I wrote it <i>clearly indicates</i>" sorry, but I don't think it's that "clear", somebody who reads the lead which starts with "was a Romanian Communist" leaves with impression that he was a Romanian who happened to spy for Soviets, not a <b>dual</b> citizen, NKVD colonel sent to Romania with a mission. Maybe is a question of how the stress is placed in the lead, but I don't find it quite "clear", that's all, as long as it mention <b>all</b> the relevant facts is fine by me. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 01:09, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point is... was he a "Romanian Communist who was also a Soviet agent and officer" or he was a "Soviet spy and NKVD (or secret service) officer sent in Romania with a mission"? Both are technically correct (I think we agree on that, plus or minus the "NKVD" part which we can discuss in other thread) however they do convey different meaning (it's not about using illustrations and rhymes). I understand that you'd consider the second one POVish, but to me the first variant seems just equally biased in the other direction. Maybe I'm still under the impression of "actually a Romanian from Bessarabia" kind of thing from other article which to me was clear POV pushing... and can't see this one as the balanced and style complying lead that you consider it is. Please let's wait for other opinions because this way we'll provoke each other and continue this endlessly since you can't convince me that's "clear enough" I'm not going to convince you that is not.

<dd>Since he was a Romanian citizen for most of his life, there is nothing but POV in implying otherwise. No matter how strong you feel about it, this is not up for debate, and, aside from being <i>a fact</i>, is consistent with wikipedia conventions.

<dd>He was Soviet citizen most of his life too, and most importantly he was born as a Russian citizen (I will research that to see if I can find any evidence, but it's only common sense since he was born in Russian Empire). -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 20:17, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is only one "most of his life" in this instance. Moreover, indicating both citizenships in articles having to do with dual citizens is the widespread practice on wikipedia. As for "Russian citizenship" and "common sense", inform yourself on the legal concept of Jewish emancipation (the same reason why, by default, a Jew was not a Romanian citizen at any point between the Wallachian-Moldavian Union and 1921). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dahn, first of all thank you for being informative and trying to make a rational argument for the first time without being dismissive to other people, although the last paragraph kind of spoils it... you behave like the proverbial cow who gives good milk, but at the end because she's too proud kicks the bucket and spills the milk over, therefore I will just largely ignore the last paragraph, I will address only the strawman that you built there: the issue is like this, we don't "judge" him if he was a "good Romanian" or not, everything that he did, a Romanian could have done too, there's no debate there (with the amendment that Romanians are usually not that effective in what they do, as this page witnesses&#160;;-). The point is and I think I'm repeating myself that he was <b>born a foreign citizen</b> (non-Romanian ethnic too, but that's only collateral to this discussion) and <b>he came in Romania as a Soviet spy</b>, that needs to be mentioned in the lead because it's the most defining thing for the guy, he's not just the regular Romanian who decided to spy for Soviets, he came in Romania as a NKVD colonel together with other NKVD officers (that's the heck of a difference, don't you agree?) As for the rank we have reference that he was at least a NKVD colonel, that's defining for the guy too, in all the leads about military persons the rank is mentioned, e.g. "Patton was a general in US Army", we need to say that he was a NKVD colonel because that's what made him a "personality" without that he would have been a big nobody. It's also a matter of where we put the stress, he's not just the regular Romanian who decided to spy for Soviets, <b>he was a Soviet, NKVD colonel who came to Romania undercover to take over the country</b> (that collaborates with what the his other associates were: Soviets, NKVD officers, etc)
<dl>
<dd>Again, I do not answer to ad hominems and other conclusions you draw about my charcter or supposed views. Suffices to say that I have already answered with these points a long time ago, while you are merely beating around the bush. Your statement is contradicted by the fact that he did not have any citizenship before the Romanian one (prove me wrong) and that his he held the Romania citizenship for the longer part of his life. Make me repeat myself, why don't you? The appeal to probability indicating what I would agree with <i>about</i> his citizenship weighs naught on the simple matter of him being a Romanian citizen to begin with. Furthermore, the lead as I wrote it also mentions his Soviet alliegiance in clear words, but does not impose a POV on the matter. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:06, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Concerning the last paragraph in my previous post (the first one of this section): AdrianTM has not only brought up some of those arguments himself (the ethnicity stuff), but he should have made note of the fact that these have been brought up consistently by a certain user (who made mention of Nicolschi's language skills and wrote the completly inappropriate and irrelevant remark about "how brave a Romanian Nicolschi was" - ironically, since AdrianTM scolds me for not having seen that the purpose here is not to "'judge' him if he was a 'good Romanian' or not", and inflammatory, since the straw man alleges I would imply that or even care if he was a "brave Romanian"). It was to <i>these</i> I was bringing attention to <i>there</i>, just so we don't continue dragging appeals to emotion into this discussion (or any other). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me quote you: "A resident of Imperial Russia, he was probably a <b>Russian citizen from his birth</b> and until the age of 2". As for dealing with "probabilities" -- that's pretty much certain, when somebody is born gets a citizenship (the claim that he gain Romanian citizenship back is also a "probability", do you have a copy of the act that he got it back?) -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 17:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For one, you did not prove that he did have Russian citizenship, which is what I asked (as you may easily find out, Jews in Russia were emancipated in 1917, when Bessarabia was in a very murky situation regrding political control, and when Nicolschi was already two years of age; I'm also not sure that the concept of citizenship was automatically extended to children back then - given that, in Russia especially, adults were entirely responsible their offspring, even their unmarried daughters of age 30 and so). You also did not address the fact that he had Romanian citizenship for the rest of his life - see Oprea for a mention of him receiving his citizenship back (the fact is also consistent with mentions in several other sources - for one, it is virtually imposible that he could have worked for the Romanian Kingdom's police forces without holding Romanian citizenship...). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:31, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That sentence only implies that you suspect us (as evidenced by your comments, and if I didn't get that right please correct me) that we try to discuss if he was a good Romanian or not, I discussed his ethnicity mostly in <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securitate.html" title="Securitate">Securitate</a> article as a <b>collateral factor</b> to the discussion, relevant in the sense that if he were a Romanian ethnical then the sentence "actually a Romanian from Bessarabia" would have made some sense. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 01:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What's not proper about your quote?

I'm not sure <b>where</b> you see a straw man or somebody implying or accusing <b>you</b> that you "imply that or even care if he was a 'brave Romanian'" I read Icar's post only as a distaste with Nicolschi not as a strawman against you.

<dd>As for which rank: colonel or general, I'd say let's use colonel because that's something which is clear referenced (and even if he was general at some point he was a colonel before too). Can you deny he was a NKVD colonel? -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 16:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I can deny he was a general. I can also deny he was "of the NKVD" (since that would be chronologically absurd). This is precisely why I used "Soviet agent and officer" - one could improve that to say "Soviet agent and secret service officer", or "colonel", if need be (though, as I have said, I'm not sure this is compliant with wikipedia norms). This means that an article is expected to be as relevant as possible to the unfamiliar user.

<dd>Quit being nasty, I read the post entirely, I pointed that your argument was against an argument I didn't make in this post (actually it was a question, <b>not</b> an argument, and the question is still unanswered as far as I'm concerned). Pacepa did say he was colonel <b>of NKVD</b> it's irrelevant that at some point NKVD changed its name, yes, at that point he was no longer colonel of NKVD, but he <b>was</b> before (I asked you if you can deny that). I also think I already explained that ranks are mentioned as a norm in Wikipedia for military people and I think that's a relevant enough fact to be placed in the intro. If you don't think so, that's fine, that's your opinion, this is mine. Shall we see if other people have other opinions or should we continue to be nasty one to another? Maybe somebody can come with better documentation too -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 00:39, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For one, NKVD is <i>colloquially</i> used as a reference for other Soviet services (just as KGB is casually used for the present Russian one). Therefore, Pacepa makes no clear claim that he was actually a colonel from back in the days of the NKVD (he would have had to climb through the ranks at a remarkably rapid pace), just indicating that he rose to this rank inside the secret service (as early as the NKVD or later - note that he also mentions the SMERSH). The Patton article is not a featured one, and its lead is not compliant with norms (for one, it does not begin with a clear mention of his nationality - arguably, because Anglo-Saxons think that English-language wikipedia was produced with either America or the UK in mind). Now, if you will find me a guideline in use for this, I will concede on this isue - I could not find one myself (I urge you to read these words in my post again: "one could improve that to say 'Soviet agent and secret service officer', or 'colonel', if need be", plus the part immediately following this). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 00:49, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me add my further 2 cents to this discussion. I found yet another reference on the subject, hitherto not quoted: the book "Scurtă istorie a securităṭii", by Gabriel Catalan and Mircea Stănescu; excerpts can be found <a href="http://www.asymetria.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=210" class="external text" title="http://www.asymetria.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=210" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Let me quote the part relevant to this discussion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>O altă instituţie care a fost trecută sub controlul partidului a fost Corpul Detectivilor, unitate a Ministerului de Interne alcătuită acum din cadre comuniste şi din vechi poliţişti, transformată radical prin reorganizarea din 14 martie 1945. În fruntea ei este numit Alexandru Nikolschi. Boris Grünberg, alias Alexandr Sergheevici Nikolski, cetăţean român de origine evreiască, membru al Komsomol şi UTC al PCR din anul 1932, a fost instruit de KGB şi trimis pe teritoriul României pentru spionaj.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So these guys say Nicolschi became a Romanian citizen at some point, but they don't specify when (in 1932? in 1945?) One new piece of info here is that he not only joined the UTC in 1932 (as the article states, and this confirms), but also the Komsomol. At the same time? Well, this is unusual, but again, it makes some kind of weird sense in this context, where so many things are unusual. Note though that these authors use the ahistorical term KGB (instead of correct NKVD for that time), but that is a common enough mistake, so I wouldn't read much into it. At any rate, some more food for thought -- see what you guys think. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 03:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can see, him having Soviet citizenship before 1945 is not even up for debate. If you would look through Oprea, you will see mention of him: having served in the Romanian Army in the 2nd Communications Regiment, and being discharged as a corporal in 1940 (in fact, this seems to prove that he was not even withdrawn his citizenship 1938 to 1940); having worked for the Romanian Police after March 1945 (I wish I were presented with a case where any other foreign citizen was allowed to be a Romanian policeman); having received back his Romanian citizenship sometime after 1944 (I will repeat it here that the paradox of his status in Communist Romania, per the DYK, was not of "having Soviet citizenship", but of "<i>also</i> having Soviet citizenship"). Note on the Komsomol issue: there doesn't have to be an "at the same time" - the man was a Soviet citizen in 1940, and he probably joined the Komsomol at that time. Oprea only mentions the UTC and the regional wing of the PCR in Bessarabia (I interpret the latter to be in reference to what Tismăneanu mentions about the Politburo). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:11, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Basically I support Turgidson's proposal to use the sentence that was used in "did you know?" announcement:</p>
<pre>
"Soviet citizen and a confirmed NKVD agent, Alexandru Nicolschi served as head of Communist Romania's secret police" 
</pre>
<ul>
<li>He was was Soviet citizen at the moment he entered Romania and at the moment he became "famous" to my knowledge he was Soviet citizen till his death.</li>
<li>He was <b>dual</b> citizen, but he was Romanian <b>only by accident</b>: the region where he was born was part of Russian Empire and now is part of Moldova, it was only temporarily part of Romania. Usually, the allegiance is irrelevant, but in this discussion and in this case of dual citizenship I think it is telling that he was spying for Soviets against Romania. it would be unfair and unbalanced to describe him as first and foremost a Romanian. I'm perfectly fine with: "Soviet and Romanian citizen" or "Dual citizen, Soviet and Romanian" (whatever sounds better).</li>
<li>Moreover, he was born as a non-Romanian citizen, most likely Russian (I admit that we need a reference here) but what's sure is that he <b>was not</b> Romanian citizen by birth.</li>
<li>Style issue -- Wikipedia calls for a standard description in "usual cases" I think I proved this is not an usual case: an NKVD colonel sent in Romania to spy for Soviets who took over the country together with other NKVD colleagues and high officers (at this point it's not even important if he got his Romanian citizenship back after it was retracted, since <b>nobody could have opposed his demand</b>, he was part of the Russian occupier apparatus and he took active part in crashing the Romanian resistance).</li>
<li>NKVD agent/colonel. -- he was NKVD agent that's also a defining characteristic, the fact that NKVD changed names couple of times might be confusing, but what's clear is that he <b>was</b> NKVD agent at some point in time (unless somebody can come with some proof that he wasn't, there are many sources that talk about his connection with NKVD). Again, talking about style, <b>can anyone find an article about a military person where his rank and which army or service he belonged to are not mentioned in the lead?</b> Also, if a guy changed sides, for example if a colonel in German Army became general in French army (while French and German Army were at war), wouldn't that be worth mentioning? Representing such a guy only as "a Frenchman, general in French Army, spy for Germans" would be misleading, more appropriate would be to list the ranks and where he belonged historically "German, colonel in German Army... and general in French Army".</li>

<dd>Virtually all of the above message is pretentious and self-contradictory, while most of the arguments don't even apply to the text (the "French colonel" stuff, is, as proven by Adrian's own points <i>just above it</i>, a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_analogy.html" title="False analogy">false analogy</a>). What AdrianTM is basically telling readers is that he hates to see the text telling you that Nicolschi was Romanian, even though he admits Nicolschi was Romanian... Whether AdrianTM thinks that this should be encapsulated in a vague phrase that would also reflect his and his pals' blatant POV is, obviously, of no importance to this project (or any other, except perhaps colloquial posts on various forums). Repeating this stuff about what "feels wrong" with the text will not make him seem more right. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:56, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"AdrianTM is basically telling readers is that he hates to see the text telling you that Nicolschi was Romanian" -- <b>Not quite:</b> I don't have a problem with saying that he's a Romanian as long as it's mentioned <b>first</b> that he was a Soviet, NKVD officer sent into Romania with a mission.... and yeah he was Romanian too. And why is that a false analogy (just curious, I don't care too much about that analogy, I wrote it as an afterthought)? I also challenged you and others to find a lead about any notable military person which doesn't mention rank. It's also important to say on which side he was first, escuse me for being picky, but to me it's highly relevant that he was a NKVD colonel before becoming general in Securitate.

<p>Now that I understand better Dahn's goal of tarnishing the image of Romania and its people, it makes sense why he tried to convince other editors to drop the non-Romanian names of the NKVD founders of the Securitate. His argmuent ("let them have the names they chose for themselves") is fallacious: there exist legal procedures for changing one's name but I have not seen any hint that they were followed by Grunberg, Bodnarenko or Mazurov. Also these were occupation agents, not normal people. Dropping the true name is intentionally misleading. At some point in their lives, these foreigners chose Romanian names because they were sent to Romania by the NKVD, but it could have been Polish or Czech names if the mission were in those countries. All that mattered (like for Dahn today) was to hide their true identity for the success of their mission. I propose to emphasize these names and refer to the "romanized" versions Nicolschi and Pintilie as conspirative names, sort of spy games. (Icar 07:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>The issue raised by Icar is interesting and I cannot but follow AdrianTM’s suggestion of searching what the <i>legal status</i> of his Romanian name was. I have however some problems with your argumentation style, Icar. You are making imprudent allegations, like those claiming that Dahn has a goal of “tarnishing the image of Romania and its people”. Honestly, I don’t know if he has such an explicit goal, though I could guess a certain idiosyncrasy to displayed Romanianism. Even if it’s true and he really has this goal in mind, you shouldn’t accuse him of that. It’s simply not politically correct. Never forget NPOV, NPA, never forget that you are here on Anglo-Saxon cultural territory. BTW, phrases like “tarnishing the image of Romania and its people” read at least naïve if not primitive against the background I’ve just mentioned. Such a discourse makes you and others editors vulnerable. Don’t let you become a target of ironies and be depicted as a primitive Romanian nationalist. I understand very well that this is far of being true, but don’t provide ammunitions to get shot. Wikipedia says to assume good faith, I ‘d add, yes, but be prepared for the worst faith. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintila_Barbu_9193.html" title="User:Vintila Barbu">Vintila Barbu</a> 09:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vintila Barbu, in case you have that particular problem with understanding my arguments, I will lay them down for you here. As the author of 95% of this article, I introduced the qualified sources referring to his activities, NKVD spying alike. I edited on the basis of the sources, something which is apparently new to you - I said what they allowed me to say. I could find no confirmation that he was an NKVD officer (or, at least, don't remember reading one so far), simply because these were the sources I used. At no point did I deny or confirm that he <i>was</i> one, just that this had not been mentioned.</dd>
<dd>All of this is besides the point, since the claim made by Icar, and previously made by Adrian TM is that he was an NKVD <i>general</i>. To this goal and this goal only, Icar used as "evidence" a text that <i>does not</i>, in all actuality, say that.

<dd>I don't see any indication that he was a general of <i>any</i> Soviet agency. On the rest, my version has: "agent and officer". You sem unable to read the text through: you will find an anser to your question there. I owe a similar answer to Vintila Barbu, who keeps claiming that Nicolschi had "no responsability in the Romanian Communist Party" - incidentally, he was <i>a member of the Politburo</i> in the 1930s, if Vintila Barbu would actually care to read what he criticizes. I'm pretty much done answering to false dilemmas: argue something that is based on reality, and we'll talk. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 19:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In the text it says he was general. I misinterpreted fist time too, but if you read again you'll see that Pacepa said that he was NKVD colonel at one point and then when he talks about subsequent period: "by now a general". -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 04:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually: I also see a indication that he was a police officer in the Romanian services, and then a general. This is consistent with other sources, who point out that he was promoted a general around that date. Unless you can prove that the mention is about the NKVD, you make no point. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 09:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dahn has the WP:OWN syndrome. I think explaning things to him is a waste of time. In this case, Pacepa says it clearly: Grunberg-Nicolschi was a NKVD colonel. Later on he says "Nicolschi, by then a general". Dahn is really an extreme case. (Icar 11:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

The revelation of seeing how my contribution is evaluated by a fellow editor is quite dispiriting to me. I was under the impression that Wikpedia is a collaborative effort, that no one "owns" an article, and that we are all supposed to work together in creating and improving content.

<dd>Turgidson, for what it's worth, I'm sorry. First of all, I did not mean to say that I created or owned the article or that I had any right to it. Don't take me out of context: what I was answering to was an absurd and insulting allegation that I come here and "hide" stuff about Nicolschi, in an article where I have contributed most. I thought it just happened to be about 95%, which means nothing in itself - it was not under any circumstances meant as self-promotion, and it did not implicate either the value of your work or the collaborative effort of the project itself. 95% was probably exaggerated, but hope you will see that it was not in my intent to insult your contributions.

<dd>I wonder if collective <i>"hit and run"</i> edits made with the obvious intention of avoiding 3RR rule and “winning” edit wars, fall under the incidence of any WP norms. <b>Could someone check ?</b> What is troubling, is the collective and organized character of this action. As long as "edit wars" take place between normal editors engaged in working on an article, this is regrettable but understandable. However, if things really are what they seem to be, here we have to do with organized collective action aimed at undermining the very spirit of Wikipedia. Alarming for me is the mentality behind this, which evokes what Romanian criminalists call “rezoluţie infracţională” and their German colleagues call “kriminelle Energie”.

<p>I found another article about Nicolschi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miruna Munteanu, <a href="http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2003-06-28&amp;id=121181&amp;ziua=70055e94e7df1175ca46cb85f3f7c2ef" class="external text" title="http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2003-06-28&amp;id=121181&amp;ziua=70055e94e7df1175ca46cb85f3f7c2ef" rel="nofollow">"Sinistrul Nicolschi"</a>, <i><a href="../../../z/i/u/Ziua.html" title="Ziua">Ziua</a></i>, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article contains all sorts of information -- some simply corroborating what we know, but much completely new. The article is pretty well written, I think, and is based on research by historian Cristian Troncota, who apparently had access to the SSI dossier of Nicolschi. Among the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolschi did his military service in Iaşi in 1937-39, where he became corporal. (This seems to reinforce the case that he had become Romanian citizen by then: hard to imagine one could serve in the Romanian Army -- or any other Army, for that matter -- without being citizen...)</li>
<li>By the way, the article as it now stands says Nicolschi was "elected to the internal Politburo" "by the late 1920s". This does not sound very likely to me: he was only 14 in 1929. Who would elect someone that age to the Politburo? Maybe late 1930s is meant?</li>
<li>His initial contact with Soviet intelligence was with a man named Kasenberg ("Blondul") from Chişinău.</li>
<li>He became member of the PCR in 1937.</li>
<li>The Munteanu article says he crossed the border on May 16, 1941 (not May 26). Can we double-check?</li>
<li>He had 13,450 lei on him when he was caught. Anyone knows how significant a sum that was at the time? Sounds non-negligible to me.</li>
<li>The investigation into his activities was done June 6-12, 1941 by Lt.-Col. Emil Velciu. This is when Nicolschi confessed he was a Soviet spy, recruited by Capt. Andreev. Note that this confirms one of the categories we have on Nicolschi ("Admitted Soviet spies"), to which only 7 people worldwide belong!</li>
<li>He was sentenced to life in prison on August 7, 1941.</li>
<li>Before going to Aiud, he spent some time in prison at Ploieşti.</li>
<li>Apparently, he was set free on August 24 (not August 28) 1944, through Royal Decree #1624 -- can this be double-checked?</li>
<li>On April 9, 1946, it was Nicolschi who took charge of Ion Antonescu, Mihai Antonescu, and other high-ranking prisoners, escorted back from Moscow by Soviet Lt. Col. Rodin. (Clearly, Nicolschi was already a senior figure by then.) This is an interesting vignette, I think.</li>
<li>In 1954, Alexandru Drăghici had information about Nicolschi, according to which Nicolschi was drawing (at the time) a salary from the Soviet Embassy in Bucharest and that he was (implictly) a KGB officer. This sounds like strong evidence to me that Nicolschi had maintained his ties with the Soviet Union (and, one could reasonably argue, his Soviet citizenship) even at that late date. (I'm not saying that the case is 100% clear, just making a reasonable inference).</li>
<li>He retired on a pension of 4,200 lei a month.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, but as long as the page is blocked, this seems rather futile. So let me ask again: is there a valid reason for keeping this page blocked indefinitely, while new information is coming up? Is there any admistrator reading these messages, and, if so, could some response be forthcoming? Or is this hopeless, and should I just give up on trying to work on this article?

<dl>
<dd>Sorry again for not noticing this at the proper time. Aside from those details that can be simply passed into the text, I have some comments:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>According to Oprea, Nicolschi was "a member of the Communist Party in/of Bessarabia" (I'm quoting from memory). I've seeen this distinction made in several other places, with an indication that the Besarabian structure of the PCR was virtually an independent one, but could find no details regarding this. Note that, if this is the reason why, it could explain both of the apparently contradictory mentions in Tismăneanu and Munteanu. Concerning the date: as I have answered beforehand someplace in the above text, I misread the text I had in front on me (which does not actualy mention the date, just the office; the one date mentions in there refers to the late 1920s, and I took it as an indication that it applied to subsequent sentences - it did not, and the text most likely refers to something from the 1930s - early to late -, to which I have since changed it in the article). I would also presume it refers to the late 1930s, esopecially since most of better-known (and older) PCR activists were kept at the state's expense around that moment.</li>
<li>He was probably freed by Soviet troops and probably heard the news that he was officially free sometime afterwards.</li>
<li>Yes, he did have double citizenship, as confirmed by several sources. (As stated, I do not interpret this as weighing much on the citizenship debate.) <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, glad to see the page was unblocked -- thanks to the admin who did it. I started incorporating some of the info from the Munteanu article, but it's slow going -- I've had a bit of pain figuring out this formatting scheme for references (I usually use other ones, but now it's OK). About dates: yes, errors do occur (eg, Munteanu puts Nicolschi's joining the UTC at 1923 instead of 1932, which clearly must be a typo). There still are a couple of unresolved date conflicts, but these differ by days, not years, making them more difficult to resolve just by common sense. Also, I now see that at least one of the above facts was in the article -- the one about Nicolschi taking charge of Antonescu &amp; Co in 1946; but the added detail may still be useful. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 13:58, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All accurate detail is useful, and thanks for it. Btw, if you feel like changing the references system, I have no objection (generally, I use this one because it seeems to be the easiest one to apply, and especially the easiest way in which one can add more references to any single version). I would suppose that changing it is probably harder than working from with this one, but hopefully this doesn't mean that I [inadvertendly] twisted your hand into using it. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>After experimenting with various reference schemes (and there are at least 2 or 3 of them within wikipedia) I came to prefer the one where the referece is added in the text (as opposed to at the bottom), and then referred to in quotes. I know, it's more clumsy that way, and harder to add on later on, as you say; but the final appearance is more compact, and it's easier to follow which reference is used where (though it can be a problem if specific page numbers are used). So all in all, the case is not strong enough or clear enough right now to go against inertia, and face the pain of changing things. But I propose keeping this is mind, especially if at some point one would envisage bringing the article to a higher ranking, and planning things ahead when working on similar articles, i.e., deciding in advance which ref scheme is best suited to a given article. BTW, can a ranking (say, Start? or better?) be given already? While at it, how about trying to add a photo of the guy, as requested in a template at the top of the page? I never could find one, and even if one could find such a photograph, one would surely run into copyright issues... <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 14:29, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Specific pages are my main concern as well (though not the case here, it is a headache when somebody decides to switch from one system to another where a large book was thoroughly used as reference). I came up with a compromise in some articles, where I used your preferred system for all non-specific references together with my system for those with page numbers). Any solution is fine by me.</dd>
<dd>From what I understand, anybody can add a rating (or at least argue in favor of it on the page indicated in the template). I persoanlly never bothered with projects, and there might be a specification that this si to be done by people who did not contribute to the articles.</dd>
<dd>I too have no idea what the man looked like. When reading Oprea, I found a mention of a photo of him at the crematory (about to be cremated, that is) - this was the only indication I did see of there being a surviving recorded image of him... <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:46, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I added the info on Nicolschi and Antonescu from Munteanu's article. Note though that the dates seem to conflict with the previous ones (1946 vs 1945). I think the 1946 date is the correct one (I also added it to the Antonescu article yesterday), but maybe this is just due to some fuzz about when Antonescu was sent to Moscow, and when he returned. By the way, I think it would be good if that were to be explained more precisely and in more detail in the Antonescu article (the transition between August 23, 1944 and his trial is just too abrupt). I may do it later on, right now I probably won't have the time. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurgidson_916c.html" title="User:Turgidson">Turgidson</a> 15:10, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, by all means: a lot needs to be done about the Antonescu article. As you may have deduced from my modus operandi, I generally gather information in related articles that are bound to be shorter, then either gather it all in one place, or leave others to do it. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 15:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
