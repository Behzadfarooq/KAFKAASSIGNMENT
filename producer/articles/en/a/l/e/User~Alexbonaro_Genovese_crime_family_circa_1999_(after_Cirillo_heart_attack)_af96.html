<li>"good chart. just little thing to add is that <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Ricci_652a.html" title="Lawrence Ricci">Lawrence Ricci</a> was acting for Tino Fiumara"</li>
</ul>

<li>"The Consiglieri at that time was James "Little Guy" Ida.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Sammy Aparo was Acting Capo for <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosario_Gangi_eb18.html" title="Rosario Gangi">Rosario Gangi</a> who went to prison like a year or two earlier. Petey DiChiara was also a part of that crew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Louis Muscatellio and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Serpico_5a70.html" title="Frank Serpico">Frank Serpico</a> are part of Bellomos Crew. When Bellomo became Acting Boss, Ralph Copolla became Acting Capo. After Cirillo was taken down, Frank Serpico became Acting Boss. Not long after that Copolla was clipped and Ernest Muscarella became Acting Capo of the crew. When Serpico went down in 2001, Muscarella became the Acting Boss (before going down in 2002) and Louis Moscatellio became Acting Capo before he was busted as well. So from 1992-2002 (with the exception of that breif time Cirillo was Acting Boss in the late 90s) the Bellomo/East Harlem/Bronx Crew has been running the family. That was <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fat_Tony_Salerno_00f0.html" title="Fat Tony Salerno">Fat Tony Salernos</a> old Crew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The new Acting Capo of that Crew now is Arthur "Artie" Nigro who was just bested with Bellomo and Ardito.</dd>

<li>After Dom Cirillo's 1998 heart attack, Andrew Gigante became <i>Messaggero</i> and retained the position until his 2002 conviction. Dom Cirillo was on the shelf so to speak and became Acting Boss in 2003, until his recent conviction. As far as most law enforcement agencies go, Bobby Manna still had the official Consigliere position even after his conviction, he was basically the New Jersey faction Boss and was to respected for the Chin to demote, Ida was Acting Consigliere according to Sammy Gravano, Mikey Scars and Anthony Casso and never officially held the position, just like his brother Joey Zito was never officially Underboss, only Acting. Matty Ianiello is one of the most powerful and respected Capos in the Family and had been released from prison since his 1985 conviction and was made Acting Boss in 1997 after Bellomo's conviction. Ralph Coppola was made Acting Capo of Bellom'o crew in 1992 and hit in 1998, then Ernest Muscarella took over after Coppola was killed in 1998, and was placed on the Ruling Panel with Frank Serpico and Alan Longo. Frank Serpico was never Acting Boss, he was promoted to Street Boss in 1998, he gave the orders to the Capos and soldiers, Matty Ianiello was Acting Boss. By late 2001 Serpico was really sick and then died in 2002 and Alan Longo went to prison, leaving Ernie Muscarella the only Ruling Panel member, so he was made Street Boss. Then he got indicted in early 2002 and eventually was sentenced to 5 years in 2003. The Street Boss started with Bellomo 1991/92-96, Serpico 1998-2001, then Muscarella 2001-2003. Like Pogo stated, I also believe Salvatore "Sammy Meatballs" Aparo took over when Rosario "Ross" Gangi was jailed in 2002, then when Aparo was jailed, Peter "Petey Red" DiChiara took over, if I'm wrong let me know because I always want to have the Capos straight, but I think Pogo agrees. You also left out Ludwig "Nini" Bruschi, a Capo in the New Jersey faction since 1998, James "Jimmy from 8th St." Messera was promoted to Capo in 1989 and Pasqule "Patsy" Parello was also a Capo by then, as a matter of fact some New York law enforcemnet say he was part of the Ruling Panel at some point in the late 1990's. You should mention the Capos in prison at the time, Michele "Mikey Domino" Generoso, Alphonse "Allie Shades" Malangone, Angelo Prisco, Salvatore "Sally Dogs" Lombardi, Tino "The Greek" Fiumara, Louis Arrechio, Rudolph "Rudy" Santobello and Mario Gigante. I know Joseph "Pepe" LaScala, Silvio DiVita, Joseph "Joe D." Dente Jr., Anthony "Tino" Antico and Renaldi "Ray" Ruggiero from Florida are all Capos now, but I don't know when they were promoted. If I'm mistaken on anything, let me know because I want to have my New York facts completely straight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark my words on one thing, if Barney Bellomo ever get's out of prison, he be the official Boss of the Genovese Family one day. His East Harlem/Bronx crew (the old Salerno/116th St. Crew that merged in late 1980's or early 1990's) has always one of the strongest and Bellomo is highly respected, has filled up a graveyard on his own and is feared throughout La Cosa Nostra.</p>
