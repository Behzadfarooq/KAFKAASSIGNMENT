<p>I don't see a POV issue here. I consider myself more pro-Yashin than just about anybody I know, and I think that the article more or less focuses on the facts and doesn't say anything untrue or unfair. If any individual editors have specific spots in mind, they're free to edit the article to remove what they see as a lack of neutrality. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 05:07, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here are a few examples of questionably NPOV sentences:
<ul>
<li>Yashin soon eclipsed Daigle as the team's brightest young star</li>
<li>the pinnacle of his career came in the 1998-99 season</li>
<li>Yashin's anger at being paid less than Daigle was probably justified since Daigle never even approached his potential.</li>
<li>his mediocre point production has led people both inside and outside the Islanders organization to question his effort and salary</li>
<li>Satan and Yashin showed signs of chemistry early in the season, but generally produced disappointing results.</li>
</ul>

<dd>According to Wikipedia's official policy, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth.</b></a> So while I'm not saying the above statements are false, they should either have citations/sources or they should be edited/removed. I guess it's fine to remove the <i>NPOV</i> tag as long as the <i>unreferenced</i> tag stays, because if proper citations/sources are added, that should take care of the NPOV problem at the same time. I will try to add some citations in the next week or so. If anyone has any good links to articles about Yashin, but doesn't want to go through the trouble of incorporating them into this article, you can just provide the links here and I'll try to work on them. --<a href="../../../m/u/%C3%A9/User%7EMu%C3%A9ro_3824.html" title="User:Muéro">Muéro</a> 05:36, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the Daigle-related statements are supported by the statistical comparisons. The same could probably be said of the "pinnacle" statement beig supported by statistics, though I'd be fine with weakening that statement. The "mediocre point production" sentence should be sourced, but it's definitely factual. Just about any NY-area article on Yashin would do as a source. The Satan/Yashin statement, while true, could be rewritten. I know that Islanders broadcasters talked about that matter a lot, but that's not really a verifiable source unless someone has tapes. More generally--and I admit that this is kind of a non-answer--I'm more concerned with untrue, inaccurate, or opinionated statements, since 90% of Wikipedia is unsourced. Naturally, though, the article should be sourced. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 06:57, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just got some links some some of the assertions. Speaking of the questionable NPOV sentences, most of them were made by sports analysts, particularly CNN Sports Illustrated. Although the use of columns is discretionary, I would say that there could be nothing else on Sen's management treatment of Daigle and Yashin. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">GoldDragon</a> 01:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not in a rush to remove the unsourced tag but I feel that most of the major points have been sourced. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">GoldDragon</a> 01:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is relevant. My inclination is that two months from now, it won't matter at all. I'd probably be inclined to remove it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 23:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't really think that the "nickname" section of the infobox is really intended for nicknames like this. I know from reading fan forums that many players receive similar punny pejorative nicknames like this from fans. I appreciate the sources, but I still question whether it's really necessary or appropriate for the article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 02:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm by no means married to it, I just saw it was removed for being poorly sourced and sourced it. His image in Ottawa is no secret, but dragging it into the article without making the whole thing tilt under POV won't happen. But yeah, if such shining Lady Byng candidates as Darius Kasparitis and Sean Avery don't merit mentions like these for their on-ice behaviour, Yashin's off-ice &amp; dressing room antics certainly don't call for it. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 03:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont think this article is written from a neutral point of view. it seems to focus alot on Yashin asking for more money and not playing to pontential so i think it should be adjusted so it says "some fans think" instead of writing it like a fact because it is more of an oppinion.64.6.202.210 01:39, 27 February 2007 (UTC)Tubyboulin</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm generally not a fan of adding clauses like "some think" onto statements that are not specifically related to fan opinion. It would be less accurate to say something like, "Some fans think Yashin held out to secure a better contract" or "some fans think Yashin's point production has declined" because the hold out and decreased point production are facts, not matters of opinion. If there are unattributed statements of opinion in the article, then they should certainly be attributed or removed. In general, I don't think it's inaccurate or unfair to focus on the controvery Yashin has created: that's what drives the coverage he gets in news publications. The New York press rarely mentions him without making reference to his contract and the less-than-stellar years he's had since signing it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 01:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>well the new york press is a bunch of idiots so i dont think we should base articles on them, and your examples are not what i meant, i meant things like " Some people think Yashin did not play to his potential" not "some fans think Yashin's point production has declined"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is there a line like that in the article? I think that there's a line about Alex Daigle not playing to his potential, but that's about as close to factual as you can get. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 03:50, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
