<p>Yeah, the page is now on my watchlist. I'm not sure why people want to delete it. I met one user who tried to delete <b>all</b> historical names from articles about Turkish cities.

<p>Slave! Yes, it was my friend <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a>. I believe he did it based on the changes to the Greek name at the <a href="../../../i/z/m/%C4%B0zmir_4158.html" title="ƒ∞zmir">ƒ∞zmir</a> article. And if you look at <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, there's no mention of Constantinople until further down in the history section. I'm not sure why historical names are such an issue for Turkish and Greek editors here‚Äîwhat's so bad about them in the first place? Look at the <a href="../../../l/v/o/Lvov.html" title="Lvov">Lvov</a> article, you don't see some huge edit war over the names there. I'm not sure what the exact problem is. No, there isn't an offical policy, I guess people just play it by ear. Well, edit wars won't happen if people use the talk page more, perhaps you could just leave a comment at the talk page, but this whole thing about the names just looks like one big reenactment of the <a href="../../../i/m/i/Imia_Kardak_eb6c.html" title="Imia/Kardak">Imia/Kardak</a> conflict on Wikipedia.&#160;;) ‚Äî<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 02:27, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ciao Alessandro</p>
<p>"Non vi √® una cosa pi√π difficile che trovare moda giusta di esprimersi in una lingua straniera." As an Italian I am sure you would find much here to improve idiomaticaly, even within this one sentence. That is pretty much what I have began to do with your article. It is really excellent. You have shown great dilligence in collating your information and sourcing it. In my changes I have tried to be faithful to the spirit of your intentions, while aiming for idiomatic clarity.</p>
<p>Examples: 1.When and where the English choose to put the word "the", seems sometimes to be a matter of custom. Thus, Raphael's fresco in the Stanze Vaticane is known as "the fire in <i>the</i> Borgo", consequently I have conformed to that custom by also putting in 'the Borgo' throught the part of the article I have edited, except in the beginning, where 'borgo' can just appear as the general name. 2. "Saint Peter", when it refers to the Basilica and not to the Saint, is always "Saint Peter's" even when the word Basilica is missing. 3. I have altered word order to conform with general usage. 4. Made changes to make the grammer conform to your meaning. In certain places I have changed a few things which would have appeared a bit strange in English; two examples in particular are: 5. Romans tombs which "reached large proportion" - I could have changed that merely to "reached large proportions" but even then the word "large" in this particular context would not be quite right, so instead I put "reached notable proportions" 6. The use of the word "apparently" with reference to the Vatican becoming established as the center of Rome. "Apparent" can mean both "evident" and "seeming", "apparently" ONLY means "seemingly". So I eliminateed the word "apparently". Personally I think it looks better without anything here, but if you really want to add emphasis you could put in the word "visibily", which is my best approximation to what I think you intended.</p>
<p>I left the last sentence of the second section as it was, because I do not understand your meaning: The whole section reads;</p>
<p>The Portica collapsed, so that Saint Peter's could be reached only by two roads, running from E. to W. of Borgo S. Spirito and Borgo vecchio. This also named "Carriera Martyrum, after the martyrs going to death in the Circus of Nero, was built on the same palace of (viz: on the site of) the Portica.</p>
<p>Ok: so the Portica was no longer usable because it collapsed, so only the Borgo S. Spirito and Borgo Vecchio could be used. BUT NOW you say "this.."&#160;: what "This" , do you mean "these" referring to the two Borgi&#160;? But you cannot be refering to them, because you suggest that the Carriera Martirum was "on the same place" as the Portica. Does this perhaps mean that there was a rebuilding activity of the Portica that you don't mention&#160;? I don't know. Please feel free to write to me, if you feel it will help, put that sentence in Italian.</p>

<p>Ciao Alex,</p>
<p>Yea, it's the Thames, I'm a Londoner. I'm also the guy who wrote to you about the Palazzo Caprini, I hadn't then worked out how to get a user name. I found the article absolutely fascinating, all that stuff about the 'boia non passa fiume' etc. I would never have known otherwise. I had edited the whole of the article, but then found that the computer decided to go caput on me, twice, so I am now doing it in chunks. I think I should give you time to digest what you've already got, but I'd like to add here one question, because it concerns the section already edited.</p>
<p>Note 4 - you say that the two Roman roads "crossed each other" at about the mid point of the via della Conciliazione. I left that bit intact, even though it would have been better to say "the two roads crossed at..", because I wasn't in fact sure if that is what you really meant. If, as you say the two roads began at the Vatican then perhaps you mean that the "two roads roads joined" (i.e. "the site of the junction at which these two roads began is...") 'crossed' means they made an <i>incrocio</i>. But perhaps that's exactly what you do mean.</p>

<p>Wow Alex, what a great thing to have been christened in Saint Peter's&#160;!!! I will finish the edit as soon as I can. Your English is extreemly good, and I am delighted to do anything I can to help`</p>
<p>Do you think it might be possible to put at the very beginning of the article a sentence something like&#160;: "The historical importance of the Borgo is that this area of Rome constitutes a forecourt to Saint Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Palace."&#160;?</p>

<p>Caio Alex, Finished copyedit. Just three small suggestions</p>
<p>1) As I understand the situation, regarding the time of the 'Avignon Papacy' The Portici or Carriera Matyrium became unusable for a time, but then, what, the rubble was cleared up, and it was used by pilgrims&#160;? Perhaps it would be more effective, as an illlustration of the decay during the time of papal absence, to just keep the bit about the one road been unusable and the other two being used, and leave it at that, otherwise the picture may become confusing.</p>
<p>2). Some of the facts regarding the palaces in the Renaissance could be pruned such as the home town of the Cardinal of Sant Clemente, or transfered to a note, such as the whole bit about the subsequent name of the Palazzo Caprini.</p>
<p>3. The section on Alexander VII and the Colonade could be very slightly expanded and given its own paragraph. Something like: Between year X and year Y Alexander had Bernini construct his Magnificent collonade. This entailed the destrution of a number of houses including the Palazzo Branconio by Raphael. Further destruction of houses also occured with the making of the piazzetta in front of the colonade. (with the appropriate references}</p>

<p>Hi Alex, I am deeply touched by the your very thoughtful gesture, it's a wonderful picture&#160;!!! I'll be looking forward to reading your new version of the Borgo. BTW I was thinking of writing eventually something on Raphael as an architect starting with the Palazzo Branconio. It's a very interesting work, as it was a house, that was dicectly visible from piazza s. Pietro, and Raphael wanted to make a statement, do something new, say 'look I can break the rules'. Up till then in designing a facade the architect would always place a column above a column, but here Raphael placed nitches directly above columns, and this was the first ever work of Mannerist Architecture. I have a book which reproduces an engraving which is a measured drawing of the facade, and i was thinking of scaning it onto Wikipedia. Would you know what the procedures are or who I could ask, I am a bit of clutz with things techical? Anway, I won't be doing this yet, as I am on the point of moving house.</p>
<p>However, notwitstanding all the other stuff i've got going, I'm thinking hard about the intro, i'll run it all by you, might be asking questions about it soon.</p>

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>I know from personal experience of some of the difficulies involved in writing in another language, on a litterary level (as oppose to colloquial). The first time when I had an article of mine published in Italian, I tried writting in Italian , they had a look at my effort, said write it in English we will translate it. The translator did a very good job, they sent me the bozze- proofs, and there was this one sentense, which was pefect Italian, but had absolutely no relationship to my meaning. Well I wrote my own version in Italian of what it was that I meant, but it didn't get changed, so now I've got an article in print, and people reading it will forever be saying, what does the author mean here&#160;?</p>
<p>Basically I was wondering If we could have a discussion in real time, this evening. I know that Zurich time is ahead of London time by an hour, so if you can at all, send me a note, giving both times to avoid comfusion. If you can't do today, give another date, I am self-employed and my shedules are fairly flexible. I was thinking we might try and get a discussion going on this page.</p>

<p>I have been going to Turkey since early 2002 - whenever I am there, although I am Greek, I refer to places by the names most likely to be understood - I will ask the way to the Feneri Isa Camii, not the monastery of Constantine Lips. I talk about Ayasofia and Kucuk Ayasofia. It is obvious that while the Turks would have called the place Ayastefanos, the name is not what it would have been called by the Greeks while they were living there in the majority. I do not write that it would not be called Ayastefanos by a Greek because you have told me that it is. I hope you can see the difference. When the time comes on the greek wiki to write about Alexandroupolis, and someone writes that it used to be called ŒùœÑŒµŒΩœÑŒµŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ¨œÑœÇ I will also argue that this should be replaced with the latin alphabet Turkish form (and even the ottoman form) for the reason that although ŒùœÑŒµŒΩœÑŒµŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ¨œÑœÇ might be close to the original, it will not be what the Turks called the city: Dedeaƒüa√ß. (the œÑœÉ transliteration for √ß, although standard, is not too good). --<a href="../../../5/t/e/User%7E5telios.html" title="User:5telios">5telios</a> 14:13, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You write <i>But are you sure that this name is not the REAL local (byzantine) name of the village?</i>
<dl>
<dd>Pretty sure - I cannot state with 100% certainty that it is not, but the Ayastefanos form overrides basic rules of adjective noun agreement which would have sat "wrong" on the ears of the byzantines (it would do so to unschooled demotic speakers, too), but which may not have been noticed by the Turks. I am only perpetuating the correspondence since you seem interested, I don't think there is any persuading to one point of view or another necessary. Stelios</dd>

<p>I have a linguistic question for you: The latin name of Bolzano is reported to be "Bauzanum". This conains the letter "z", a letter that otherwise in Latin occurs only in loan words from Greek.

<dd>Ciao Andreas,</dd>
<dd>the name <i>Bauzanum</i> is - like many in the alpin area - of celtic origin, and does not stand from the Roman times, but it is known only since the VIII Century. It should come from the farm of a Celtic man, whose name was Baudiosus. In Latin these toponyms describing rural properties get often the ending <i>-anum</i> (i.E. in Umbria, from Strabinius =&gt; Strabinianum =&gt; Stravignano: there are hundreds of name places in Italy which are built so). So, according to this theory, Baudiosanum became Baudsanum, and then Bauzanum. Another hypothesis says that the name comes from a 'Castrum Balteanum' ("Swamp Castle") from the indoeuropean word 'balt' (swamp), like in Baltic Sea.</dd>
<dd>I don't know how the 'z' was pronounced, but i will look for you about others toponyms in this region. Anyway, I strongly doubt that during the roman times there have been many toponyms with 'Z'.</dd>
