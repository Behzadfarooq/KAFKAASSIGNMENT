<li><a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 22:49, 19 July 2005 (UTC). Russian consorts need a further general consideration - This article should not be used as rallying point, as now seems happening because Deb made a controversial action, without consensus. She was known "Alexandra Fedorovna" most of her life and all her prominent life, and IT WAS her pre-marital name, as she took it before the marriage. Newspapers and books say (almost) always "Alexandra Fedorovna". There are weighty reasons why she should be at "Alexandra Fedorovna of sth" and not under any artificial "girl name" which is unknown to all but some Germans or whatever. (Remember that Wikipedia naming also favors strongly the name one was best known.) -"and by Rhine" is simply ridiculous. <s>The result of the above vote remains of course inconclusive, as there are effectively two alternatives for the heading written by the originator of the vote (and mentioned in her proposal writing), and the result (if even affirmative, which I doubt, as there are also clever people here) thus cannot mean anything precise - the precise place where to locate remains as not decided fully by the vote (this is the danger of presenting alternatives when officially proposing rename).</s>The last sentence talked about the original renaming proposition - the proposition has <b>now</b> been amended to a clear multi-thing. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 07:37, 24 July 2005 (UTC) - In my opinion, the best transliteration for the patronymic can be solved later. My vote is for the principle of having the patronymic, and I do not bind myself into any precise transliteration at this stage (actually, I do not care as long as the transliteration is reasonable). <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 09:35, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse is, as has been pointed out, misleading: we shouldn't mix and match maiden and married names. I can't resist the impulse to say: let's try not to move articles because of personal preferences. There are things about the naming conventions I don't much care for, but there's nothing I can't live with. Newcomers especially should be cautious about moving things around: it really is rather a lot of work to clean up, and it doesn't improve the Wikipedia when naming conventions are deviated from. If the naming conventions need changing, by all means present the case for that, but precipitous moves to try and force the issue make bad policy, irritated Wikipedians, and frayed nerves. It would be nice if people could manage to adopt the feeling that it is, after all, not so crucial under which title a person's article winds up (within reason!), as there will always be someone who thinks it's wrong, or wants to add their own diacritics, or an additional title, etc., and the only way we can manage to work together is to choose one.

<p>The previous vote was inconclusive precisely because it was <i>too complex</i>. The way to settle this is to do it they way they do California recall elections: <i>first</i> take a poll <i>solely</i> on the question of "keep the article at 'Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse'". If there's rough consensus to move it, then you hold <i>another</i> poll to decide what the new name should be, with each person getting <i>one</i> vote only. (I would suggest that in the interest of fairness, 'Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse' be included as an option in the second poll - that way, if the "change it" group don't agree on a different name, those who like AFoH get it back there.) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:53, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This will end up with one variant, collecting the plurality, being a winner. Such may or may not be the least unaceptable for the consensus. Actually, this would be like a political election in the democracy, which WP is not, because it goes by consensus, rather than by plurality. The only way to determine the consensus, is to allow <b>oppose</b> votes and the least opposed name would be a good preliminary indication. Then we run a <b>move</b> vote only with this single variant and see, whether it passes a regular simple move vote.

<p><b>Oppose</b>. That is not the way to do a decision. Agreeing to some move without knowing what is the result. The proposed result should be presented, and IT will be set against another in the vote. I will not accept the proposed procedure for example in a situation to change bylaws (or constituion): it is to give blank authorization to a change, not knowing what would be the result. Basically, the situation is that if there is no one specified other alternative that wins as itself against the specified incumbent, sorry, it will not be a proper decision. As to the great number of alternatives in vote, it should not have meant anything to honest voters. All voting systems are dependent on honesty (i.e. if every voter votes for all those alternatives s/he approves) - everything can go wrong otherwise. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 20:37, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That method could be a way to have this issue furthered. However we had problems in the beginnings of the ongoing vote particularly due to unfamiliarity with the voting system. There were voters who actually were asking whether they may cast more than one vote (apparently the explanations in the voting system article are not lucid enough or some did not bother to try read). So, before accepting a possibly too complicated voting system, I would ask for example Deb, Jtdirl and Choess to read carefully the IRV article and tell us whether they believe they understand how to vote and how they are counted. It wouldn't be useful for the purpose to have a vote and have important people saying that the vote is too complicated. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 10:08, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, I would like to chastice in strongest possible terms the moves taken wihout consultation irrelevant of how I see the new name<b>s</b>. As for the name, the person is best known as an empress of Russia which she was as <i>Alexandra Fyodorvna</i>, not a the German princess. But I do see a point with parenthised name, which should be then Alexandra Fyodorvna (Alix of Hesse).

<dd>Not necessarily objecting, pls check the past talk and archives on why some users claim that this emrpess qualifies as an excemtion. As for the uniletaral moves, I can nothing but agree with you. However, no direct vote will ever come up with the concensus of a single best name. I suggested a rating voting earlier. This was a very hot discussion which settled to no one's satisfaction. BTW, we can move the article back to AF of Hesse despite that is also not the best name, obviously.

<dd>Well then, since Alexandra and Mary were both <b>Empresses of India</b>, should they be part of the exception too? Not being serious there, BTW.

<p>The issue with Russian empresses is that they change their names. There was no "Alexandra of Hesse", and she is not best known as "Alix of Hesse". We need an overall solution for Russian Empresses in particular. I've several times proposed the format [[Adoptedname Patronymic (Birthname of Birthcountry)]] for Russian Empresses. The form <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alix_of_Hesse_787a.html" title="Alix of Hesse">Alix of Hesse</a> is deeply bad, because it goes against the most important rule of naming, which is that the name should be recognizable. Why should the woman known throughout the world as "Empress Maria Fyodorovna of Russia" be at the title <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagmar_of_Denmark_549c.html" title="Dagmar of Denmark">Dagmar of Denmark</a>? If this is what the current naming conventions say, they need to be changed - note that only the least well known of all the foreign Russian empresses, Empress Elisabeth Alexeyevna, is located at her birthname (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_of_Baden_7fbb.html" title="Louise of Baden">Louise of Baden</a>). All the others have been moved to a bewildering series of alternate names. At any rate, my proposal for this page is <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_%28Alix_of_Hesse%29_9fb5.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)">Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)</a> or Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse and by Rhine). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:44, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could live with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_%28Alix_of_Hesse%29_9fb5.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)">Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)</a>; since that has her adopted name and maiden name in there.

<p>Does anyone present <i>deny</i> that the subject of this article is best known as (the Enpress) Alexandra?</p>

<li>If so, the assertion can be documented.</li>

<p>I myself moved the article to <b>Empress Alexandra of Russia</b> (which was changed yet again), because likely anyone who looks up the words <b>Empress Alexandra of Russia</b>, etc. is looking for the last Russia Empress, wife of Tsar Nicholas II.</p>
<p>I agree along the same lines with <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">User:Irpen</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">User:John Kenney</a> - the name should be '<i>Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse Darmstadt)</i>.</p>
<p>She was NEVER known as <i>Alexandra Feodorovna of Hesse</i>, or <i>Alix of Hesse and Rhine</i>.</p>
<p>Now, what of the spelling of Feodorovna?? I have a coffee-table-ish book called <i>"Nicholas and Alexandra"</i> that presents the collection of Tsarist-related items of the Hermitage, and in this book her name is spelled <b>Feodorovna</b> (not to mention in every other book, etc. I have ever read with her name in it), not <b>Fyodorovna</b> as is spelled in the article. But since every Wikipedia article has the name spelled in this way, perhaps it should just be left as <b>Fyodorovna</b>?</p>

<dd>Her maiden name was Alix of Hesse and by Rhine; even the article makes this quite clear. As do any number of biographies about her, including "Nicholas and Alexandra" by the Massies, etc. Given Wiki's preference for citing maiden names for spouses of monarchs as article headings, and also given that any simple redirect will lead one directly here, my vote is for "Alix of Hesse and by Rhine (Alexandra Fyodorovna)" or something similar. It would be awfully pleasant to have people discuss this calmly and make a group decision based on Wiki precedence and not emotion. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 13:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since Wikipedia files past royal consorts under their maiden name, her article title should be that. I am also ok with having her Orthodox name included in parantheses.

<p>I agree with JohnK. The reason why her adopted name should go first, IMO, is that it is under this name that she became notable and also a saint. Usually the consorts fall into obscurity and here this is clearly not the case. The barely known princess Alix became a last empress of the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>, a martyr and a saint. Therefore I support <b><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_%28Alix_of_Hesse%29_9fb5.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)">Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)</a></b>.

I am asking all to read the archives. Also note that AF <i>is her maiden name</i> since she legally changed it <i>before marriage</i>.

There aren't any other Alix's of Hesse, so i don't see that shortening it to Hesse is problematic (additionally, the informal "Hesse-Darmstadt" would also seem alright, as it was commonly used both at the time and now to distinguish the two Hessian lines).

<dd>Pendantic, perhaps, but accurate? Certainly. An encyclopaedia should be about accuracy. And contemporary books of nobiliary enrollment, et cetera, especially German ones, typically used the "Hesse and by Rhine" title, and, yes, occasionally, Hesse-Darmstadt. The former, however, seems to have been most accurate and is used in a recent biography of the empress's brother, as I recall.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 14:59, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then let's come up with a solution and stop the ping-pong match. FYI: The Wiki article about her brother <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Louis%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Hesse_2a65.html" title="Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a> gives his full title as "Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine", with "Grand Duke of Hesse" as shorthand. And all the other rulers of that particular patch of Germanic ground are treated similarly (ie with "and by Rhine" in their formal titles), which would, arguably, make her "Alix of Hesse and by Rhine." Any suggestions? Also her great-great-great-whatever grandfather, Louis I, has the following information in his article: <i>At the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15, Louis had to give up his Westphalian territories, but was compensated with the district of Mainz on the left bank of the Rhine. Because of this addition, he amended his title to Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.</i> Also, the Wiki article "Hesse-Darmstadt" states the following: "The Grand Duchy changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine in 1816." And her sister Victoria's Wiki article is titled <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Victoria_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine_192d.html" title="Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine">Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 20:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and (as in that article) <i>Hesse</i> is the simplest form of the country. It is present in the article <i>only</i> for disambiguation; if her brother were certainly and perpetually the only Grand Duke Ernest Louis we would use that. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Look at all the articles about the former duchy as well as its grand ducal family, especially the female members: In many cases, their article titles are "Hesse and by Rhine" (see her sister Victoria's article) ... This discussion should include all of this, because whatever we decide here will impact all associated articles, which may or may not have to be renamed as well.

<dd>Then there should be only one argument here re the correct title: It should be Alix, not Alexandra. That was her birth name, and though she converted to the Orthodox church very shortly before the wedding ceremony, she should be, logically, Alix of Hesse and by Rhine. That should be please everybody; it's correct and yet inconsistent at the same time.

<p>Okay, as I see them, the situation is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alix's title was "Prinzessin von Hessen und bei Rhein".</li>
<li>A completely literal translation of this into English is "Princess of Hesse and by Rhine." I don't think this makes particularly much sense in English. Does it mean she is "Princess by Rhine?" I'm not sure what this means.</li>
<li>Other German noble particles are often not translated directly. Notably, "zu," which literally means "at" or "to" is generally translated "of" in noble particles. "Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg," not "Prince Felix at Schwarzenberg." I am fairly certain I have seen this done with the Hesse-Darmstadt title, so that it is translated "of Hesse and the Rhine". This <i>does</i> make sense in English, but loses some of the meaning of the German.</li>
<li>For all Hessian titles, it is perfectly correct to refer to them as simply "Prince/ss of Hesse". This is a true statement. It is not as specific as it might be, but is certainly not <i>incorrect</i>.</li>
<li>Additionally, an informal way to distinguish between the various Hessian branches was by territorial designation. Electoral Hesse was known as "Hesse-Kassel," and Grand Ducal Hesse as "Hesse-Darmstadt." This was not strictly correct, but is certainly not <i>incorrect</i>. The title of the British queen we have at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline_of_Ansbach_3001.html" title="Caroline of Ansbach">Caroline of Ansbach</a> was actually "Margravine of Brandenburg." Ansbach didn't even show up in her formal titles, but her branch was always called "Brandenburg-Ansbach," and this is usually shortened in English usage to merely "Ansbach.' Such usage is not a completely accurate rendering of her formal title, but there is nothing to indicate that our purpose here is to give a completely accurate rendering of her formal title.</li>
<li>There is only one person who is ever referred to in English as "Alix of Hesse" (her mother was "Alice"). Certainly there is only one such person who was also empress of Russia as "Alexandra Fyodorovna."</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that, I see no particular reason to insist on the formal title. I would say this certainly for her, and also for most other members of the family. I'd add that "Hesse-Darmstadt" is a much more commonly used designation for the same thing, and one that was used for junior dynasts, for instance, the <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanach_de_Gotha_77c2.html" title="Almanach de Gotha">Almanach de Gotha</a>, which was the authoritative source on European royal genealogy at the time. The article should, of course, give her formal full title in the text, but there's no particular need to have it in the title. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 23:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One last time, "Hesse and by Rhine" was the full official name of the grand duchy from which she came. So says Wiki articles about Hesse, her father, her brother, grandfather, et cetera, all of which I mentioned earlier (please look). That is what it means. And forgive the caps but ALL I WANT IS FOR THE TITLE TO BE ALIX NOT ALEXANDRA. That is all. Can we at least agree on that before trying to figure out the rest? And I do feel if we're going to call her "Alix of Hesse" (without "and by Rhine"), other members of the family, ie article titles, should conform.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 23:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. Alix is not English usage; and therefore UNACCEPTABLE.&lt;/countercaps&gt;.</li>
<li>Literal translations of German usage are irrelevant to English WP naming policy; we should use them <i>only</i> when English does. (i.e. often, but not always).</li>
<li>Attempting a literal one-for-one mapping of German prepositions into English is silly to begin with. <i>zu</i> is cognate with, and often corresponds to, English <i>to</i>, but not always; "the door is to", while a literal claque from the German, is only meaningful as a piece of comic <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Dutch_32c3.html" title="Pennsylvania Dutch">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> dialogue. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:04, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am sorry to disagree, but as the Massie biography of the imperial couple points out, her legal birth name was Alix, which has no English equivalent; just calling her Alexandra doesn't make it right as her birth name because it wasn't. Alexandra is the name she acquired after her conversion it to the Orthodox religion as an adult. Her true name was Alix; have you read the article? Or the Massie biography? Or any biography of her? Alix is not a nickname for Alexandra; it was her birth name. I think you both utterly fail to see this. And to use the Nicky/Nicholas analogy is willfully ignorant; Nicky was his nickname; Alix was her real name, not her nickname. Since there is no direct English equivalent to the name she was born with and used until she converted to Orthodoxy, there is no reason to ignore it and use something incorrect. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 00:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Alix is not her "true" name in a sense that Alexandra would then be a false name. Alix is her birth name which she changed upon her conversion.

<dd>A better solution might be this: the article title should be "Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)", which is correct, logical, etc, and which conforms to similar article titles for Russian empresses more famously known for their post-Orthodox conversion names, ie her mother in law, who is listed thusly: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Fyodorovna_%28Dagmar_of_Denmark%29_b934.html" title="Maria Fyodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)">Maria Fyodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)</a>.

<p>Actually, in books and other material about Alexandra, it is mentioned that (1) one of the reasons she first became acquainted with Nicholas was the fact that her elder sister had already almost ten years been married with Nicholas' uncle (and was living in Russia); and (2) when Alexandra settled in Russia to marry and when married, lived there, her sister's presence in the same country, and such family relations, were part of Alexandra's experience (whatever they were) to settle and live.
