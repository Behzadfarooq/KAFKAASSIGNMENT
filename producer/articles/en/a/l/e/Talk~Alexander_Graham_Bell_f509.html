<p>Wouldn't it be fair to strip this guy the title "inventor"? Honestly, the guy, on top of acquiring a patent in a dishonest way have lead to most of humanity being brainwashed that he invented the telephone. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3253174.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3253174.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> wkm</p>

<dd>No, it would not be fair. Even ignoring the telephone, Bell's many other discoveries, patents, and creations easily make him one of the greatest inventors of all time. While many people have challenged his telephone patent, no one has ever been able to overturn it. If you have astonishing new evidence that can overturn this decision after a hundred years of controversy, you would be better filing your own counter-claim. I will offer one suggestion; legal cases are rarely decided by one litigant calling the other "brainwashed".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Mr. Reis, he can join the long line of people claiming to have invented the telephone before Bell. It is entirely likely he did invent "a" telephone before Bell, but when most people speak of "the" telephone, "the" airplane, "the" automobile, or "the" light bulb, they mean the design which was eventually a commercial success and not the many earlier attempts which were not. The design for the telephone that became a commercial success was Bell's, not Reis', Gray's, Meucci's, or anyone else's.</dd>

<dd>There's a strong case for a "race to the patent office" with Bell's application arriving a mere two hours earlier than Grey's. Not to mention the fact that in later life, the clerk in charge of receiving the patents revealed he'd actually sold part of Grey's design to Bell's lawyers, thus giving the Scottish inventor a major breakthrough (vibration though a liquid medium.) Grey took his case as far as the supreme court but was unsuccessful and he died relatively unrecognized in 1901 while Bell went on to become the father of the telephone and died a very rich man. I'd like to see this added but it makes more sense to be on the telephone page rather than here, as well as the fact a large number of Bell zealots that would dispute it.User:gosunkugi 13:45, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since no one seems to be willing to defend this page, I've deleted the offensive passage which credits Bell with being responsible for deaf people's ability to speak.

<li>I agree - I came to the talk page because this sounded pretty dubious to me, and I see you have the same concerns. Even the similarity of the physical principle is pretty tenuous - OK it's all to do with changes in electromagnetic fields but that's about it IIRC. It's been a couple of months since you brought this up, so I'll check back here in a week or two; if no-one comes up with anything firm on the subject then I'm going to remove any mention of MRI from this part of the article. <a href="../../../g/y/p/User%7EGypsum_Fantastic_cf17.html" title="User:Gypsum Fantastic">Gypsum Fantastic</a> 23:17, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Read the congressional resolution. It is clear that Meucci's device worked, had been demonstrated to do so, and that ALexander G. Bell had stolen the device. This is now indisputable. SO any reference to Bell having invented the phone is false.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"H. Res. 269—Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to honor the life and achievements of 19th Century Italian-American inventor Antonio Meucci, and his work in the invention of the telephone (Fossella) Order of Business: The resolution is scheduled to be considered on Tuesday, June 11, 2002, under a motion to suspend the rules and pass the resolution.</dd>
<dd>Summary: H.Res. 269 has 11 findings about an Italian immigrant to New York, Antonio Meucci, who, rather than Alexander Graham Bell, may have been the first inventor of the telephone. The findings state that:
<ul>
<li>Meucci invented something he later called the “teletrofono,” involving electronic communications, which he set up inside his house, demonstrated in 1860, and had a description of it published in New York's Italian language newspaper;</li>
<li>Because Meucci could not afford the patent application process, he settled for a caveat, a one year renewable notice of an impending patent, which was first filed on December 28, 1871;</li>
<li>Meucci later learned that the Western Unionaffiliate laboratory reportedly lost his working models, and Meucci, who at this point was living on public assistance, was unable to renew the caveat after 1874, which would have cost $10;</li>
<li>In March 1877, Alexander Graham Bell, who conducted experiments in the same laboratory where Meucci's materials had been stored, was granted a patent and was thereafter credited with inventing the telephone;</li>
<li>Whereas on January 13, 1887, the Government of the United States moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation, a case that the Supreme Court found viable and remanded for trial;</li>
<li>Meucci died in October 1889, the Bell patent expired in January 1893, and the case was discontinued as moot without ever reaching the underlying issue of the true inventor of the telephone entitled to the patent;"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And states that the House is resolved:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and his work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged."</dd>
<dd>Cost to Taxpayers: There is no cost to this resolution.</dd>

<dd>Meucci's "invention" of the telephone may have been endorsed by congress, but legislative bodies do not rate very high in the dispute of scientific issues. Congressmen wanted votes of Italian-Americans. The Meucci telephone claims were promoted for decades by the same man who got Columbus Day recognized as a national holiday. In the trials of the 1880's Meucci was brought forward by promoters who sought to break the Bell patent. Drawbaugh, Dolbear, and dozens of other "inventors" also testified. The court heard them all and ruled against them. Meucci's early telephone was apparently a string telephone operating on non-electrical principles. The Reis telephone of the 1860's was not a practical device for commercial use, but Silvanus Thompson published a book in the 1880s with testimony by noted scientists that they had heard it transmit articulate speech in the 1860's. Bell's electromagnetic phone was ok as a receiver, but too weak for transmission to any distance. The transmitter evolved from the Reis device to the Berlinner "loose metallic contact" device, the Edison carbon transmitter, with improvements by Hughes (the"microphone") Blake, and White among others into the device used through most of the 20th century. Work by Meucci did not contribute to this sequence of development.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not certain, but this seems rather out of place and angry:</p>
<p>"However, Meucci was the first to invent the telephone, and this was how Bell got the idea. Bell invented his own telephone, and then went down to the patent office, and bribed the officials there to destroy the records of Meucci's inventor-of-the-telephone status (Meucci was too poor to secure a patent). Bell then secured his own patent. Meucci was understsandably furious, and took Bell to court. However, he was too poor to hire a legal team, and his health was declining, and thus he lost the court case. However, credit where it is due, because Graham refined the telephone, and had a lot to do with it's development."</p>

<p>I vote this article not be included on the CD until this article can be corrected in relation to the who-invented-first debate.

<p>That boldface sentence "<b>He was a naturalized citizen of the United States</b>" mentioned by user Trode was weird indeed. How did it get in the intro?

It says: "Today, Bell is still widely considered to be the foremost inventor of the telephone, although this matter has become controversial, with a number of people claiming that Antonio Meucci was the real inventor". This seems to suggest that Meucci's priority is a minority's view, which it is not. Those interested in the history of the telephone know that <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Meucci_5b1f.html" title="Antonio Meucci">Antonio Meucci</a> (1857) came first, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philipp_Reis_3cff.html" title="Philipp Reis">Philipp Reis</a> (1860) second, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Graham_Bell_395d.html" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> (1876) third at best (and let us not forget <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Bourseul_217a.html" title="Charles Bourseul">Charles Bourseul</a> who possibly had the first telephone design but no prototype). Sure, Bell eventually was the one who made the money, and maybe the Bell PR department eventually became influential enough to make many believe that Bell was first, at least in North America, but for a Wikipedia article it should not be important what the masses thought at some point in time - there was a time when many thought the world is flat.</p>
<p>I suggest to rewrite the intro as follows: Today, Bell is widely considered as one of the foremost developers of the telephone, together with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Meucci_5b1f.html" title="Antonio Meucci">Antonio Meucci</a>, inventor of the first telephone prototype, and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philipp_Reis_3cff.html" title="Philipp Reis">Philipp Reis</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicists_3d25.html" title="User:Physicists">Physicists</a> 19:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"His work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged". IMHO it is clear. Try studying Meucci s life. In Italy he invented a model of telephone in 1834 (Bell didn't exist). In 1847 Meucci was 39 years old and had over 25 years of experience in mechanics, chemistry and physics. Meucci’s 1st electric transmission of the human voice took place in Cuba in 1849, when Graham Bell was only 2 years old. Meucci demonstrated his electric telephone in NY, USA in 1854, when Bell was 7 years old. And so on. So the paragraph is right: "the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and his work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged". IMO you should study his life. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_94a8.html" title="User:Jack">Jack</a> 18:50, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on <i>in popular culture</i> information. I started that last year while I raised <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> to <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a> when I created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a>, which has become a <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a>. Recently I also created <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Alexander_the_Great_d3a1.html" title="Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great">Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great</a> out of material that had been deleted from the biography article. Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.

<p>Is there anyone who doubts that Bell's contributions as a collective body of work is outstanding&#160;? Then why is the adjective <b>outstanding</b> continually being challenged (read dropped)? The introduction states correctly where he was born, so why not bookend it, by including, where he died&#160;? An introduction with a concluding statement that he emigrated to the United States leaves the misleading impression that the U.S. was his final stop. Clarifying that he returned to Canada is not only historically accurate, it leaves no false impression and bookends where he was born. The intro should read something, on the order, like: <b>Alexander Graham Bell</b> ( March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922 ) was an outstanding <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientist</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventor.html" title="Inventor">inventor</a>, and innovator.

<dd>Because where and when someone died is not key information about a person, unlike where they were brought up, educated and began their career, which is absolutely fundamental information in establishing a biography. There have been edit wars going on ever since this article was started trying to claim Bell for various countries. This is just another attempt to boost the case of Canada, over his other two identities.

<dd>Where the man finished his life is hardly irrelevant in a biographical piece, which this is. If it was an article on the telephone, fine, but not when it is an article on the man and his life. Unless you'd like to re-write history and suggest he's still alive and kicking out there somewhere, the end of his live is relevant information.</dd>

<dd>On the substantive point: he was not simply "born" in Scotland: he was brought up, educated and began his career there: it is key to our understanding of the person, because Scotland formed him.

<p>The article's introduction concludes Bell emigrated to the United States. That interprets to a reader that he stayed there, after leaving Canada. Since that is not the case, leaving the intro, as is, becomes a distortion of the truth [just another attempt to boost the United States?]. Introducing where Bell came from leads to concluding where he ended. Adding it is not boosting Canada; it is stating the truth. Deleting it wont change that reality, it just misguides the reader [a cautiousness I would have thought superceded American editorial wishful thinking]. --<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECuriouscdngeorge_525f.html" title="User:Curiouscdngeorge">Curiouscdngeorge</a> 22:20, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thankfully the format of Wikipedia incorporates this <b>Discussion Page.</b> It's the last bastian of reason within Wiki. Truths get exposure, despite those editors whose raison d'être is to whitewash articles with their own pet-theory personal falsehoods. The integrity of many an articles' contents is in the hands of inexperienced (read weak and immature) editors, which accounts for the jello-like foundation of their decisions. Fortunately, the intelligent program designers of this wonderful encyclopedia have provided a discussion page, as if to provide a life-raft for anyone choosing to voice the truth, despite an engulphing sea of editorial quicksand, in the article, itself. --<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECuriouscdngeorge_525f.html" title="User:Curiouscdngeorge">Curiouscdngeorge</a> 22:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is Bell's nationality even subject to debate? The man was born, bred and educated in Scotland. Would Canada and the USA be so eager to claim him had he been an infamous mass murderer? Where he moved to as an adult is irrelevant. It's shameful that countries with loose ties to Bell lay claim to both he and the telephone. Saying that the telephone is an American invention is as accurate as saying that America achieved a clean sweep of medals at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. It matters not where the achievement takes place. It is the 'who', not the 'where' that counts. And as far as Canada's claim to Bell is concerned, it is laughable that the site of one's death should take precedence over their place of birth. The page should state, first and foremost, that "Alexander Graham Bell was a Scottish inventor" and go from there, stating where he moved, died etc. Allowing his nationality remain ambiguous is pandering to the glory hunters. Ambiguty, no matter how it manifests, should be avoided wherever possible.Clydey 02:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
