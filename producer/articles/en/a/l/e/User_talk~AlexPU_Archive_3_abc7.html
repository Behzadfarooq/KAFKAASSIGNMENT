<p>People, I can't stand the <b>behaviour</b> of some of Russian (and Russia-biased) Wikifellows. The "behaviour" is the key, cause I don't deny they right to have their highly-erroneus views an present them <b>correctly</b> on WP. But I will renew my fight against the propaganda-driven vandal-like actions like undiscussed deletions and unforgiveable denials of common sense.</p>
<p>I'm going to list such uncooperative Wikipedians here. Feel free to edit and discuss the list.</p>
<p>And let's see are they brave enough to not delete themselves or each other from here.</p>

<dd>A comment on your list above. Polish editors being offended by many anti-Polish remarks on articles’ talk pages, decided once to create a page where they would be able to deal with the offending users. You may see it here 1. Unfortunately, despite their best intentions, few people on Wiki approved the idea, and the page went through two VfDs <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Polish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_Black_Book_529e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Polish Wikipedians' notice board/Black Book">1</a> <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia%7ENon-main_namespace_pages_for_deletion_User%7EWitkacy_Black_Book_93dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Non-main namespace pages for deletion/User:Witkacy/Black Book">2</a>. The final result was certainly not the assumed one. Not only it didn’t solve anything, but also it backfires from time to time, like on this RfA <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Halibutt_3f65.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Halibutt">1</a>.</dd>

<dd>During the many discussions we had held due to explain our view, many people suggested that problems with such problematic users should be solved with the use of the existing Wikipedia policy tools like <a href="../../../r/f/c/RfC_1260.html" title="RfC">RfC</a> or ArbCom. And although that is exactly what Polish editors wanted to avoid, today, when I look back at the discussions, how much of our energy they took, and how little we achieved, I really think that the official tools would be the best idea. Some of the comments you oppose were posted on our board, and I can understand your frustration, however, the list is unlikely to resolve anything.

<dd>Hi. I think I know a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Ghirlandajo_3146.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ghirlandajo">better place to discuss the edits of Mr.Ghirlandajo</a>.

<p>Thank you everybody for commenting an important and complicated issue. Please proceed! Ukrained, I already did. And thank you for alerting me of the freaking <i>East Ukraine</i>. Thank you Poles (and dziewczyny polskie:) for info on "black lists". BTW, I hardly could be elected admin because of my short-temperedness and poor English. And I'm happy about it. If being elected means compromise with the disgraced editors - I don't need it. I suggest this approach for <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Mr.Halibutt</a> particularly.

<p>Please take a look at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#What vandalism is not</a>. Characterizing others' edits as vandalism in a POV dispute is a serious breach of civility. Just because someone disagrees with you, even if they <i>are</i> wrong, none of these are justifications for calling edit vandalism. You also need to seriously consider toning down your language. Calling others "Propagandistic" and maintaining some kind of hitlist is not conducive to building an encyclopedia.

<dd>To answer your questions:
<ul>
<li>It is not directly prohibited per se in any policy, but there is a precedent and strong consensus for forcing users to delete them. More importantly though, it is just wrong, and unproductive for Wikipedia.</li>
<li>All of your edits to Wikipedia are released under the GFDL. That's what you agreed when you clicked the save button. You cannot take them back, unless there is a standar deletion criterion they fall under. But I especially don't see why you'd <i>want</i> to, if they were useful encyclopedia articles. If you're pondering leaving over this conflict, that may be to our loss, but I would hope you wouldn't want to reduce our store of knowledge here (for anyone in the world to access) because you can't get along with an editor. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:18, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen!</p>
<pre>
I'm concerned with  the <b>terrible pro-Russian propaganda on</b>
Wikipedia,
and community's failure to stop it<b>.</b>
The supposedly-neutral Wikifellows
permanently can't see (or pretending they can't)
the evident POV-contributions, and most important,
both the <b>vandalistic</b> and the <b>insidious</b> methods
used to preserve those contributions.
<i>This disappoints me very mother-fucking much!!!</i>
</pre>
<p>So I find Wikiediting a rather nervous (although a high-minded) activity. I passionately hope to see positive changes on <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia NEUTRALITY</a>!!!</p>
<p>I will kindly ask all of you for following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't purge this statement (even if you find it illiberal) and don't let people whom I described do it. May be it will require watching the anonymous vandalism.</li>
<li>Don't purge the list of propagovandalists above, even if you dislike the idea. Instead, developing that list would be a sign of a <b>true political correctness - towards Ukraine, Ukrainians, and, not to forget, Wikipedia principles</b>.</li>
<li>Do discuss the issues raised on my talkpage and elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Dear Dmcdevit, I don't admit any guilt in EDITING today. You see, all Wikipedians engage in edit wars, some of them get punished for that. If you decide to punish me, let it be so. If you decide to punish <i>only</i> me, ... we'll discuss it later if needed (for now, see the discussion below :).</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Militsiya&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51028736" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Militsiya&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51028736" rel="nofollow">this</a>, so <b>this is really serious</b>. My new last-resort method against Wikipropagandists. Can you imagine what a mess would occur in Russia-related pages if I fulfill my threat, and recruit other Rus.-literate Wikipedians to it (without POV-pushing or trolling, mere supply of article names and external links)? In order to prevent that and keep each side on it's country pages :), you admins and bureucrats should carefully and ACTIVELY treat the issue of pro-Russian propaganda.

<dd>I don't see how I can be more plain, but let me try. Calling someone a "Wikipropagandist" is a personal attack, and a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Make comments <i>only</i> about the content, not the contributor. Meanwhile, this warning was clearly <i>not</i> about content. I am not knowledgeable about, and frankly don't give a whit about the Russian-related pages. That is for those editors who edit them to decide amongst themselves consensually. And civility is a rerequisite to consensus discussion. So, it doesn't actually matter what wrong you are trying to right, you cannot do it with incivility. Language like "Wikipropagandists," or whatever other personal smear you choose, <i>will</i> get you blocked the next time you do it. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:27, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alex, please take the advice above seriously. It understandable that it's hard when your contribution is reverted with "nonsense" as summary, but responding by personal insults does not solve the problem. As an example, <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> has been blocked for incivility twice (while escaping from the second term thanks to <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a>), and is "working" toward his next block. It would be despondently to see you going the same way. <a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 21:34, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>KPbIC, please stick to facts which you know fully well. I intervened only when Kazak was blocked for the second time for the offence for which the original block expired, there is a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_jeopardy.html" title="Double jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> principle. The second block's summary or explanation didn't say that the blocker viewed the block too short and made it longer. Otherwise, he would have said just that. He problably haven't realized that Kazak was already blocked for his rudeness and was back because the block expired and not because he was never blocked. You've been told about that and you know exactly what you are talking about.
<dl>
<dd>Irpen, it’s your opinion that Kuban kazak was blocked twice for the same offense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kuban_kazak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48281580" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kuban_kazak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48281580" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (which probably was influential in Ezhiki's decision to unblock Kazak). But in my opinion the first block had no effect on Kuban, and I provided all evidences in WP/I, which in my opinion were in no relation to his first block (which he has got for his conflict with Space Cadet). If I steal two pockets, one from you and one from Kuban, and I’m only penalized for stealing Kuban’s pocket, you would probably ask “What about my pocket?”, and that would be a valid concern.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And Kazak will be blocked for each incivil remark and I will not lift a finger in such cases. And I tried and keep trying my best to talk him out of such behavior while what you are doing is basically saying that the AlexPU was right on the issues, just acted the wrong way, and you will miss him.

<p>Dear Alex, I appreciate your edits very much and will help you with them as well as with fighting the Russian bias here. But discussing Irpen's mother ... that's what unaware readers would notice <b>in the first place</b> instead of your numerous articles :(((. I'd share your concerns and more, things have gone much far here while you were out. But wording... <b>You're messing up the whole our point.</b> Can't you understand that swearing is exactly what they want? It is trolling, it is simple, and it allows Russian Group to call <i>you</i> a troll.</p>
<p>Regarding above said, I support your blocking. Yes, Irpen was provoking you for few days. But yes, ... that Guy is right too: you provided <i>plenty</i> of reasons for blocking yourself last weekends. And yes, Mr.Bakharev would eagerly block you (or me) each time we give him an excuse. In other words, that block was entirely legal. Write something similar again, and I'll <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_administrator_attention_79d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for administrator attention">report</a> you <i>first</i> - to make a point of neutrality and objectivity. Please don't undermine my politics here.</p>
<p>Let's discuss all other topics of our interest elsewhere (preferrably, by e-mail). Best wishes, <a href="../../../u/k/r/User%7EUkrained_0b14.html" title="User:Ukrained">Ukrained</a> 19:03, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ukrained, you a wrong here on several accounts. First, right above you are accusing Alex Bakharev of a willingness to use his admin privilleges to POV push. I quote you above: <i>"Mr.Bakharev would eagerly block you (or me) each time we give him an excuse."</i>. Now, admin abuse is a very serious matter, especially to settle the personal grudges and/or POV disputed. You can't just throw this in someone face with no consequences for yourself whatsoever and have Bakharev just take it from you. If he gave you any reason to accuse him in an improper use of adminship, you should post your substantiated claim at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>. If you haven't done so because you know that in view of lack of any evidence and much evidence to the contrary such posting would make you just look ridiculous, you should not use smearing him at user talk pages as a workaround.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>AlexPU is guilty of about dozen of personal attacks lately. Still Bakharev blocked only after four (!) recent warnings (two of them "last") and a multitude of warnings above in case you failed to notice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your calling those who disagree with you a "Russian group", it is just as uncivil. Your accusations that people want to simply dismiss AlexPU presenting him as a troll is as unsubstantiated. Of all talk pages entries AlexPU posted lately, there was only one at <a href="../../../v/i/k/Talk%7EViktor_Yushchenko_53bf.html" title="Talk:Viktor Yushchenko">talk:Viktor Yushchenko</a> that was on the topic rather than an angry diatribe. In no time I posted my agreement with his suggestion and actually edited the article to make sure it is taken into account.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I absolutely don't care about you both calling me names. It is a general disruption that I am concerned about. If AlexPU's <b>article edits</b> start being as reasonable as yours, Ukrained, (yes, despite your trollish talk page entries and constant assumption of bad faith of everyone but yourself), this all will be a different story. I am looking forward to it but with little hope. And, Alex, if you intend to post another attacking message, better save your nerves and time. This really doesn't upset me anymore. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 05:30, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel I should answer some semi-official issues mentioned above. First, I accused Mr.Bakharev in <i>willingness</i> (or <i>readiness</i>), <b>not</b> in commited admin abuse. There's a bif difference herem which I realize. As for his willingness, he expressed it on his talk page long before his adminship started. As you may remember, I made it public on his second RfA (when your group clowned the election attacking virtually everyone voting "Oppose"). However, we should consider that AlexPU is an experienced user. Thus, following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlex_Bakharev&amp;diff=39330202&amp;oldid=39292782" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlex_Bakharev&amp;diff=39330202&amp;oldid=39292782" rel="nofollow">Mr.Bakharev's logic</a>, AlexPU shouldn't be punished at all :)). By the way, I was only answering the AlexPU's naive amusement of why so reasonable editor as Bakharev blocked him.</p>
<p>And yes, AlexPU was "guilty" (just like <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">User:Kuban kazak</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKPbIC&amp;diff=50936020&amp;oldid=50236903" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKPbIC&amp;diff=50936020&amp;oldid=50236903" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I have dozens of such diffs). And he (I mean Alex, not Kazak :( ) was punished properly. And I find his <i>article</i> edits reasonable.</p>
<p>As for my <i>reasonable edits</i>, I'm afraid they only seem like those <b>for you</b> because I was out for two weeks in April and now retro-patrolling my wathclist.

<p>It is good to see a contributor from Ukraine on Wikipedia. I believe many articles need more Ukrainian editors to preserve NPOV I would like to see a greater cooperation in areas interesting to Central European topics that are native to the region. I know work with certain other editors can be frustrating sometimes, but It is good to hold your anger, it would be a shame to loose a contributor from Ukraine, since they are so few.

I can't directly contribute since I don't speak Russian, Ukranian, Polish or any other Eastern European languages.

<p>Legal status: I suspect that the Internal Troops are indeed legally Gendarmies, which means that they are subject to the same treatment as any other internal force. For example, American Police officers oath, is identical to that of soldiers, except for the "juridiction of". So, I "X" do solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States, agaisnt all enemies, foreign and domestic, in the jurisdiction "Y." In the unlikely case of an invasion, US police/sheriffs would act as the "light infantry. So Internal Troops would be treated as troops, rather than civillians. I am not 100% sure, but pretty sure. Other than that, i don't think they rate any official status as "soldiers," but again, I suspect they have the same status as the local border patrol/ coast guard. That they are civillian in peace, soldiers in war... --<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V. Joe</a> 05:31, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AlexPU: Valentine here again. To let you know, I don't know too much about templates, but am willing to learn--[[User: Valentinejoesmith|V. Joe]] 02:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You see, Valentine, I was thinking of some templates (navboxes or whatever) regarding Soviet/post-Soviet law enforcement and military pages. I recently avocated purging one (purely misleading), but started to like the idea. I'm willing to plan them, but not ready to draw now:). If you don't draw neither, we could try to volunteer some experts in that and concentrate on the template contents. E.g., I feel a need for some navbox distinguishing <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gendarmerie.html" title="Gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_police.html" title="Military police">military police</a> etc.</dd>

<p>Just to let you know that it is the policy of those who maintain <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a> to not feature stubs there. The article to qualify has to be 1) less than 5 days old (3 days until recently); 2) not a stub. Please unstub it asap if you want it featured. If you are busy, uninterested, blocked or whatever, I will try to find time to do that on my own but I can't guarantee. It would be a pity if the article on such a colorful person misses DYK. I linked a full English L bio in UP and much of it can be used directly as UP only requires it's material to be acknowledged and does not object to its being used. Just a suggestion. Feel free to heed it, ignore it, delete it or whatever. Please don't waste your time for another attack though. Not for mine but for your own sake. That said, I <b>do</b> think that your return (a prolific contributor in the past), might be beneficial for the project. I hope you learn some manners and we will work on improvement of Ukrainian topics. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And please, Irpen, don't prevent that Tomenko stub from reaching DYK in any way (although you were right in your criteria objection). As you may remember, two episodes of yours and Ghirlandajos' questioned DYK behaviour happened so far. I wouldn't like to witness a third one. By the way, AlexPU wrote/enlarged several big articles already this month. This said regarding your "contributor in past" incinuation.

<dd>Ukrained, please point out where exactly I tried to perevent any UA article from appearing at DYK. Make sure you check before posting some imagined comments because I am doing all I can to make sure as many UA article appear at DYK as possible. Even for this article I dug up plenty of references and an extremely valuable Eblish L bio that makes unstubbing it extremely easy. SHould I have wanted the article not featured, I would not have done anything for it. And this is exactly the reason why I posted this call for expansion at the first place, and, besides, posted it at the author page rather than the article's talk or under the DYK submission to make sure I post it quietly. If I knew, I would have time within a short time-span when the article qualifies for DYK, I would have just unstubbed it. I, however, did the second best thing: linked sources that anyone, yourslef included, can use to unstub the article. Your perpetual assumption of bad faith all the time are notorious and make you look just as ridiculous. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 16:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For now I just want him learn some manners because his current manners are disruptive. If it takes blocks to learn, it is not my fault. If he can reform himself on his own, it is just as well.

<p>Hi, Alex. I generally have nothing against your most recent edit to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, although it looks that in some portions you were overeager to expose negativity that wasn't there or to interpret some of the sources you provided in, eh, somewhat <i>too</i> liberal way, but I take it that you understood my attitude when you reviewed my edit.</p>
<p>As a hard and fast rule, I don't play anyone's games except my own, and the rules of <i>my</i> game are quite simple—stick to the facts; maintain NPOV; provide references, especially to the edits that may be viewed as controversial; be polite, and don't hesitate to listen to others even if you strongly dislike them—you may just discover that you are occasionally wrong. Hmm, looks like I've just quoted most of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">key concepts</a>. Oh, well.</p>
<p>I don't particularly enjoy adding negative information about Russia or, for that matter, about any other country or subject (one may say that's because I am not a journalist :)). I much prefer balanced approach—if there is only negative, or only positive information about some controversial topic, it means that the article is pretty much useless. I will never cover up some horrid fact be it about Russia's past or present, but I will do my best to tone it down to make it sound more neutral, while still preserving the core factual information, and, of course, to make sure, that it's indeed a fact. For example, that was the reason why I commented out your addition about militsiya "not usually interfering" with hate-crimes: first of all, it may or may not be true in different parts of Russia, so you cannot draw a general conclusion about this being a practice in Russia as a whole; second—the reference you provided only describes one case; one in which militsiya's inaction was a subject of speculation. Notice that I am not saying that the "not usually interfering" part is untrue—I am merely requesting a better source (one newspaper article is certainly not enough to draw this broad a conclusion). Of course, if I had such better source on hands, I'd added it myself.</p>
<p>Finally, even though I am a Russian admin, I cannot take responsibility for behavior of all Russian editors. It certainly hurts me to see that some folks (both on Russian and Ukrainian sides, with you, unfortunately, not being an exception) are unable at times to stick to a civil discussion. It's no less disgusting when any of the sides tries to push their own POV. With all that in mind, I am but one admin; I can't fix the whole world. I interfere when things get really ugly, I always try to help or mediate when being asked, I always enforce policies when I see one being breached, but unless the sides start listening to one another, my efforts often amount to a nerve-wracking, productive editing-distracting waste of time. Often the debates are over the subjects I either know little about (Old Slavic Ukrainian/Russian architecture being a good example) or have no interest in (such as <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militsiya.html" title="Militsiya">militsiya</a>). Furthermore, any interference by force means the sides are deprived the possibility (however remote) to settle the disputes among themselves on their own. Sum this all up, and you'll have a decent guide explaining my attitude toward the majority of issues. I often wish I could do something to ease the tensions, but not being born a baby-genius it's not easy for me to do :)</p>
<p>I hope I explained my position. Hope to see you continuing with great contributions of yours and discontinuing some of your less-than-productive behavior. You don't have to like or agree with the Russian editors, just show them some respect—everyone deserves as little.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (ërinacëus amurënsis)</a> • (<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 20:41, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alex, if you happen to read this before you check your mail: please present here links/references about UPA-partisans negotiations. You were the one who promised such references. My favorite admin is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Soviet_partisans&amp;curid=3185495&amp;diff=56811902&amp;oldid=56510698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Soviet_partisans&amp;curid=3185495&amp;diff=56811902&amp;oldid=56510698" rel="nofollow">requesting</a> those references instead of deleting the issue like his friends ;).</p>
<p>And please <i>don't answer</i> the posts from above section. Some of them are trollish (while some are painfully true), and all those people are expecting some answer from you. I suggest you to ignore any expectation, at least for now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are willing to add some new pages/sections during your block, feel free to insert them on this page or e-mail me, so I can read and possibly contribute to the respective pages. Of course I don't mean minor edits or rewritings of existing texts. Cheers, <a href="../../../u/k/r/User%7EUkrained_0b14.html" title="User:Ukrained">Ukrained</a> 20:17, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AlexPU, are you still not feeling well? Your block was quadrupled specifically for trolling at your talk post-initial block. Why continue with <i>burrying</i> stuff? While you have time, could you pleae bring up <i>any</i> references of Rudniev's article consipracy theory? I am almost done rewriting it and will post a new version soon. I will not include any of your speculations unless you provide the source for them. It was funny btw to read your "he was not a communist" for the Old Bolshevik who took part in storming the Winter Palace.</p>
<p>Before resorting to new outbursts, please take a breath (and a pause, if necessary). I would really like just to see the links or names of the authors for the Rudniev's material.</p>
<p>Besides, I copyeditied your reservoirs article and I think it should be at DYK. I thought the unsourced info there is correct (except another unreferenced conspiracy theory about Stalin's "time bomb".

<p>I posted the following remarks on the talk page, as well as did some clean up in re: grammar. Here goes:</p>
<p>Reviewing over, I have additional thoughts about the status of the Internal Troops. If you have a gun and fight in an uniform, you are probably soldiers according to the laws of war. Therefore, gendarmes are closer in status to the United States Coast Guard (which assists the Navy during times of war). Most prominently, many of the bosun's at Normandy were Coastguardsmen, and not sailors. Additionally, part of the chain of command during John Kerry's stay in Viet Nam were USCG officers. If they are indeed deeply involved in the Chechen conflict/war/revolution/whatever, it doesn't surprise me that the international media has mislabeled them as "Russian Soldiers/ Russian Army". Especially as very few reporters outside of the US or UK have any expierence in millitary matters, and even in the US media, reporters are often dreadfully confused about the most basic "Army stuff." and occasionally mistake soldiers, airmen and Marines with each other, and even American and British troops at a distance. (They wear different variations of camoflauge and carry slightly different weapons. Also, the Union Jack on the sleeve is a dead giveaway :)). I'm going to do a minor edit for grammar, etc in this new addition. Thanks: V. Joe 05:34, 7 June 2006 (UTC) (<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V. Joe</a> 05:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Duly noted, Valentine. We do need disambiguation in many pages where "army" and police units are mistaken with each others. There's a related problem: some conflicts (like in Chechnya) are not "declared wars" according to <b>international</b> laws. Therefore, only police/gendarmerie-like units may participate in them - according to their <b>national</b> laws. Instead, those units are not allowed to act like conventional <b>army</b> (that's really the issue in Chechen war), but only like <b>police</b>. Despite the fact that they fight in a uniform. I guess we should develop this topic everywhere if it wasn't still. I'm going to add notes to the lead of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Troops_b691.html" title="Internal Troops">Internal Troops</a>, if you haven't. Do you read my poor English so far :)?</dd>

<p>I don't reall believe in my early release: there's a Russian cabal in Wikipedia. They didn't like my changes to Russia article, so I'll stay blocked at least until July 2. Hey, why am I saying "they"? At least two of you are in that :)).</p>
<p>Bogdan, thanks for your diplomacy, but I'm afraid it will be of limited success. BTW, leaving the summary fields blank will be another excuse for them to reblock me ;).

<dd>Thanks! Looks like good useful project. I'll be there some day. I AM a conservative, may be liberal in some practical methods (that bloody job :), but anyway conservative by my views.

<dd>My 2 cents: I do need AlexPU's help in editing and so do several other users (see above). And Mr.Bakharev somehow owes AlexPU after a little intrigue with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threat_of_the_Dnieper_reservoirs_dcd3.html" title="Threat of the Dnieper reservoirs">Threat of the Dnieper reservoirs</a>, so a pre-scheduled unblock would be natural. Also there are some procedures alternative to blocking (I guess they're called mentoring) which I could participate (co-participate) in.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is rather unspecific. For instance, I'm being accused of its violation on a weekly basis, predominantly undeserved. And what is "I could try"? (AlexPU, my tactic thoughts are <b>in e-mail</b>). Instead I suggested a more exact condition for unblocking last week (see above). Mr.Bakharev, why don't you negotiate more specific conditions under which you would just go and unblock him (which you should do anyway)? <a href="../../../u/k/r/User%7EUkrained_0b14.html" title="User:Ukrained">Ukrained</a> 19:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My dear User:Ukrained, Bogdan (if you insist on personofication, I have NO problems with it), with all due respect, since when does Alex have to accept conditions, have you ever heard of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>. Alex has proposed to Alex that as he is ready to make useful contributions, he is ready to allow him to continue so. <b>Where do you come into this?</b> I mean I can understand that you are thinking for him and trying to negotiate your own settlement, but with all opinions, one has to assume that AlexPU is a big boy and needs no babysitting on your behalf. I mean if you are getting so involved why can't I make my own suggestions? Alex Bakharev is proposing a clear condition, that AlexPU returns to writing, but would stop disruptive behaivour, yet you are critising him for that? Honestely who do you think you are to do that?</dd>
<dd>My condition for a premature unblock is that AlexPU <b>must</b> apologise to all the people he insulted, and to the Ukrainian community which he shamed. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 20:54, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I have unblocked you. You already served the 3/4 of the block and somehow promised not to engage in the personal attacks anymore. Until July 2 consider yourself on probation, please do not get yourself involved in anything controversial. Work on the articles instead.

<dl>
<dd>As for "probation", I'm not sure what you're talking about because:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I didn't reconsider the actions of the Wikipedians that I characterized objectively, but in an obscene way</li>
<li>I won't say thanks regarding blocking history of Russian users</li>
<li>I will <b>immediately</b> get involved in many things "controversial" like:
<ul>
<li>process against Irpen</li>
<li>fighting Russian neoimperialistic propaganda</li>
<li>editing <a href="../../../r/u/s/Category%7ERussia_1c69.html" title="Category:Russia">Category:Russia</a> with neutral and sourced info (they deleted almost all my changes to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, but I'm back!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, my reservoirs article hardly needed "saving" from anything at the moment when I wrote it. There are thousands unreferenced articles in Wikipedia that nevertheless reflect truth.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a> 06:13, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>BTW, I might add, that a) just because you are unblock does not mean you can continue your crusade, like a dog let of a leash, b) Apologising to Irpen would be the least you can do to save face of Ukrainians on Wikipedia, c) Remember Bakharev acted in good faith and gave you a second chance, you do realise that if you waste it you'll be blocked sooner than you expect.

<p>Alex, here is an important request for your expansion. I'm too lazy to deal with political and especially military details there.

<p>Just a reminder for you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, especially when you encounter someone else for the first time. Your relevant edit is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shovel&amp;diff=75276091&amp;oldid=74794334" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shovel&amp;diff=75276091&amp;oldid=74794334" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, or rather, its description - by calling my edit a "propaganda-related censorship" you are ascribing to me specific intentions with no good reason, and I fail to see how my nationality, which you also mentioned there, is relevant at all. That edit is now reverted with a more detailed explanation for the reasons, and if you still find them not good enough, let us <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civilly</a> discuss them, shall we? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInt19h_42b2.html" title="User:Int19h">-- int19h</a> 13:09, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex, as you might hold an in Poland-Ruthenia-Litvania, have a look at the vote there; you may also notice how certain uchastniki have devoted themselses to their higher cause. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthseeker_85.5_20f3.html" title="User:Truthseeker 85.5">Truthseeker 85.5</a> 11:42, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
