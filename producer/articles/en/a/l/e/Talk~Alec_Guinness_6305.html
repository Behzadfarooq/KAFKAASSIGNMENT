<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an autobiography. Millions of younger moviegoers were introduced to him through Star Wars, so I'd say it's not only appropriate to have a Star Wars pic, but necessary, whether he would like it or not. The article mentions his dislike of the series, after all. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrysaor_9112.html" title="User:Chrysaor">Chrysaor</a> 22:48, May 31, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with the first user. Alec Guinness hated Star Wars, so putting a photo of him from that movie is like sticking a dagger in his stomach. Since the article is not just about the Alec Guinness the actor but Alec Guinness the person off the movie set, I think a candid photo of him would be most appropriate.
<dl>
<dd>A bit on the fence with this. Guinness would have hated it, but this isn't an autobio, and the Obi-Wan role did introduce him to a new generation. How about adding additional photos: a candid shot, as suggested, or maybe one from the Ealing years, one from Lawrence of Arabia, and one from Bridge on the River Kwai. That should cover all the bases, and diminishes the impact of seeing a photo the man himself would have disapproved of. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 16:29, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article currently read "it is not known if their minor aged son Matthew converted at the same time". According to a BBC interview Guinness gave in 1977 Matthew went to a private school in which was run by the catholics and althought his parents innitially disapproved of this he was allowed to attend. After a while Matthew decided to convert and his parents followed him.</p>
<p>I have this interview on tape but haven't watched it in a few years (I recorded it in Enland on a PAL cassette and I am now in Canada with an NTSC VRC). In his last autobiography Guinness stated it was his big regret that he did not make the decision to become a Catholic sooner in his life.</p>

<p>Here's a weird fact.

<dd>Obi-Wan (as played by Guinness) only ever says "the Force will be with you, always".
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Sign your comments.</b></i> Guinness only ever says, "The force will be with you, always," near the end of the film after the destruction of the Death Star. He says a great many other things about the force in many different ways throughout the film. It's entirely possible that he did say, "Luke, the force is with you," although I don't specifically remember it. That said, I think trying to create a bridge between <i>Kind Hearts...</i> and <i>Star Wars</i> is a bit of a stretch. Unless someone can come up with a quote in support, or the line from <i>Kind Hearts...</i> is extremely well-known in Britain to the present day, I think it's safe to say it's a coincidence. But it's amusing for its own sake. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 16:40, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a small bit of controversy concerning his sexual orientation. Nothing has been substantiated, but should the presence of controversy and debate be mentioned here? The "visible evidence" (happily married with one child for 60+ years) supports the mainstream interpretation that he was a normal heterosexual. But he was known for making statements to the effect that he had had homosexual relations prior to his marriage. Several authors have published posthumous biographies that attempt to "prove" that he was homosexual. <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Callow_2a04.html" title="Simon Callow">Simon Callow</a>, who knew him, has stated that Guinness may have been homosexual or bisexual but that he chose to live his life as a heterosexual; Callow also implied that Guinness liked to be a bit mysterious and had a tendency to describe himself so as to deliberately mislead, and that he believed Guinness really didn't have much of a sex life at all, not even with his wife. The "facts" in the case are hearsay, but should the existence of controversy be noted? Would an adequate explanation take more proportional space in an article of this size than is warranted by its value? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 17:08, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not certain what you are suggesting? There was a rumor going around for years that he was arrested in a men's room when the rumor was investigated by researchers there was found to be no truth in the matter. Another actor John Gielgud on the otherhand was actually arrested in a men's room.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only controversy seems to be one created by others theories and suggestions. If there is no solid evidence that Alec Guinness was bi-sexual or homosexual and if no writings or recorded statements were made by Guinness say that he was then why is this even being discussed?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Does the fact that he was an English stage actor who had many stage actor friends some who happened to be homosexual mean that he was one himself? Speculation of this sort seems to be just that and is irrelevant for an article of this scope and type. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a> 17:33, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some information about his arrest on this page: <a href="http://myweb.lsbu.ac.uk/stafflag/alecguinness.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://myweb.lsbu.ac.uk/stafflag/alecguinness.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (Quoting from page): In 1946 he had been arrested and fined ten guineas for a homosexual act in a public lavatory in Liverpool, but he avoided publicity by giving his name as Herbert Pocket to the police and the court. The name was taken from the character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations that he had played on stage in 1939 and was also about to play in the film directed by David Lean. The incident did not become public knowledge, unlike that of John Gielgud seven years later in 1953 which received a great deal of press attention. Also: "Last night Mr Morley - son of the actor Robert Morley, a Gielgud contemporary - said Guinness's gay side had 'always been known' to his father and family friends in the theatre such as Dame Gladys Cooper." 69.95.115.154 04:53, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.mckellen.com/writings/sirag.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mckellen.com/writings/sirag.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>entry on his psedo-blog, <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_McKellen_4f6f.html" title="Ian McKellen">Ian McKellen</a> describes a lunch he had with Guinness where he sought Guinness' support for his gay rights campaign. McKellen say that Guinness replied that "It was not appropriate for gay people to talk publicly about their sexuality nor to campaign openly for law reform." Between the lines, McKellen seems to be saying that Guinness was closeted and discreet about his sexuality, but this could also be taken as evidence of a conservative Catholic opposition to homosexuality. McKellen then mentions that Guinness partially bankrolled the professional training of the openly gay <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Charleson_2520.html" title="Ian Charleson">Ian Charleson</a>, the co-lead of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chariots_of_Fire_e5ad.html" title="Chariots of Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>, who died of AIDS in 1990. This too seems like a between-the-lines allegation of gayness, but others have cited this as merely an example of a well-documented tendency to lend his support to up-and-coming actors whose work he admired.--Andrewjnyc 20:24, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Has anyone considered actually reading Guinness's authorized biography by Piers Paul Read? At this point, Guinness's orientation is not a matter of controversy, except possibly among squeamish homophobes. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChips_Critic_3474.html" title="User:Chips Critic">Chips Critic</a> 03:30, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Er, the fact that his marriage was one of convenience and he had sex with many other actors including Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Charles Laughton, Richard Burton, Noel Coward, Dirk Bogarde etc. Sorry homophobic fans of "Star Wars", but you can't change the fact Sir Alec was gay. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.101.html" title="User:195.93.21.101">195.93.21.101</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.93.21.101.html" title="User talk:195.93.21.101">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.93.21.101_2015.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.93.21.101">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Since we are talking about events which took place 60 and 70 years ago, it is very difficult to provide hard evidence. Most of Sir Alec's friends and boyfriends are dead. Next I expect you will say Laughton and Bogarde were straight.</p>

<p>The latest authorized biography proves that there was absolutely no evidence to support the rumor that Guinness was arrested in the 1950's and gave his name as Herbert Pocket. In fact, the author speculated that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gielgud_0e68.html" title="John Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> was really arrested for having sex in a men's room in the '50's and believes that it was this real event that was repackaged and spread about as if it was Guinness. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Dwain</a> 16:13, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it worth including something about A.G. telling James Dean (outside the Villa Capri) he'd be dead in no time if he got into the car that, in fact, he died in just days later?</p>
<p>Just a thought. It isn't mentioned in Dean's article, either.</p>

<p>I did a cleanup of the Trivia section. The first two were simple: They were merely references by a charachter (Lisa from the Simpsons, and Lorenzo from Double Star, respectively) in an otherwise unrelated work of fiction mentioning the name of an internationally recognized actor, and clearly non-notable.</p>
<p>I left the remaining two points, as it might be possible to work them into the text somewhere. It should be easy to work the point on his love-hate relationship with star wars into the Star Wars section. The only reason I didn't do it now myself, is that the point is not sourced. If we can get a reference for this point and work it into the text, fine. Otherwise I say delete it.</p>
<p>The point on Stanley Laurel could possibly be worked into the beginning of the "life and career" section. I don't know how good and encyclopedic it would be though. For now, I left the point here. If someone feels this piece of information is vital to an article on Alec Guiness, please work it into the text at an appropriate place. If no one is interested in doing this, or able to do it in a good way, I say we delete this point too.</p>
<p>To those who disagree, please read <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">wikipedia:trivia</a> before re-adding or adding to the trivia-section.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_bab_aed9.html" title="User:Dr bab">Dr bab</a> 07:54, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
