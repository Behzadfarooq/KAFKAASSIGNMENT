<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relationship with John Laurens</span></h2>
<p>Hamilton had an extraordinary relationship with John Laurens, whom he wrote that he loved. It has been suggested, by Jonathan Ned Katz and others, that this was a homoerotic relationship. In any case, it bears mentioning here. <a href="http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/hamilton_a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/hamilton_a.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>To accuse one of our Founding Fathers of being a homosexual based on assumption routed in a phrase 'loved' is not enough to establish it as fact. In fact, if you read the letters of our Founders, as I have to do my thesis in college, you would understand that the way men expressed themselves then (and woman for that matter) was quite different than our modern minds would perceive. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 00:17, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree in saying that it is worth mentioning, even if it is noted to not be positively true. It seems fairly likely through the excerpts of letters I've read that his rleationship with Laurens was at the very least more than platonic. Also, being a homosexual isn't necessarily a bad thing. "To accuse one of our Founding Fathers of being a homosexual," isn't to say that he was a bad man. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheysangthesolo_2b90.html" title="User:Theysangthesolo">theysangthesolo</a></p>

<dd>Actaully Hamilton asked Laurens to find him a wife: [Mitchell p 199]:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Hamilton had commissioned his friend John Laurens to get him a wife in South Carolina, and gave specifications of his requirements. ... "She must be young--handsome (I lay most stress upon a good shape) Sensible (a little learning will do)--well bred. . . chaste and tender (I am an enthusiast in my notions of fidelity and fondness) of some good nature--a great deal of generosity (she must neither love money nor scolding, for I dislike equally a termagant and an oeconomist)--In politics, I am indifferent what side she may be of--I think I have arguments that will safely convert her to mine--As to religion a moderate stock will satisfy me--She must believe in god and hate a saint. But as to fortune, the larger stock of that the better."</p>

<p>I find it very hard to believe that Alexander Hamilton had a sexual relationship with his friend John Laurens, as it is well-known that Hamilton was, in fact, quite the playboy throughout his life. He was often in sticky situations because of his appreciation of the female sex, and everyone who knew him knew that. In fact, I believe it was his wife's good friend Dolley Madison who named a tomcat of hers "Alexander Hamilton" because of his wandering ways.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some biographers have suggested a relationship with Laurens, or with Lafayette, before Hamilton's marriage. Hamilton's reputation as a philanderer was almost entirely from some years after that, as far as we can tell. They find the tone of the correspondence suggestive, even for the Age of Sentiment. I did not write it; but the present phrasing does have one advantage: Unless "intimate" is taken in a prurient sense, the statement is indisputable: Hamilton and Laurens were intimates and friends. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 17:11, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">historians agree AH was leading abolitionist</span></h2>
<p>Hamilton has often been described as one of the 4-5 most prominent abolitionists among the Founding Fathers (along with Jay and Franklin). For example the main scholarly study is <i>The Transformation of American Abolitionism: Fighting Slavery in the Early Republic by Richard S Newman</i> (2002). on p 18 he says the NYC group was along with the Phily group the “most visible” in the country. He specifies Jay and Hamilton (along with Franklin and Rush) as the prominent statesmen who endorsed abolition. The same argument appears in <i>William Jay, and the Constitutional Movement for the Abolition of Slavery</i> by Bayard Tuckerman, (1893) P 23 which lists the five outstanding antislavery figures of the late 18th century, including Hamilton as one of the five. Likewise Horton (2004) and Littlefield (200) agree. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:41, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've read Horton, who is writing a tertiary source. I do not see <i>this</i> claim. My eyes may be glazing; please quote the exact words to which you give this sense. If the present text said that Hamilton was a <i>prominent statesman who endorsed abolition</i> I would still edit for redundancy and so forth; but it does not: it says he was prominent <i>as an abolitionist</i>; a statement unsupported by even his most fervent biographers. I have limited WP time at the moment (as may be obvious); but I will consult the others as soon as I can.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The dispute over accuracy and PoV was not originally over slavery; no edit over slavery will completely settle them. I hope a statement of the facts, without peacockry, will settle the matter <i>on that issue</i>; but please do not remove the tags.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As an instance of PoV editing, I protest the suppression of the following passage:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>He argued that the blacks were not as stupid as generally believed (and if they were, it didn't matter: "{<a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s24.html" class="external text" title="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s24.html" rel="nofollow">the Russians would make the best troops in the world</a>", if their officers weren't Russians.) Some biographers have acclaimed the liberation of those given muskets as abolitionism; Hamilton argues for it by pointing out that the British were already offering freedom to slaves who ran away and fought for them. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is both sourced, and (as the link will show) factual. The excuse for this suppression was that it is a pro-slavery PoV. If so, Hamilton was a peculiar abolitionist, for it is Hamilton's, and the quote is from him. I await an explanation that is consistent with Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>The present text in the intro is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>He opposed the slave trade and negotiated the deal that abolished the international trade in 1808. During the Revolution he urged Congress to enlisted slaves in the army (and then free them). As a lifelong opponent of slavery and top official of the country's leading abolitionist society he was one of the most prominent Founding Fathers in the abolitionist movement.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>My objections to this are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I see no evidence that he negotiated the slave-trade clause.
<ul>
<li>Neither Chernow nor Mitchell suggest any such thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The clause did not abolish the slave-trade, and we should not say it did.
<ul>
<li>Garry Wills, <i>Negro President</i> 56-9 quotes Madison, Micholas, and Governoeur Morris as expecting the Southwest and the 3/5th clause would give the South an electoral majority. So this is not merely a point of detail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sentence on the Revolution is misleading: it was one abortive project, to raise three or four batallions for one emergency, and it wasn't Hamilton's idea. If we were discussing <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Laurens_8eaf.html" title="John Laurens">John Laurens</a>, this phrasing and placement would be proper.</li>
<li>That he was a <i>lifelong</i> opponent of slavery is conjecture. There is no evidence either way before the Revolution, as Horton, and others state.</li>
<li>That he was <i>top</i> official is peacockry,even in describing the Society secretary; Jay was President. Unless there is evidence elsewhere, it is unsupported by reliable sources; it is a slip of Horton in reading Brookhiser.</li>
<li>That the New York society was "the leading" is peacockry; it is not even supported by Jensen's own summary above.</li>
<li>The remainder of the sentence is either original research or (in the lead) undue weight given to a minority view; what even Chernow does not assert is not consensus. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Slave trade at Constutional convention. Pmanderson is right (I misread Mitchell 1: 411); the clause was an agreement to abolish the International slave trade in 1808, which happened on schedule.</li>
<li>Garry Wills etc: Hamilton lost out on the 3/5th rule.</li>
<li>Hamilton was a top aide to Washington and he made a formal proposal to Congress involving abolition (with Laurens). That is important to show AH’s dedication to abolition from early on.</li>
<li>Lifelong opponent is true enough. He was on record opposing slavery at age 15 [McDonald p. 10] – how young does one have to be? Horton p 19 quotes Hamilton attacking slavery in print at age 19</li>
<li>Top official–he was the #2 official after Jay.</li>
<li>New York and Philadelphia were the 2 leading abolitionist societies. (See the standard history by Newman p 18)</li>
<li>Prominent among Founding Fathers: not original research–comes from Newman book <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 04:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The Constitution says: <i>The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person</i> (I,9,1) (and Article Five prohibits the amendement of this before it expires).
<ul>
<li>This is not an agreement to abolish, but an agreement to postpone consideration definitely. (If, as some think, the South felt certain of losing the vote when it came, this would be a tweak; but Wills shows that Madison and others expected to have a majority in the not-too-distant future, and Morris, at least, agreed.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The draft plan he drew up during the Convention included the three-fifths rule (Mitchell, p. 401). There were many reasons for Northerners to oppose it; assuming it as anti-slavery is conjecture.</li>
<li><i>Top aide</i> is redundant; Washington did not have a multi=level staff. He supported Laurens' limited (and abortive) proposal; to phrase this as through the proposal were general is misleading the reader.</li>
<li>please quote McDonald, with date of document. It is particularly undesirable to cite Hamilton by age.
<ul>
<li>Horton quotes a document opposing Parliamentary rule in the colonies <i>as slavery</i>. By this argument, Jefferson is an abolitionist.</li>
<li>None of the actions cited as Hamilton's opposition to slavery took place after 1788; none of them related to New York's actual abolition in 1799.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The assertion that he was secretary depends on a single tertiary source, written by a man who is out of his field, citing a source which does not support him. Even if true, it would not justify <i>top man</i>, but <i>a top man</i>.
<ul>
<li>On this matter, Chernow, who looked at the New York papers, is a secondary source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So they were. The unmodified text did not say this, and it suggested that New York was unparallelled.</li>
<li>I do not have Newman with me as I type. I repeat, however, that there is a distinction between <i>a prominent man who opposed slavery</i> and <i>a man prominent as an opponent of slavery</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The present section on <i>Hamilton and slavery</i> is advocacy by special pleading and selective quotation. This does not belong on Wikipedia; use a blog - we can even link to it.</p>
<p><a name="Hamilton_not_mentioned" id="Hamilton_not_mentioned"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Hamilton not mentioned</span></h3>
<p>I will add here: I pulled a random history of abolition off the shelf. Basker, ed.&#160;:<i>Early American Abolitionists 1760-1820</i>, which contains extensive historical reviews to set context. It mentions Franklin and Jay repeatedly; it mentions Hamilton three times:</p>
<ul>
<li>once to say that he, Madison, and Jay wrote the Federalist Papers.</li>
<li>Twice in identifying <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tench_Coxe_565e.html" title="Tench Coxe">Tench Coxe</a> as Undersecretary of the Treasury.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't mention his antislavery activity at all. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 19:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Filler: <i>Crusade against Slavery</i> mentions Jefferson, Benezet, and Henry Clay on the Kentudky constitution of 1798. He doesn't ever mention Hamilton, and he mentions several societies without picking out the NY one. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 21:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Arming slaves&#160;: from classical times to the modern age</i>, edited by Christopher Leslie Brown and Philip D. Morgan, mentions the South Carolina episode as one of a series of such proposals. It associates it with Laurens alone, and even calls him "a rather solitary proponent. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:48, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">What Newman says</span></h3>
<dl>
<dd><i>The New York society joined its Pennsylvania counterpart as one of the most visible first-generation abolitionist organizations. Inaugurated in New York City in January 1784, the NYMS advocated the gradual abolition of slavery, established schools for free blacks, aided African Americans in courts of law, and fought to end the overseas and domestic slave trades. Like the PAS, the New York group received official incorporation from the state government and welcomed prominent statesmen into its ranks, including John Jay and Alexander Hamilton.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And on p.28:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>New York’s John Jay and Alexander Hamilton (both members of the New York Manumission Society) held corresponding status in the PAS.</i> (after similar mentions of PAS members from Massachusetts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is <b>all</b> he says.</p>
<ul>
<li>If browsing did not make clear that Newman is reading the PAS archives for the 1780's and 1790's, I would cite this as more evidence of Hamilton's inactivity. As it is, it is inconsistent with the implications of Jensen's edits that Hamilton was the anti-slavery Colossus.</li>
<li>This does not say that there were the two leading organizations, but that these were two among the leading organizations.</li>
<li><i>January 1784</i> puts Hamilton even further from the founding of the NYMS; it may be a misprint.</li>

<dd>Alas, it was a common tactic for proslavery spokesmen to ridicule and minimize the work of abolitionists. Pmanderson continues that unfortunate tradition.
<dl>
<dd>So, to add anything less than laudatory about Hamilton is to support slavery. A convenient argument, but less than a syllogism - and a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hamilton was one of the 3-5 most prominent opponents of slavery among the Founding Fathers say the historians [Newman, Horton] &amp; is denied by no-one. Hamilton helped set up one of the two most important abolitionist societies in the country, was elected secretary and president, drew up key petitions, and was active in its legal work and its boycotts. Pmanderson'squibbles are typical of anti-anti-abolitionists seeking to minimize their role in history. He demands I quote McDonald when he was the one who erased the McDonald quote. OK Here's McDonald p 10, saying Knox in 1772, "taught him to abhor slavery as the wellspring of many other evils." Or page 34: " In one crucial respect, however, his attitude never changed: he always championed liberty and abhorred slavery." (talking about black slavery)
<ul>
<li>Newman does not say this; Horton does not appear to say it.</li>
<li>Does McDonald present any evidence on page 10, or is this more conjecture? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hamilton as an officer of the Manumission Society. Several biographers say so: <i>History of the Republic of the United States of America: As Traced in the Writings of Alexander Hamilton</i> by John C. (John Church) Hamilton says AH was elected president of the group abou 1800 [p. 442] Also Nathan Schachner, Alexander Hamilton (1946), p. 183. As late as 1803 he was elected an officer [Hamilton Papers vol 26 p. 81]. <i>Alexander Hamilton: A Life</i> by Willard Sterne Randall calls him "a prime mover" in the Manumission Society. Randall says AH drafted the 1786 petition to the state legislature calling for the abolition of slavery--there were 9400 slaves in NY state. It passed the Assembly over furious opposition but was killed by the upper house [292-3] In <i>Blacks in Colonial America</i> by Oscar Reiss (1997) has details on abolition in every state, and says AH was elected Secretary (p. 85). <i>The Market Revolution: Jacksonian America, 1815-1846</i> by Charles Sellers says Hamilton succeeded Jay as President of the group.

<dd>People who systematically go about ridiculing abolitionists are following a well-known proslavery agenda. That is nasty business and will be exposed. Newman lists the most important abolitionist leaders of the era and notes Mamumission Soc "received official incorporation from the state government and welcomed prominent statesmen into its ranks, including John Jay and Alexander Hamilton." I think "prominent statesmen" = Founding Fathers. Mitchell's bio in 1950s was written before the civil rights movement, and abolitionists had a very bad press then for causing a needless war [Civil War]. So Mitchell simply left out the details. We have a much different sensibility today and so people like Horton, kennedy, Randall, Littlefield etc pay more attention to his antislavery work. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 18:37, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fascinating! In my experience, ridiculing abolitionists has been the business of the Marxists rather than Southern Apologists, and pro-slavery is not a fault I normally ascribe to Marxists. Frederick Douglass deprecated most abolitionists as wanting, "Rain without thunder and lightning." Pro-slavery is not a descriptor I would apply to him. Personally, I think Hamilton and Franklin and crew did about as well as they could, but others are not so charitable for reasons that have nothing to do with liking slavery.</dd>

<dd>I will add that I grew up on books written in the 1950's, and if anything the abolitionists were lionized. The next current was that the Founders sold out the slaves to expediency, and only around 1980 did I start running into the attitude you describe. Obviously, your experience is different, and if you have done careful surveys of trends in the literature, I stand informed.</dd>

<dd>Neither do the other three. I have discussed Newman above. Tuckerman's nineteenth-century book makes a list of anti-slavery <i>societies</i>; the NYMS is duly listed, between the PAS and the abolition society of Connecticut. Littlefield discusses the mulatto abolitionist <i>William</i> Hamilton at some length; he has four paragraphs on Alexander, none of which say any such thing; founding member (and member of a committee) of the NYMS, but nothing about secretary. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 21:36, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Hugh Knox</span></h4>
<p>McDonald's book (p.10) refers entirely to Broadus Mitchell's paper (<i>ProcNJHistSoc.</i> <b>69</b>:88-115, and claims no other source or evidence. Knox, Princeton 1754, was minister of St Saba, and transferred to St. Croix May 1772; he spent some time there negotiating the previous fall, but there is no evidence he met Hamilton then. He set up the collection which sent Hamilton to the mainland, and they corresponded thereafter; some of this is lost.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no evidence he taught Hamilton.</li>
<li>One of his sermons was on the ill-effects of Negro slavery, but there is no evidence he was an abolitionist. The sermon was printed in 1768, so there is no evidence Hamilton heard it.</li>
<li>He was on St. Croix, all told, six months before Hamilton left it.</li>
<li>Hamilton had been working for Cruger, and suprisingly literate for two years, before Knox settled on the island.</li>
<li>Hamilton is not mentioned in Knox's obituary, May 1790.</li>

<dd>In Wiki we rely on leading scholars, such as Forrest McDonald. He says "His influence upon Hamilton... was considerable especially in focusing and reinforcing his moral sense. Knox inspired Hamilton with a religious piety that lasted for some time, impressed upon him the dangers of drinking to excess, and taught him to abhor slavery as the wellspring of many other evils." so we go with that.

<p>In fact, Knox's sermon (or rather quarter of a sermon) is part of a sequence of Christian household management: See Knox's <i>Discourses on the truth of revealed religion and other important subjects.</i> (London, 1768) II, 162-175, and the context. It is a characteristic example of how far one can go without being abolitionist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Slaves are held by lawful authority (II,109)</li>
<li>Parents control their children <i>and servants</i> by divine right (II, 189)</li>
<li>A belief in God will make them more obedient, and reuce pilferage.</li>
<li>But these "poor unhappy unfortunates" will be judged equally with us at the day of judgment (and, yes, Knox's phrasing makes quite clear he is preaching to the owners)</li>
<li>They are not dull and stupid, but appear so because they are in an abject condition and a foreign culture.</li>
<li>They have faults, but these are the results of the absence of Christian instruction; and their swearing must be the results of white example</li>
<li>We should be just in our severity to both children and servants; and he quotes Juvenal to the effect that domestic cruelty is a bad example to our children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without the element of divine right, this could easily become abolitionism; as in other fields, it became revolution; but it hasn't yet. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 17:24, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is plagiarism.

<li>If so, McDonald's language is more or less justified, for we know what Knox's sermons were. (I suspect McDonald has not read them, and this is why the last clause is vague. Broadus Mitchell summarized as "ill effects of slavery").</li>
<li>Mitchell also said that there is no evidence, either way, that Knox taught Hamilton. However, McDonald may well mean this, or be happy to suggest it. He may regard it as obvious that Knox would have done so; Hamilton did require some months of coaching even after he arrived in North America. It depends, I suppose, when Knox noticed Hamilton, and when Hamilton left St. Croix (I observe that Chernow has a conjecture on this.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:35, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Fair use does not give any hard and fast rules on number of words; however, it is never fair use to lift a passage out of one work and pass it off as one's own writing in another.

<p>Wiki's role is to present the best scholarship, and not to do any original research. That means that if a leading scholar makes a point about Hamilton we are bound to it, unless there is a dispute in the literature. (In which case we report the dispute and not try to arbitrate it.) The POV rules mean that efforts to promote a proslavery or anti-abolitionist agenda are not allowed on Wiki. Some recent edits run afoul of these rules by one editor who wants to ridicule abolitionists and indeed ridiculed black soldiers at one point. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 19:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are also bound to say what the literature actually says; which the present version does not. And I deny that a statement credited to one secondary source, and denied by that source, is, at that moment, can possibly be the best scholarship - one side of a dispute, possibly. I admire, in the literal sense, Jensen's ability to detect ridicule; what edit can he be thinking of, the direct quote from Hamilton? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's give an example of incompetent scholarship that crept into the article. A 1952 article by Larson in William and Mary Quarterly discussed (p 147) whether young Hamilton in fact was given charge of business affairs when the owner (Cruger) was away. The evidence rested on a dozens of letters. Larson said the letters were "baffling" and noted that he was not a handwriting expert and could not verify they were by Hamilton, therefore "for the lack of convincing evidence" he decided they were not by Hamilton andtherefore Hamilton was not really in charge (p 148). . Since then the experts at the Hamilton papers (Syrett et al see vol 1) confirmed the handwriting, as did Mitchell and most recently Chernow, who conducted extensive research in the West Indies. All biographers now agree that Hamilton did write the letters and that he was in charge of the business. All except one editor who still cites Larson's doubts and wants Wiki to reflect discredited 1952 speculation.</dd>

<dd><i>Hamilton was a lifelong abolitionist, going on record at age 19 against slavery, even though (like other abolitionists) he owned household servants. He collaborated with Laurens on a proposal to and arm a regiment of blacks under Laurens' command, and emancipate them. Hamilton brought the proposal to Congress, but it was rejected by South Carolina officials. He refuted arguments that blacks made incompetent soldiers and rejected the dominant racism of the era.<a href="http://www.vindicatingthefounders.com/library/index.asp?document=14" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vindicatingthefounders.com/library/index.asp?document=14" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> He publicly denounced Americans who demanded freedom for themselves but refused to allow it for blacks: "Who talk most about liberty and equality?... Is it not those who hold the bill of rights in one hand and a whip for affrighted slaves in the other?" <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>As Horton, a leading African American historian, observes, Hamilton was moving toward a vision of a multiracial society and matched his actions to his beliefs. In 1785 he helped organize the (New York) Society for Promoting Manumissions. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jay_7ffe.html" title="John Jay">John Jay</a> was president and Hamilton was Secretary; he later became President. This was the second abolitionist society in the country. It played the major role in abolishing slavery for the 9,000 black slaves in New York State in 1799. Hamilton, Jay and Burr — three of the most powerful men in New York City — organized boycotts to force businessmen and newspapers to end their connection with the international slave trade. In court, Hamilton argued on behalf of dozens of runaway slaves in pro bono lawsuits. In international affairs Hamilton supported <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toussaint_L%27Ouverture_0716.html" title="Toussaint L'Ouverture">Toussaint L'Ouverture</a>'s black government in Haiti after he revolted and overthrew French control. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></i></dd>

<p>What Jensen's sources actually say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horton:
<dl>
<dd><i>Yet Hamilton did not call for removal of blacks emerging from slavery. He is traditionally credited with envisioning an industrialized, urbanized America, but we might consider that he may have also envisioned a multiracial America. Of all the differences between Hamilton and Jefferson, perhaps their assumptions about the racial future of America were most telling. For a man who had grown up in a black society in the West Indies, a multi-racial New York or a multiracial America was not unimaginable.</i>
<dl>
<dd>An argument from silence: Hamilton never said anything for the colonization of freedmen; therefore he might not have minded a multiracial society. A quite possible conjecture; but not what Jensen quotes Horton as saying.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>McDonald;
<dl>
<dd><i>Much of what he said about slavery at first was patriotic hyperbole, but beneath the talk about evil ministerial designs lay an intense hostility towards slavery in the more conventional sense.</i> (No date is given.)
<dl>
<dd>In short, Hamilton is "on the record" as opposing the British; but McDonald sees a deeper sense.
<dl>
<dd>This appears to arise from a single short paragraph in the <i>Full Vindication</i> (McDonald gives no examples) which criticizes slavery in a manner not uncommon in the middle 1770's: <i>Slavery was condemned by almost all the leaders of the Revolution. Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, slaveholders all, made statements supporting the principle of gradual abolition.</i> (McManus 152). McDonald's view is described in the present text. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Too long to quote, but a lengthy statement about the Manumission society, controverting any suggestion in Flexner's text that it was a do-nothing body. Since Flexner doesn't say this, the whole passage seems odd; he says it was a social obligation to belong to it. The only mention of Hamilton (other than refutanda from Flesner):
<dl>
<dd><i>Its lawyers, such as Hamilton and Burr, processed thirty-six cases of unlawful enslavement for blacks.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Note that all the society's lawyers did three dozen, and since there were at least four of them (Chernow, p.239), <i>dozens</i> above is an exaggeration. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 01:16, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Alexander Hamilton to John Jay</p>
<p>14 Mar. 1779 (Papers 2:17--18) <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s24.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s24.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><br />
Col Laurens, who will have the honor of delivering you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project, which I think, in the present situation of affairs there, is a very good one and deserves every kind of support and encouragement. This is to raise two three or four batalions of negroes; with the assistance of the government of that state, by contributions from the owners in proportion to the number they possess. If you should think proper to enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail of his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by Congress to the state; and, as an inducement, that they would engage to take those batalions into Continental pay.</p>
<p>It appears to me, that an expedient of this kind, in the present state of Southern affairs, is the most rational, that can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected in that quarter without it; and the enemy's operations there are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have not the least doubt, that the negroes will make very excellent soldiers, with proper management; and I will venture to pronounce, that they cannot be put in better hands than those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, enterprise, and every other qualification requisite to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some great military judges, that with sensible officers soldiers can hardly be too stupid; and on this principle it is thought that the Russians would make the best troops in the world, if they were under other officers than their own. The King of Prussia is among the number who maintain this doctrine and has a very emphatical saying on the occasion, which I do not exactly recollect. I mention this, because I frequently hear it objected to the scheme of embodying negroes that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This is so far from appearing to me a valid objection that I think their want of cultivation (for their natural faculties are probably as good as ours) joined to that habit of subordination which they acquire from a life of servitude, will make them sooner bec[o]me soldiers than our White inhabitants. Let officers be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers approach to machines perhaps the better.</p>
<p>I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience; and an unwillingness to part with property of so valuable a kind will furnish a thousand arguments to show the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme which requires such a sacrifice. But it should be considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will; and that the best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out will be to offer them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is to give them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure their fidelity, animate their courage, and I believe will have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the project; for the dictates of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favour of this unfortunate class of men.<a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s24.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s24.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<dd>1 Hamilton's devotion to republicanism in the 1790s was exemplified by the letter to Washington quoted (and by McDonald's book in elaborate detail). Not to mention the Federalist Papers which every scholar in 200 years has cited as an ur-source of American values. The otriginal research by PmAnderson is not credited by scholars.</dd>
<dd>2 Along with John Jay he was the most conspicuous Founding Fathers -- he is repeatedly listed in the standard reference works like Newman. (The only possible competitor was Franklin, who died too soon to be important in abolition. Franklin was in no way more conspicuous that Hamilton on slavery issue.)</dd>
<dd>3 Mitchell says AH "participated with a friend John Laurens" in the project. Text says that Hamilton took the emancipation plan to Congress, which is correct--he --not Laurens--made the argument to Congress.</dd>
<dd>4 AH was a founder of the Manusmission society, the #3 signature, a repeat officer as Secretary, Counsellor and President. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 14:37, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<ol>
<li>The "original research" here consists of looking up Mitchell and Chernow and seeing what they say. That Hamilton supported republican principles <i>for the United States</i> is clear. To suggest that the secretary of the Convention was inventing Hamilton's monarchism is misrepresentation; Chernow and Mitchell agree that he made the speech on hereditary monarchy (with a legislature of Life Senators and commons) as the ideal, but unachievable, government.</li>
<li>He is mentioned twice by Newman, and I have quoted both references in full <a href="#what_Newman_actually_says" title="">above</a>. They do not support this statement or anything close to it.
<ul>
<li>Despite Franklin's early death, Newman mentions Franklin four times, and calls him <i>eminent</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Took" is misleading, "wrote" is accurate; and "Laurens' plan" is a quote from Mitchell.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yes Knox taught Hamilton</span></h2>
<p>Historians agree that Knox educated Hamilton:</p>

<li>Mitchell: An immediate sympathy sprang up between them. Both had the taste for study and literature in a community more given to</li>
</ul>
<p>ledgers and litigation. Alexander's gifts were obviously to be his reliance, and probably from the first Knox was alert to contrive means of fulfilling the boy's ambitions. Plausibly, a further influence of Knox was on Hamilton's noticeable early piety We may think that Hugh Knox influenced Alexander to support the cause of the American colonies....The evidence points to Hugh Knox as proposer and organizer of the plan to send Alexander to America. Mitchell 1:33-34</p>
<ul>
<li>McDonald: "An immediate sympathy sprang up between them. Both had the taste for study and literature in a community more given to</li>

<dd>Quibble quibble. Indeed it was Mitchell who wrote "An immediate sympathy sprang up between them. Both had the taste for study and literature in a community more given to ledgers and litigation. Alexander's gifts were obviously to be his reliance, and probably from the first Knox was alert to contrive means of fulfilling the boy's ambitions." p 33 Pmanderson seems to think teaching = sitting in a classroom. That is not how teaching works of course.

<dd>Those who wish to publish conjectures should do so under their own names; Wikipedia should stick to the accurate, the consensus, and the verifiable; and it would be nice to keep to things for which there is actual evidence. Knox was his clergyman, his "friend and patron". To suggest, as Jensen has been trying to do, that Knox conveyed some esoteric doctrine, is to go beyond the evidence. Knox's sermons were neither abolitionist nor revolutionary; he specifically avoided discussing the powers of the temporal magistrate, even when drawing the parallel between him and the Christian householder. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:03, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Conjecture? Nonsense. Our job is to go with the scholars--Mitchell, Syrett, McDonald, Miller, Chernow. When they say XXX we report XXX and do not try to refute their conclusions, as Pmanderson repeatedly tries to do. Thus to quote McDonald p 10 regarding Knox: "His influence upon Hamilton, during the few months he had him under his direct tutelage, was considerable, especially in focusing and reinforcing his moral sense. Knox inspired Hamilton with a religious piety that lasted for some time, impressed upon him the dangers of drinking to excess, and taught him to abhor slavery as the wellspring of many other evils. Most immediately important, however, was the orientation of Knox's faction of the Kirk: in a manner of speaking, the fifteen-year‐old Hamilton fell in with a group of revolutionaries" That's history, that's what we report. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 16:14, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>If "tutelage" = "education", it's McDonald's conjecture. It's unsupported by his (secondary) source, by argument, or by evidence. It should be mentioned; but it should be given no more weight than a single evidence-free conjecture deserves. A special section on McDonald's Hamilton may be warranted, since it seems to differ from everyone else's; but if so, we should report what he said.

<p>On the other hand, in strict usage, "tutelage" does <b>not</b> mean the education given to a 17-year old who has met a payroll; still less does it mean the graduation-address meaning of <i>education</i> which Jensen accuses me of ignoring. If we don't insist on compelling McDonald to mean this, we have the following genuinely consensus set of statements among the authorities, and McDonald agrees completely with Mitchell's paper, which he praises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hamilton was in Knox's congregation;</li>
<li>Knox lent him books,</li>
<li>Knox encouraged him to write for the paper, which Knox helped edit</li>
<li>Knox preached sobreity and about the evils of slavery</li>

<p>The incident in which Hamilton saved the Tory President of Columbia from a patriot mob by oratory is accepted by McDonald (p.14), Mitchell (I 75), Chernow (63), and Flexner (78). Flexner even answers the objection that Cooper wrote a poem about the incident and didn't mention Hamilton.</p>
<p>Yet Rjensen deleted this consensus statement<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Hamilton&amp;diff=60600817&amp;oldid=60597297" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Hamilton&amp;diff=60600817&amp;oldid=60597297" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> If we are bound to follow the consensus of the authorities, why?</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jensen ignores the clear text of historians on a far more important issue: Mitchell distinguishes quite clearly between Hamilton's "ideal" government, the parliamentary monarchy, and his requirements for the "republican experiment". (Howe's paper addresses only the latter, and doesn't narrate the quarrel before 1792.) The present text of the intro is incompatible with this distinction. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:41, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No don't revise--the statements are quite accurate. PManderson alas began by using proslavery tactics to ridicule abolitionists and blacks, and now expands to tar Hamilton.</dd>

<p>1) certainly true: :<i>He rejected the states-rights, localistic, agricultural orientation propounded by his arch-rival Thomas Jefferson. " and yes Jefferson was the arch-rival and even founded a whole party to fight Hamilton. Burr of course was an enemy at the end.</i> 2) :<i>Along with his friend John Jay, he was the most conspicuous Founding Father in opposing slavery.</i> supported by new book by Davis, Inhuman Bondage p 154, as well as major Horton article and major exhibit at NY Hist Society that emphasizes AH role. I don't believe anyone (except maybe Jay) has received this much attention for abolitionist activity in the late 18th century. Note that recent scholarship sharply dimninishes role of Franklin.<a href="http://www.common-place.org/vol-04/no-04/author/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.common-place.org/vol-04/no-04/author/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> 3) absolutely true : <i>and was a cofounder and president of the country's second abolitionist society." See Newman book</i> Cofounder: he was #3 on the list; president is attested by several scholars. PManderson's intense POV is showing here 4) Republicanism in the US, agreed. 5) "Hamilton had been supporting and associating with Tories for years. " well not in 1774-1783 when he helped destroy the Tories. He did favor reconciliation with the many Loyalists who remained behind. 6) literally true: :<i>Hamilton made sure the Federalist newspapers were equally nasty in their attacks on the Jeffersonians." Article already cleary states: "party newspapers that bolstered Hamilton's position and excoriated the opposition. He supported partisan newspaper editors such as John Fenno and Noah Webster." <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 19:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Personal attacks are still deprecated; this one is already grounds for a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Rjensen_5a5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Rjensen">RfC</a>; there are other remedies for repeated incivility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rjensen's comments would be far more legible if he would format them. Either &lt;br&gt; or the left-justified string of control characters (including the autonumbering #) would be a help.
<ol>
<li>I repeat, this is a parody of Jefferson's actual policies; it will be replaced when I find a better short description. The melodrama about <i>arch-rival</i> is frivolous, and inconsistent with Hamilton's decision in 1800.</li>
<li>This is not the work of a serious editor.
<ul>
<li>As Robert West said above: Horton does not call Hamilton <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alexander_Hamilton&amp;diff=60750413&amp;oldid=60699620" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Alexander_Hamilton&amp;diff=60750413&amp;oldid=60699620" rel="nofollow">one of the top N, for any N</a>. This includes N=2, which is the present text. If Rjensen will supply the passage to which he ascribes this force, I will read it.</li>
<li>Davis's words are (<i>loc. cit.</i>): "No less significant is the fact that many national leaders including Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, John Adams, John Jay, Gouverneur Morris, and Rufus King, slavery as an immense problem, a curse, a blight, or a national disease."
<ul>
<li>This not only fails to support the claim that Jay and Hamilton were exceptional; it denies it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reference to the exhibit is not a verifiable citation; and an exhibit on Hamilton is not required to give due weight to Franklin, Burr, or Adams - it would be unkind to compel them to discuss men on whom they have no room for displays.</li>
<li>As for Waldstreicher's essay, it makes two actual points: that Franklin's antislavery does not put him on a pedestal above his contemporaries, and that Franklin did not come unequivocally to any such conclusion until late in his life - which is the same decades the other Founders did. Some editors might protest this besmirching of an abolitionist; I will simply agree, for what it is worth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Newman's two mentions of Hamilton are <a href="#what_Newman_actually_said" title="">already quoted above</a>. Neither supports the disputed portions of the present text. The remainder of this consists of Rjensen's claims about primary sources, and his guesses at their significance. My POV remains a preference for statements actually supported by reliable secondary sources.</li>
<li>Nice to see agreement on something; will so alter.</li>
<li>None of this red herring makes Madison's conclusion groundless or supports the bias of the present text, which is therefore undefended.</li>
<li>Misleading the reader in the intro, in the hope that he will catch the explanation some paragraphs below, is unacceptable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>This all adds up to additional voices in the actual consensus of scholarship; <i>Hamilton was prominent among the Founding Fathers</i> (which the rest of the article implies anyway) and <i>Like many of them, he expressed his detestation of slavery</i>. I am still willing, for the sake of compromise, to up the second to <i>abolitionist</i>. What's wrong with that? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both the Continental Army and the British freed slave recruits. It took Washington "the first year of the war" to agree to this (see the cited page of McManus); but then it was easier for the British: they didn't have to pay compensation. I don't really care which we say, but they're not the same thing. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:47, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Avoiding_Peacock_Terms_and_Personal_Attacks" id="Avoiding_Peacock_Terms_and_Personal_Attacks"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Avoiding Peacock Terms and Personal Attacks</span></h2>
<p>Peacock terms are generally deprecated in Wikipedia, even if sourced. In the same vein, I quote from Waldstreicher's essay, "We might ask, in other words, whether these debates about the relative virtues of Founders are doing anything besides increasing our obsession with the Founders and their personal traits. The very question has its biases toward smoking guns, moral judgments, individuals, and their last words." He doesn't think much of the tendency to rank, and on reflection, neither do I.</p>
<p>This whole most-prominent-abolitionist thing is really a tempest in a teapot. The article should focus on what Hamilton did, and what he said. He was prominent: no argument. He worked for abolition and had meaningful accomplishments befitting his station: no argument. Would "abolitionist" have been one of the top three adjectives that a voter in 1800 would have used to describe Hamilton? We will probably never know -- the sources cited so far are silent on that point.</p>
<p>Part of editing is selection. I have enough Franklin biographies on my shelf to dispute numbering Hamilton in the top two, and Catherine Drinker Bowen doesn't even mention Hamilton when she enumerates abolitionists at the Convention. We could devote half the article to the dispute, which would be undue weight to an unimportant issue. The whole question of where Hamilton ranks is peripheral and divisive at best. IMO, it adds nothing to the article.</p>
<p>Rjensen, as for your renewing the attack upon Septentrionalis as being pro-slavery, that was incivil and unjustified, whatever the article should look like. I note that you cite Waldstreicher's points about Franklin, which are remarkably similar to those Septentrionalis raises about Hamilton. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">Special pleading</a> aside, why should he be called pro-slavery and you not?</p>
<p>Rjensen, please apologize to Septentrionalis, and <a href="../../../s/p/i/WP%7ESPIDER_911a.html" title="WP:SPIDER">please climb down from the Reichstag</a> before this gets more carried away than it already has. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:39, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rjensen's recent edit puzzles me.
<ul>
<li>Why call an extensive revision a tweak?</li>
<li>Wny this proliferation of peacock terms at all?</li>
<li>Hamilton helped end the <i>export</i> trade in slaves out of New York; why suggest this was international? The obvious market was the South; the less obvious dodge was to "sell" a slave in New Jersey and "lease" him back, to evade NY legislation. (see McManus)</li>
<li>Why claim credit for forming Jay's Treaty? The British formed it; if any American helped shape it, it was Jay. ("the treaty Jay had negotiated" McDonald, p. 315.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And above all: Is Hamilton's reputation so fragile that this mess of exaggerations, and misleading claims, is needed to bolster it?
<dl>
<dd>To be clear, I removed the mass in part because Hamilton's reputation <i>doesn't</i> need it. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Some comments. Franklin is no longer considered a major antislavery figure (See Waldtreicher), but Hamilton is, as testified by Horton's major statement and the major exhibit at the NY Historical Society.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Hamilton shaped the Jay treaty more than Jay did or anyone else, So he gets credit.</li>
<li>people who use proslavery tactics and call blacks stupid are getting themselves in hot water. Pmanderson needs to apologize and promise not to do that again. I will not apologize for loudly complaining about blatant racism.</li>
<li>Hamilton played the central role in stopping the international slave trade out of New York City</li>
<li>Wiki does not use 50 year old popular history (Bowen)--when we have dozens of better sources. It's an example of poor research skills displayed by Pmanderson. (For example he erased material about AH's business skills based on long-superceded sources, while ignoring very good recent work by Chernow.)</li>
<li>Readers expect Wiki to summarize how historians evaluate their subjects. Hamilton as one of the dominant figures 1787-1800 is unusually important. Abolitionism is especially important (the slavery issue has recently badly hurt Jefferson and now Franklin, and raised Hamilton's esteem.)<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 01:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Rjensen has left a remarkable number of misattributions for a polemic on research skills.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have all read Waldstriecher; two of us disagree that he says any such thing, on different grounds. What sentence does Rjensen see this as having this force?</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Unsourced fantasy; not even McDonald says that.</li>
<li>I regret this indefinitely repeated personal attack; I trust it will be reconsidered.
<ul>
<li><i>stupid</i> is Hamilton's word (so if this is blatant racism, then Jensen's argument falls to the ground anyway).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There has beem no evidence, and it is unlikely <i>a priori</i>, that there was any significant international slave trade out of New York in 1785.
<ul>
<li>if this is based on calling New Jersey and the Carolinas other nations, it is deceiving the reader.</li>
<li>If it is based on the scope of the law, it is disingenuous. The export of slaves to Mars would be illegal too. Would this justify "interplanetary"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did not cite Bowen.
<ul>
<li>If I had, so what? The records of the Constitutional Convention have not changed since 1966. (2006-1966 = 40)</li>
<li>This comes poorly from a man who will cite a popular history from 1893, like Tuckerman.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As far as I can tell, no historian has ever made the evaluation which Jensen insists on; certainly none has been cited. Even if <i>one</i> had, <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPeacock_fa49.html" title="WP:Peacock">WP:Peacock</a> and the principle of undue weight would argue against the position he wants to put it in. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 17:47, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>New York, like other states, had its legislature choose its <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_College_1b27.html" title="Electoral College">Electors</a> for President, and the legislative election of April 1800 had been largely fought on the issue of whether Federalists or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republicans_b642.html" title="Democratic-Republicans">Democratic-Republicans</a> would be chosen; and Aaron Burr won them, by letting the Federalists announce their candidates first. Few prominent Federalists chose to leave New York to spend three months in Albany, but Burr had arranged for the most eminent Jeffersonians to stand, including <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Clinton_%28vice_president%29_6c01.html" title="George Clinton (vice president)">George Clinton</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Gates_246d.html" title="Horatio Gates">Horatio Gates</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In May, immediately after the election, Hamilton and his father-in-law wrote John Jay, who had left the Supreme Court to be Governor of New York, suggesting that the outgoing Federalist legislature be recalled, and pass a bill, dividing New York into districts to vote for Electors directly; he enclosed a map of the proposed districts, five or six of which could be counted on to pick Federalist Electors; which might well be enough to decide the election for the Federalists. Jay endorsed Hamilton's letter: "Proposing a measure for <i>party</i> purposes, which it would not become me to adopt", and did not reply.</dd>

<p>It would on the whole be helpful if Rjensen would consult the listed references for statements. McManus spends some time describing the British efforts to enourage slaves to run away from their masters and fight for the British on the promise of freedom; more than he does on the Continental enlistments. I don't see why Rjensen disbelieves this; the danger of their doing so is cited in <a href="#What_Hamilton_actually_said" title="">Hamilton's letter</a>. Furthermore, since the injury was to colonials and rebels out of the King's protection, the British had every reason to do so. (I have seen no source on what they did with runaway slaves belonging to Tories; presumably it depended on the political influence of the owner.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 13:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>designing the Jay Treaty in 1794 that promoted trade and resolved issues left over from the Revolution</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>citing Elkins and McKitrick. What they actually say (as consensus, and they are right) is that Hamilton "devised Jay's <i>instructions</i>", a very different statement.</p>
<p>Those instructions left Jay, who would be negotiating at some 3000 miles from Philadelphia, an enormous amount of latitude, and a rock bottom minimum (EK say <i>sine qua non</i>, 412). Jay, who had a very poor negotiating hand, came in very close to that minimum - in part because of Hamilton. In the process, he failed to resolve most of the grievances and points of principle left over from the Revolution, and made a substantive concession on the carrying trade from the West Indies which was unnecessary (the Senate refused to ratify, and the British accepted the change <i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>
<p>In short, this statement is not supported by its authority - or by any other. (Rjensen writes as if Jay's Treaty were a credit to Hamilton; how he comes to that conclusion is another mystery.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hamilton designed the Jay treaty and Jay negotiated it. "The leading role in the devising of Jay's instructions, as has always been known, was played by Alexander Hamilton. The main principles were initially blocked out at a meeting on April 21, 1794." They explain in detail how all the main prinsiples were wroked out, primarily by Hamilton. By the way it was NOT British custom to free slaves--who invented that?</dd>

<p>Bemis (Jay Treat p 212) insists on <b>"how thoroughly the ideas of Hamilton dominated the negotiation, even more strongly than they had controlled the early informal diplomacy with England and the official negotiations between Hammond and Jefferson.

<dd>Rjensen quotes correctly statements which do not support his text. But I see no reason not to cite what Elkins and McKitrick actually said. I shall even refrain from adding, as controversial, Hamilton's evaluation of his instructions as a "crude mass". The value of Jay's Treaty, which is even more controversial, does not belong in the intro. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 01:37, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alexander Hamilton. "But it should be considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will; and that the best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out will be to offer them ourselves." Letter on the Laurens project, pasted in full above.</p>
<p>The statement is made explicitly by McManus: <i>History of Slavery in New York</i>. 153-8, and by <i>Arming Slaves</i> pp.192-3; the sources cited in the text Rjensen reverted. I should add Elkins and McKitrick p. 411. If some contrary statement can be adduced, the Continental Army's practice will be sufficient, but I see no reason not to follow the sources. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 01:37, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>there were no combat slave battalions in the US Army, and only one (briefly) in the british army. The latter was a matter of British welcoming American runaways. Hamilton's proposal involved Ameerican slaves with owners' approval. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 02:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be less misleading to say that there were no slave battalions of any kind; much of the enlistment of slaves was of individuals, and the First Rhode Island was mixed. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 12:27, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No version of the text has ever covered their military duties.</li>
<li>Yes, of course, this was a matter of the British welcoming American runaways; what does Rjensen read as saying anything else?</li>
<li>Rjensen's last sentence is contrary to several sources which describe Laurens' project as a "draft" (with compensation to the owners). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 02:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The British and Americans welcomed runaways, but that is not the issue. The question is forming slave combat battalions, with the cooperation of the salve owners. It almost happened--Hamilton did get Congressional approval for 3000 troops. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 00:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The First Rhode Island was raised in 1777; it was originally planned as a slave unit (although it wound up containing other troops as well), and was raised with compensation to the owners. If Rjensen had read <i>Arming Slaves</i>, p. 193, as cited, he would have seen this; so I must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume</a> that he has not. (Knowing American acceptance of runaways is open to question; it is not supported by any text I have supported, and would have hurt relations with those men of substance whom it was always Hamilton's intention to conciliate.) Continued deletion of sourced material (especially if it leaves the footnotes deceptively alleging claims which the text cited does not support) is a form of vandalism. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:15, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The First Rhode Island regiment did contain 96 slaves. The Hamilton-Laurens proposal approved by Congress called for 3000 slaves--quite a difference when fighting a war with armies of 2000 to 8000 soldiers. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 00:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>142 slaves and more free blacks and Indians, but it's the principle that counts; and how exactly does "three or four batallions" become 3000 men? Describing a project opposed by the South Carolina delegation as approved by the Continental Congress is bizarre.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, this compares apples to oranges. The Rhode Islanders planned on two battalions of slaves, and didn't get them. Laurens planned on three or four; who knows how many he would have gotten?</dd>

<dd>In short, Laurens' plan (and all the authorities call it that) was neither the first such plan, the first plan designed for Congress, nor the first plan to be realized - nor would it have been if it had been realized; the key point (of freeing enlisted slaves) was standard practice on both sides.</dd>

<p>It was one of a series of plans of this kind. Hamilton wrote a letter in favor of it. In the process, he made some laudable, but not uncommon, remarks about Negro equality, sufferings, and the prospect of emancipation. He also made some remarks not now politically correct, to deflect criticism. These are the facts. Why inflate them? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Some incidental notes</span></h3>
<p>Sergeant's plan made be found in full at Taylor:<i>Adams Papers</i> 4:454-5. It has large similsrities to Laurens':</p>
<ul>
<li>Sergeant wanted to enlist, arm, and free slaves.</li>
<li>He asserted their equality with whites, when out of "their Condition as Slaves that stifles every noble Exertion."</li>
<li>He answers objections, including ones Hamilton doesn't address:
<ul>
<li>How do we compensate their masters? (take their price out of their pay).</li>
<li>How do we trust slaves with weapons? (make sure they are outnumbered; once they're free, it won't be a problem.)</li>
<li>What do we do with them afterward? (there's room on this continent for a free black settlement.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He wanted Congress to do this; that's why he sent it to Adams.
<ul>
<li>It was shot down because South Carolina would never go along (only faster).</li>
</ul>
</li>
