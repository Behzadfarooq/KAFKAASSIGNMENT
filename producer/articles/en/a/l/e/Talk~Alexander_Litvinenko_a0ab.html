<p>I think we must include Litvinenko claim that Putin threatened Politkovskaya life, and that <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irina_Hakamada_846c.html" title="Irina Hakamada">Irina Hakamada</a> told to Politkovskaya about that; because this is on the video tape. Is that true or not is irrelevant. It is only important that Litvinenko made this claim. Could anyone give more info when and where exactly this tape has been made?</p>
<p>Of course, this claim was denied by Hakamada. She tells that "I have not been in Kremlin already for three months!". That means she actually WAS in Kremlin three months ago and earlier (note that Litvinenko did not say when exactly Putin issued his threats). We also know that Hakamada and Politkoskaya were talking on numerous occasions. Most important, Hakamada is a Kremlin's insider. What does it mean? She wrote herself about this in her recent book "Sex in big politics". There are some fragments (Russian): <a href="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/45n/n45n-s22.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/45n/n45n-s22.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>,<a href="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/40n/n40n-s25.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/40n/n40n-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/43n/n43n-s25.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/43n/n43n-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. To be a Kremlin insider means to play all their games by their rules. If someone do not follow their rules, like Tregubova (author of "Stories of a Kremlin's digger"), she will find a bomb under her door like Tregubova. Therefore, Hakamada could not tell what really happened.</p>
<p>Of course, I do not think that Hakamada came to Politkovskaya and told her as <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolay_Khokhlov_07d3.html" title="Nikolay Khokhlov">Nikolay Khokhlov</a>:"The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has ordered your assassination."! It is more probable that Hakamada told to Anna someting like that: "Some people on the very top (you know who I am talking about) are really angry. If you do not stop, they can kill you. This is serious". That is why Anna asked Litvinenko: "can they really shot me near my house?". His answer was "yes". All of that are speculations that should not be in Wikipedia. But the claim by Litvinenko is a fact. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:33, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I know, Hakamada said "I was not in Kremlin for 3 years(!)" not 3 monthes (in order to prove she has no links with Kremlin). Otherwise, it would be a really bad argument and she is not so unclever to make such statements.</p>

<p>I can see that user Wikipidian is very interested in Islam. But this suject do not belong here. Litvinenko was not a religious man. Islam was not a part of his life. He mostly wanted to show support to his Chechen friends, and perhaphs he did not like Russian Ortodox Church, which is led by Aleksius II, a former KGB agent.

<dd>A non-denominational funeral service with Muslim rites from an Imam? That makes a lot of sense... The fact remains tho his conversion to Islam is something which has received a fair amount of coverage and controversy so it definitely merits conclusion.

<p>I'm not sure how reliable this stuff is, but some sources are now saying that links between him and Al-Qaeda are currently under investigation by the British internal security service. And an Al-Qaeda plan to purchase Polonium-210, too. But of course, theories are flying wildly right now, so who knows? Here are a few links in any case: <a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53208" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53208" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=10098" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=10098" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. There are also allegations of all kinds of stuff, for example that he was getting state secrets from the FSB after his exile from his contacts there and using it to blackmail important political figures. And another quote:</p>
<p><i>Even more problematic for Litvinenko's elevation to sainthood is the allegation that he was involved in smuggling nuclear materials out of the former Soviet Union. The Independent reports:</i></p>
<p><i>"Alexander Litvinenko, the poisoned former Russian agent, told the Italian academic he met on the day he fell ill that he had organized the smuggling of nuclear material out of Russia for his security service employers."</i></p>
<p><i>According to the British newspaper, Litvinenko admitted to Scaramella that he had "masterminded the smuggling of radioactive material to Zurich in 2000."</i></p>
<p>Do with the links what you wish, but... it would of course be better if the info in them was either incorporated into the article or debunked on this talk page.</p>
<p>On that note, I don't think it's a good idea to support the "good article" nomination until all of these things are covered. On the whole, I'm not at all sure that it's a good idea to nominate something like this for "good article status", because this is still a current event and it's becoming very clear that we only have a very small section of the story right now; certainly not enough to make a good encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 08:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't know why they are claiming that Litvinenko's body has to be kept in a lead coffin - the alpha radiation from the polonium in his body wouldn't even get out through his skin - I think there is an excess of caution being employed there. From what I've read of Scaramella, I don't think he could remotely be described as an honest witness. He's up to his neck in wierd connections. As far as Al Quada is concerned - why on earth would they want Polonium-210? It's hideously expensive - it decays to boring old lead in a matter of months - so it has to be bought fresh and used quickly - which shortens the chain of contacts and makes you easier to trace. It's pretty harmless stuff unless you eat or breath it - it's heavy (like lead) - so you can't disperse it into the air very easily. Polonium 210 decays by emitting alpha particles. Alpha radiation is stopped fairly effectively by one sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air or the layer of dead skin cells that covers your entire body! There are plenty of poisons that cost $1 per gram that will kill you if you eat them - heck, you could sneak 20 grams of Tylanol into someones lunch and they'll die a few days later - but don't use Polonium! Why pay $3,000,000 per gram?! As a poison - it's ludicrous. The most plausible reason why they might want the stuff is as a nuclear trigger - but it's way too expensive to use as a terror weapon by itself. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A thing is... Biophys claimed that Stomakhin is a political prisoner. But he was accused by private persons - ordinary people. FSB has nothing to do with Stomakhin. By inserting this unsupported and irrelevant information, Biophys makes grounds for inserting false information in the article about Boris Stomakhin. So I don't bother about FSB at all. If you would look at Biophys contribs - you will see that his specialization is abusing Russia actually. He also committed a number of violations, such as citing blogs and sources proved to contain false facts.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Litvinenko, journalist <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> was "last conscience of Russia" (see <a href="http://www.chechenpress.net/events/2006/10/24/02.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.chechenpress.net/events/2006/10/24/02.shtml" rel="nofollow">Opinion of Aleksander Litvineko (Russian)</a>). <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Bukovsky_0c6a.html" title="Vladimir Bukovsky">Vladimir Bukovsky</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elena_Bonner_e0b0.html" title="Elena Bonner">Elena Bonner</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/ARTICLE_19_bcd8.html" title="ARTICLE 19">ARTICLE 19</a> also tried to protect Stomakhin when he was convicted for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_speech.html" title="Free speech">free speech</a>. I have created an article about Stomakhin, but user Vlad Fedorov and others used this article for defamation of Stomakhin by citing his alleged writing completely out of context. Moreover, these "writings" are taken from extremely unreliable sources, and there are certain indications that Stomakin actually did not write some of that. I left a message about this problem in living persons noticeboard. Right now, the Wikipedia article about Stomakhin is "an active measure" (disinformation) FSB can be proud of. So, how do you think: is it appropriate to include at least a link to Stomakhin in this article? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 00:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please look at the text below ("Kill, kill, kill"). First, if you translate the original complete text from Russian, its meaning will be very different. A lot of phrases is missing, the order of phrases in the cited piece is completely different from the original, etc. That is how it is doctored by Vlad Fedorov and others. Moreover, I do not know if this text was actually written by Stomakhin, as explained on his talk page and living person notice board. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 02:33, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not Ok. The version created by user Biophys lacks important facts, it cites third-party blogs (unreliable sources), it contains original research in citations of Stomakhin from court sentence. Biophys also deleted the most serious statements by Stomakhin, leaving his most moderate citations. He also excluded without any grounds the fact that Stomakhin political view is to exterminate all Russians. Excluded many facts such as false facts contained in Statement of Union of Councils of fU Jews. This perversions of the facts and personal edits of Stomakhin's citations by Biophys are intolerable.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please know that Stomakhin wasn't procesuted by FSB, but he was prosecuted on the basis of applications of private persons, see the article on Boris Stomakhin. The statement of Union of Councils of fSU Jews is containing false statements and facts which contradict to Mass Media reports. Stomakhin is a leader of extremist organization Revolutionary Contact Association He was sentenced by court for the extremist activities, inciting religious and ethnic hatred, promoting violent change of constitutional regime, calls for violation of terriorial integrity of Russian Federation, defamatory statements(articles 280 and 282 of the Russian Criminal Code). He is not a dissident. Consider the following his statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kill, Kill, Kill! To flood all Russia with blood, to not give a quarter to anyone, to try to make at least one atomic explosion on the territoryof Russian Federation -- this is like the program of radical Resistance should be, and Russian's, and Chechen's, and anyone's! Let the Russians, according to their deserts, reap as they has sown. Russians should be killed, and only killed, for there is no one among them who is normal, intelligent, or who can be talked with and for understanding of whom we could rely. Harsh collective responsibility of all Russians should be introduced, of all loyal Russian citizens for the actions of the government elected by them -- for the genocide, executions, ordeals, trade with corpses... From that moment there should be no division of killers on combatant and non-combatant, wilful or forced. <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" class="external free" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm</a></p>

<p>Good comment. Personally, I strongly disagree with such writings. However, some of <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/articl.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/articl.htm" rel="nofollow">these articles</a> might not be written by Stomakhin. Few of them were cited in the court sentence ("Death to Russia" was not cited). Journalist Vladimir Abarinov claimed that one of the incriminated Stomakhin's papers was not actually written by Stomakhin but copied from a different site, which is typical for unreiable sources run by small groups of "revolutionaries". See <a href="http://grani.ru/Society/Religion/m.115021.html" class="external text" title="http://grani.ru/Society/Religion/m.115021.html" rel="nofollow">Stomakhin Case - by Vladimir Abarinov for grani.ru (Russian)</a>. Your point about <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a> may be valid, because Stomakin is a Jew, and there is a growing <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intolerance.html" title="Intolerance">intolerance</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist violence</a> in Russia.

<p>Perhaps this is the reason Stomakhin is so hated in Russia. I am glad the Litvinenko was not an anti-semit and supported Stomakhin. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also take a look at article "History of Orthodox <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>" in the same RKO web site. I have never seen anything like that about Russian Orthodox Church. Was it really written by Gleb Yakunin as claimed?

<p>Lies, lies, lies... Biophys has deleted the conclusion of the official phsychiatric expertise which found Stomakhin competent but having organic emotional-labial (astenic) disorder (taken from the official court sentence). Now opposition and the russia-haters like Biophys, use his disorders to cover the fascism of 'politically prosecuted journalist'. Here more of his genuine statements taken from the court sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Let tens of new Chechen snipers take their positions in the mountain ridges and the city ruins and let hundreds, thousands of aggressors fall under righteous bullets! No mercy! Death to the Russian occupiers!"</li>
<li>"<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechen_suicide_attacks.html" title="Chechen suicide attacks">Bombing in Moscow subway</a> was justified, natural and legal... The Chechens have full moral right to blow up anything they want in Russia after what Russia and Russians did to them, none objections on humanism and philanthropy could be accepted."</li>
<li>"Salman Raduev was fighting with Russia to the end, without any compromising with the killers of his people. His life was an example how to fight Russia. Salman Raduev is the most outstanding page of heroic Chechen resistance. He was a hero of the generation, not only in Chechnya, but in Russia itself. His life and death is a guarantee that the damned imperial Russia would be wiped out, and Chechens and all other people occupied with it, would receive freedom at last".</li>
<li>"We, 'Revolutionary Contact Association' and 'Radical Politics' are united with the Committee and are ready to cooperate with it. It is understood that we a lot more radical than it. We are for not waiting until 2008 and <b>we shouldn't bother ourselves particularly with Constitution, but we are for calling people to overthrow and liquidate Putin's regime as soon as possible</b>. And we at all do not see possibility of preserving of present Russian Federation as a single state. But we are for common front with all our allies, even more moderate".</li>
<li>"And for yesterday's, and for today's genocide of Chechen people, let Russia, still at our life span, wash herself with blood, - rightly, she deserved it! And let our memorial candles on the meetings on February 23 turn into torches, in purifying flame of which this rotten log, standing on the way of mankind, will be burnt down".</li>
<li>"Supporting fighting Chechnya, uniting publicly with Basaev, openly joining the side of Movsar Baraev at the days of Nord-Ost -- we have crossed the border, behind which any connections break and vanish with the past, with the environment, with people among which you have been born and have been growing-up and lived, trustingly considering yourself a part of this, until on the foreign "enemy" website have read and have seen with own eyes terrifying details of deeds made by these people in neighboring, tiny mountain country. So the Rubicon is crossed, the choice is made, and there is nowhere to retreat - now there is no for us any other family, except for oppressed by our "Empire" peoples, except fighting for liberation from yoke partisans, famous field commanders like Basaev, political parties which put forward demands for monetary compensation of occupation and return of taken away territories".</li>
<li>"After with the same Budanov's - maniacs, blood lusting sadists, murderers and degenerates with epaulets - all Chechnya is currently filled up. And it is Russian occupation army consists of these same Budanov's".</li>
<li>"In Chechnya Russian army ceased to exist as a military structure of a state, finally turned into devilish gang of marauders and killers, intoxicated from narcotics gang".</li>
<li>"Jesus Christ was crucified not by the Jews, but by Chechens".</li>
<li>"Orthodox Christians entirely have got a dick…"</li>
<li>"Russians have slaves and dare to blather something at Chechens"</li>
<li>"Zakhaev is not a terrorist unlike Putin and Co". <a href="http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/061120prigovor.html" class="external free" title="http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/061120prigovor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/061120prigovor.html</a> <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 18:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I like funny phrase that "Jesus Christ was crucified not by the Jews, but by Chechens". But Stomakhin did NOT say that, according to the court sentence. To the contrary, Stomakhin criticized this stupid claim as an example of propaganda booklets distributed by the Russian Orthodox Church. That is how citation out of context can be used to disinform a reader. Another problem: someone have deleted my arguments from the talk page of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a>. In my opinion, Stomakhin is only a normal "liberal" who likes strong statements - by US standards. He is not even a real "anarchist". I have seen many people in US whose political views were more extreme than views of Stomakhin. All these people are free and promte their views relentlessly. How about <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> who said about Muslim countries: "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war." (but others say something like that about US). Ann Coulter is a famous women, not a prisoner.

<p>I have failed the article for Good Article status due to the image used to display his condition in his final days. The image is from the BBC News website which has a strict copyright status on the use of images from the site, see their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3281849.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3281849.stm" rel="nofollow">Copyright Notice</a>. However, it may be possible to use the image under the fair use criteria by contacting BBC News and asking for permission, explaining who you are, exactly which image you would like to use and exactly where it will be used. As long as you are entirely upfront, they should be quite accommodating. Otherwise, unfortunately the image cannot be used and would be tagged as a copyright violation and deleted. I wish you all the best with sorting that out and look forward to passing the article for Good Article status once it is sorted.</p>
<p>Note: I would have simply placed the article's nomination on hold since it is only the image holding the article back. However, since it could take a little while to sort this, I thought it best to remove the nomination until the problem is solved. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 15:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess you know more about BBC Copyright than the rest of us, but surely fair use would apply here - FU images are always copyrighted, but an assertion is made on their use in the article. If not, any of the instances of the same photo would apply from <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=alexander+litvinenko&amp;ndsp=20&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enGB176&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=alexander+litvinenko&amp;ndsp=20&amp;svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enGB176&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this search</a>, so would simply mean replacing the source with one more accomadating. I've also looked into emailing the guardian and asking permission there, but since media outlets regularly swap and exchange information, copyright status can be unclear. I've tagged it with historical fair use too, since arguably its the image that represents the entire case. Thanks for your help, <a href="../../../r/h/b/User%7ERHB_fa8a.html" title="User:RHB">RHB</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/h/b/User_talk%7ERHB_5cf5.html" title="User talk:RHB">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RHB_91c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/RHB">Edits</a></sup> 19:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well this would fall most definitely under the fair use criteria; it would be best to ensure the BBC are in full agreement with the use of the image. Once you have permission then there would be no problem. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 22:16, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most likely it is a fake. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 20:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Most likely it is not a fake. As to pictures of these exercise shooting targets, I saw them personally on the Vityaz site in January, so the Dziennik article has some factual base. However, I don't know where the video comes from. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColchicum_15ab.html" title="User:Colchicum">Colchicum</a> 00:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Most likely" because it comes from Poland. However this could be true that some of Spetznaz stuff thought that this could be funny, because officially and unofficially (which is more important) in Russia he was a traitor, so I don't see any real moral problems with this. To mention here, in 2002 very-very little people knew Litvinenko. Most people in Russia knew him only after his death.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 15:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What are we discussing? These exercise shootings did take place, that's for sure. I don't know why they use such targets, but we don't discuss it in the article. Whether Litvinenko was known to the general public in any given year is also irrelevant for the paragraph about these shootings. I see no problems here. Futhermore, as to the alleged treason, he was not a traitor officially in Russia or any place else, as he has not been called traitor by a court. He was charged with other accusations. Unoficially - well, if you can find some polls... As of now, we can only claim here that he is considered traitor by certain people, if their personal opinion is notable enough. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColchicum_15ab.html" title="User:Colchicum">Colchicum</a> 16:18, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if it has been forged, it has been forged by the Vityaz team themselves, as I have seen the pictures on their site (confirmed with WHOIS) when they were available (maybe they are still there, I haven't checked it). But I cannot see any reason for them to do this forgery. And nothing about Litvinenko's death follows from this, that's why this section has been added to this article rather than <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Litvinenko_poisoning_b2f4.html" title="Alexander Litvinenko poisoning">Alexander Litvinenko poisoning</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColchicum_15ab.html" title="User:Colchicum">Colchicum</a> 00:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
