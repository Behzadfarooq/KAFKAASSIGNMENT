<p>I changed this: "He was the last major poet to write in traditional rhyming couplets; he developed the heroic couplet beyond that of any previous poet, and essentially exhausted its usefulness for later poets." There's room for disagreement about who's major, but I'd count Keats (<i>Lamia</i>) and Frost ("The Bear", <s>"A Considerable Speck",</s> "The Egg and the Machine", "The Onset", "The Tuft of Flowers"). I don't know whether the current version is true. Does anyone have any information on use of the heroic couplet before and after Pope? —<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryFriedman_2245.html" title="User:JerryFriedman">JerryFriedman</a> 20:08, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The notion that Pope was "educated mostly outside "normal" schools and colleges as a result of the penal laws that were in force at the time to uphold the status of the established Church of England." seems anachronistic - it would not have been unusual in that period to have not gone to school. Certainly a catholic family would have made education outside the school system more likely, but I am not sure this comment adds much. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 10:57, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, your article is very good and it helped me to write an essay for university about Pope. But in a German introduction to English Literature I found that his birthday was on the 22th May. So I need to change this. I would also like to add something about his interest into landscape gardening. <i>(unsigned comment by user Daniela Wecker on 9 May)</i></p>
<p><br />
That's not so sure. Other sites tell he was born on the 21st. Should see... <i>(unsigned comment by IP 212.194.59.142 20 May)</i></p>

<p>According to the definitive biography by Maynard Mack, Pope was born at 6.45 pm on May 21, 1688.--<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:46, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have the original copy of <i>POETICAL WORKS OF ALEXANDER POPE, ESQ - THE LIFE OF THE AURTOR, BY DR. JOHNSON</i> from 1830 and the first paragraph states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"ALEXANDER POPE was born in London, May 22, 1688, of parents whose rank or station was never ascertained; we are informed that they were of "gentle blood;" that his father was of a family of which the Earl of Downe was the head; and that his mother was the daughter of William Turner, Esq. of York, who had likewise three sons, one of whom had the honour of being killed, and the other of dying, in the service of Charles the First: the third was made a general officer in Spain, from whom the sister inherited what sequestrations and forfeitures had left in the family.</i></dd>

<dd><i>"Pope, Alexander, English poet, was born at London, May 21, 1688, his father being a Roman Catholic and a man of means. Although Pope's early education was irregular and unsystematic, his father retiring from business soon after the son's birth, his application to study must have been close, for even in his juvenile poems are traces of profound thought. In 1711 Pope published his Essay on Criticism, which placed him at once in the front rank of the literary men of his day; and in 1712 appeared the Rape of the Lock, the most imaginative of his poems. Soon after appeared his translation of Homer's Iliad, which brought a fortune of $30,000. (See HOMER). A translation of the Odyssey followed a few years later, and in 1728 he issued the third volume of The Dunciad. The Essay on Man, published in 1734, is a didactic poem, and, although almost wholly deficient in the imaginative quality, is a masterpiece of wit and versification. Pope's command of terse and smooth expression is at its highest here; and it has been well said that this poem contains more familiar quotations than any other poem of equal length in the English language. Pope died at Twickenham, near London, May 30, 1744, leaving behind him a literary fame that has suffered no eclipse in over a century and a half."</i></dd>

<p>I'm sorry to be cranky, but this article is pretty insufficient for a poet as significant as Shakespeare or Wordsworth. As a poet, it's possible that no one in English matched him for technical skill. As a person, he has an extremely interesting life. As an historical person only is he less interesting than someone like Wordsworth. To have his <i>Pastorals</i> skipped over (see <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_poetry.html" title="Augustan poetry">Augustan poetry</a>), to miss out on what each of the <i>Moral Epistles</i> were, to not mention the imitations of Horace and Virgil, to make <i>Rape of the Lock</i> a quick mention, it all goes against my own interests. Unfortunately, it has been an age since I've read Maynard Mack's biography, but I surely hope that someone passing by this article with Mack fresh in his or her head, or someone with an interest in this article's state and has access to a U. library and can go read Mack (and Aubrey Williams's critical work on Pope), can incrementally build this up. I'd love to see Pope's article be a Featured Article, or at least FA quality. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 4 July 2005 14:18 (UTC) (No, this is not on my list.)</p>

<p>Hello, agreeing with Geogre, I think this article should mention something of the Pope v. Curll lawsuit, which apparently is "a foundational case in English and American copyright law" (so says Mark Rose, in _Authors and Owners_, Harvard University Press, 1993, p.60)? There are 3 scholarly works on this by James McLaverty, and they sound very interesting, colorful, important, etc. See: James McLaverty, "The First Printing and Publication of Pope's Letters", Library 6th ser. 2 1980.</p>
<p>I've added a great deal of information to this article from Mack (though there's still much that could be in there: Lady Mary and Curll, for instance). Apologies to whoever wrote the "Politics" section; I've tried to incorporate it into the biography itself. Pope's politics aren't always clear-cut (he was a Catholic and he often had to keep his cards close to his chest, according to Mack). Hope these revisions help improve this article a bit. Pope deserves decent treatment. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 15:01, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's about an anonymous handwritten manuscript of aphorisms discovered in the late 1920s.
