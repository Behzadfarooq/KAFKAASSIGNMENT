<p>SILENT HILL</p>
<ul>
<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Spoiler #46 sent in by Brentage5000.</p>
<p>"SHARON! Where are you?" We first hear Rose DaSilva (Radha Mitchell) shouting these words as she and her husband Chris (Sean Bean) search for their daughter Sharon in the middle of the night. Rose runs beneath a highway through some kind of river and finds herself standing over a gigantic waterfall. She sees Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) standing on the other side, in a trance (she sleepwalks). We see from Sharon's point of view the world literally falling apart and becoming some kind of hell (think the HelLA sequences in Constantine). Just before Sharon sleepwalks off the cliff, Rose gets to her and wakes her up, where she starts screaming, "Silent Hill! Silent Hill!" over and over. Chris arrives and reassures his wife and daughter, although it's obvious both him and Rose know it's far from alright.</p>
<p>Some time later, we see Sharon leaning against a tree and coloring in a picture of herself and a lion near the tree. Rose comes up and her and Sharon play around a bit. She then tells Sharon about her sleepwalks and how she keeps mentioning Silent Hill. Sharon says that she doesn't remember, but Rose replies with, "That's why we're going there...so you can remember." They leave and head out, passing a sign that basically says angels shall be judge by saints -- people -- and not the other way around. Meanwhile, we see Chris trying to contact his wife, who is continually ignoring his calls (apparently this trip was not made to include him). He begins looking at some of the websites Sharon pulled up on Silent Hill, and he learns that it is located in West Virginia, is considered one of the most haunted towns in America, and that thirty years ago, there was a large underground fire that pretty much killed everyone there...</p>
<p><br />
That night, Sharon and Rose pull into Braham's Gas Station, which is within spitting distance of Silent Hill. As she gets out, Rose notices Sharon's pictures and sees that they've been changed to show people burning in various buildings, like a church or a school. Sharon wakes up and Rose asks her about them, but Sharon starts crying and swears she didn't do them, which a nearby cop takes notice of. Rose placates Sharon by saying she can ride up front with her, and then goes inside to pay. The cop comes over and tries to talk to Sharon, but Sharon just rolls up the window and ignores her. The cop just smiles and says, "Good girl." Inside, Rose tries to get directions to Silent Hill but is told that the road is closed and her credit card has been declined. She pays cash and then calls Chris. He tells her what he found out, but she just asks him to trust her. Rose heads back to the car, and the cop tries to talk with her, but Rose waves her off and drives away...but not before the cop gets her license plate number...</p>
<p>A little while later, we see Rose and Sharon approaching the Silent Hill turnoff when they get pulled over by the cop from before. She approaches the vehicle just as Rose notices a sign indicating the turnoff is right ahead. She tells Sharon to buckle her seatbelt and speeds off. The cop gets on her bike and gives chase. Sharon crashes through a padlocked gate and crosses an old bridge, managing to lose the cop at some point. She keeps heading forward at seventy and rounds a curve just as we see someone step into the road. Sharon warns her and the two girls scream as Rose swerves the car and they crash into the embankment.</p>
<p>The next morning, Sharon wakes up with a big bump on her head. She looks around groggily and suddenly notices that Sharon has disappeared. She gets out of the car and begins calling for her as she notices that snow has begun falling...black snow. She passes a sign that says "Welcome to Silent Hill" and heads into town, utterly lost and disoriented. She wanders the streets calling for Sharon, and suddenly sees a little girl who looks exactly like Sharon running off. Rose gives Chase and eventually ends up atop some stairway leading down below street level. She starts descending just as an air raid siren begins sounding from somewhere. Things grow unbelievably dark, and Sharon takes out a lighter. She turns it on and sees that she is now standing atop some grated floor with falling apart walls and...well, basically it's the same hell world Sharon saw earlier. She wanders around trying to get her bearings and trips over a wheelchair. She stumbles upon a dead guy who has been strung up and gutted, and then she catches another glimpse of the Sharon lookalike. She runs after her but finds a chain-link fence between her and the girl. She turns around and then finds a bunch of gray ghost children behind her. One of them gives a banshee-sized wail and begins attacking her, but she gets it off just in time for a hundred or so more to come up. She runs past them and manages to find a door. The children overwhelm her and she gets the door open. She crawls away and screams, but--</p>
<p>--she wakes up in some abandoned bowling alley where "Ring of Fire" is playing on the jukebox. She looks around, but the gray children are nowhere in sight, and if it weren't for her obvious wounds, it could almost be a dream or hallucination. She runs out of the bowling alley and heads down a street, trying to find someone, but is stopped by an enormous chasm that seems to have simply cut off Silent Hill from the world, even cutting through buildings halfway. She leans over to look down, and then someone behind her says, "Only the dark one opens and closes the door to Silent Hill." She turns and sees a dishevelled and dirty homeless woman there. She approaches the woman, Dahlia Gillespie (Deborah Kara Unger), and asks what's going on and tells her about Sharon, but Dahlia just says "We've all lost our children." When Rose gets more cryptic comments, she pulls out a locket picture of Sharon. Dahlia freaks and claims that the picture is of her daughter. She tries to attack Rose, but Rose hits her and runs away as Dahlia says, "Deep in the fires, she will be buried."</p>
<pre>
At this point we cut back to Braham's gas and see Chris pulling up. He gets out and asks the station mechanic if he's seen his wife, but the mechanic claims not to know anything, even when Chris offers a bribe and shows him a picture. Back in town, we see Rose heading back to the car. She sees a picture of Sharon's blowing on the ground and sees it is of a school. She goes through some other pictures and realizes they're of places around Silent hill. She gets in the car and calls Chris's cell. Chris picks up, but all he hears is static. Regardless, Rose says what happened and tells Chris that she is heading for the school. She tries to start the car but is interrupted by the cop, who tells her to get out of the car. Meanwhile, we see Chris pull up to the bridge, but it is blocked by police. He says that he is Rose's husband and gets through. At the other end of the bridge, he meets detective Thomas Gucci (Kim Coates) and tells him what he's doing there. Gucci tells him that he understands and that he's got an officer on the other side of the fallen trees blocking the road -- Cybill Bennet (Laurie Holden), who apparently did something famous with a young boy three years ago in that town, and she's probably got Rose in good condition.
</pre>
<p>Meanwhile, we see exactly what condition Cybill has Rose in -- handcuffs. Rose is trying to tell her that something is wrong in town, but Cybill is ignoring her and tells her how three years ago she tracked some sick guy into town who went into the mines with a little boy. She rescued the kid and spent three days trapped in there before someone could rescue them. They get back to Cybill's overturned motorcycle and Cybill tries to radio in, but gets nothing but static. Rose tries again, but instead is forced to march with Cybill to....another chasm. Rose yells at Cybill about not believing her just as something comes out of the mountains that looks like a person. Cybill takes out her gun and yells at it to halt, but it keeps coming, and we see that it has no arms and gray skin. It spits some kind of acid at Cybill, who takes it on the jacket and helmet. She rips them off, dodges another round, and shoots the Spitter five times before it goes down. Rose seizes the opportunity and runs back into town, still in handcuffs but now with a clear destination. She finds a map of town on a corner lamppost and eventually makes her way to Midwich Elementary School, whose motto above the school door reads, "The foes of the righteous shall be damned to suffer" or something like that. Rose finds the main office and grabs a set of keys to every door and drawer in the school. She also uses the keys to get a flashlight out of one drawer, which thankfully works.</p>
<p>At this point we check back in with Chris, who is being driven around a bright, fogless, and snowless Silent Hill by Gucci. Gucci is on the pa system and is telling Rose to come out. Chris thinks she might respond more to his voice, but Gucci vetoes that, telling him that when a woman steals off in the middle of the night with her daughter, hearing her husband tell her to come out is not something that usually gets them to come out. Meanwhile, we see Rose searching the school when she hears something coming upstairs from the basement. She opens a door and softly calls out and sees a pair of very imposing men -- the miners -- come out. She runs off and eventually ends up in a classroom. She finds a desk with witch carved into it and looks inside. She finds the journal of Alissa Gillespie, and we see a scene of the young girl who looks like Sharon being mocked by her classmates for apparently being the daughter of a witch (Dahlia, in case you forgot). Suddenly Rose sees either Alissa or Sharon running past and follows her into a bathroom. Inside, Rose hears the sounds of a little girl crying and figures out which stall it's coming from. She opens the stall but instead of Alissa or Sharon finds a dead naked janitor with dog tags identifying him as "Colin" being held up by barbwire in a contorted position. The wall behind him reads "Dare you dare you double dare you!" and we see an arrow pointing into Colin's mouth. Sharon sees something sticking out and reaches through the barbwire to pull out a hotel key -- the Grand Hotel, Room 111. She runs away from Colin and opens the door just in time to be caught by one of the miners' lights. She slams the door shut as three of them head for the door. Rose locks it with her key set just in time for a canary the miners had to start flapping around wildly. The miners look at each other and bolt. (see clip)</p>
<p><br />
Clip Meanwhile, Rose looks around her as the walls literally start melting and changing into the hell version of things . Just as things finish changing, Colin wakes up and starts coming towards Rose. He pulls himself along the walls and somehow creates a horde of giant cockroaches with human faces, which chase Rose out the door and down the hallway. The bugs find the miners and take them down, and Rose runs faster. Unfortunately, while she's running, she gets blocked by a giant of a man with a pyramid for a head. He swings his huge-ass knife at her (it's about ten feet long and two feet wide) and runs, crossing some in-school bridge. He catches up and knocks her out a window, and she falls two stories to the ground. She runs to the other side of school, into another wing, and eventually collapses by a bank of lockers.</p>
<p>We then cut to Chris, who is apparently searching the school with Gucci in broad daylight, and it looks just fine. Gucci tries to placate him a little, but Chris isn't having any of it. Suddenly, they pass the locker bank where on the other side Rose is lying in a heap, and Chris swears to Gucci that he can feel her and smell her perfume, though Gucci just ignores this and keeps Chris moving. Meanwhile, Rose is still crying when we see someone come up and start dragging her somewhere. Eventually Rose ends up in a boiler room where we see that her abductor is...Cybill! She takes off the cuffs just in time for the bugs to show up again. They slam the door shut and lock it with a steel pipe through the handles when suddenly a giant knife slams through the door, narrowly missing them. Pyramid Head tries a few more times and then starts trying to pull the door apart. Cybill shoots him a few more times but runs out of ammo just in time for things to revert back to normal.</p>
<p>Once on the regular side, Cybill puts her last clip in her gun while Rose tells her about the hotel key. The two make their way there as we see Chris finding out that there are no records regarding what happened in Silent Hill or at the very least, the records are kept private and locked up. Meanwhile, we see Rose and Cybill get to the Grand Hotel. Inside, they see Dahlia being...plastered (guess they're out of stones)...by a woman named Anna (Tanya Allen). She chases Dahlia out and begins spouting some religious nonsense to Cybill and Rose. Cybill looks around while Rose asks Anna about Sharon. Anna points out a drawing on the floor of a cross with circles on the ends, and says it is a symbol of their faith that was created by the elders of their elders. They are interrupted by Cybill, who has found a bunch of keys scattered across the floor and a piece of art she found in the mailbox for room 111 that looks like Sharon's other works. Rose immediately decides that they need to find room 111 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Back with Chris, we see that night has fallen on his side. He is outside the Braham's town archives. They lock up and leave the building. He heads over there and breaks in (funny, you think there'd be an alarm, even in a small town...). He heads upstairs and after searching around a bit, finds the files for Silent Hill, including a report of a burning victim named Alissa Gillespie. Chris finds a photo of Alissa, and is shocked to see that Alissa looks exactly like Sharon. He dials a number on his cell phone and gets an address for a building.</p>
<p>Back with Rose, we see her, Cybill, and Anna -- who is apparently along for info -- looking for room 111, which apparently doesn't exist. Anna points out a picture of the first witch burning the town ever had, and Rose realizes the whole town was founded by witch hunters. In a flash of inspiration, she picks up a knife she took from the kitchen downstairs and tears the picture apart to find...room 111. They go inside and find that the room is little more than a storage closet with a hole in one wall that leads to another hole in the next building, and more beyond. Cybill jumps first, followed by Rose (who loses the knife), and they leave Anna to make the jump herself. Inside this new building they find more stuff and while Cybill is looking around, Rose catches another glimpse of Alissa/Sharon. She gives chase and eventually finds her crying on the other side of a huge pit that leads down into the mines, where we see fires burning. She jumps across, balancing on a few support beams and almost falling once. She goes up to Alissa/Sharon, and the girl turns around and says, "I'm burning" as her arms and then her whole body burst into flame. Rose screams and steps back, only to realize that Alissa/Sharon isn't there. Cybill and Anna find her and get her back over to them just as the siren starts up. Anna screams "The darkness is coming!" and runs off, with Cybill and Rose following close. They wind up at the town church, which is apparently the location of the siren. People are coming out of everywhere to get there while Dahlia stands in front, saying "You run not towards sanctuary but from your fears. Join not the others, for they are deceived as they are damned." Cybill tries to convince her to come inside, but she grabs Cybill and says, "No! They are wolves in the skin of sheep. They brought about their own hell. They'll take you with them!" Anna starts throwing stuff at her and screams "Filth and lies!" at Dahlia, but Cybill holds her back. Rose tries to talk to Dahlia about why they were brought here and what Alissa wants, but Dahlia's only response is, "Evil waits in vengeance. Be careful what you choose," as...</p>
<p><br />
....the darkness comes. Things begin melting, and Cybill and Rose run inside as Dahlia points her index and ring fingers at Anna. She turns and we see that Pyramid Head has appeared behind her. He picks her up and rips her skin off, splattering Rose and Cybill with her blood. The door finally closes and people begin attacking Rose for being a witch until Cybill fires her gun in the air to calm them...or at least to get them away. The leader of the church, Christabella (Alice Krige) comes forth and reassures them that what happened to Anna was not the fault of "these outsiders." She then gathers the faithful in prayer for sanctuary from the darkness, declaring that "those whose names are not written in the book of life shall burn in the lake of fire."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we see Chris inside the Toluca County Orphanage, trying to get information on Sharon's past. He tries to talk with one of the nuns running the place, but she is very resistant to the idea of giving out information, particularly hers. Chris starts getting rough when suddenly Gucci shows up again. He arrests Chris for breaking and entering (the archives), and then has a talk with him about justice, saying that it's a foggy concept, since there's man's justice, God's...and even the Devil's. He also shows Chris his hands, which were apparently badly burned by something sometime in the past. Gucci then informs Chris that he is being taken out of town and back to his homestate.</p>
<p>Back in Silent Hill, we see Christabella explaining to Rose that she will need faith to find her daughter and survive here, since, as she observes, "In the eyes of a child, a mother is God," but Rose isn't buying into this -- she just wants to find Sharon. Christabella agrees to take her to the home of the demon, and, with a few miners (!!!) along for protection, they head to Brookhaven Hospital. Here Christabella informs Rose and Cybill that the demon is housed in room B151 and gives them a flashlight to see by, even though the monsters will be drawn to it. Rose memorizes the map as much as she can while two miners break open an elevator leading to the wards. Christabella moves to give back Rose's locket, which one of the faithful apparently took from her (Christabella's excuse: "We're scavengers.") when she notices the picture of Sharon inside. She starts calling Rose a witch and Rose runs into the elevator, with Cybill covering her. Cybill kills a miner with his own weapon and starts the elevator going down. Rose screams for her, but it's no use. Cybill trains her gun on Christabella and pulls the trigger...on an empty chamber. The remaining miners beat her senseless as Christabella smiles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rose has descended about forty floors a minute and is now getting out of the elevator. She finds herself in the A Ward, meaning she has to go down one more floor. She begins picking her way through but once on the B floor finds her way blocked by a bunch of freaky looking nurses bent in various awkward positions and holding sharp knives that could slice open an elephant. She shines the light on them and they all snap to attention and begin coming for her. She turns the light off and they go back to rest. She begins to pick her way through, but the nurses eventually wake up and start trying to attack her. She ducks down and tricks them into attacking each other. While they're busy with that, she gets free of the crowd, drops the flashlight, runs, and finds the room. She opens the door and--</p>
<p>We hear the voice of Alissa saying that she is going to show Rose the truth about what happened, as a reward for coming all this way. We see Alissa being picked on again, and she runs into the bathroom, which is being cleaned by Colin. He smiles at her and Alissa narrates about how desperate for love and acceptance constant hate can make you, and it is strongly suggested that Colin raped her. We later see her coming out of the bathroom and being talked to by her mother, who looks much better now, and her aunt/principal, Christabella! Since the town is so taken with Christabella, a town meeting is held, and it is decided that the sin shall be cleansed, and that sin is Alissa. They tie her up and roast her over a fire, but the fire spreads until it consumes everything. We next see Alissa, blackened and crispy, being pulled from the wreckage as Dahlia weeps. Alissa describes how her hate grew so much, and how one day something gave her power to use with that hate. One day, we see a young nurse (who fans from the first game recognize as Lisa Garland) doing her rounds. Lisa pokes her head into Alissa's room and becomes her first victim, and...</p>
<p>...we see Rose in room B151. In front of her is what remains of Alissa, who is now about thirty years older. She is being tended to by an eyeless and blood-covered Lisa. Lisa moves to sit next to Alissa, and then the little girl steps forward. Rose asks who she is, and we get a typical "I have many names" answer. She says that Sharon was the last representation of the goodness in Alissa, and that Sharon is about to be found by Christabella and her minions. Rose asks why she is here and "Alissa" says that it is so Christabella can be confronted with the truth. She then hugs Rose and proceeds to absorb into her body. While doing this, we see Sharon hiding in the Nathan Motel, which Rose kept passing throughout the movie, in time for Dahlia and a bunch of miners to come in. Dahlia tries to ward off the miners, but is unsuccessful and they take Sharon. Meanwhile, we see Chris being dropped off at his car in the early morning. Gucci says that they will keep trying to find Rose and Sharon, but Chris doesn't believe him and drives off.</p>
<p>We then cut to the church in daylight. We see a still-alive Cybill tied to a ladder while Christabella says that she must be burned. Cybill tries to shout some sense into the people, but is successful as one might expect. They lower the ladder over a fire as Cybill catches Sharon's eye and shouts that Rose is coming, but this just draws some laughter from the crowd, who then proceed to burn Cybill's flesh off. The crowd then gets set to burn Sharon too when the doors slam open and we see Rose standing there, with Dahlia creeping up behind (every time...). Rose -- now covered in blood, wearing all red, and with fire in her eyes -- begins taking the townsfolk to task for what they are doing, but Christabella orders her burnt as well. Rose laughs at this solve-all solution and gets right up in Christabella's face, but gets stabbed through the heart with a sacred knife of Christabella's. She calls Rose a blasphemer while Sharon screams...just as a drop of black blood falls from the knife to the floor of the church. Things grow dark, and Rose begins coughing out more and more black blood from inside. The blood spreads and the darkness at last overwhelms the church. Old Alissa rises out of the hole that was formed and begins running everyone through with barbed wire and killing them spectacularly while Rose heals (a gift of Alissa's) and makes for Sharon. She gets there with Alissa dispatching anyone who gets in the way while Dahlia watches in horror and asks her daughter, "What have you become?" Meanwhile, young Alissa has shown up just in time for Christabella to get run through with barbed wire. She is torn apart by the wire from inside while Young Alissa dances in the blood rain just as Rose frees Sharon. They crawl into the corner and attempt to ignore everything as Sharon climbs up the ladder. Rose keeps telling Sharon to pretend it's a bad dream just as Sharon opens one eye to find Heather staring her right in the face.</p>
<p>The next morning, we see a depressed Chris arriving home, going inside, and closing the door. Meanwhile, we see Rose and an eerily calm and happy Sharon walking out of the church. Dahlia asks Rose why Alissa didn't kill her and Sharon repeats what Christabella told her about a mother's love. Dahlia looks at the two, and Sharon looks at her, and it is strongly implied that Sharon is now Alissa. Rose and her daughter head back to the car, and Sharon calls home. The machine picks up, and Christopher hears only static, but we see Rose saying that they'll be home soon. Rose pulls out and through the fog, passes Cybill's motorcycle. They come to where the chasm was, but it fixes itself and they drive on through the fog. They are still in a fog when they pass Braham's Gas and arrive home, where Christopher is sleeping through the unblocked sunlight. The girls go in, leaving the door open, and Sharon goes to play with something as Rose sits on a chair opposite the empty couch where Chris is still lying, having just woken up. He rises and lingers around the chair where Rose isn't sitting in his world, and then heads for the door. He sees that the door is open and runs forward, hoping to maybe catch a glimpse of Rose and Sharon, but when he looks outside, he sees only his car, parked right where Rose had parked her car.</p>
<p>SO WHAT HAPPENED? I think that Rose and Sharon are now nothing more than ghosts, kind of like how Jennifer Connely was in Dark Water. As for Silent Hill, the town is alive and decides whether or not to show you it's darker self. If it does, though, you end up forever living in a fog world like Rose and Sharon now do.</p>
<p>INSIDE MAN</p>

<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>NOTE: This spoiler was sent in by Naomi who says..."Great bank heist flick with some interesting twists at the end. " It begins with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaking from a cell. This is the line we see in the trailer, where he tells us to listen very carefully to what he's saying, and he continues on to say that there is a large difference between a cell and a prison cell (dead giveaway right there if you're paying attention to what he's saying). He then goes on to say that he executed his (perfect) plan to rob a bank not only for monetary gain, but because he could do it.</p>
<p>We then cut back to the day of the robbery where an obscure van from a painting company is picking people up from different locations. Each person is dressed in a white smock, and its difficult to identify one from the other (main theme in the movie). Inside the bank, it appears to be an ordinary day. A Rabbi is speaking to representative, people are waiting in lines, listening to their music, talking on their phones etc. Then a "painter" in his smock enters with two large flashlights. He calmly sets his flashlights down in specific positions on a table in the center of the large room. He is followed by two others dressed like him who then proceed to lock the doors of the bank entrance. At this moment, the security guard is alerted and the butt of a rifle is shoved into his back, warning him to not attempt to do his job. Russell (Owen) then sets off smoke canisters and orders everyone to be on the floor in 4 minutes or suffer a bullet to the head. Sooner or later, everyone complies.</p>
<p><br />
Outside the bank, passers-by notice the smoke coming out through the entrance doors and point this out to a passing cop. The cop checks it out, trying to get the doors open when Russell opens the door from inside, sticks a gun in the cop's face, speaks in some fake Eastern European accent and tells the cop to keep the police away from this place or he will shoot the hostages inside. The cop backs off and Russell retreats inside.</p>
<p>Cut to Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) at work, on the phone with his girlfriend. They have a small argument about his girlfriend's brother - who is living with them. The brother apparently has a record and is living off his sister. Frazier is not happy about this situation, but acknowledges the fact that this brother is the only family his girlfriend has, and they end the argument by making up. Frazier's partner, Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), tells Frazier that he should marry his girlfriend, but Frazier brings up the issue of money and the lack of a ring to give to his would-be wife. We also find out that Frazier is suspected (by internal affairs, I assume) to have stolen (or accepted as a bribe, I don't know) a good sum of money by some suspect. Frazier claims this to be a set up.</p>
<p>The chief of the department then comes up to Frazier and tells him about the bank robbery and hostage situation going down. He throws the case at Frazier not only because the other detective is unavailable but because he believes Frazier to be a good cop. Needless to say, Frazier and Mitchell are psyched at this opportunity to prove their worth and drive down to the scene.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the bank, Russell and his comrades in arms (who refer to each other as "Steve", "Steve-o" or "Stevey") are working on organizing the situation. They ask everyone to surrender their cell phones. Everyone does so except for one employee who insists that he left his cell phone at home that day. Russell asks the man his name and then threatens the man with a gun to see if he is lying, but it doesn't appear to be so. Russell then goes through everyone's phones looking for this man's name as a contact in one of his co-workers cell phone. He finds one and dials the man's number from this different phone and hears it ringing in another room. The man sweats, apologizes, and Russell, who is obviously very angry, says it's okay. Russell goes into a room with foggy glass windows and we see him debating whether he should shoot this chap or not. He comes out, drags the man inside the room and proceeds to beat him up.</p>
<pre>
The robbers then get all the women onto one side of the room and the men onto the other. They are ordered to strip down to their undergarments and to put on the clothes contained in bags that the robbers had brought with them. Everyone does so.
</pre>
<p>Things are being organized outside the crime scene with ambulances at the ready, and NYPD's squads at the ready. The bank is cordoned off and there is a large van that houses audio/visual equipment necessary to provide information on how things are going down. Inside Frazier introduces himself and Mitchell to Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), and although there is some uncomfortable tension between Frazier and Mitchell, this all gets straightened out in the next minute.</p>
<p>We flash forward to scenes after the heist has taken place (this happens at several junctures of the movie), and we see Mitchell and Frazier interviewing several of the hostages. They are hostile to some and friendly to others, trying to figure out whether any of the hostages knew the identity of the robbers or anything else about them. It is obvious at this point that the police do not know which of the people are the hostages and which of them are the bank robbers. However, we do not know if the robbery was successful or not.</p>
<p>Flash backward, and we see the man who started this successful chain of banks being informed of the hostage situation taking place as one of his branches. His name is Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) and he is chairman of the board of directors. He then makes a direct call to Madeleine White (Jodie Foster), and asks her if she is the kind of person who he can trust with handling a delicate situation. She believes she can. Case drives off to meet her where they take a walk and he explains his concerns regarding this incident. He tells her that he has something more valuable to him then money within that bank and that he would do anything to protect it. In other words, he wants this secret kept safe. White tells him that if it's anything that can jeopardize the lives of people (and in short, her career), the deal's off. Case tells her it's not so, and she agrees to take on this task.</p>
<p>In the bank, several things are going on. In the back of a storage room (where office equipment is stored), we can see the robbers digging a hole with some kind of pickaxe. They alternate between this task. The hostages meanwhile are kept in groups in separate rooms. At times, one hostage is pulled out of the room and exchanged with another in a different room to seemingly keep the confusion going. The robbers alternately take off their maks and pose as frightened hostages being tossed into a different room so they later will be identified as hostages by the other hostages.</p>
<p><br />
In the police van, Frazier wants visuals and a cop inside says he got into the video tapes and plays them. They look at the screen (from when Russell first entered the bank) but can't see much both because of Russell's outfit and mask and because the videos are turned off in sequence as soon as the robbers enter the bank. One police officer believes this has something to do with the flashlights that were carried into the bank, and says that the customers didn't notice any light emanating from the devices because they were probably infrared. IR lights have the ability to disrupt mechanical devices, hence the disrupted video cams.</p>
<p>Darius asks Frazier when he's going to make the call to the bank to speak to the fellow in charge down there, but Frazier plays it cool, saying that he'll speak to him when he makes the first move.</p>
<p>Inside the bank, one hostage is experiencing chest pains. Russell sees this, and decides to let the man go. The hostage - who is dressed up one of the hostage-takers - is thereby mistaken for being just so, and is handcuffed and brought to the ground (but is otherwise unharmed). I think he had a note with him from Russell, telling the cops to send in some food for "50 hungry hostages". The cops do so, deciding to send in some pizza (because it's easier for them to place bugs in).</p>
<p>White, in the meantime, meets with the mayor and asks him for "one last favour" - indicating that this must be a big one. The niceties are dispensed with, and they deal with each other very frankly and forwardly. She asks him to get her down to the crime scene and give her access to whatever she needs to get her job done. He agrees.</p>
<p>The mayor and she then meet with Frazier, alone, and she tells Frazier to allow her certain liberties in this case without giving him any solid explanations. Frazier is not thrilled at this new turn of events, and to crudely appease him, White hints that he could move up his career ladder should he choose to help her out.</p>
<p>After he leaves with his meeting with White and the mayor, another hostage is released. This time, there is some kind of metal briefcase or panel hung around the hostage's neck. The hostage is a Sikh, and mistakenly thought to be Muslim, and the case around his neck believed to be a bomb. This doesn't turn out to be so. The case has writing on it. More demands from the hostage takers. They want 2 buses and a jet for their getaway. Frazier ! and Mitchell interview the hostage but are unable to get much information from him (as they do from a lot of the other hostages. Some racial comments get brought up here as they do elsewhere in the movie).</p>
<p>Using the bugs from the inside the pizza boxes, the police hear dialogue which they identify to be Russian or Eastern European. Finally, they identify it as being Albanian. But on getting a Albanian woman to translate, they discover that this dialogue is merely a tape being played back (to confuse the police, and therefore, to delay them) as it's a recording of a dead Albanian president's propaganda.</p>
<p>Finally, Frazier decides to make the call and speak to Russell. The first time Russell doesn't pick up, but he does on the second go. There's the usual hostage negotiation dialogue here, but the only difference is that Russell is extremely calm, and Frazier immediately recognizes this. He realizes that Russell is someone who you do not want to play around with because he is perfectly clear in what he says and does. Russell wants each of his demands met and threatens to execute a hostage if this is not done.</p>
<p>In the bank vault, we see more unusual goings-on. The money has not been touched. Instead, locker number 392 is opened. One of the female hostage takers picks the lock, and Russell pulls out one of the contents inside. It's an old, yellowed file with the Nazi swastika on its cover. He takes it with him, leaving some small black cloth bags containing diamonds inside.</p>
<p>Come evening, Frazier is more than normally concerned about how things are shaping out. The robbers seem unusually patient. Previously, he had called Russell asking him for more time. Russell grants him more time only if he answers a riddle correctly, which Frazier does. This strikes him as odd.</p>
<p>He decides to let White go in to speak with Russell, as she wanted to in the first place. He tells her that if she doesn't come out within a stated time limit, she might not come out until this entire ordeal is over. White is not fazed. She goes in, checked for any hidden weapons etc., and then begins talking with Russell. She tells him that she can offer him a better deal than anyone out there. If he surrenders, she will see to it that he gets a few years max, and then 3 million quid will be waiting for him when he gets out. At this point she doesn't know that Russell has the file, Arthur Case's file, with him. When he shows it to her and tells her that he knows all about Arthur Case, he tells her that there is nothing that she can possibly offer him, indicating that their conversation is over. He tells her that he will get what he wants his way, and will be walking out of that door a free man and leads her outside and lets her go.</p>
<p>Frazier then speaks with White and asks her what goes on. She lies to him, and Frazier tells her he's aware of it. Off the record, she only tells Frazier that Russell has something that is very important to a client of hers, and for her client's best interest, she needs to protect it. He reminds her of her agreement - wanting more information, but she doesn't relent and walks off, telling him that her bite is worse than her bark.</p>
<p>Fed up with how things are going on, Frazier decides to add a catalyst to the situation. Recognizing that these guys are more than just a little patient, he decides to arrange this jet for them and lets Russell know, wanting to see how they'll react to this new turn of events. But in order for this to work out, he wants to go in there and make sure that every hostage is alive and well. Russell agrees.</p>
<p>Frazier then goes in, and is allowed to see each group of hostages. Apart from being terrified everyone seems in reasonable physical condition. There's some casual banter between Russell and Frazier with Russell offering Frazier some gum. Frazier even tells him of the situation with his girlfriend, explaining how he doesn't even have enough money to buy her a ring. Russell tells him that if he really loves her, then money shouldn't be an obstacle. Frazier then asks Russell to give this game up in a friendly manner, even offering him to buy him a beer. Frazier extends his hand as if to shake, and immediately suckers Russell into getting knocked over. The two wrestle down the stairs by accident, with Frazier almost coming out on top. But his victory is short-lived as one of the other robbers points a gun to his head, causing him to back off. Russell is extremely ticked off, and lets Frazier know this. Frazier tells him that this situation is a complete load of "bullshit" and that Russell cannot "bullshit a bullshitter". Everything that has been going on is a facade for something else, but he doesn't know what that something is. At this point, Russell points his own gun at Frazier, and Frazier tells him to pull the trigger because he's not nothing to lose. Russell pushes him out the door and comments on wishing that someone sane was in Frazier's place.</p>
<p>Frazier speaks with Mitchell telling him that he messed up and knows that something bad is going to go down. Sometime later, they get a visual feed from within the bank. It's apparent that Russell wants the cops to see this. We see a hostage with something pulled over their head, and a gun pointed at him/her. The trigger is pulled and the hostage falls to the floor. The Chief then approaches Frazier and tells him that although he believes that the latter is great cop, he cannot allow himself to go down in this mess.</p>
<p>The following day, a decision is made to storm the bank. The layout of the building is awful for this kind of mission to go down well, and the cops throw ideas off of each other. Shooting with regular bullets is a no-go because they could just as easily hit one of the hostages as it's difficult to tell the hostage-takers apart from the hostages. They finally decide on rubber bullets, and choose to dress the squad up in similar get-ups to add to the confusion.</p>
<p>Outside the van, Frazier is talking with the cop who first reported the robbery. They get into a more of less friendly conversation where more racial comments are brought up, and Frazier asks the cop to tone such slurs down. The cop agrees to do so, saying that you never know who is listening. This tips off Frazier to something else, and he now realizes why Russell and his gang are always two steps ahead of the police. He runs into the van and tears apart the metal case that one of the hostages previously came out with. There's a bug inside. He immediately contacts Captain Darius (who is leading the strike team inside the bank) and tells him to back down because the gang inside know they're coming and they know how.</p>
<p>This is apparently the case as we see Russell and his friends go into action. Immediately, the front doors burst open and out come a mad rush of hostages. Rubber bullets are fired and there is chaos. Eventually, all the hostages (and hostage-takers, we assume) are on the ground with their hands tied behind their back. They are taken back to the department on a large police bus. We recognize the faces of three of the hostage-takers, but Russell's is not amongst them.</p>
<p>When the squad secures the joint, they find no body, but a red-stained shirt with fake blood and squirter to prove it. The AK47s, too, are merely toy guns. In addition to that, no money has been taken and everyone is utterly befuddled. Back at the police station a few days later, the chief expressed his relief over this case and tells Frazier to bury it. At this point, Frazier is informed that the money he was suspected of taking has been found, exonorating him.</p>
<p>Frazier refuses to do so. He leafs through what little evidence there is, and notices that the paper regarding locker 392 is missing. He had no idea why. While still pursuing this lead, White meets with him again, telling him to back down because his career is on the rise, so why ruin everything now? This is a veiled threat, and Frazier pulls out a tape recorder disguised as a pen, which has his and White's conversation of their "arrangement" on it. White backs off.</p>
<p>We then cut to Dalton Russell, who is once again talking to us from inside his cell. Only this time we can clearly see that it isn't a prison cell. It's a makeshift cell that the robbers had constructed inside the storage room. Russell's plan was to remain inside until the storm had blown over, and then walk out the bank a free man...as he had initially intended.</p>
<p>Outside the bank, there is a black colored vehicle, inside of which sit the hostage-takers from before. They are waiting for Russell and his goods. Suddenly, they spot Frazier and Mitchell entering the bank and inform Russell of this. He is not fazed as it appears that they are not coming for him. As he exits the bank, he brushes his shoulder against Frazier's, and Frazier takes no notice of this, focusing instead on his business. He needs to pursue his lead.</p>
<p>When Frazier gets a warrant to open locker 392, he sees a pack of gum (Russell offered Frazier the same gum from earlier on in the plot) and box containing a large diamond ring.</p>
<p>Russell gets inside the car and throws the bag (containing Case's diamonds) in the back. He tells the others that he left the larger diamond ring behind - explaining that it's in good hands. He explains that although he does steal, there is a certain limit to what he will do. He does so because he needs to look at himself in the mirror with respect each morning. They drive off.</p>
<p>White, in the meantime, is meeting with Arthur Case. She informs him that Russell has made off with the file, but will only use it as leverage/blackmail should something happen to his disadvantage. Case then tells her about his past, in which he accepted a generous sum of money from the Nazis when he was younger, to betray some Jews into their hands. Apparently, some of these Jewish people were once Case's friends, and the ring belonged to one of them. He offers White money to keep this under wraps. She accepts it gladly like it was something she does on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Frazier trails the ring back to Arthur Case. He and Mitchell go meet with him. The meeting starts out pleasantly enough, until Frazier mentions how this case had been pulled and tweaked by people higher up. Namely, people like Case. He speculates that Case has more than just a normal degree of interest in it, and then shows him the ring. The two partners walk out of Case's office laughing, knowing that they have him worried. Frazier then interrupts White during lunch, and gives her a business card for someone involved in exposing war crimes. It isn't obvious that he is going to take action then and there, but he makes it known to her that he is now aware of what exactly her role was in all of it. In short, it appears as if Russell has given Frazier the means of implicating Case, should he need to.</p>
<p>In the last scene we see Frazier go home to his girlfriend. While he takes off his gun and removes his badge from his pocket, he pulls out a diamond. He suddenly realizes how it got there. The person who had brushed against him earlier on that day in the bank was Russell himself, and somehow he had slipped the diamond into Frazier's pocket. Frazier smiles, realizing that he can now marry his girlfriend, as he has a proper ring to offer her.</p>
<p>P.S. The movie opens and closes with a wonderful remixed song in Hindi. For those of you wondering what it's called, I found out that it's named "chaiyya chaiyya LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN</p>
<ul>
<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>NOTE: This spoiler was sent in by BroadwayBabe. During the opening credits, a man is shot as he walks to his car; a notebook that he carries is stolen from beside the body. A man is led into an office and frisked; he then proceeds to stab both the guards with some kind of poisoned dart and kill the man behind the desk with a baseball to the eye. He then takes the book in front of the man at the desk. A young man walks out of a hotel and is shot by a sniper. There is much screaming and general confusion.</p>
<p>The movie opens in a bus station. A young man walks in and sits down, dropping his bag next to him on the floor. There is an older woman asleep on the bench nearby. The man dozes off and is awoken by Goodkat's (Bruce Willis) voice saying "There was a time." He is in a wheelchair. The guy mishears and tells him the time; Goodkat corrects him, tells him that once that old lady on the bench was beautiful...there was a time. He tells the guy that he is in town for a Kansas City shuffle 20 years in the making, and begins to tell a story, which we see in flashback. A doctor drugs a horse to make it a sure win in a horse race; there is some kind of new gang in town running a gambling ring. Word gets around via bookies, and a waiter in a restaurant hears about the horse and tells his nephew, a man named Max. Max takes his son, Henry, out to the racetrack on the pretense that they're going to a Mets game, and tells him to wait 15 minutes, giving him his watch to time him. He goes in and places a bet of $20,000 on the horse--number seven in the tenth race. The horse is leading, then falls down before the finish and loses the race. Max is horrified, and walks back out to his car, which is nowhere in sight. Two men approach him and ask for the money he bet before knocking him unconscious. He awakes in a room, battered and bloody, and Goodkat explains that the new gang wanted to make an example of him. They killed everyone: we see the dead bookie who took his bet, a man with a gun walking into the kitchen where Max's wife is washing dishes, and a man standing behind Henry with a gun pointed at him. The men place a plastic bag over Max's head to suffocate him.</p>
<p><br />
The guy in the bus station is shocked by the story. He asks if that's a Kansas City shuffle; Goodkat says no, that's a Kansas City shuffle, pointing toward the old lady. She is gone. The guy looks back at the wheelchair, but Goodkat is no longer there; he is standing behind the guy, and breaks his neck. He says, "Sorry kid, but for a Kansas City shuffle you gotta have a body." He wheels the corpse out to a truck in the wheelchair.</p>
<p>We then see Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) wearing only a towel and cleaning his face after shaving. There is a knock at the door and he goes to answer it. In bursts Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who lives across the hall. She stops when she sees him and says "You're not Nick." Slevin explains that he is a friend of Nick's who is staying with him for a while. Lindsey notices that his nose is swollen and bruised and asks about it. Slevin tells her about his recent string of bad luck experiences: His apartment was condemned due to the presence of an exotic termite; he went to his girlfriend's place and let himself in with his key, only to find her having sex with another guy in the bedroom ("It was an accident!" she says lamely, to which he replies "What, like he tripped and you fell?"); so he calls Nick to come stay for a while and as he's walking through New York he is mugged by a guy who steals his wallet ! and breaks his nose. Lindsey asks why the guy didn't take his nice watch or suitcase, and Slevin has no idea. He tells her that the door was open when he arrived. Lindsey is taken by the idea that something has happened to Nick and is thoroughly excited to play detective. She has to go to work, and walks out the door. Slevin starts to take off the towel, just as Lindsey bursts back in and sees him naked. She leaves again as he covers up, then pops back in hoping to catch him again. He is obviously flattered by this.</p>
<p>There is a knock at the door after Lindsey leaves and two thug-looking guys, Slow and Elvis, burst into the apartment. They are looking for Nick Fisher, and think Slevin is him. They tell him that the Boss wants to see him, and Slevin mouths off to them, causing Elvis to punch him in the stomach. Elvis says that if he makes one more smart-ass comment, he'll break his nose; Slevin manages to croak that it's already broken.</p>
<p>Slevin is sitting in the back of a car, still in the towel, obviously having been punched in the nose again. They pull up to an apartment building and ride the elevator up to the penthouse, where Slevin is sent to meet the Boss. There is a big man standing by the window and Slevin starts to explain that he's not Nick Fisher, that he has no ID because he was mugged, when the real Boss (Morgan Freeman) walks down a staircase to talk to him. He tells him the story of the Shmoo, a creature whose purpose is to be used by humans to eat and make things. He tells Slevin--whom he constantly calls Fisher--that he is the Shmoo. It comes out that Fisher owes the Boss $96,000. We learn that the man who was shot in the opening scene is the Boss's bookie. The Boss offers to cancel Fisher's debt in exchange for a favor. He explains that the young man who was shot outside the hotel was his only son, and that he believes that the man responsible is the Rabbi. ("Why is he called the Rabbi?" Slevin asks; "Because he's a rabbi," the Boss replies.) He tells him that in retaliation for this he plans to kill the Rabbi's son, Itzhak the fairy. ("Why is he called the fairy?" "Because he's a fairy." "You mean he has wings, glittery dust, all that?" "He's a homosexual.") He explains that in order to cancel the debt, Slevin is going to kill the Rabbi's son. Slevin is horrified, but the Boss tells him to think it over. As the elevator doors close on Slevin, the Boss says, "Let me get this straight: I'm paying you to kill someone, and you're hiring someone else to do the job?" Goodkat steps out from behind a wall and assures him that he will kill someone.</p>
<p>Two cops parked outside take photos of Slevin as he leaves the Boss's headquarters. Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) the lead cop tells the other one to run a check on the guy, because he's either in big trouble or bad news, and either one is interesting to them.</p>
<p>Slevin returns to the apartment when Lindsey returns to ask if Nick is back. The phone rings but there is no answer when Slevin answers. Lindsey dials *69 and finds out that the call came from a hotel. She has a friend who works there, and says that she will check it out, then asks why Slevin is still wearing the towel. He doesn't have time to answer as she has to get back to work. He manages to get dressed before two Hasidic Jews knock on his door and tell him that the Rabbi wants to see him. After another punch to the stomach, he is driven to the building across the street from the Boss's headquarters, up to the penthouse. It is revealed that the Boss and the Rabbi once worked together and now are opponents. Slevin meets the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) who also thinks he is Nick Fisher and owes him $33,000. The man killed with the baseball was the Rabbi's bookie. He tells Slevin that he has three days to come up with his money. Goodkat emerges from another room after Slevin leaves, and the Rabbi tells him that he knows when people are lying, and that is not Nick Fisher. Goodkat says he knows, and that he and the kid have unfinished business.</p>
<p>Slevin gets back to the apartment and Lindsey returns. She has spoken to a friend at a hotel that Nick got a call from and finds that the room is registered to a man named Smith. As she is going to check out the room, the alleged Smith walks out of the room and she follows him into the elevator, getting a photo of him with her camera phone. It's Goodkat; Slevin says he doesn't recognize the guy. Lindsey also says that she followed Smith/Goodkat to an apartment building and saw Slevin leaving that same building with two Hasidic Jews on either side of him. She asks him to explain everything, and he does (we just see a flash of all the events that have just transpired). Lindsey believes that Nick set him up, even the guy who mugged him only took his ID so that he could be mistaken for Fisher and have no proof otherwise. She asks Slevin what he's going to do about the Boss.</p>
<p><br />
Cut to Slevin telling the Boss that he'll kill Itzhak. He asks for a week; the Boss says three days. They agree that whoever wins a game of chess chooses the time limit. As they play, the Boss tells him about Itzhak's bodyguards and his alarm button on a Star of David necklace. The Boss wins the game. Slevin has three days. During the conversation it switches from the Boss-Slevin conversation to an earlier one between the Boss and Goodkat, in which Goodkat says that in order to make it look like the Boss had no involvement, the kid should go in and have a romantic tryst with Itzhak; he will then shoot Itzhak, Goodkat will shoot Slevin, and it will look like a suicide pact. The Boss approves of this idea, but Slevin is unaware of that part.</p>
<p>Brikowski, the cop from earlier, goes down to the morgue where Lindsey (who is a coroner) has the bodies of the Rabbi's bookie and his goons laid out. Brikowski tells her that the guy was his bookie back in the day.</p>
<p>Lindsey and Slevin are out on a date at a nice restaurant. They are flirting heavily, and Lindsey asks him if he comes there often. He says no, but he knows of someone who does. He points out Itzhak the fairy to her. He also points out the bodyguards, and the cops from earlier are watching from the bar. When Itzhak gets up to go to the bathroom, Slevin follows; so does Brikowski, and so do the bodyguards. Slevin and Itzhak are inside and the door locks; Brikowski goes in after Itzhak leaves and interrogates Slevin, asking him who he is because he isn't Nick Fisher. Slevin brushes him off. He tells Lindsey as they're walking back that he has a date with Itzhak. She tells him that he reminds her of James Bond. As they get up to the apartment building they are opening their respective doors (where Slevin got a key I do not know) but he winds up following Lindsey into her apartment and, subsequently, the bedroom. As they are cuddling in bed there is a cute moment where they discuss which James Bond she meant, eventually setting on Sean Connery as the best.</p>
<p>The next morning Slevin goes out to get coffee for them before Lindsey goes to work. The Boss and the Rabbi both have people watching him. Brikowski and the cops grab him and pull him into their van to interrogate him, and he reveals that his name is Slevin Kelevra. That's the only information he'll give up, and only after they beat him up a little. He heads back to Lindsey's. After Lindsey leaves the Boss's men come up to give him something to wear, and as they leave we see that the Rabbi's men have been shot dead. Slevin goes to Itzhak's apartment, looking nervous. Itzhak invites him in and tries to make him comfortable, but Slevin says, "Someone is trying to kill you." When Itzhak asks who, Slevin replies, "Me," and shoots him in the stomach. Goodkat walks up behind him with a gun. Slevin hears him and turns around just as Goodkat fires, and hits Itzhak in the chest, finishing him off. Slevin stands up and says "That was close." Goodkat hands him a key and Slevin walks out to a parked SUV, pulling a body bag out of the trunk. It's the guy from the bus station at the beginning. While Slevin handles that, Goodkat notices a false wall in the room. He presses the panic button on Itzhak's necklace and shoots the bodyguards as they break through. Slevin dumps the guy's body next to Itzhak's and switches watches with him. As Slevin and Goodkat walk away the apartment blows up.</p>
<p>Goodkat goes to meet with the Boss, who is angry that the job that wasn't supposed to look like a job is beginning to look very much like a job. He laughs and decides it doesn't matter. Slevin goes to meet with the Rabbi, carrying a suitcase that he says contains all that he owes him. The Rabbi is reading the Torah and explaining that Saul didn't disconnect the ringer on the telephone, as they don't answer the phone on the Sabbath. He doesn't understand. The suitcase is revealed to be empty, and Slevin tells him that Saul and all the others are dead before knocking him unconscious.</p>
<p>The Rabbi wakes up in the Boss's headquarters. He recognizes the place as he has been there before, and makes a nice little speech conceding defeat to the Boss. The Boss replies that there is no need, and we see that they are both taped to chairs back to back. They argue about fault, about the death of the Boss's son, and the Boss tells the Rabbi that Itzhak is dead. Slevin walks down the stairs to address them.</p>
<p>Here the scenes cut around a bit. We see Brikowski in the morgue with the charred body of the bus station guy, whom Lindsey cannot get ID for. She does, however, recognize Slevin's watch and looks horrified when she realizes who he must be. Goodkat steps in through the door of the morgue and shoots her in the chest. She falls.</p>
<p>Brikowski goes to his patrol car, where he talks on the phone to a guy at the station who tells him that a new guy recognizes the name Slevin Kelevra. The entire explanation is wedged in between the next few shots.</p>
<p>Slevin asks the men if they remember the seventh horse, tenth race, of the 1979 horse race. He recounts the story and how they were the ones who killed Max and his whole family. He recalls how they had to hire a specialist to take out the kid, and the specialist is Goodkat. In flashback, Henry turns around and looks at Goodkat, who chooses not to shoot him and instead puts him in the car. The Boss and the Rabbi are stunned to learn that Slevin is Henry. He puts plastic bags over their head like they did to his father and tapes them into them so that they suffocate.</p>
<p>Brikowski is listening to the explanation from the man at the police station, learning that Slevin is the name of the horse from that race. He also adds that the new guy is Jewish, and that the name Kelevra is Hebrew. He says "It means..." as Slevin sits up in the backseat, puts a gun to Brikowski's head, and finished the sentence with "Bad dog" before shooting him. In the flashback we see that the man who shot Max's wife was Brikowski.</p>
<p>Slevin is sitting at the bus station alone when Lindsey walks in. He goes over and hugs her. We see that on the morning he returned with the coffee, Goodkat tells him that Lindsey has to die because she took his photo. Slevin agrees, then goes in and tells Lindsey where he will shoot her and how to protect herself. When she fell in the morgue, she was wearing a bulletproof vest and a packet of blood to make it look authentic. Back in the bus station they are embracing and Goodkat walks up. Slevin tells him that he didn't think he'd understand, but Goodkat says he does. He gives Slevin back the watch, which is shown to be the watch Max gave Henry at the racetrack. Goodkat walks away, and in a final flashback Henry is shown in the backseat of Goodkat's car saying he wants to go home. Goodkat replies that neither of them will be going home for a long time, and turns on the radio to hear the song "Kansas City Shuffle" playing.</p>

<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: This spoiler was sent in by Tom T who says..."This was a very entertaining Disney family movie that everyone can enjoy. The dog's perspective is enthralling, and while the human story that parallels it is a bit predictable, it is also handled well. However parents should be warned that there is a scary scene involving the dogs, whale carcass, and a nasty leopard seal. Also, even though the title implies otherwise, not all the dogs make it."</p>
<p>Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) is a guide at Weather Station in Antarctica. His job is to take scientists to remote corners of the area around the base with his pack of 8 well-trained huskies. Each dog has a distinct personality with two named Max and Maya being the most memorable. We also meet his buddy, Cooper, a cartographer (Jason Biggs) and Katie,(Moon Bloodgood) a pilot who brings in supplies and passengers, and who is Shepard's on again, off again love interest</p>
<p>Katie has brought along UCLA Professor McLaren (Bruce Greenwood) who has traveled across the globe to the icy continent to look for a rare meteorite. Jerry gets the assignment to take him where he wants to go. McLaren seems kind of stuffy at first, but turns out to be a nice guy who bonds well with Jerry and the dogs on their joruney. They make it to their destination, but then get word from the base that a huge storm is coming and they have to return ASAP. Jerry wants to go right then and there, but the McLaren convinces him to stay for _ day since “you have to take risks for things you believe in” (this quote pops up later). When they bunk down, the Professor shows Jerry a picture of his family and a picture his child made for him, saying that he gets one for every trip (also important later).</p>
<p>Jerry and the McLaren search for the meteorite and wonder of wonders find what they are looking for, which will really help the McLaren's career. Men and dogs hightail back to the base, barely keeping ahead of the incoming storm.</p>
<p>However, when they stop to get their bearings, McLaren falls down a cliff onto the ice and through it, breaking his leg. Jerry and the dogs pull off a courageous rescue (which is thrilling stuff), ditch the gear (but not the meteorite), bundle up McLaren, and make it back through the blinding storm to the base just in time, where Katie, Cooper and the Weather Station crew attend to them.</p>
<p>Then, everyone at the Weather Station is called back to base camp McMurdo Antarctic Research Station. The storm is too fierce, operations are being shut down for the winter, and all stations have to evacuate quickly back to McMurdo before becoming snowed in. Katie's plane at the camp can only hold so much. McLaren, Shepard, and staff board the craft and leave. Katie's plan is to return for the dogs.</p>
<p>When Jerry comes to at McMurdo, he finds out he and the McLaren are going to be OK. However, Katie and Cooper tell him that the weather has gotten so bad that a flight back to get the dogs is denied by the command staff A guilt-ridden Shepard is shipper back to the USA.</p>
<p><br />
The movie now shifts back and forth from the dog's perspective to the humans. You are always given an update as to how long the dogs are on their own (ultimately they were on their own for 6 months).</p>
<p>Jerry spends six months trying to find the resources to return and rescue the dogs he loves, who were left chained outside in the cold. He does not have any luck. While the folks he has to go to are sympathetic there is not enough money and the weather is still too bad and no expeditions are planned until the following year. Jerry meets McLaren, who is grateful to Jerry and the dogs for saving him. However, he cannot help Jerry either as he cannot get funds from UCLA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the eight dogs have gotten tired of waiting for help and manage to break free of the leashes they were tethered to so the storm would not blow them away. Sadly, one of the dogs is older and is too weak to survive the storm.</p>
<p>However, these are not your everyday hounds. They band together like a pack of wolves and wander the area around the base camp hunting sea gulls to survive. Sadly, another dog dies in a mishap and one of the dogs (Max) gets separated from the others in a snow storm. The other 5 dogs continue to wander around the area getting into some scrapes but working together to overcome them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile back in the USA, Jerry goes to see McLaren at UCLA at a ceremony that is honoring the Professor for his discovery. The Professor gives a nice speech where he thanks Jerry and the dogs for saving him. They have a drink after, and Jerry tells him he is going to Christchurch, New Zealand (a popular jump off point to Antarctica for most expeditions) to see if he can get a ride South so he can find out what happened to the dogs. McLaren asks why, since the dogs have probably dies by now. Jerry replies with the same line McLaren used earlier (cue uplifting music) “You have to take risks for things you believe in”.</p>
<p>Back to the dogs…. Max has stumbled upon a carcass of a killer whale (WARNING: Parents with kids who don't like “Jaws” like moments should be prepared) and is digging in when in a vicious leopard seal, which has been sleeping IN the carcass (don't ask) leaps out. Max gets away but then reunites with his 5 companions, who also notice the dead whale as well. Working together, Max lures the whale away so the others can eat. However, the seal and the dogs eventually get into it and the Maya gets nipped in the leg by the seal. The other dogs manage to drive the seal off and feed up.</p>
<p>Back in the US of A, McLaren comes home from the UCLA soiree, and kisses wife and child goodnight. As he is tucking in his youngster, he sees that the kid has drawn a picture of 8 dogs titled (“The dogs that saved my daddy”). This kicks McLaren into gear and we see a scene of him looking at financial statements from the meteorite expedition.</p>
<p>Back to the dogs…..The remaining six keep wandering, decreasing the sea gull population but it is clear they are getting weaker (especially Maya).</p>
<p>We now cut back to Christchurch, New Zealand, where Jerry is not finding any luck finding a ship to take him to Antarctica. He is at a bar where he is surprised to see Katie, Cooper, ……. and McLaren. It turns out that since the expedition was cut short because of the storm, McLaren got the surplus cash to hire out an icebreaker and a chopper to help Jerry. (*Sure, happens all the time, but this is a Disney movie :)</p>
<p><br />
Off our friends go and we next see them in an icebreaker smashing its way through the ice. However, because of ice that even an icebreaker can't break, Jerry and friends only get within 100 miles of the weather station where the dogs were.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Cooper remembers an Italian weather station, where his girlfriend worked, is close enough to the icebreaker to get to by helicopter (which Katie can fly) , and the station has a vehicle that can get them the rest of the way. Jerry doesn't really believe Cooper has a girlfriend, but will give it a shot. Turns out that they find the station (which is close for the winter). They break into the garage and find the vehicle Cooper mentioned, which is more than adequate to the task and fueled up to boot. In a funny moment, Cooper provides Jerry proof that the girlfriend is for real as well (I have to say Jason Biggs was the most entertaining bipedal character. His comic relief was always a scene stealer.)</p>
<p>Jerry, McLaren, Katie, and Cooper fuel up the vehicle at the Italian station and set off for the base camp. There, they find the body of one of the dogs, but notice that the other 7 have broken free. The folks really don't know how or where to start looking for the others. Happily, in classic Disney fashion, bounding over the hill come the 5 remaining dogs (no Maya). Joyous reunion of human and husky! Though Jerry is sad that three did not make it, that five survived is miraculous.</p>
<p>But wait, Max runs away and Jerry follows him over the aforementioned hill where he finds Maya, who was too weak to make the last dash. Jerry picks her up and carries her back to others where it is clear she will be OK too.</p>
<p>The last scene shows Jerry, Katie (whom we infer will now become Mrs. Jerry), Cooper, McLaren and the six surviving dogs driving back to the Italian station to fix the door to the garage, return the vehicle and head home. The final shot is of a cross with 2 collars on it to honor the 2 dogs that did not make it.</p>
<p>Now, this movie was “based on a true story”. The “true” story was that there was a Japanese expedition in Antarctica in 1958 where a science expedition had to leave behind 15 sled dogs under similar circumstances that we see in “Eight Below”. The story of what happened to those dogs was told in a 1983 Japanese movie called Nankyoku Monogatari (released in the USA with the name “Antarctica”) I saw this movie and it is a magnificent picture. However, if you want to rent it for the family, be warned that the story in this movie is much grittier and only two dogs made it out of fifteen.</p>
<p>BASIC INSTINCT 2</p>

<ul>
<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
NOTE: This spoiler was sent in by Michael Gettings who says..."A slippery mystery with almost too many twists and turns, confusing names, and bizarre, out of left field plot points. A mystery unsolvable to the viewer, it takes your hand and doesn't quite let go, with almost laughable dialouge througout. Definitley one of the guilty pleasure movies of 2006, and dubiously enough, I hope it's the last." For more work by Michael, please see: www.fictionpress.com/~michaelgettings. The movie opens with a car speeding around London at 110mph. The camera moves in to show Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) driving along, with a male passenger who is obviously drugged. As they drive faster, she grabs his hand and begins to masturbate, as she speeds up. Eventually, the car crashes off of a bridge as she climaxes, into the water. The drugged man cannot escape, and Tramell tries to help him, but the car is filling with water far too fast.</p>
<p>She's arrested, and put under psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Glass (David Morrissey), who informs the British Court that she has a "Risk Addiction" and a God complex where she can do no wrong, and can predict the future. Tramell resents this. Dr. Glass, on the way out of the court room, is questioned by a reporter, whom we find out is sleeping with Glass' ex-wife, who left him for an undisclosed reason. The reporter brings up an old case of Glass' that was supposed to remain private.</p>
<p><br />
Glass talks to his ex-wife, who said she might have mentioned it in passing to the reporter during pillow talk, which aggravates Glass.</p>
<p>Glass talks to the police about the man in the car, and the officer in charge of the case, Roy Washburn, tells Glass that there was a drug in the passengers system, and he was dead before he hit the water.</p>
<p>Glass decides to take on Tramell as a personal case, as he is vying for a high-chair in the London Parliament. He goes, with his partner, to talk to an art dealer about getting the position, when Tramell shows up. She talks to Glass' partner, an older female, outside, which is distracting Glass. The art dealer tells him that he's not going to get a recommendation because of his depressive melt-down, after a drug dealer under his care went crazy and killed his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Glass, at home, gets a call from his ex-wife. She's panicking, and Glass heads over. The reporter has been killed in the bed, strangled to death. Washburn shows up and begins to question Glass about why he was there, and he points out that he was called by his ex-wife to come over. Washburn mentions that the man was drugged, the same drug that was in the football star's system at the beginning of the movie, thus implicating Tramell.</p>
<p>Glass begins to follow Tramell, and sees that she is going into a seedy building. He follows, after it looks like she is attacked, into a brothel. He runs to the roof and finds an orgy going on in the room below, looking through the sky-light, with Tramell in the middle. Distraught, he leaves. Tramell stops by his office later and terminates her treatment, saying she is going to be treated by his partner.</p>
<pre>
Glass begins to follow the story the reporter was writing before he was murdered, which was about the drug-dealer who killed his girlfriend, and would expose Glass as a freak. There was a mystery detective referenced in the article that was known to plant evidence in order to secure warrants and make arrests, and Glass finds out that the mystery detective was Washburn, and he'll do anything to implicate suspects.
</pre>
<p>Glass is called to the location of the orgy, and finds the body of the man who was sleeping with Tramell in the orgy. Glass calls Washburn on him, for planting evidence, but Washburn says it's a load of shit, and says that Glass is their primary suspect now. He's taken in, when Trammel provides an alibi and Glass is released. He goes to Tramell's apartment, and they have sex. In the morning, he opens her fridge to find some needles and a liquid in the back, which he suspects to be the same liquid that was used to poison the reporter and football star. He turns it in to Washburn for analysis, but does not mention where he got it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Glass has a fight with his ex-wife, and finds her in a bathroom, dying with her throat cut. He's once again the prime suspect.</p>
<p><br />
Washburn tells Glass that the liquid was the drug, and he needs to know where he got it. Tramell, furious with the lack of trust, tells Glass that it's insulin and she's diabetic. Tired of being strung around by everyone, he follows her to her upstairs deck, and almost drowns her in a hot-tub. He goes home, frustrated, and starts smashing pictures he had hanging on the walls.</p>
<p>He reaches into his pocket and finds a copy of the new book Tramell is working on, and reads it. The story ends with Tramell killing Glass' partner, and he freaks out, rushing over to her house. He runs inside, to find his partner perfectly okay, and Tramell fixing a drink. He accuses Tramell of wanting to kill her, and she says it's ludicrous, and just part of her book. When Glass goes to attack Tramell, his partner gets in the way. He shoves her, and she hits her head on a table, knocking her out.</p>
<p>Glass goes back to attack Tramell, and she pulls a gun, saying that it's protection from Washburn, who is setting her up. Glass doesn't believe it, until Tramell tells him the article was really about Washburn killing the drug dealer's girlfriend to set him up. Glass sees that his entire mental breakdown was the result of Washburn wanting to further himself, and when Washburn breaks down the door, he grabs Tramell's gun and shoots Washburn dead. As he is dying, he says, "Whatever she told you, it was a lie."</p>
<p>Unfit to stand trial, Glass is sentenced to a mental institution, where Tramell comes to visit him. She tells him that she didn't like the ending to her book, and she gave him a much better one, but the real ending would blow him away. The real ending was that the writer wasn't the killer, nor was it the detective, it was the psychiatrist, who was never quite sane after his mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Glass is the murderer, and in a series of flashbacks, you see him murder the journalist because of the story, the orgy-man because of jealousy, his ex-wife because she was cheating on him before the divorce, and Washburn because he did kill the drug dealer's girlfriend. Tramell says that she misses him, as he is catatonic, and leaves him a copy of her book on his lap. He looks at her, smiles before going vacant again, and she walks away.</p>
<p>He opens the book, and finds the inscription, "To Michael Glass. I couldn't have done it without you."</p>
<p>The camera pulls away, and the movie ends.</p>
<p>SLITHER</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>NOTE: Another great spoiler sent in by brentage5000. The movie starts with a giant meteor hurtling through the depths of space. From there, we go to the quaint midwest town of Wheelsy, where new Sherrif Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion -- Serenity fans represent, yo!) and his deputy Wally (Don Thompson) out at night measuring the speed of a passing...whipporwhill. While Wally reflects on his fading speed judgin ability, the meteor crash lands behind them...at the size of a basketball. The meteor cracks open, and inside we see a big pulsing growth.</p>
<p>The next day, things are getting ready for family fun weekend in town as the foul-mouthed mayor, Jack McReady (Gregg Henry) drives into work after cursing a jeep driver out in front of a little girl and her mother. Elsewhere, we see science teacher and former beauty pageant winner Starla Grant (Elizabeth Banks) trying to teach her students -- including Connie Strutemyer (Tania Saulnier) (the IMDB credits say Kylie, but I swear I heard them calling her Connie the whole film), who looks like she's out for Starla's former crown and is currently passing notes with one of the cuter boys in class. School lets out, and while Bill talks with crossing guard Margaret (Jennifer Copping) and her young son, Starla's husband Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) comes by to pick her up, although he gets jealous after seeing her talking with one of the male teachers. The pair leave and head for their house where that night Grant tries to work up Starla, but she's "not in the mood." Disappointed, Grant throws on his pants and walks out.</p>
<p><br />
Sometime later, we see Grant drinking alone in the local bar when he is approached by Brenda Guiterrez (Brenda James). The two talk and she tells Grant how she's jealous that her fat sister could find someone to stick around and love her while she gets nothing but a baby to take care of. Before you know it, the two are out in the woods and about to have sex when some part of Grant (not that part, obviously) stops him and reminds him of Starla. Brenda starts to insult Grant but stops when Grant starts following a trail he just found. They eventually find the slug thing and Grant takes a stick and starts poking at it. A needle comes out of the top and fires at Grant, embedding itself in his chest before burrowing all the way in. Grant falls over, apparently dead, and Brenda starts trying to wake him up. A few minutes later, after the needle has dug into his brain, he does wake up and walks off with a glazed look in his eyes, leaving Brenda there wondering what's wrong with him.</p>
<p>The next morning, we see Starla waking up in bed, and she notices that Grant isn't there, although his truck is parked rather awkwardly in the driveway. For his part, Grant is downstairs spreading leaves and other forest stuff in a kind of bed on the cellar floor. He starts smelling meat and heads upstairs where he finds Starla waiting loooking rather beautiful, and she apologizes for last night and the two have make-up sex, although since Grant's not Grant, it's more like plain ol' sex. Later, Starla is leaving with a big smile on her face while unbeknownst to her, Grant is going through the fridge for any meat related product when he hears a dog barking outside. He goes to check it out and...</p>
<p>...we see Starla bragging to one of her co-teachers about the incredible makeup sex she and Grant had. That night, though, things get weird for Starla when she notices that Grant has put a lock on the basement door and later still when she's in the shower, with Grant outside ready to infect her, but he chickens out and runs off, saying he'll meet her at the hunting dance in town after he takes care of something at work. Confused, Starla heads over to the dance where Wally is giving Bill a hard time about his crush on Starla, to which Bill says, "Fuck you, fatty." Regardless, he still goes to talk to an impatiently-waiting-for-Grant Starla and the two start having fun. Meanwhile, Grant has gone over to Brenda's house and seems to be having sex with her when two tentacles pop out of his chest and he infects her with...whatever. Later that night, Starla arrives home and finds Grant there, only his face looks like roadkill. He waves it off though, saying it's a bee sting and he went to the doctor earlier -- which is where he was -- and he said it should clear up in a day or two.</p>
<pre>
The next day, Starla is riding home from work when at a stoplight, she sees a Lost Pets sign advertising the sheepdog from before. Meanwhile, Grant visits a barn deep in the woods where we see a chained Brenda, whining about being so hungry. Grant deposits a couple of bags filled with meat in front of her and she begins eating them ravenously as an even-worse looking Grant smiles. That night, at the Grant household, Starla is approached by Wally and Bill, who tell her that Brenda is missing and Grant was the last person to be seen with her. Bill leaves his card with his direct number on it and asks her to have Grant call him so they can sort this out. She says okay and goes inside, looking like she's about to cry. She looks at the basement door with the padlock on it and for whatever reason, breaks it open with a baseball bat. She goes downstairs and finds a mess of dead animals with their guts torn out, including the sheepdog she saw on the poster earlier. She runs upstairs and tries to call Bill, but is interrupted by Grant, who breaks in and starts trying to kill her with an extra long tentacle left arm. Just then, Bill and Wally come back with the rest of the police force -- seems Starla's call did get through. They gaze in horror and wonder at Grant, and he throws Starla at them and takes off.
</pre>
<p>3 DAYS LATER...</p>
<p>We find Bill leading his cops in a review of "Squidboy's" (that's Grant) latest appearances when Jack comes in asking if they've caught him yet. When he gets a negative, he asks how hard it can be to catch one guy with Lyme Disease. The others look at him incredulously, and he explains "You touch rat droppiings without washing your hands, then you eat something, and boom -- Lyme Disease!" The others ignore this and plan where to be that day for Grant's next likely appearance and with a couple of hunters -- a young white guy and a middle aged black guy -- they run out. As they're leaving, Starla comes up asking to go with them, saying they'll never find the still-missing Brenda unless Grant gets taken alive, and after a while, Bill's crush forces him to agree. First, though, they stop at the Strutemyer house to try get the literal man of the house Otis (William McDonald) to come with them, but he turns them down and goes back inside to his family of Connie, wife Ethel (Iris Quinn), and twin eight year olds Emily (Matreya Fedor) and Jenna (Amber Lee Bartlett).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over at the farm of the day, everyone -- including Jack, for some reason -- is setting up to wait for Grant's appearance. That night, as Starla and Bill are recollecting for Wally a time when she was twelve and came over to his house and asked him to come to Hollywood with her to be the bodyguard to her famous actress, and he called the cops on her instead, Grant shows up, now looking more like "half-tree/half-worm-boy" He starts eating a nearby cow and the party comes out, with Starla begging him to come quietly, saying she will stay behind him, since "Marriage is a sacred bond for better or for worse." ("Much fucking worse," mutters Bill) Grant turns and starts to get out of there, but is cut off by the young white hunter -- who promptly gets sliced in half as all his guts spill out (TOTALLY the grossest scene I've ever seen in a movie). Grant takes off and the others follow him into the forest, eventually happening upon the farmhouse where Brenda is. They hear her in there, go inside...and find a 5,000 pound Brenda that looks like a human hot-air balloon. She asks them for some food -- a little possum, maybe -- and Bill says they'll get her to a hospital. Just then, she starts shaking and screams "They're tearing me apart!" just before bursting open as thoousands of little slugs come streaming out of her. Bill yells to cover their mouths, but it's no good -- only him, Starla, Jack, and Margaret survive, the slugs having taken Wally, Trevor, and the black hunter.</p>
<p><br />
Meanwhile, we see Connie taking a nice relaxing bath while her mother tucks Jenna and Emily in and her father watches TV. Outside the bathroom window, we see a slug sneak in and make it's way over to her. It hops in the water, but just before it goes in her mouth, she wakes up and sees it. She screams and it starts going in, but she grabs it and pulls it out, getting a whole boatload of race memory in so doing. She throws the slug against the wall and cuts it in half with a curling iron, but then the house gets inavaded by dozens of more slugs, which manage to infect the rest of her family. She gets outside, jumps to the ground, and crawls into her dad's pickup truck, but since he has the keys and is inside the house, she's stuck...especially as the slugs manage to cover every surface of the truck.</p>
<p>Back at the barn, the survivors are gathering the bodies and Bill says that he's going to the station to get help -- like from the CDC or something. He leaves and as the others are tending the bodies, they start getting up and asking Starla why she ran. It soon becomes clear that they're speaking for Grant, and she tells them all to get away, threatening to shoot them. They laugh until she blows Wally's head off with a shotgun, and then it's a merry ol' chase through the woods -- except for Margaret, who gets eaten.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we see Connie in the truck when her family stumbles out of the house, demanding that she join them (even though they're zombies). Just then, Bill shows up and Connie runs for him, telling him what happened. The two get into Bill's police car and get out of there just in time to see Jack and Starla cross the street in front of four or five zombies. Bill distracts them and Starla manages to pick up some kind of pole and kills one of them with it by bashing its brains in, causing Jack to go, "Bitch is hardcore..." Starla and Jack get in the police car, and after a minute of silence, Bill goes, "So...how's everyone's evening so far? Good?" He calls radio operator Shelby at the station and after reminding her not to nod over the radio asks her to get the CDC on the line for him. She says okay and they sign off just before a shitload of slugs drop out of the ceiling onto her. Connie speaks up and tells them the history she learned from her experience with the slug -- that these things have been moving from planet to planet for millenia, and the leader's real head is shaped like a needle, and that Grant is the first sentient host he's had. Bill calls Shelby back, and he hears, "Hello there, killer. I've got a nice big surprise for you. It's waiting just around the corner." He looks up and the car gets totaled by a big 18-wheeler, knocking him and everybody else out.</p>
<p>Some time later, Bill comes to in time to see a bunch of zombies making off with Starla's still unconsciouus body. He grabs Connie and pulls her out of there, but manages to lose Jack. He and Connie run for the police station, and he asks her if they kill Grant, will the others die, and she says yes. He tells her to hide in a nearby alley, and he runs into the police station to grab a grenade that just happens to be there. Inside, something moves in the dark, but he ignores it and tries to get an outside line. Naturally, the phones and radio are dead. Bill goes for the grenade but is suddenly attacked by a mutant alien deer that got infected back when Brenda blew up. He gets saved by Connie, who kills the thing with a fire extinguisher to the head. Bill grabs the grenade and thanks Connie, although he shamefacedly asks her to tell anyone who asks that he saved her, to which she replies, "Okay."</p>
<p>Back with Carla, she wakes up in her bedroom, alone and confused. She goes over to her bedstand, picks up a comb with a rather sharp handle, and pulls the bristles out and tucks it into her stocking -- instant dagger. We quickly cut to Jack and see him in a dark room. he takes out a lighter and gets it lit in time to see himself surrounded by zombies. They head for him and the light goes out. Sometime later, we see Jack sit up, apparently okay and being ignored by the zombies. He looks at a dead arm sticking out, goes over to it, looks one more time at the zombies, and then digs in. Upstairs, we see one of Grant's tentacles put on some Barry Manilow as Starla comes into the living room and sees a big blob Grant (totally gross) absorbing (or becoming one with) people. Outside, we see Connie and Bill watching this and Bill says, "Well, that is some fucked-up shit right there." Inside, Starla starts talking to Grant and calming him down, saying she will stick by him. Just as she's about to kiss the big blob, she pulls out the dagger and attacks him with it, getting thrown against the wall for her trouble. Bill takes this as his cue and runs in, followed by Connie, but Grant throws a couch at Connie and knocks her out against the wall and manages to hit the grenade into the pool out back, where it promptly blows up. Bill takes out his gun and starts shooting at Grant, but Grant gets one of his tentacles into Bill, knocking the gun to the floor. Outside, Bill is fighting off the other tentacle and spots a propane tank. He manages to grab it and shove the second tentacle into it. Grant pulls both tentacles in and Bill yells at Starla to shoot Grant. She picks up the gun, closes her eyes, and fires, at which point Grant explodes magnificentally.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the sun has risen on the town. We see Connie picking her way out from behind the couch as Starla wakes up covered in blood. The two girls stagger over to the inert body of Bill, who wakes up coughing as they're watching him. Connie tells him that he'll be okay, since he only got one tentacle inside him, and he says, "Oh...great." The three start walking out of town, and Bill speaks up, saying Connie should tell Starla how he saved her from that dear. Connie shrugs and says, "Oh, yeah...Bill saved me from a deer."</p>

<p><br />
The movie opens with Wendy, a high school graduate from McKinley High, photographing her friends on a ride called the "High Dive". Shortly after she takes their picture, she notices the letter "V" missing out of the ride name, but thinks nothing of it. As the beginning of the movie progresses, we're introduced to several characters, including Wendy's boyfriend Jason, her best friend Tiffany, and her boyfriend Kevin, as well as other characters like the jock-like Lewis, the valley-girlesque Ashley and Ashlynn, and the goth-liking Ian and Erin., as well as Wendy's attitude-laden sister Julie and the troublesome "playa" Frankie. They all begin to make their way to the roller coaster, which has a demon-like figure at the front and a dark, foreboding voice warning them of the ride ahead. This begins to get Wendy nervous, even as she's taking pictures for the yearbook of everyone.</p>
<p>The group begins boarding onto the roller coaster, with Jason getting divided from everyone else, as he sits in the front car and the others sit in the back. Lewis is attended to by the ride attendant to adjust his shoulder pads, and this sets off a slight sleak in a hydraulic pipe on the car, unnoticed by staff. Frankie hides a video camera in his pocket as Wendy's camera is pocketed by Kevin, sitting next to her. The ride begins and soon turmoil erupts as the leak continues and Frankie's camera is knocked away by Ashley, wrapping itself around the track. It's run over, causing the leak to become worse and the ride's shoulder belts to become loosened. One car suddenly jars entirely off the track, and others begin dropping off left and right. The ride suddenly stops upside down, forcing Ian and Erin to hang and eventually fall to their deaths. Kevin and Wendy motion the ride to go backward, but in doing so, Kevin is cut in half and Wendy is dumped onto the track...</p>
<p>Then Wendy wakes up and realizes it is all a premonition. She's still sitting in the car as it gets ready to move. She makes a big fuss and demands to be let off, and the attendant releases all the seats in the rear car. Wendy and Kevin exit, and soon the others follow, out of curiosity (and because Lewis almost strikes a fight with Kevin). Jason asks to be let off as well, but the ride continues with him and the people in the front car still sitting in it. Attendees lead a terribly upset Wendy outside and start to ask her details, and the coaster crashes, as predicted, leading to the death of Jason.</p>
<p>A little while later, Wendy is at the school and is confronted by Kevin, concerned about her and the loss of Jason and Tiffany. Wendy insists to be left alone. Ashley and Ashlynn invite her to a tanning session, and she takes their phone number. As she makes her way to her car, Kevin explains that this has happened before, with flight 180 and the seven people who got off...and died in mysterious ways. Wendy charges off as thunder booms overhead.</p>
<p>Ashley and Ashlynn head over to their favorite tanning salon, hoping to bronze up for a party. They both have Big Gulps, and the owner insists they trash them, as he heads off to complete a phone call. Ashley only pretends though, and they both head back to a tanning booth, where they proceed to disrobe. Ashley sets her drink down on a bench, right above a cooling unit for the tanning units. The girls also reach for a CD, knocking a book shelf slightly loose on one side. The owner heads out the door, with only a tube of lotion holding it open. However, the lotion squirts out, and the door closes shut and locks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wendy is looking over the photos she took after she promises Julie the camera, and after Julie lent her a good friend bracelet left behind as a family heirloom. It's here she notices a photo of Jason with a foreshadowing of the coaster behind him, and gets an eerie feeling as the light bulb dims in and out. She finds Ashley and Ashlynn's number and proceeds to dial.</p>
<p>Back at the tanning salon, Ashley's Big Gulp has begun to leave a water residue, which leaks into the cooling unit and forces the temperature to rise slightly. As the girls seem to notice this, a cooling unit kicks in that causes a coat rack to tip.slightly. A vibration from the phone (Wendy's call) forces the coat rack to fall over entirely, causing a plant to fall on the book shelf and collapse. The panel from the self slides right into place on both units, locking both Ashley and Ashlynn in as the temperature rises. Both girls wince and scream in pain as the bulbs begin breaking, and soon a fire breaks out, burning both girls alive. The owner tries to get in, but the back door is locked, and he also locked the front. They're done for.</p>
<p><br />
The next scene is at their funeral, where Ian begins questioning the preacher's comments and is led off by Lewis and Kevin. Afterward, Kevin finds Wendy kneeling at Jason's grave, and she begins to show him pictures of scenes that depict what's going to happen beforehand, including a picture showing a plane about to crash into the Twin Towers in New York. Suddenly, a strange wind blows over both of them, and Kevin tells Wendy he's going to get her some food.</p>
<p>The two go to a local drive-thru restaurant, unaware that Frankie is ahead of them in his little sports coupe. On the way, the two almost hit a truck in their vehicle, forcing the driver to jump aside. They get to the drive-thru of the restaurant, noticing a vehicle is pulling behind them and also to the side, blocking Wendy's exit. The sign also shows a bit of glitching out, and soon the radio kicks on, playing a creepy "Walking Behind You" song. Suddenly, Wendy and Kevin notice a runaway truck coming their way. They can't escape the vehicle, and they honk at Frankie to move aside, only to have him flip them off. The couple behind them move out, and they crack the windshield and jump out of the truck before the runaway truck hits it. The trucks collide, forcing Kevin's truck to spit its engine out of the front. It slides along the back of Frankie's car, and the fan cuts right into the back of his head, killing him. Wendy and Kevin go to check, and a "jolt" moment occurs when the fan sputters one last time, spreading Frankie's brains even further.</p>
<p>After a talk with the coroner, Kevin and Wendy begin to calculate death's design and who was sat where on the roller coaster. They look over the photos and decide to pay Lewis a visit while he's in the middle of a workout. Lewis thinks the whole thing is crap and proceeds to his workout, even as Wendy points out to Kevin that his photo shows a guy with swords, a weight dropping on his head, and a bear in the picture. (There's a tall bear statue and a sign with loose swords in the weight room.) Lewis begins to work out with the other team members around him, causing the swords above his workout machine to rattle loose. Suddenly, some kind of accident jars a tooth out of the bear's mouth, forcing a weight lifter to drop his weights. Lewis stops for a moment, and the swords come down, missing him and instead slightly cutting into a cable on the machine he's working on. Lewis takes this moment of victory and lifts the weights one more time, only to have the cable snap and the two weights on top come down and smash his head to bits.</p>
<p>After a brief moment talking at the car, Wendy and Kevin make their way to the Home Depot-like shop where Ian and Erin work. Ian begins blasting away at birds with a nail gun, then sets it down. He then makes light of the stuff that's happening and tries to jokingly fool with Wendy and Kevin. However, soon some accidents are put in motion to put a forklift in motion to knock objects around, and it forces it to start lifting on a wall loaded with objects- including sharpened stakes and pieces of flat plywood. As Ian discusses the possibilities of death's designs, Wendy notices the stakes, and Kevin saves him as the items begin reigning down. It soon starts stacking on top of each other, and one item penentrates a bag of sawdust, blinding Erin. She ends up falling backwards with her head against the nail gun, and about nine rounds end up getting fired through her head (and her hand), killing her. Ian is completely upset.</p>
<p>After a visit to the police station and the disbelief that follows, Wendy and Kevin split up, with Ian (not noticed) giving Wendy an evil stare. Wendy ends up falling asleep at her house, and Julie comes along to take back the bracelet, for good luck. Upon leaving, Wendy wakes up and realizes that she and her friend Perry were actually on the ride, upon the identification of the bracelet in a photograph. She calls up Kevin and informs him that his photo looks like something glaring, with bright light. It's then that Kevin informs her that he's overlooking security at a colonial fair, complete with fireworks, and Wendy starts heading out the door to the fair. Soon, the song she heard at the drive-thru kicks on again, and she notices a vehicle following her. She almost hits a wolf and continues to the fair.</p>
<p>Kevin notices Julie and her friends at the fair and tries to talk to her, but she runs off after being weirded out. Meanwhile, an actor leaves his cannon lighting stick on a cannon, knocking it sideways and forcing a cannonball to run along and knock one of the fireworks trailer cars off balance. Wendy shows up, wondering if Kevin will survive some kind of firework attack. Soon, the display is about to begin. As fireworks begin to go off, a couple of pranksters set off some of their own, startling a nearby horse. The horse begins running amuck, dragging a wooden stake behind him. Julie somehow ends up getting tied up in this, and almost gets impaled on some kind of rake machine that the horse jumps over. Kevin, however, is able to cut her loose. It's then that Wendy asks who was sitting next to her on the roller coaster, and she reveals it was Perry. As Perry realizes this and starts to stand up, the horse, still startled, pulls a flagpole off a trailer, which jettisons itself into Perry's chest, killing her.</p>
<p><br />
After a close call with Kevin where he is nearly fried by a firework, Julie and Wendy begin to drag him off, only to run into Ian, who thinks that he is the cause for Wendy's death (indicated by a shirt she was wearing bearing his last name, the same name as the school). He confronts them, but then the firework cart settles over and aims the fireworks right at them. The others duck as the fireworks go off, which go all around Ian. He thinks he's safe and the others are next, but the fireworks ended up hitting a crane that loosens, carrying with it a sign that cuts Ian in half. He flips off the trio as he dies, and the screen fades to white.</p>
<p>Shift to five months later. Wendy is now in another city, starting a new life with her new boyfriend and a roommate. She is riding in a subway train car with them, and starts to notice signs pointing to the deaths that previously occurred, as well as the "Walking Behind You" song being sung by a patron. She begins to motion to get off the car, but is stopped by Julie, paying a surprise visit and getting on the car. As she does, some guys in face paint drop an unfinished candy bar, which misses a trash can and goes onto the tracks, where a rat notices it. As the doors close, Wendy can't help but notice that the car number is "081", which, in the reflection of a mirror, are the numbers "180", the same as the flight from the first movie. She's nervous, but sits down to talk to Julie.</p>
<p>As they speak, she notices Kevin riding on the car, and goes over to ask why he's there. As he answers, she notices something is wrong as the lights begin to dim. The rat chews on the candy bar, but gets too close to some wires and fries himself, causing the tracks to switch over. The car goes haywire, and soon everyone is shifted as it flies off. Julie is cut to shreds by an oncoming train, and Kevin is pushed against a window and blasted apart as he scrapes in the tunnel. Wendy hangs on for dear life until the car crashes. Everyone is dead around her, and she crawls out, seeing her leg is severely injured. She then notices another train approaching, and not stopping. She screams for dear life.</p>
<p>We then flash back to on the train. It was another premonition she had while talking to Kevin. Kevin grabs for the emergency brake and Julie attempts to help Wendy pry open the doors to the car, but the screen fades to black and the last thing we hear is the crashing of several subway cars.</p>
<p>RUNNING SCARED</p>

<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Another great spoiler sent in by Marcus.</p>
<p>The film opens with a gunshot, and we see Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker) walk out of a building. In his arms are Oleg Yugorsky (Cameron Bright) and a silver snub-nosed .38 pistol. Oleg has blood on his shirt, and Joey puts him in his car and speeds off. Joey is frantic (his face is bloody), and keeps reassuring Oleg that they are going to make it. They speed through a red light and continue driving while Oleg takes his asthma inhaler. Oleg yells out that they are going to crash when he sees a person on a bicycle in front of them. We hear the car screech, and we go back to 18 hours earlier…</p>
<p>We see a group of men in a hotel room. Three men are black, two of which are counting money while the other one walks around with his machine gun. Three other men are white – Tommy Perello (Johnny Messner), Sal Franzone (Michael Cudlitz), and Joey. Tommy is busy making sure the drugs he has in front of him are good (this is obviously a drug deal). Everything is going smooth until three masked men bursts into the room with shotguns. They order everyone on the ground, to which everyone complies except Tommy. The leader of the masked men hits him in the stomach with his shotgun, then whacks him in the back to get him on the floor. Very carefully, he orders everyone to slowly get out their weapons and slide them across the floor (under the bed). Everyone obeys, then the masked men start to collect the money and the drugs. One of the black men pulls out a razor and cuts a masked man’s Achilles tendon. The masked man screams in pain, and then the leader of the masked men shoots the black man in the chest. Another black man pulls out a hidden blade that was on his back and lunges at the leader, who blasts him with his shotgun (the black man’s body flies across the room). That leaves one black man left, who promptly gets blasted in the head by a shotgun. Tommy says that he doesn’t care about them, but if they spill Perello blood, they are going to be in a world of pain. The leader orders his man to shoot him, but Tommy pulls out a hidden gun he had (it was attached to his leg; it’s the snub-nosed pistol) and shoots the man in the groin. A shootout occurs, which has Tommy, Sal, and Joey taking cover. Joey shoots a masked man to death and the leader runs away. Tommy walks over to the man he shot in the balls, steps on it, then blows his brains out. The masked man’s hand turns over, and in it is a cop’s badge. The man Joey killed is also a cop, which makes Tommy extremely pissed. They gather the goods and quickly leave.</p>
<p>In the car, Tommy gives the gun he used to kill the cop to Joey (along with Sal’s gun). He orders Joey to get rid of it by dumping it in the lake. At the Gazelle house, Joey’s son Nicky (Alex Neuberger) is playing hockey with Oleg (who’s his best friend) in the basement. They wrestle around, trying to get the puck, and Nicky accidentally pushes Oleg hard against a wall. Oleg lifts up his shirt and we see that his back is very bruised. Nicky fells bad about doing that to him, but Oleg knows that he’s not the reason for his bruises and uses his inhaler. Joey arrives home with the two guns wrapped in newspaper. He sees his father watching TV, and walks into the laundry room where his wife Teresa (Vera Farmiga) is doing the laundry. He gets horny seeing her bent over and pretty much has sex with her on top of the laundry machine, but they stop because Teresa insists that they don’t do in right now (Oleg and Nicky are in the house). Joey goes downstairs when Nicky hears him. The two kids hide while they see Joey stash the guns carefully in plastic bags in a hidden space. Joey goes back upstairs and gets a bit upset with Teresa that the kids are playing hockey in the basement again (he saw their gear).</p>
<p>Teresa tells Joey to get Nicky since it’s time to eat. Nicky and Oleg come up, and Nicky asks if Oleg can stay for dinner (Joey says no). Oleg doesn’t mind too much and goes to leave. Joey tells Nicky to get his grandpa to the dinner table (Joey’s father is disabled). After he does, Joey surprises Nicky with tickets to a hockey game later that week. Nicky is happy, but asks if Oleg can come too (Joey says maybe next time). Oleg goes back to his home, which is directly next to the Gazelle’s. His father, Anzor (Karl Roden) is watching a John Wayne movie on TV. From the tattoo on his back of the Duke, along with various posters around the house, it’s clear that Anzor is a big John Wayne fan. His wife brings him some pizza, but he doesn’t like the crust. Oleg comes in and Anzor talks to him about his childhood. When he was younger, he didn’t have any entertainment like people do nowadays. After he did a “job” for his father, he was rewarded with a super 8 film player and three movies, one of which was a John Wayne movie. The movie was only 10 minutes, but he loved it and watched it a thousand times. However, when he came to America he saw the rest of the movie and saw that John Wayne got shot at the end (which made him pissed). Oleg doesn’t like John Wayne, and he calls him a fag. Anzor almost hits him, but Oleg runs upstairs.</p>
<p>Joey and his family sit down and eat dinner. Teresa is concerned because a teacher of Nicky’s said that he should be tested for ADD. Nicky swears, and is corrected by his mother and father. Joey says that there’s no way Nicky’s going to be medicated and is against the test. Back next door, Oleg’s mother Mila (Ivana Milicevic) brings Anzor some food again. He smacks her across the face and shoves her head into the food. He’s been smoking meth, and so is a bit worked up. We see a shadow come downstairs and enter the living room where Mila and Anzor are. Teresa hears a gunshot, but Joey ignores it and makes Nicky pass the bread. A bullet is shot into their window, and Joey gets everyone on the floor. Everyone is okay, but Joey is furious at his Russian neighbor. He grabs a gun and heads next door. Mila opens the door, and Joey searches the house for Anzor (he thinks Anzor was the shooter). He finds his neighbor in the kitchen, shot in the shoulder. Anzor tells him that it was Oleg who shot him. Joey asks him where he got the gun, and Anzor describes perfectly Tommy’s gun that Joey was supposed to get rid of.</p>
<p><br />
Joey runs back home and looks in the basement to find that Tommy’s gun is in fact missing. He can’t believe it. Teresa called the cops about the shooting, and Joey tells her about the gun. If the cops get it and find Oleg, they will force him to tell where he got it, which would make Joey dead. Teresa assures him that he can get to ! the gun before the cops can. The ambulance arrives and takes Anzor away. Joey goes back next door and tells Mila to go with the ambulance. He acts like he’s concerned, and waits for the paramedics to leave, saying that Anzor told him to stay until Oleg came home. While no one’s looking, he digs out a bullet from the wall and it falls on the floor. Two cops come in and ask him about the incident. Joey tells him that Anzor was talking in Russian when he came in and didn’t tell him who shot him. Joey steps on the bullet to hide it. The cops tell him to go outside, where they’ll take a statement from him. They then proceed to look at the bullet hole. Joey eats some nicotine gum and quickly chews on it. He then drops it on the floor, steps on the gum, and steps on the bullet so that it’ll stick. He goes back home, nearly having a heart attack. He also digs out the bullet that came through his window.</p>
<p>Joey tells Nicky to make a list of all the places him and Oleg hang out. He’s going to go out and look for him. Joey leaves and takes Nicky with him. He tells Teresa to stay next door, and to call him if Oleg shows up. The first stop Joey makes is at the hospital, where he puts on a doctor’s uniform and looks for Anzor. He finally finds the room where they operated on him, and he sees the bullet lying on a table. He tries to get it, but a nurse asks him what he’s doing. He says that the cops outside want to examine the bullet right away, but the nurse takes it and says that she’ll give it to them. Joey dumps the doctor disguise and bumps into Detective Rydell (Chazz Palminteri) in the hallway. They both look at each other, as if they know each other. Joey walks away while the nurse gives Rydell the bullet (since Joey told her the police wanted to examine it right away).</p>
<p>Joey then drives to a park, where Nicky and Oleg sometimes hang out in an abandoned building. We see that Oleg is already there, and he’s pretty scared. A crack addict surprises him, and Oleg pulls out the snub-nosed pistol. The druggie looks at it and says “nice gun”. Back at the hospital, Rydell talks with Anzor about the shooting. Rydell notes that Anzor’s family members are associated with the Russian mafia. He asks who shot him, and Anzor tells him that it was a black person. Rydell leaves, and bumps into Ivan Yugorsky (John Noble), Anzor’s uncle who’s also a mafia leader. Ivan and his men walk in the room and talk with Anzor. Meanwhile, the druggie is leading Oleg somewhere. It turns out he’s leading him to get some drugs from the bathroom at the abandoned building. Joey and Nicky begin to search the park for Oleg. The druggie has the pistol, and he holds a drug dealer hostage while he makes Oleg search for the drugs hidden in the toilets. Another drug dealer asks Oleg what he’s doing, and he sees the druggie holding his man hostage. Dealer #2 holds a gun to Oleg’s head and orders the druggie to release his man. Joey hears a lot of gunfire, and runs to the bathroom. He sees the dealers are dead, and orders the druggie to put his hands on his head (he thinks Joey’s the police). He then asks him about the gun, but Oleg has already run off with it again.</p>
<p>Oleg runs in front of a liquor store, where he sees a pimp named Lester (David Warshofsky) beat up one of his hookers. He smashes her head against his car’s headlight, and beats her up for not making enough money that week. He holds a knife out to her face and is ready to use it when Oleg draws the pistol on him. Lester doesn’t think he has it in him to shoot him, but Oleg does. However, the gun is out of bullets and so Lester takes it away. He then holds the knife to Oleg’s face and tells him that he’s going to permanently carve a smile into his face. The hooker knocks Lester out, and Oleg takes the gun back. The prostitute sees that Oleg is wheezing (he doesn’t have his asthma with him), and walks off with him. Somewhere along this Mila (Oleg’s mom) has returned to her house and talks with Teresa about how she belongs to Anzor. Mila was a prostitute, and was promised safe passage to America where she would get rich (she was a mail-order bride of some sort). However, once she arrived and was found to be pregnant Anzor’s mob relatives wanted her to abort the baby. Anzor stood up to his family, and married her to save the baby. Since Mila married him, the mob relatives wouldn’t hurt her kid (but Anzor does abuse him frequently).</p>
<p>As Joey and Nicky continue to look for Oleg, we see the prostitute and Oleg in a pharmacy. The pharmacist won’t give Oleg medication, since they won’t tell him who his doctor is or his name. Even after the hooker offers sex and money, he still won’t budge. She pulls out the pistol and orders him to give Oleg medication (he does). Joey goes to a strip club, and makes Nicky stay in the car. Tommy and Sal pull! up and enter with Joey. The three meet up with Rydell, who makes it clear that he was the masked leader during the opening shootout. He also makes it clear that unless they give him two million dollars, he’s going to take over the investigation and nail all three of them for the his dead partners. The three won’t budge, since Rydell has nothing on them. However, Rydell tells them about the snub-nosed pistol, and how it was used to shoot Anzor. He tries to make Tommy and Sal turn on Joey, and Tommy finds it interesting that Joey didn’t get rid of the gun (the whole time Joey denies it). Rydell gives them instructions to a locker that he wants the money delivered to, and promises to finds the pistol before they do (“I got the toughest mob in the world – I’m the law”). They all leave.</p>
<p>Joey drives Nicky to a diner and says that he’ll get him some food (since his dinner was interrupted). Inside, we see that Joey really is having a meeting with Tommy, Sal, and Frankie Perello (Arthur J. Nascarella). Frankie is Tommy’s father, and the boss of all of them. They discuss the dirty cop situation (i.e. Rydell) and Frankie promises that they’ll take care of it. Joey orders a burger for Nicky and sends someone out to give it to him. Frankie asks Joey if the snub-nosed pistol really was used in Anzor’s shooting, and Joey denies it. Since Anzor is related to Ivan Yugorsky, and Ivan and Frankie are doing business together, Frankie doesn’t want the shooting to look related to them. Frankie orders them to find Oleg. A man goes outside and gives Nicky his burger. Nicky however noti! ces the prostitute and Oleg walk into the diner to eat. Nicky goes inside to try to get Oleg’s attention, but is noticed by Tommy (who brings it to the attention of the others). Nicky tells Joey that he’s going to the bathroom, and Oleg sees him (he also tells the hooker that he’s going to use the restroom). In a stall, Oleg gives Nicky the gun, who hides it in a toilet lid. Joey comes in and tells Nicky to hurry up. Oleg remains unseen and Nicky promises that everything will be okay. Nicky and Joey leave.</p>
<p><br />
Oleg and the prostitute see some cops walk into the diner, and so they decide to leave. Joey asks Nicky for any other places where Oleg could be, and Nicky tells him not to worry about it. Joey stops the car and Nicky tells him that Oleg was back at the diner, and gave him the gun. They drive back to the diner, and appear on their best behavior in front of the cops. We see that the bathroom has been cleaned (there are two yellow signs that say the floor is wet). One of the cops is using the toilet that has the gun in it. Joey and Nicky hide in a stall until he leaves. When they lift the toilet lid, they find it missing. Joey gets pissed, and accuses Nicky of making it up or misplacing it. Joey pieces it together – the janitor took it. He and Nicky sneak into the kitchen. Nicky stands guard outside while Joey searches the manager’s office for who the janitor was. He finds out the name and address after being nearly caught by a cop. They leave again.</p>
<p>The prostitute wants to ditch Oleg and tells him to go home, but he lifts up his shirt and reveals his horribly bruised back. She then has a change of heart and lets him stick around some more, but the cops show up and arrest the hooker, along with Oleg. Teresa calls Joey and tells him that Oleg has been caught by the cops, and wants Nicky to come back home. Joey drives Nicky back at home and gets an earful from Teresa for putting Nicky through this. Before Joey can pull out of the drive way, Tommy and Sal pull up and ask him where he’s going. He says he’s going to get groceries, and they ask him if there’s anything he wants to tell them. He says no, and so they leave. Joey drives off for the janitor’s home. Rydell interrogates Oleg, and asks him where he got the gun. Oleg tells him that he found it at school, but Rydell knows he’s covering up for Joey and gets frustrated that he won’t tell the truth. Rydell leaves and talks with Anzor in the hallway (his arm is in a sling). Rydell tells Anzor to get Oleg to tell the truth about where the gun came from, and in return he will overlook the fact that Anzor has a meth lab in his backyard. Anzor thus takes Oleg out for some ice-cream.</p>
<p>Joey drives to the janitor’s place, and knocks on the door. He bursts into the apartment and holds the janitor’s wife at gunpoint while she holds her baby. He asks her where the janitor is, but he’s not there. She tells him that he’s out playing cards with his friends, and Joey makes her tell him exactly where (along with making her promise not to contact him). Joey takes off and ends up at the card game place. He passes by a man in the staircase, and asks him if he’s the janitor. He says no, and tells him that he’s still inside (but he warns him that if he owes him money, he already cleaned him out). Joey bursts into the room where the janitor is playing cards with his buddies. He finds out who he is, and asks him where the gun is. The man gives Joey the middle finger, who responds by breaking it. It turns out the janitor lost it in a card game to the man Joey just passed by in the staircase. Joey orders him to give the location of where the man is going. When Joey goes outside, he screams in frustration and anger over the gun.</p>
<p>Anzor is trying to get on Oleg’s good side by telling him that if he tells the cops where he got the gun, he’ll get him season tickets to his favorite hockey game. Oleg says “I’m sorry”, and Anzor tells him not to worry about it. But Oleg finishes by saying “I’m sorry I missed”, which causes Anzor to lose it and hit Oleg in the face. Oleg overturns the table and runs out of the ice-cream place, hiding in the parking lot. Anzor tries to find him, and Oleg sneaks into a van and hides there. Anzor leaves. The people who own the van come and open the back, where they are a bit surprised to find Oleg there. The woman says “it looks like we picked up a stray”, and Oleg notices that there are two other kids in the van with him. The man and woman give the kids ice-cream and drive off with them.</p>
<p>At a car garage, a mechanic (the man who Joey ran into in the stairway) talks with Lester (the pimp) about his car. He tells him that he can have his car’s headlights repaired in a couple of days. The mechanic shows Lester the pistol (which catches his attention, since he recognizes it from his incident with Oleg), and Lester pays a couple of hundred dollars for it. The mechanic gives him bullets for it, and Lester calls a cab. The cab pulls away from the garage while Joey pulls in (Joey sees Lester). Joey then asks the mechanic about the pistol. The mechanic freaks out and runs off inside, where he turns off the lights. Joey can’t see anything, and the mechanic grabs a blowtorch. He uses it to knock the gun out of Joey’s hands, and tries to burn him with it. Joey eventually gets the upper hand and sets the mechanic on fire. While the flames slowly work their way up his body (his lower half is on fire), Joey asks him where the gun went. He tells him about Lester and where he can find him.</p>
<p>Back to Oleg – he is at the couple’s apartment where everything is crystal clean and there is a big room full of toys. The couple show the kids the! ir video camera, and force the other kids to hug. Oleg uses his inhaler and asks where the bathroom is. The woman is a bit concerned, but tells him where it is. The man tells Oleg that he’s going to miss being in the “movie”. Oleg leaves the room and tries to open the front door, but it won’t open (there’s a lock on the inside that requires a password). He tries to open up any windows, but they are all locked. He grabs a cell phone from the woman’s purse right before she finds him in the hallway. Oleg says that he just couldn’t find the bathroom, and this time he actually goes inside it. He locks the door, and calls Teresa Gazelle. He doesn’t know where he is, and he is scared. She talks her through it, and helps him find out the location when Oleg finds a prescription bottle. Teresa is concerned since the adults there sound weird, and she promises to go there. She gets Nicky in the car and they drive off. The man and woman burst into the bathroom and see Oleg flush the toilet.</p>
<p>Teresa shows up at the location, which is an apartment complex, and leaves Nicky in the car. She goes to the right apartment and rings the doorbell, which catches the man and woman off-guard (in case it wasn’t clear before, they are pedophiles). They throw on some clothes and the woman tells the man to take care of the kids. The woman opens the door and asks Teresa why she’s there. She says that Oleg called her, but the woman lies and says that she must be mistaken. Teresa lets herself in and looks around. The apartment looks like it’s straight out of a magazine, and is disturbingly clean. Teresa sees that two kids are in their bedroom, sleeping, and still doesn’t find Oleg. She goes to leave when she realizes something – there are no pictures in the apartment, at al! l. If they were their kids, they would have had at least one picture. She walks into the room full of toys, and refuses to leave without Oleg. The man threatens to call the cops, but Teresa sees through his bluff and tells him to go right ahead. Teresa then pulls out a gun and orders them to tell where Oleg is. It turns out he’s in the closet; his hands are tied with tape and a plastic bag is taped around his head. Teresa performs CPR on him and he regains consciousness….all the while the man and woman are debating on how to get the gun. Teresa orders them to get away from the door and let Oleg leave. They do, and she tells Oleg to get the other kids and go downstairs to wait with Nicky. Teresa calls the police and tells them that she heard gunfire across the hallway (giving the location). She hangs up and shoots the pedophiles to death.</p>
<p>Teresa calls Joey, and he returns home to comfort his wife. She tells him that she never saw true evil before that night, and confesses to killing the pedophiles. Joey gets pissed, saying that she could have just taken Oleg and walked away. Anyways, he takes Oleg along with him to retrieve the pistol while Nicky and Teresa stay at home. In the car, Joey talks with the cab service and ask where they took Lester (saying it’s an emergency). On the way over there, Joey talks with Oleg about music (Oleg only listens to a Russian song his mother has). They listen to the radio and show up where Lester is. They wait outside for him, and Joey puts his gun on his lap. Joey talks about knowing a kid once, who was beaten and abused just like Oleg was, day in and day out. But then when he was 14, he went to his father’s room and beat him with a baseball bat. Now the father can’t do anything without shaking. It’s clear that Joey is talking about himself and his father. Lester walks outside, and Joey sees the gun. However, before he can get out of his car Tommy and Sal show up again and block Joey. Tommy says “Let me guess, you were just about to call us”, and sees Oleg. Tommy wants Joey to follow them, and he puts Oleg in their car.</p>
<p>They drive to someplace deserted, where they leave Oleg in the car while Tommy, Joey, and Sal walk a good distance away. Tommy gets a phone call from his father, and he assures him that he’s “taking care of the problem”. He pulls out a gun and holds it to Joey’s head. He doesn’t buy the story Joey told him about the gun, and Joey realizes that they are going to kill them. After all the time they’ve known each other, they are going to kill him. Joey keeps on knocking the gun away, so Tommy pistol whips him a couple of times while Oleg watches helplessly from the car. Joey accepts what’s about to happen, but just asks that it’s not done in front of the kid. Tommy refuses, and points the gun at Sal’s forehead and fires. Sal dies, and Tommy reveals that Sal got busted a while ago and has been a rat for the cops ever since. He then reveals what’s going to happen to Rydell, of whom is at the locker and sees the bag full of cash. Rydell opens the bag in a bathroom stall, and finds that it’s full of phone directories. Also inside is a cell phone, which Tommy calls him on. The cell phone was connected to explosives, and so Rydell explodes in the bathroom. Since he’s dead, that takes care of their problem. However, Tommy has one more place he wants to take them. They get in their cars and drive off.</p>
<p>Tommy leads Joey and Oleg to a hockey rink, which is owned by Ivan Yugorsky. Also at the rink are Ivan’s goons, a couple of hockey players, Frankie Perello, and some of his goons. Oleg is brought forth before Ivan, and Anzor is revealed to be there as well. Since Frankie brought back Oleg, this would guarantee that his business relationship with Ivan would not be in danger. Ivan shows Oleg his light system, and at the touch of a button the lights go off and everything becomes glow-in-the-dark (it’s like neon lights or something). Ivan hits Oleg in the head, and Joey gets pissed. Ivan doesn’t like Joey’s disregard for him, and so has his goons throw him on the ice rink. They hold him down, and a hockey player launches a puck at Joey’s eye. Then another at his forehead. Then another at his nose. And another at his mouth. By the time they are done, Joey is a bloody mess and is face-down in a pool of his ! own blood. Ivan throws down Oleg next to him and orders Anzor to kill him. Anzor grabs a gun but can’t bring himself to kill Oleg. Joey also tells him that he wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he did. Anzor throws down his gun, takes off his shirt, and walks away. Ivan grows furious and orders him to kill Oleg, but he won’t listen. Ivan shoots Anzor three times in the back, and Anzor dies.</p>
<p>Ivan walks over to Oleg and is going to kill him when Joey talks. He tells him that Frankie ordered him to use Oleg to shoot Anzor. Frankie denies this, but Joey persists that Tommy gave him the gun himself and told him to use the kid. Tommy gets pissed as well, and things turn tense. Tommy pulls out a gun and is going to kill Joey when he is shot in the back by a shotgun, which blows a chunk of his body off. He’s not quite dead yet, and so he fires at Joey but he misses (Joey is sliding around on the ice). A shootout occurs, and Tommy dies. Frankie’s goons and Ivan’s goons kill each other. Frankie and Ivan hold guns to each other’s heads, but they are both empty so they scramble for a shotgun. Joey got his hands on a gun, but a hockey player knocks it away and hits him in the face with his stick. Ivan bites off a piece of Frankie’s ear, and they continue to struggle over the shotgun. Ivan is shot and killed by Frankie. Oleg slides a gun to Joey, who kills the hockey player coming at him. The last hockey player knocks it away and jumps on top of Joey. He shoves his stick on Joey’s throat while Frankie brings himself together and shoots the player point-blank with the shotgun.</p>
<p>He is angry at Joey for ruining everything and prepares to kill him. Joey rips open his shirt and we see that Joey is wearing a wire. He is undercover, and has been for 12 years. Frankie asks him why he would wait so long to bust him, but Joey says that they were waiting for the right time (Frankie doing business with Ivan was the right time). Joey’s so deep undercover that Teresa doesn’t even know the truth. Frankie tells him that she will never have to find out when he hears a gun cock. It’s Oleg, with a pistol pointed at Frankie. This distracts him enough so that Joey gets up and takes the shotgun from him. Joey blows Frankie’s head off with the shotgun. Joey then leaves with Oleg, and the FBI show up with helicopters and cars. An agent tells Joey that they lost contact with him, but they traced him to the hockey rink. Joey gets in his car and says that he is going to take Oleg home. The agent tells Joey that he needs medical attention, but he doesn’t care. This kid has been through hell this night, and he just wants to take him home.</p>
<p>On the way home, he tells Oleg that maybe he can find him a ticket to the game Joey and Nicky are going to later that week. For the first time, we see Oleg smile. Joey then says that they should eat first and clean up before going home. They stop at the diner and eat their meal. Joey seems to be really connecting with the boy. After they’re through, they get up to leave. As Joey pays for the food, Lester the pimp walks in with two hookers. He immediately recognizes Oleg, and starts threatening him. Joey intervenes and the two hookers fight with him. He headbutts one and throws her on top of the other who tried to pepper spray him. All Joey has is a knife, and Lester pul! ls out the snub-nosed pistol. Oleg stands in-between them. Joey wants Oleg to move behind him, but Oleg won’t move. Joey rushes to move Oleg, and we hear a gunshot.</p>
<p>We now are back at the opening scene, where Joey takes Oleg out of the diner with the gun. We see that Lester has had his throat slit, and is now dead. It turns out Oleg wasn’t shot, but Joey was (in the chest). Joey speeds off to get Oleg back home while Oleg tells him that they should go to a hospital. Joey is losing a lot of blood and is bleeding to death. They nearly hit the person on a bicycle, but Joey is determined to bring Oleg home. Back at home, Teresa and Nicky are sleeping on the couch. Next door, we see Mila looking regretful and we see a gas line is broken. She lights a match and her house explodes, killing herself and destroying the windows next door. Teresa and Nicky go outside and see the damage when they see Joey driving towards them. He passes out before he can stop, and so he crashes into garbage cans. Oleg gets out and sees his burning home while Teresa gets Joey out of the car. He says that he is really a good person and tells Nicky that he’s going to take him to the game. Joey dies right before the ambulance gets there.</p>
<p>Some time later we see Teresa, Nicky, and Oleg at Joey’s funeral. Teresa has been given a folded American flag. They are all very sad. Teresa drives the kids to their new home (Oleg has been adopted by them), which is a farm house. She walks over to the person fixing up Joey’s car. She tells George that the flag is for him. “George” is actually Joey, who didn’t die after all. Nicky asks Joey what was put in the coffin, and Joey says that it was probably a bunch of old uniforms. He wrestles around with Nicky and Oleg, who has finally found a loving family. FREEDOMLAND</p>

<li>CUT TO THE CHASE*</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: This spoiler was sent in by AJ. who says..."The movie is rather weak, but the performances are VERY strong!</p>
<p><br />
The movie opens with Brenda (Julianne Moore) wandering through the Projects at night. She gets to the hospital, goes into the emergency room and takes her hands out of her pockets. They’re cut to pieces and all bloody.</p>
<p>Next, we meet Lorenzo (Samuel L. Jackson), a cop, and his partner who are trying to pick up a guy on a warrant from the next town. He gets a call about seeing Brenda to take a report on her stolen car, and he heads for the hospital.</p>
<p>Brenda is pretty shell-shocked and it takes a while, but she finally reveals that Cody, her four-year-old son was in the backseat of her car. Lorenzo freaks and has an asthma attack and the doctor has to give him a shot. It’s also revealed that Brenda's brother is a cop in the next town - a predominately white town.</p>
<pre>
The search begins. Brenda’s brother goes overboard and calls every cop car to seal up the projects and look for clues. Tensions get high as the media goes wild. Lorenzo takes Brenda home and can’t help but feel there’s something she’s not telling him. After dropping her off at her place, he starts to drive home and realizes he’s being followed. He pulls over and finds out it’s a volunteer group that helps look for missing kids. He declines their help and goes home.
</pre>
<p>The next day, he visits his son - who’s in jail. Then he checks the situation. Brenda has helped a sketch artist do a rendering of the Negro man who took her car.</p>
<p>There’s still no sign of Cody and tensions are going through the roof around the projects. Lorenzo again asks Brenda what really happened to Cody and she pleads with him to believe her, that Cody is her life and she would never hurt him. She goes by the day care center where she works and the children try to cheer her up. As she’s leaving, a mother tells her to stay away from her child.</p>
<p><br />
The white town’s cops show up at the projects and arrest a man. They work him over pretty good, drag him back to the precinct and hold up the drawing of the wanted man. He kinds of looks like the sketch. They start to question him when Lorenzo and Brenda’s brother show up. The brother goes thermal and pounds the guy; the cops have to drag them apart. Lorenzo leaves in disgust and runs into his partner outside. The Feds are about to take over the case and Lorenzo asks his partner to stall them for one more day.</p>
<p>That night, the police make their presence known in the projects. Things are close to exploding and Lorenzo begs the cops to stand down, let tempers cool. They do, but several tenants don’t! The situation erupts into a full-scale riot. Fires are set, people beaten, cops jumped and arrests made everywhere.</p>
<p>Lorenzo calls in the volunteer group and suggests they search Freedomland. It’s the site of an old foundlings’ home - abandoned for years - and the only place in the area that a small child could wander or hide for some time. They also feel that taking Brenda there will get the truth out of her via the psychological impact of the place.</p>
<p>The searchers gather and Lorenzo learns that their leader lost her son about ten years before. As they search, she talks to Brenda. She tells her how she wishes she knew where her son was, how she knows who did it, but can’t prove it. She runs through (several times!) what she would like to say to the man to get him to tell her where the body is. Gradually, she shifts the context of the sentence to asking Brenda.</p>
<p>Brenda cracks and tells them this is the wrong place. She leads them to a shallow grave covered with heavy rocks. Cody is buried there. Lorenzo calls in the forensic team and can’t help but wonder how Brenda could move such heavy boulders.</p>
<p>Lorenzo takes her back to the police department and they talk. Brenda was having an affair with a man from the projects and would feed Cody cough syrup to get him to sleep, so she could have sex with the man without interruption. She told him it was liquid vitamins. One night, Cody wouldn’t go down and they had a fight. Brenda walked out to see the man - even though she knew it wasn’t for sex, it was to break it up. When she returned, she found Cody dead under the table. He’d overdosed on the cough syrup. Brenda lost it, not knowing what to do. She drove out to the woods and dug his grave with her bare hands. Then she called her (old) boyfriend and asked him to help. He carried Cody out there, buried him and put the rocks over the grave - both as a tribute and to keep animals away. Both he and Brenda are taken away.</p>
<p>Lorenzo visits Brenda in prison and tells her to channel her grief into something positive - helping other prisoners etc. Then he visits his son and breaks down into tears.</p>

NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by Marcus.</p>
<p>The opening scene takes place in Tehran, Iran. Bob Barnes (George Clooney) is at a party, drinking and socializing with the people around him. His language skills are perfect, so he has no problem understanding people in foreign countries. He talks with two men, and asks them where they want to do the deal. Next, we see Barnes with the two men in an empty building. Barnes has two cases with him. Each case holds a missile/rocket, and Barnes puts a battery in each one to show that they work. The men give him some money, and they place one case in another room while taking the other one to their car outside to load. Barnes is confused, since he thought that they were going to have both of them. They tell him to mind his own business and go outside. Barnes goes into the other room where he sees that the other case is already being transported out of there. A man pulls a gun, and Barnes talks to him in Farsi. He realizes that the man doesn't know the language, and the man goes away. Barnes walks outside the building while passing the two men from the deal, who are fooling around with the case while trying to get it into the car. The two men get into the car. The car explodes as Barnes walks away as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Next, we see a bunch of oil workers in the Middle East lose their jobs. If they do not find work in the near future, they will be deported back to their native country. Wasim (Mazhar Munir) and his father walk away from the oil plant with their fellow fired workers. Wasim's father looks on the brighter side of things and talks about how many opportunities there were in their native home of Pakistan. Wasim however is not so happy to lose his job, but listens to his father's words with thought.</p>
<p>In the United States of America, two big oil companies are going to merge together: Connex and Killen. This happens to be the reason why Wasim was laid off from his job. Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), an oil tycoon, hires Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate how the smaller oil company managed to get rights to apparently untouched oil fields in Kazakhstan. Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper) is part of the smaller oil company, and does not approve of the merger or of Holiday's presence. Holiday seems to not get as much respect as his associates, but he can still get the job done. When Holiday comes home from a hard day's work, he sees an older man sitting on his porch. Holiday leaves the door open for the man, who comes inside and helps himself to some food and a cigarette. This man is Holiday's father, who's a drunk. He usually finds his way to Holiday's home frequently and he doesn't approve of his son's job.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, we are introduced to Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), who's a successful energy consultant. He lives with his wife Julie (Amanda Peet) and his two young boys. It's dinner time, and the boys ask if they can have real meat to eat for breakfast (the bacon they have is made from tofu or something). The family laughs about this. At work, Woodman's boss approaches him in ! his office. He tells him about an Emir in the Middle East, and how he's extremely wealthy in the oil business with his two princes, Nasir (Alexander Siddig) and Meshal (Akbar Kurtha). It would benefit Woodman's company if they did business with this royal family, and he asks Woodman to go to a party that the Emir is holding at his palace. Woodman says that he can't, because it is his son's birthday. His boss tells him that he can take his family, and so the Woodmans go to the party. Bryan's kids socialize just fine with the other kids there, and all the kids play around in the pool located on the estate.</p>
<p><br />
We see senior members of the CIA talking about their agent, Bob Barnes. It seems that Barnes keeps on writing memos on the missing missile/rocket, and his superiors don't like this. They say that no one wants to hear about a missing weapon during this time, so they decide to try and silence him by offering him a desk job. Barnes goes to the interview, where the interviewer asks him about his experiences in Beirut (apparently, he did some mission there or something). Barnes is not too vocal, and the interviewer asks him about his opinions of the Middle East and what should be done. The interview is obviously not in Bob's favor, so they cut him short. Barnes then tells them that he actually likes the Middle East and how he doesn't like how everyone perceives that place in a supremely negative light. He finds himself at ease over there more so than he does in the US. Later, Barnes meets up with his college student son for lunch. Barnes thinks that maybe his son should move back closer to home and go to a local college. His son has other ideas and doesn't want to. During this conversation we find that Barnes is divorced.</p>
<p>Wasim and his friends fool around in the desert and hang out. They talk about how hard it is to find a job, but they keep their spirits up with jokes and whatnot. Later, we see Wasim trying to find a job on a ship. He even offers to work for free, and will be willing to do any job. The employer, however, tells him that there's a long list "just for that job". Wasim then tries to go to a government building, wh! ere he hopes to get some help in finding a job. There's a long line to get in though, and everyone is ordered to stay orderly in line. After his father talks too loud and is unruly in line, his father and Wasim are perceived as a problem and are beaten by the soldiers outside with batons.</p>
<p>Back at the Emir's party, Woodman waits patiently to talk to the king about a proposition for his company. The king is still in a meeting with some Asian men, and Prince Meshal seems busy trying to impress these men with his electronics and how fancy the palace is. Meshal shows that he can control everything with a remote control, and puts on the lights outside since it is getting dark. When he tries to put on the pool lights though, something's wrong because they won't come on. That's when we see that lights in the pool are cracked, but electricity is still going through them. The kids at the party want to play a game (it’s basically tag but in water). They want one of Woodman's sons to be the 'it' person, so he has to get in the pool first. Woodman is greeted inside by some men who represent the Emir, and they tell him that the king cannot meet with him but would still like to hear his proposition. Woodman tells the men the prop, but is put off by not talking to the Emir (he gives them his business card, though). He walks outside where he hears screaming coming from Julie. Their son is in the darkened pool, and he's not moving. The royal family shuts off the power to the palace and Woodman jumps into the pool and takes his son out. Bryan and Julie scream for a doctor/help, but they find that it's too late - their son is dead. He was electrocuted when he went into the pool.</p>
<p>Holiday continues his investigation with the merger and the oil rights to Kazakhstan. He gets to spend some time getting to know Jimmy Pope from an afternoon hunting session. It's during this time that Holiday meets Danny Dalton (Tim Blake Nelson), someone working in Pope's oil business. Back to Barnes, the CIA still want him to stop writing memos. One of the people worried about Barnes’ memos is his superior friend, Fred Franks (Thomas McCarthy). Without options, they decide to send him out into the field again just to get his mind off of the missing weapon. They tell Barnes about Prince Nasir, who they say has money in dark places that could be used for terrorism against the US. They want Barnes to find out what Nasir is up to, and send him off. Barnes uses an old contact from Beirut, a man by the name of Mussawi (Mark Strong). Mussawi is not the man's original name, and Barnes keeps on calling him his old name, which gets Mussawi pissed at him. Barnes wants him to kidnap Prince Nasir, put him in a car, and drive across the desert with him. Mussawi gets idea that this is about killing Nasir (even though Barnes just wants to find out where his money is going), and leaves after agreeing to help.</p>
<p>The Woodman's bury their child. Bryan and Julie try to remain strong with their surviving son. One night, Bryan finds that his son can't fall asleep. His son wants to look out the window, and so Bryan looks out the window with his son all night. Woodman breaks down at his job, but gets a call from Prince Nasir. Woodman flies back to the Middle East and tries to keep his feelings under control. He checks into a hotel and talks with Julie, saying how hot/humid it is down there. Julie sounds concerned, but Woodman assures her that he's okay. He talks about how the culture is over there (the woman cover themselves completely, the men wear spotless white clothing). Later on, he meets up with Nasir who takes him to the desert where they talk business. Nasir offers to cut Woodman's company into his oil business, a cut that would be around 75 million dollars or so. Woodm! an says "great, now how much for my other kid?” bluntly bringing to the surface that Nasir is only cutting them in because of Woodman's loss. Woodman then tells him that he could maximize Nasir's profits by being his consultant. Nasir hires him as his consultant, and the first thing Woodman recommends is building an oil pipe-line.</p>
<p>During this time, we see Wasim and his friends joining an Islamic extremist group, who welcome them in as brothers and provide them with food. They also provide them with work, which keeps them from being deported. The leaders lecture on how the West has failed, and how they care so much for oil. One day, Wasim and his friends are become friends with a man who tells them that there is another group within this Islamic group that might be more suitable to their needs. He takes Wasim and one of friends one day through a field to a shack, promising to show them "something cool". What he shows them is the missing case from the beginning, with the weapon inside. This man is the same man who couldn't speak Farsi (he held the gun to Barnes at the beginning). He puts the battery in, and explains that they should be careful around it. He then tells them that it's nearly impossible to hit anything with it.</p>
<p>Holiday finds out that corruption was part of the deal between the smaller oil company and Kazakhstan, He tells his superiors that Danny Dalton was involved, and that he plans on bringing Dalton up on corruption charges. Pope thinks this is hypocritical and wrong, since he personally saw a check made out to Holiday's company from a foreign country (and this was obviously corruption as well). Holiday's superior just tells Pope that the company under investigation is Pope's, not his.</p>
<p>Barnes meanwhile follows around Prince Nasir, who has Woodman in his company. While checking into the hotel that Nasir is staying at, Barnes goes to the elevator to find Nasir, Woodman, and two bodyguards standing in it. Nasir orders his men to make room for Barnes. Nasir makes small talk with Barnes, who te! lls the prince that he is Canadian. Barnes shortly leaves. He has lunch outside where Nasir is talking with Woodman and some of his men. Near the hotel, we see a worker open a back door for three men (these are the men who Barnes hired to kidnap Nasir). After Nasir goes up to his room, Barnes goes to his own room and looks out the window upon Nasir. The three men are hiding in Barnes' room, and they kidnap him by taping his mouth shut and rolling him up in a bag. They take him to the car and drive away.</p>
<p>Barnes wakes up in an old bathroom. Mussawi enters and asks Barnes what type of torture he would like: the Chinese water torture, his arm being broken and his face forced into his own feces, or having his fingernails removed. From the way Barnes is tied to the chair, with his hands tied flatly to a piece of wood across his lap, it's clear that Barnes is going to get the third torture. Apparently, Mussawi used to work for the CIA but has switched sides to Iran. He wants to know why the CIA wants to kill Prince Nasir. Barnes doesn't know what he's talking about. Mussawi then proceeds to rip off his fingernails one by one. Mussawi has to splash Barnes with water to keep him from passing out. He gets frustrated because Barnes won't talk, so he beats him up with his own bare hands. He says angrily, “We are at war! You are a POW! Talk!” He grabs a blade and prepares to decapitate Barnes when Mussawi’s superior comes in. He's not happy with what's going on, and having a dead CIA agent is not good news for Iran. He orders Mussawi to stop, and they all leave Barnes in the room, beaten and bloody. Barnes eventually wakes up and goes to a hospital, where CIA agents are sure that he spilled the beans on what's going on with Nasir. The CIA learn of Mussawi's involvement, and learn that he is planning on going public with the news that the CIA is trying to kill Nasir. The CIA decides to cut Barnes loose and leave him out to dry alone, claiming that he was acting out of his own agenda and that he is being investigated for the Tehran incident.</p>
<p>Wasim and his friends watch a video of a man talking about the event of his death, and what should be done. Elsewhere, Holiday confronts Danny Dalton with the corruption charges in broad daylight (while in public), which upsets Dalton greatly. He tells Holiday that corruption is how the country "wins". It keeps everything in check and safe. The only reason why they made laws against corruption is so that they can get away with it. Holiday starts to get a sense of what's really going on and leaves.</p>
<p>We briefly see a scene where Prince Meshal is celebrating his birthday on an expensive yacht. In attendance are several oil businessmen, including Whiting. When Whiting asks Meshal what he wants, Meshal laughs and says that he doesn’t know. Whiting gets after him for being so childish, ! and says that his brother Nasir will become the new Emir if Meshal is not careful. So he again asks Meshal what he wants, though this time more sternly and more overt in the answer he wants (he wants Meshal to want Nasir dead).</p>
<p><br />
Woodman talks with his wife in a park while their son plays on the playground. Bryan tells Julie about his new job, and how he's moving up in the business world. Since he's working for Nasir, he's going to get rich very quickly because Nasir is steadily becoming an influential figure. Julie asks him how it feels to profit off of the death of their son. Bryan tries to reason his actions and reactions, but she's had enough. Julie is going to move back to the U.S. with their son. Bryan will stay behind with his job, since that's all that he cares about anymore.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the Emir has announced which prince shall take the throne - it will be Prince Meshal. Nasir is obviously not happy with this, and expresses his anger towards this decision. He then gets into a discussion with Woodman about what the modern world thinks of the Middle East. According to Woodman, they think that oil is running out and that the majority of it lies in the Middle East. Nasir talks about how he accepted a Chinese offer for oil (and turned down a major American oil company), and how he was going to use the money to help his country and its people. He wants to give women the right to vote, help his people out of poverty, and not spend money on lavish things (obviously Meshal is going to do the opposite of these things). Woodman encourages Nasir to fight for his right to be the new Emir, especially since it is more logical than choosing Meshal and the people prefer him over his playboy brother.</p>
<p>Holiday is called from work to pick up his drunk father at a bar. He takes him back to his place to stay. Holiday later on goes for a jog and talks to some oil businessmen about the way things work (i.e. corruption again). Holiday returns home to find his father again sitting outside, waiting for him to come home. His father is angry at him about his job, and storms off. Holiday follows for a little bit and yells that he doesn’t want him coming back to his home anymore.</p>
<p>Barnes goes back to work and finds that he is refused access when he tries to gain information on Nasir. All the computers in his entire office come up with a message saying that he is being investigated. Barnes confronts Fred Franks ! at his home, asking why he's being investigated. Franks tells Barnes that he shouldn't even be talking to him, but tells him that he should take care of himself. We see that Barnes is being followed everywhere he goes. Barnes meets up with another CIA contact, Stan (William Hurt), who tells him that it was Whiting who was responsible for Barnes to be a scapegoat for the CIA. Whiting was ex-CIA, now current oil tycoon.</p>
<p>Barnes eventually comes to meet with Whiting in a public place, where Barnes threatens Whiting's family unless he gets back his passports. Through and after this meeting, Barnes has figured out what is happening and heads on a plane to the Middle East to meet up with Nasir.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pope tells Holiday that taking down Dalton for corruption charges won't be enough. He would need someone else, maybe someone "higher up in the food chain", maybe like one of Holiday's superiors. He agrees, and confronts one of his superiors with a corruption charge before a banquet is held celebrating the merging of the oil companies. Holiday then lets the charges against his superior and Dalton slide, since it would ruin Holiday’s job (his superiors would fire him if he went through with it). Thus the merger will go through as planned.</p>
<p>Wasim and one of his friends are selected by the Islamic group to undergo a mission. They are deemed "ready". Wasim comes across his father playing baseball in a field. He asks his father for some “bus money”. His father gives it to him, and Wasim hugs his father before walking away. His father looks concerned for his son. We see Nasir and Woodman with several generals and other personnel. They are all in support of Nasir staging an overthrow of power to claim the throne as Emir. Also in attendance is Nasir's family. Everyone gets into jeeps and start to drive across the desert for the coup. Woodman rides in the car containing Nasir. A man who saw the caravan leave calls someone and tells him what car Nasir is in. Next, ! we see the CIA is watching the motorcade through satellite, and are going to assassinate him (because he's going to overthrow his brother). Fred Franks is the CIA agent in charge of the operation. We also see that Barnes has arrived in the Middle East, is driving through the desert, trying to find his way to Nasir.</p>
<p>The celebration of the merger of Connex and Killen has commenced. Nasir's motorcade comes across some sheep in the middle of the road, and due to custom they stop their vehicles and must wait until the sheep move out of the way. While stopped, Nasir spends time with his family and plays with his kids. Barnes drives recklessly through the desert, desperate to find Nasir. We see a small celebration happening on an oil plant at sea. We also see Wasim and other Islamic extremists driving boats out near the plant in the ocean. The animals move out of the road, and Woodman (who saw Nasir play with his kids and remembering his own family) suggests that maybe Nasir should ride with family while he gets in another vehicle. Woodman and Nasir's family switch places in cars, and the CIA agents see this. Franks is a bit worried about this. Barnes eventually comes across the motorcade en route to the coup. He flags them down with a white cloth to get their attention. Franks sees this, but does not know who it is. Nasir’s men pull their guns on Barnes, but he urges them that he is not a threat. They all stop their cars and keep their guns on Barnes, of who desperately pleads to talk to Nasir. Franks orders a CIA agent to fire, and he presses down on a button. Their weapon is coming quickly over several miles. Barnes makes his way to the side of Nasir’s car, and Nasir makes e! ye contact with him. He remembers him from the elevator. He says, “You’re the Canadian”. Nasir’s car violently explodes, killing Nasir, his family, and Barnes.</p>
<p>What Barnes figured out was that the CIA was going to assassinate Nasir because he was going to overthrow his brother. Meshal becoming the new Emir would keep things the same and Meshal is easy to please with expensive gifts. If Nasir were to become the new Emir, he would have reformed his country for the better and would have given exclusive oil rights to the Chinese. This would block out the US from their successful oil trade, and so by eliminating Nasir they ensure their ongoing oil trade along with the poverty of the Emir’s nation. Something else to note is that the American oil company that Nasir turned down in favor of the Chinese is the bigger oil company involved in the merger that Holiday was investigating. The bigger oil company bought the smaller one to get the rights to Kazakhstan, and the CIA is apparently involved with the bigger oil company.</p>
<p>We see the happiness that all the oil tycoons and businessmen are sharing at the merger celebration. It is also at the celebration that Prince Meshal is officially welcomed as the new Emir. Franks and his CIA agents congratulate each other on a job w! ell done. Woodman gets out of his car bloodied and covered in dirt. His ears are bleeding, but he appears to be fine. He sees that the blast was so powerful that it created a crater in the ground. It also killed some generals who supported Nasir. Woodman leaves the caravan and walks across the desert towards the closest city. Wasim and the Islamic extremists are right next to the oil plant out at sea now. Wasim’s friend, who’s steering the boat, breaks off from the rest and heads straight towards the oil plant. Wasim sits at the nose of the boat, and reveals the missing weapon that Barnes accidentally supplied them with from the beginning. He puts the battery in and switches it on. Wasim looks back at his friend and shares a moment before he turns around to meet his destiny. The boat crashes headfirst into the oil plant and the weapon explodes, destroying the oil plant and killing Wasim. Woodman returns home to his wife and son in the US. His son embraces him, but Julie and Bryan share an unsure look together. CIA agents clean out the office that Barnes had with them. We see Barnes smiling in a picture with the same people who would later kill him over oil. Holiday returns home from the merger party and sees his father waiting for him outside. Holiday welcomes him into his home.</p>

<p><br />
NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by Bruno.</p>
<p>As the opening credits come on, we are treated to the faint sounds of a man whistling briskly as he cleans what appears to be a dirty shower stall or something possibly of the sort. We can't see, it's rather dark.</p>
<p>At one point, the audience sees a pair of really bloody, filthy shearers or lawn clippers. It's nasty, whatever it is. We hear a door slam shut and the movie begins.</p>
<p>We begin by seeing a trio of young men, Paxton, Josh, and Uli (their Icelandic cohort who they picked up in France) leaving their European youth hostel. It's present day. They reveal right away that they're in Amsterdam. What's the first thing you have to do in Amsterdam? Well, go to a coffee shop, of course! And that's exactly where they go- but as it turns out, the place is just filled with other Americans also taking bong hits and laughing hysterically. Josh thinks it's sad that he's come all the way to Europe just to smoke pot, when that's all they did back in college. The men depart for a disco/techno club.</p>
<p>It becomes readily evident that all the men have done in Europe is tried unsuccessfully to pick up women. Their quest continues here, as they start hitting on some smoking' hot Dutch girls. Everything is going well till Josh whips some cash out of his fanny pack, putting the nail in his coffin. Undeterred, Josh gives his fanny pack to a perturbed Paxton, and proceeds to approach another smiling girl. Unfortunately, he spills a drink onto another girl, and her boyfriend picks a fight. Needless to say, the two are thrown out the club... Somehow, Uli is with them again (we saw Uli not five minutes ago banging a girl and taking pictures of the act with his cell phone). But whatever.</p>
<p>The three guys, Paxton, Josh, and Uli, tour Amsterdam's infamous "Red Light District" maybe looking to buy some action. Josh, with whom we've been sympathizing for quite some time, says he'd rather not. We are then inside the brothel as there are multiple silhouettes of people in lewd acts streaming in through various doorways. One of these appears to be a guy getting beaten up, but it's only some guy getting a bondage treatment. Josh gets out the room, but there in the hall are his two buds, obviously finished with whatever they were up to. They go into the bondage room, while Josh ventures to whence his friends came. In the room at the end of the hall, there's a beautiful prostitute washing her hands. We see her take off her bra (this movie teeters on soft-core porn pretty regularly), but as she turns around, Josh is gone.</p>
<p>The three are once again reunited. They stumble back to their hostel, but, alas, it's after curfew and they're locked out. They yell, but some disgruntled neighbors drive them away to a nearby flat, owned by a friend of Uli's. Uli is a drifter, you understand. As the guys enter the apartment, we are greeted with the sight of two people having sex on the couch, while no one else seems to care. They meet the owner of the house, Alex, who has a weird black mark on his lip and just looks generally eccentric and rather odd. They explain to Alex the situation, and their intention to hit Barcelona, where the girls are supposedly stunning. Alex sees right through the American's story, as it is obvious that neither of them has gotten laid but once on this trip. He tells them of this mythical hostel, whose whereabouts are known only by word of mouth and those in the know, where one can get the best pussy of all time. Incredulous, the guys pass, but then Alex busts out the digital camera. HOLY CRAP. Basically just pictures of three to four naked chicks lying on top of each other, with Alex periodically sandwiched in with them. The guys are sold right there.</p>
<p>So, they're on the train headed for the hostel, which is said to be "East of Bratislava", for what it's worth. Obviously an eastern-European town that was once a prototypical Soviet village. On the train, they run into a dutch businessman with a briefcase and upscale dress. The man is actually very eerie as he eats his salad with his fingers, telling the boys that it is his way of communing with nature, that people have lost touch. At this point, the man makes a move on Josh, to which Josh completely flips, predictably. The guy gets up and leaves.</p>
<p>The train pulls in, the guys get off, and the town is gorgeous. They go straight to the Hostel, and get a room. Another comedic moment: as they walk in, these five guys are watching the execution scene from /Pulp Fiction/, making just about everyone in the theater laugh. Needless to say, the woman behind the counter is stunning, and the camera's eye mimics that of the men, checking her out completely as she turns to get their key. Paxton wants private rooms, but apparently they'll have to share the room, as it's semi-private. When they go in their room, however, the story is completely different as we see two women, Svetlana and Natalya, both of whom could pass for models changing in full view of the guys. They seem to enjoy the guys' presence, and invite them to the spa. The spa? In a youth hostel? The next shot is a wide pan of the spa, and we are treated to the sight of a dozen or so naked, utterly incredible women bathing in the hot steam. In an adjacent sauna, we see the two beauties from before, topless thank God. The guys go in and make small talk, and are invited to another club that evening, and decide to go.</p>
<p>The next shot is of inside the club, which is probably the cheapest, worst set I've ever seen in a movie, but it's filmed such that it looks almost realistic. The guys are dancing, doing X and what not, and old Uli is up there partying it up with the chick from the front desk. Paxton has Svetlana while Josh gets Natalya, who I think is way hotter. They're both incredible, though. Josh's asthma picks up, though, when Natalya blows cigarette smoke in his face, and he has to step outside for a few inhaler puffs. Once their, in the semi-darkness, a bunch of street urchin kids come up and demand money. He doesn't know what to do and it's kinda tense, until the same Dutch guy with the nice glasses (the one with the salad) suddenly appears and throws coins at the kids. Josh thanks him and asks to buy him a drink, to which the Dutchman agrees. They go inside and resolve their differences, and supposedly this guy has a daughter. The two talk briefly before Josh rejoins his friends. Eventually, the scene changes to their hotel room, which aside from the fact that it's two guys having sex in relatively close proximity, is really, really well done. Tarantino obviously gave Eli Roth a few pointers on how to do this, cause the scene looks great.</p>
<p>The next morning, the guys wake up to find Uli gone. Both are pretty distraught when they see he's not at breakfast, and look around for him. As they walk along, Paxton describes an incident that happened to him when he was 8, when he saw a girl drowning but didn't do enough to save her. He says the screams of the dying girl's mother haunted him for months. As Paxton finishes up his story, the two see a guy wearing Uli's orange coat. Uli! They chase him around until the guy escapes into a museum. As the guys follow him in, it becomes apparent that it is one of the myriad torture museums in Europe. What might have originally been kinda tense and creepy lasts a good ten seconds. They basically just collar the guy at the exit without so much as a jump-scare. The guy isn't Uli but is very menacing and has a bad set of teeth. He tells them it's his jacket, and to go fornicate with themselves.</p>
<p>Paxton finally comes to the realization that maybe Uli just left, that things might happen here in Europe. As he's saying that, a Japanese schoolgirl who we saw previously in passing runs up to the two, visibly distraught. As it so happens, her friend is also missing, and shows them a picture on her camera phone. It's of her friend and Uli, with grim expressions, standing in front of a big smokestack. The word "sayanara" (goodbye) is written beneath in Japanese.</p>
<p>As the guys walk away, they get another picture message on the cell phone. It's one of just Uli, with the words "I go home" across the bottom. Uli's expression is odd, but kinda looks like the spirit in /Ghost/ who teaches Patrick Swayze how to touch objects. The camera kinda goes through the phone to Uli's head, which is disembodied and sitting on a table. The whistling guy is shown from the chest down in a butcher's outfit with surgical glove, a costume we'll see quite often. He flips shut his cell phone and walks down the hallway with the lawn clippers in hand, towards a girl in obvious anguish. With a little deduction we can determine that it's the Japanese girl's friend. This is the part from the trailer, with the toe getting cut off, though we don't actually see the cutting off part (instead, we see Svetlana clipping her nail, nice segue).</p>
<p>The two guys are pretty freaked out from the picture, but see the girls. They invite them to go back to the club, and they agree.</p>
<p>Back at the disco, we the audience are shown two things: Josh is obviously really affected by Uli's disappearance; and there are some disquieting goons lurking around in trenchcoats. While Paxton is having fun dancing, Josh just basically gets sloshed and goes back to his hotel room. When he gets there, the hot front desk girl who Uli was getting with earlier helps him to his room, and lies him down on the same bed from which Uli disappeared. As he passes out, we see a pair of male shoes emerge in the doorway. Menacing.</p>
<p><br />
Back to the club, Paxton is sitting with the two girls, pissed that they're gossiping about him in an eastern bloc language he doesn't understand (he does speak German, though). He goes to the bathroom, but when he gets there it's just a storage room that locks behind him. He eventually passes out after pounding on the door to no avail.</p>
<p>As he passes out, we suddenly see what appears to be the interior of a prison cell or shower or something. We can only see the surroundings through a tiny eye hole in the top-left of the screen, but see plenty. The room is rectangular, with a door at the far side and low shelves on the adjacent walls. On these shelves are surgical implements, garden tools, and nasty stuff of various size. On the other side of the room are hatches, hammers, machetes, chainsaws and pistols. Lovely. We see a man come in, wearing the same costume as the guy before. This is all very claustrophobic, since it's behind the little peephole. The bag is removed from Josh's head, and he starts screaming at the guy. He didn't do anything, please don't hurt me, that sort of thing. The guy isn't phased, but rather peruses all the worrisome implements laid out neatly on the tables. He picks up a large drill, with a long skinny bit, and revs it slightly to Josh's horror. He comes over to Josh and pushes it into his flesh as Josh screams. Eventually, he backs off and we see there are six holes with blood pouring out, four on his chest forming a large square, and two right above his knees. By the way, Josh is in handcuffs and shackled to the chair upon which he sits.</p>
<p>The torturer grabs a scalpel, which I think is one of the grossest things in existence, and takes off his surgeon's mask. As he's doing this, Josh pukes in the background. The surgeon's the guy from before, who Josh shared a drink with. He grabs a scalpel and goes on a long-winded monologue about life and connecting with nature, how he wanted to be a surgeon but was denied, and instead got rich in business. The guy's obviously psychopathic and drunk with power and ego, but it doesn't matter since he's the one with the knife. After his speech, he gets up and we hear some pretty disgusting noises of flesh getting sliced. He unshackles Josh, opens the door, and tells him he's free to go. Though in real life he'd probably be passed out from sleep deprivation, blood loss, hangover, massive induced trauma and pain, he gets up gratefully. When he does this, the camera cuts to his heels, where both of his Achilles tendons have been slashed wide open and he tumbles to the ground. The Dutch guy comes back in, grabs his feet and puts him back in the chair, where he slices Josh's throat open with the scalpel.</p>
<p>The entire scope of the film now flips to Paxton, who stumbles out of the club and returns to the Hostel. He asks the guy behind the counter for his room key, but he's supposedly checked out. His bag is with the clerk and there's no sign of Josh. He's creeped out, but goes to the room where he sees to girls exactly as before. Except, it's not Svetlana and Natalya, just two girls who look similar and act identically. They even ask him to join the spa. He's freaked out now, and gives the clerk an earful. Also, we notice that the Japanese girl is gone.</p>
<p>Paxton goes to the police station, where the cop has a distinct face with baggy eyes. He tells Paxton there's really nothing he can do but wait back at the Hostel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paxton wanders the town, where he sees a familiar orange smokestack. He compares the smokestack with the one in the picture, and they match. As he dials a number to try Josh's cell again, those damn street urchins grab it away from him and take off. Paxton runs one of them down and starts choking him, but lets go. He trudges on under a bridge, and sees Natalya walk into a bar. He follows her in up the stairs, where it's her and Svetlana talking with one of those goons from before. Paxton's pissed, and wants to know where Josh is. The girls explain to him, through bad English and worse acting, that he went to an art exhibit. He demands to see it, and Natalya agrees and goes with him. Svetlana, interestingly, tries for a second to prevent it, and tells him to instead have a drink, but Paxton is adamant. Svetlana doesn't come with, saying she's already seen that show.</p>
<p>Natalya and Paxton ride in the back of an old black car of indeterminate make, possibly of Soviet origin (communist Russia made everything from wheelbarrows to cars back in the seventies and eighties). The girl keeps joking, but Paxton isn't having any of it. He just wants to see his friend and leave. The car arrives at what must have been a munitions plant or factory from the cold war, now mostly in disrepair. A sentry post with an arm still remains though, and lets them in.</p>
<p>It's basically a complex of semi-dilapidated buildings with a square in front. Sure enough, the main building is a giant factory with that orange smokestack. There are a lot of similar black cars with chauffeurs and goons standing around. As Paxton gets out, he sees a well-dressed Chinese-American, who when asked "Is it nice in there?" responds with "Don't spend too much". Kinda weird.</p>
<p>Paxton passes a booth with an older guy inside with mutton chops, who tells Paxton that for him, the exhibit is free. Natalya and Paxton walk further into the factory, which is a complete dump of a place, obviously hasn't been used for anything productive since before the Berlin Wall fell. At this point I lost sympathy for Paxton, who is obviously too stupid to see he's being set up, which he obviously is. It's like the guy DeNiro fires in /Casino/- I just didn't feel sorry for him anymore.</p>
<p>Paxton walks down stairs into a dark, familiar hallway with Natalya, and continues on to the end of the hall. We see Josh's corpse being surgically operated upon by the salad guy, and Paxton freaks, calling Natalya a bitch. She laughs, saying she's getting so much money for this, that Paxton is really the bitch. At this point, some goons jump out of the woodwork and drag Paxton away. We stick with Paxton though, as he passes by room after room of people being tortured, maimed and beaten in various ways. It's both fascinating and disgusting simultaneously, as we only see each victim for an instant. Paxton is eventually put in a familiar chair, facing away from the door, in a cell much like before. He's strapped in, and left in the dark for about twenty seconds as we just hear him bitch and moan, screaming and such.</p>
<p>A guy comes in eventually, dressed predictably. This guy we haven't seen before though, and is skinny and tawdry. The goon tells Paxton to speak, proving that he's an American. The goon leaves, and the new guy picks up a pistol, waving it in Paxton's face. Paxton starts yelling at the guy that he's never done anything to him, that he doesn't want to die, but the guy yells back something in German. German! Paxton starts speaking German, and it's obviously the same things that he just said in English. The guy with the gun gets freaked out, and runs out of the room. The goon re-appears and puts a ball gag on Paxton. The new guy then gabs a chainsaw off the wall and starts revving it in Paxton's face. Like Josh, he throws up, but this time into the gag and in plain sight. Really nasty. The new guy kinda pities him and takes off the gag, and Paxton blows chunks across the floor. As he does this, the guy takes the chainsaw and saws off part of Paxton's hand, removing his ring and pinkie finger with lots of blood.</p>
<p>Since the chainsaw inadvertently hit the handcuffs, the guy runs at Paxton with the chainsaw, but slips on the gag and vomitous, comedically getting impaled by his own chainsaw. It pulls out his intestines, but he still alive. Paxton somehow manages to pry his chair off the ground ( only one bolt is holding him down?!?) and reaches for the pistol on the table as the guy reaches for the chainsaw. Paxton grabs the gun and blows the guy's brains out.</p>
<p>We then see the goon outside watching porn on a DVD player, and Paxton calls his name. The guy walks in to the cell, to find the new guy dead on arrival. Paxton takes the opportunity by turning around and shooting the guy point-blank. He undoes his shackles and grabs a hammer and his severed fingers, heading outside.</p>
<p><br />
Two goons are walking out, so he hides in a nearby closet. Now this part is really nasty: just as he gets in there, the door starts to open, so he hides on the bottom of this cart piled high with various human remains and body parts. Don't ask me how he managed to wedge himself under 600 pounds of organic, dripping material in three seconds, but he did. The cart is pushed away by the fat whistler from before, and onto an elevator. They go down six flights to the incinerator, where the whistler starts grabbing random parts of the cart and chopping them up as a butcher would. Paxton's fingers are lost, unfortunately.</p>
<p>When the guy leaves the room with a bucketfuls of body parts, Paxton gets out and clubs the guy, who's putting the parts into an oven. He heads back to the elevator gripping his hand, and hits the up button. About halfway up some guys spot him, but he keeps going. When he gets to the top floor (ground level), he is in what seems to be a dressing room, with several butcher/surgeon costumes hung on the wall. He checks the lockers, and finds a beautiful expensive suit with a pair of gloves. Once it's on, he notices a business card in his pocket, with the words "Elite Hunting" beside a picture of a bloodhound. On the back, there are three prices: $5,000 for Russian, $10,000 for European, and $25,000 for American. This sickens Paxton, who starts to run out but runs into a guy walking in. The guy assumes that Paxton is a paying customer just leaving, and starts on a rant of his own, saying how it's such a rush and comparing the different ways of doing it. He says he paid 50 grand for his client today, and Paxton just wants to get the hell out there. Interestingly, the guy has a tattoo of a bloodhound on his arm, identical to the one on the card, meaning there's an intense fraternity here.</p>
<p>Paxton runs out, and sees the policeman from before with the baggy eyes shaking hands with one of the goons. He finds a car, which miraculously still has the keys in the ignition (and a bloodhound on the key chain). He hears some blood-curdling screams from the factory. He runs down, though there doesn't seem to be any guards suddenly, and finds the American from before with his $50,000 dollar client (it's the Japanese girl with the cell phone). He's taking a blowtorch to her face, and Paxton shoots him. As he helps the girl, her eye is hanging out of her head, and she's screaming. He cuts off the eye in plain view of the camera, and pus gushes out of the wound. He unshackles her, and they run back to the car.</p>
<p>Paxton takes off in the car, the girl's face all bloody and nasty. They flee down several alleys and find a van blocking their way. Paxton honks the horn until a guy comes out and moves the van. As the van moves, we see Natalya, Svetlana, and Alex standing together. Natalya makes brief eye contact with Paxton, and he runs over all three of them. Svetlana and Alex are killed instantly. Natalya, bloody, looks up toward the car speeding off, and another car clocks her, dragging her away.</p>
<p>Paxton and the Japanese girl then get surrounded by the gang of kids while they're in the car. Paxton finds a huge bag of candy in the car and gives it to the gang leader. The kids let them pass. Then the goons roll up, but have nothing for the kids and even threaten them. More kids pelt them with rocks from above, then the gang on the ground beats them to death.</p>
<p>They eventually get to a roadblock and there's no one behind them. At the roadblock, the same cop from before is checking everyone's cars for signs of Paxton. He sees him for an instant, but as he runs to him, Paxton and the girl have run away.</p>
<p>They eventually get to the train station, but the place is crawling with crooked cops on the lookout. As Paxton tries to hide with the luggage, the girl sees a reflection of herself in a schedule case. Horrified, she commits suicide by jumping in front of a locomotive, spraying blood all over passerby. Paxton gets on the train and cries.</p>
<p>When Paxton arrives in a city that's actually normal, he sees the salad guy from before, and immediately recognizes him. He follows him off the train into a bathroom, and locks the door. As the guy's sitting on the toilet, the Elite Hunting card flips under the stall, freaking him out. He reaches down to pick it up, but Paxton slices off two of his fingers with a scalpel, again in full view. He busts through the stall door and begins to drown the Dutchman. It appears as though he may be dead, but the guy gasps out of the toilet and sees Paxton's face in the reflection of some metal behind the toilet. He's shocked and in awe, but Paxton grabs him and slices his neck open. He throws him back in the toilet, and exits.</p>
<p>Paxton gets back on the train, and it pulls out of the station. The screen fades to black, and the word HOSTEL appears on the screen over the tense music.</p>

movie trailer (apple.com)

<p><br />
NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by HorrorFreak889. who calls this film... "One of the most disturbing films of the year.</p>
<p>The movie starts off with the following appearing on the screen:</p>
<p><br />
This film is based on True events. Every year in Australia 30,000 people go missing. 90% of them are found in the first month. Some are never found at all.</p>
<p>The film opens in Australia of 1999. We see a young college man, Ben (Nathan Phillips) at a car dealer buying a car. He manages to get an old red station wagon. He pays for it, and then drives off. Cut to a beach where we meet two girls. Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi). The two girls talk about their upcoming road trip, which will last for 3 weeks. They are going to visit tourist attractions, but mainly, Wolf Creek Crater. Kristy teases Liz about how Liz has a crush on Ben. Liz says it's not true, but she giggles, indicating it is in fact true. Cut to Ben, Liz and Kristy at a huge BBQ party. Music is blasting and they are having a wild time. They all pour beer on each other and then jump in the pool.</p>
<pre>
The next morning, Liz wakes up on a beach next to people she doesn't know. She takes her top off, and runs into the ocean. After a couple of minutes, she dries off and meets up with Ben and Kristy. Kristy and Liz gather supplies for the trip. Ben starts the car, and they drive off.
</pre>
<p>The opening credits start, and for the next 3-5 minutes we see the three laughing and having a good, old, fun time. Night soon comes and the friends are tired of a long day of driving. They stop at an area in Halls Creek, to set up camp. They start a fire and start to tell stories. Ben tells one about an old guy driving down the highway by himself. Its late and he! is exhausted. The man sees a bright light up in the sky. As the man drove closer to the light, the light started to fade away before shooting up into the dark sky. The man's car didn't turn on. Liz and Kristy, now freaked out, decide its time to stop telling stories and get some rest. Next we see various scenes of some beautiful shots of the Australian midnight sky.</p>
<p>Morning comes and the group clears up their camp area. They notice a nearby trailer park and laugh at the fact that they are in the middle of nowhere. They get in the car and drive down the long highway. They eventually stop at a gas station. Ben fills up, while Liz goes inside to pay. Kristy tells Ben that Liz has a crush on him. Ben laughs suggesting he likes Liz back. Kristy walks away smiling and joins Liz to pay. As the girls pay, they are verbally harassed by a group of drunken men. As Ben is filling up the tank, he takes out his camcorder and videotapes himself making wisecrack jokes. The attendant shows up and Ben starts to film him as well. They get a good laugh together. Ben soon goes into meet the girls, who are still being harassed. Ben walks over to the guys and tells them to stop. One of the men stands up and wants to start a fight. Ben and the girls walk away and get into their car. As they pull out of the gas station, the camera focuses on a blue pickup truck parked outside.</p>
<p>As they travel down a long highway in the middle of the desert, they see a sign that says Wolf Creek Crater is right up ahead. They drive some more and find a large sign. On the sign it says you can only stay at the sight for 3 hours max. Kristy and Liz unload some supplies, as they get ready for their hike to see the crater. Ben comes along and helps. They start to hike up the hill for a couple of minutes, and they finally spot the huge crater. The crater is miles long. The friends stare in amazement. They run down the hill to the center of the crater. They set up blankets and relax on them.</p>
<p>Liz goes off on her on and Ben soon follows. The two go some place quiet and talk. Ben reaches in and kissing Liz. The two start to giggle and then make out. Liz then puts her arm around Ben. The three regroup and decide its time to leave since it will get dark soon. They hike back to the car and load it up with their supplies. Kristy notices her watched stopped working at 6:30 pm exactly. Ben notices his watch also stopped at 6:30 pm. (The whole watch stopping scene is odd, and is never explained. We just assume it adds drama to the movie) Liz puts the key in and attempts to start the car. Nothing happens. She tries again and the car doesn't start. Ben asks what the problem is, and Liz says that the car must have died.</p>
<p>“You probably left the damn lights on, so the battery is dead”, Kristy says. Ben quickly adds that the battery isn't the problem because no lights were left on. Ben and Kristy step out of the car and pop the hood. Ben adds that he has no idea what he is looking for. Ben suggests that they better get comfortable, because they are going to be staying the night.</p>
<p><br />
A couple of hours pass, and bright lights in the distance awake the three. Liz thinks its aliens, but Ben says he hears a motor running. A blue truck comes into sight and the friends step out of the car. They greet the man, whose name is Mick (John Jarratt). Mick is an energetic, middle-aged man. Ben says they are having car trouble, so Mick pops the hood and takes a look. Mick soon finds the problem and says some coils are busted. He adds that it can be fixed, but not until tomorrow morning. Mick will be heading south, while the friends are going north. This is an obvious problem. Mick says the only way to help the group is by calling a tow truck for them. However, the tow truck won't get there until the morning. Ben talks to Liz, who suggests that Mick tow them south, where Mick is headed. Ben agrees.</p>
<p>Ben runs up to Mick and asks if he can tow him and his friends south, to the nearest town. Mick agrees, and ties a wire to the group's car. As the two cars are driving, the three friends fall asleep. Hours pass and the friends are awoken by bumps on the road. “It feels like we've been driving for hours…” Kristy says in a nervous tone. Ben adds that everything is fine. Eventually, the cars stop and everyone steps out of the cars. Mick says that he is at his place, which is located around a junkyard and some coal mining caves. Mick sets up some a campfire and joins the group. For several minutes, Ben has Mick laughing. This is soon turned around when Ben asks what Mick does for a living. “If I tell ya, I'll have to kill ya!” Ben gets nervous, but is relived by Mick's laughter. Mick says goodnight to the group, and says he will have the car fixed by the morning. The screen fades to black.</p>
<p>The next morning, we see Liz tied up in a garden shed. She wakes up and takes a few minutes to freak out about the situation. The screen fades out. The screen comes back, and we see it is nighttime. Liz is still tied up in the shed. She finds a piece of glass, and cuts herself free. She climbs out the shed window and looks around. She sees that their car has been stripped of its engine and their sleeping bags are all torn up. Liz runs through the junkyard and hears Kristy screaming.</p>
<p>Liz runs up to a barn and looks in through the window. She sees Kristy standing up and tied to a pole. She is hysterical, and bloody. Mick comes into the pick with his sniper rifle. Mick talks about guns and hunting as he taunts Kristy. Mick stands a couple feet away from Kristy and aims his gun at her. Mick fires, and the bullet just misses Kristy. Mick reloads his gun with a haunting laugh. Kristy starts to scream again, and we see Mick start to pleasure himself to her screams. He goes up and starts kissing Kristy.</p>
<p><br />
Liz realizes she has to do something fast. She goes over to the junkyard and finds a bottle of whisky and a matchbox. She sets what's left of her car on fire, to grab Mick's attention. Mick walks out of the barn, and Liz sneaks in. Liz runs up and tells Kristy to settle down. Liz sees Mick coming back to the Barn, so she hides in the barn. Mick comes in and continues kissing Kristy. Liz pops out with the sniper rifle and shoots Mick in the neck. This causes Mick to fall to the floor. Liz unties Kristy and the two make a run for it.</p>
<p>They come across the blue truck and climb in. There are no keys. Liz runs back to Mick's body and finds the keys. She runs back, and starts the car. They speed away. Liz looks in her rearview mirror and sees Mick coming up fast in a truck. Liz freaks out. Kristy tells Liz to watch out and Liz slams on the breaks. The camera pulls away and we see the truck stopped just in time before going over a cliff. Kristy and Liz climb out of the truck and panic. Liz says they can push the truck over the cliff to throw off Mick. The two girls push the truck over the cliff. They then climb over the ledge of the cliff, and hang on to the side. The two stay perfectly still and quiet.</p>
<p>Mick comes up in his truck and sees the blue truck over the cliff. He gets back in his truck and drives off. Liz and Kristy climb up the cliff and make a run for it. After a couple minutes of running, Kristy says she needs to take a break. Liz tells Kristy to stay put, because she wants to run back to Mick's place and get another car. Kristy tells Liz not the leave her. Liz says that if she doesn't come back in 5 minutes, Kristy should run off.</p>
<p>We see Liz reach Mick's place and she searches around. She finds a garage with over 15 cars from tourists. Liz searches around and finds buckets of belongings from the tourists. Liz finds Ben's video camera and starts to play it. She watches the video that Ben filmed while he was at the gas station. We see a blue pickup truck parked in the gas station, indicating Mick was there. Liz finds another video camera and plays it. On the tape, we see parents and children at Wolf Creek Crater. Their car is broken down, and Mick shows up. Liz finds a set of keys and matches them to the correct car. She puts the key in, and the car starts. Liz relaxes back in the seat, and finds Mick in the backseat. Mick takes his knife, and stabs through the car seat, into Liz's back.</p>
<p>Liz falls out of the car, bleeding everywhere. She crawls over to the garage door, but Mick catches up. He tells Liz he is going to put her head on a stick. He then takes his knife and stabs her in the spine. Liz's body falls to the floor.</p>
<p>We go back to Kristy, still waiting. She figures Liz isn't coming back, so she makes a run for it. Kristy runs through the desert, and onto the highway. After a couple of minutes of running down the highway, she spots a car. The car pulls up, and the old man lets Kristy in. The old man takes his cup of coffee and puts it on the hood of the car. We then hear a gunshot, and we see the coffee is leaking all over the car. We hear another gunshot, and the old man is now bleeding all over the highway.</p>
<p>Kristy takes the keys, and drives off. She speeds down the highway and Mick drives up behind her. Mick serves off the road and Kristy screams in joy. Mick takes his sniper rifle out and shoots out Kristy's tires. The car goes rolling down a ditch. Kristy climbs out of the car and starts to crawl along the sand. Mick shoots her in the back, killing her. He then takes her body and burns it along with the rest of the car.</p>
<p>We finally cut to Ben and see him nailed to a wall, in the position of Jesus Christ. Ben looks over, and sees a body of a tourist also nailed to the wall. The body has a thorn crown on its head. We then see some very vicious dogs in cages. Ben looks back at the body, and sees that the dogs chewed up the body's legs. Ben eventually pulls his body off of the wall and runs out. He sees that he was in a cave. Ben then runs through the desert. He soon comes to a highway and collapses on the side. We see a car pull up to him. Out step two tourists and they bring Ben to a hospital.</p>
<p>The following appears on the screen:</p>
<p>The bodies of Kristy and Liz were never found. Ben went to court with the whole situation, unfortunately the cases was dismissed due to lack of witness'. Ben was then questioned by the police for 4 months, and then set free. Ben now lives in South Australia.</p>
<p>The final shot is of Ben at Liz and Kristy's funeral.</p>

movie trailer (apple.com )
</pre>
<p>NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by John from Alexandria, VA who says "...this movie is a very good movie. It is not a war movie. It's a drama that is in the setting of a war. There is little action. It was a little light hearted from the book (which was very dark), however still pretty loyal to it."</p>
<p>The movie starts with Swofford or Swoff (Jake Gylenhall) in Basic training. It is sort of like a lighter hearted version of the first scene in Full Metal Jacket. Swoff manages to piss off his Drill Sergeant, and gets his head smashed into a wall. Swoff comes from a military family, his father and uncle served in Nam, however he doesn't mention them much, indicating a troubled childhood</p>
<p>The next scene we see is Swoff being assigned to his platoon. We see the platoon members are “Branding” a person. They then see Swoff and wrestle him to the ground, and start heating up a brand and touch it to his leg. He passes out and when he comes to he sees there is no burn. A member of the platoon Troy (Peter Starsgard) says they switched the brand, and it's a thing they do to mess with the new guys.</p>
<pre>
Swoff, then fakes the stomach flu by drinking laxative, to get away from his platoon mates. Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) find him over a toilet, and says that he has been selected to try out for the STA (pronounced STAY) platoon, the sniper platoon. Swoff agrees.
</pre>
<p>Sykes then asks Swoff if he plays any instruments. Swoff says he used to play the trumpet. At the STA indoc, Sykes has Swoff stand in formation and embarrassingly mimics playing the trumpet with his mouth. Sykes then proceeds to instruct and test 80 marines in being a sniper. Only 8 will pass, which includes Troy and Swoff.</p>
<p>When they finish indoc, the Gulf War starts. The men watch Apocalypse Now and in the middle of the Chopper scene the marines are all informed that they will be going to war. They are flown into Saudi Arabia on a civilian jet. One of the marines, Fowler (Evan Jones), hits on a stewardess. When they get on the ground the Colonel Kazinski (Chris Cooper) tells them about Saddam, and his use of poison gas. He shows them a picture of a kid who was killed with mustard gas (or some other blister agent) and that the Iraqis have been fighting Iran since the 1980s. The colonel then tells them that they will await orders to fight the Iraqis, however their current job is to guard the Saudis. The men are all gung ho.</p>
<p>The STA, then deploys to its new home, a tent city somewhere in the desert. While they are unpacking their gear Swoff takes out two pictures of his girlfriend, Christina. The other guys take the pictures and ogle them. Fowler says she is probably screwing around. Escobar shows off pictures of his pregnant wife. Then Sykes then comes in and makes them put on their, NBC suits (Nuclear Biological and Chemical protection) and makes them take a run in them, not a fun thing to do in the desert. The STA goes and proceeds to train and are forced to drink water in formation to avoid dehydration.</p>
<p><br />
However, boredom soon sets in. Swoff looks at a post board with pictures of women who were unfaithful to their boyfriends/husbands. Fowler tells Swoff that Christina will be on there soon, but Swoff doesn't believe it. Sykes tells the STA that reports are coming and they are restricted in what they can tell them. One of the men pipes up about this being censorship, however Sykes said they signed away that right when they joined the Corp. Anything bad they say to the reporters will have repercussions on Sykes and therefore the rest of the platoon. The reports then do one on one interviews and the men pretty much say the same thing, they miss people at home, they are proud to be here etc. Swoff says he is afraid, but not that seriously (They made a little about this in the movie trailer)</p>
<p>The reporters are talking to Sykes about operating in a chemical environment. Sykes shows them the NBC gear while Swoff is tossing around a football with another member of the STA. Swoff then realizes that Sykes is going to make them play football in the NBC gear, its 112 degrees, and tries to get rid of the football but its too late. Sykes then proceeds to do that and the men play football in the suits. Sykes brings out canteens, to demonstrate how they can drink in such an environment, however the men protest scene some of their gas masks are broken. Sykes tells them to finish the football game and the men then do a "fieldfuck" where they simulate having sex with each other. Sykes embarrassed hurries the reporters away.</p>
<p>The platoon's punishment is building a sandbag pyramid in the rain. (It does rain in the desert, just not much). Sykes tells them that they are going to the rear, with air-conditioning and showers, after they take the pyramid down. Before they go to the rear, Swoff gets a letter from Christina, telling him she met a guy, a hotel desk clerk, who is a good listener.</p>
<p>When Swoff gets to the rear he calls Christina, who tells him that nothing is going on, however he knows that there is. He has a weird dream about her, and he then vomits sand. Troy wakes him up, telling him he was making weird sounds. The men go and watch a movie sent from home, the movie is supposed to be the movie the Dear Hunter; however there is amateur porn instead. The owner of the tape realizes the people on the tape are his wife and his neighbor screwing, and breaks down, Troy comforts him. He wants to go home to try to fix things. When the tape is over, Swoff proceeds to rewind the tape, to watch it again, but Troy stops him. He asks him why he was going to do that, and Swoff says he wants to see it because of Christina, and he feels that see infidelity would help him. Troy takes him out for a run.</p>
<p>When they get back, Swoff goes to a desk clerk who is writing love letters for his commanding officer. Swoff buys from him a 5 gallon can full of Hooch. Its Christmas Eve, and he convinces Fergus, (Brian Geraghty) to take his watch. The men proceed to party and get drunk. Fergus is cooking sausages with a camp stove and accidentally catches a box full of flares on fire. Since it was Swoff's watch he is punished. Sykes first makes him drink a lot of water to purge out all the alcohol he drunk. (They are not supposed to have alcohol in the middle East, an order which stands today, so not to piss off the Muslim hosts) and then he has to burn the shitters. The men crap in these barrels, which are filled with kerosene. The barrel is set on fire and the content is stirred. While Swoff is doing this Major Lincoln, (Dennis Haysbert) tells him to put one barrel back in so he can crap.</p>
<p>Swoff and Fergus are reassembling and disassembling their rifles. Swoff blames Fergus for what happens and loads his rifle and points it at him. Fergus is really scared that Swoff will shoot him. Swoff yells at him a lot and then puts the rifle in Fergus' hands and yells at Fergus to shoot him. He then throws away the rifle and angrily runs out of the tent.</p>
<p>Troy is not happy with this and on patrol tells Swoff to apologize. Some Bedouins interrupt them. The men take up defensive positions and do not know what to do. Swoff diffuses the situation by going up to one of the Bedouins and somehow manages to communicate with them. When the Bedouins leave, Swoff tells the men that someone shot some of the Bedouin's camels. While going back to base on trucks Fowler mentions what a camel looks like after getting shot. Some Arabs in cars pass them and Fowler makes obscene gestures at a woman in the car(she is covered in the hajib).</p>
<p>The men then are told by Sykes that they are going to war, and go to the border, awaiting orders. Sykes passes out antidote pills for nerve gas and tells them to sign a waiver. The pills are experimental, and some of the men have problems with that. Sykes tells them to take them anyway, sighting the Iranians and Kurds who children were screwed up by the Saddam's gas. Some of the men spit out the pills.</p>
<p>While digging defensive positions, Troy who has been relatively gung ho and a moderating force, seems to be losing it. Sykes calls Swoff over, under the premises that Swoff's signature on the waiver was illegible. Sykes tells Swoff that Troy will be leaving the corps because Troy had lied about a criminal record. Sykes wants Swoff to make sure that Troy doesn't do anything stupid. Swoff is pissed at Troy for not telling him about this. The men then brand Troy.</p>
<p>The war starts. The Iraqis shell the Marines position. The STA has the coordinates of the Iraqis' position, however their radio doesn't work. Sykes orders Swoff to go to the como shack to get batteries for the radio. The men at the Como shack are arguing and give Swoff dead batteries. Swoff doesn't realize this until he gets back to his position when they stick the batteries in.</p>
<p>The Marines then proceed to move on the Iraqis. The STA is mistaken by the Air Force as Iraqis and are shot at by A-10s. The trucks behind the STA are destroyed killing some people. The STA moves across a sand berm and see a road cluttered with destroyed vehicles (The Highway of Death). The STA looks around a bit. Swoff goes and sits with some charred bodies.</p>
<p>Saddam lights up the Kuwaiti oil wells. The STA sees the ecological devastation caused by this as oil rains on the area and on them. They initially encamp in a place where it is raining oil, however Sykes pulls them away to a place away from the oil rain. Here Fowler is digging a position away from the STA. Troy, Swoff and Fergus see that he has mutilated a dead Iraqi, and is a little unhinged. Swoff goes to bury the body and Sykes helps him. Sykes tells Swoff that he loves his job and that pretty much he is a lifer.</p>
<p>Sykes chooses Swoff and Troy for a special mission. The Colonel has an airfield with 700 Iraqis on it. He wants Swoff and Troy to kill the two commanding officers so the rest will surrender. Swoff and Troy get in a very good shooting hide, and find the officers. They get permission to shoot the officers however, Major Lincoln at the last second tells them to stop. He is calling in an air strike, mostly because it is probably the only time he can do it. Troy protests because he has authorization from the Colonel and that this is his kill. However Swoff restrains him and the air strike destroys the airfield.</p>
<p>Troy and Swoff talk about what will happen to Troy after they get back. Troy will be kicked out of the Corp when they get back. They realize that their pickup never comes for them and they walk to their battalion's encampment. They hear gunfire and believe that there is an attack however they instead find a party. The war is over and no one told them. The men never got to fire their weapons in combat and instead are firing into the sky.</p>
<p>The marines come home, and a Vietnam vet, who looks homeless, thanks the men for pretty much "exorcising the ghosts of nam". Swoff goes to see Christina and we see them officially separate.</p>
<p>The movie shows what happens to various marines afterward. Fowler is making out with a woman in the bar. One of the marines is an executive in a board meeting. One of the Hispanic marines (Cortez) is working in a supermarket. Escobar is with his family. Sykes is still in the Marines, now in Iraq. Fergus comes to Swoff's door with the bad news that Troy is dead. They go to his funeral; we do not know how Troy died.</p>
<p>Swoff is now out of the marines, but he still feels affinity for all marines.</p>

<p>NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by TheImmaculateOne.</p>
<p>The movie begins with Josie Aimes (Charlize Theron) being questioned in court by a female attorney. The questions are pertaining to her past. Thus, we see several scenes of the things that happened to her before she started working at the mine.</p>
<p>The first scene is of Josie on the kitchen floor, lying down helplessly. She gets up slowly and her bloody and black-eyed face is revealed. We then see her taking her daughter, Karen in her arms and going to the car. Her teenaged son, Sam follows her and is complaining. Josie wants to run away from her abusive husband. Sam comments that "This will only piss him (the husband) off." Josie yells at Sam to get in the car. She says she can't take any more of his beatings.</p>
<p>Josie arrives at her parents house. Her mother, Alice receives her warmly. Josie's dad, Hank however, is not as warm. He goes down the stairs to greet her, takes a look at her battered face and asks her if she cheated on her husband to receive such a bad beating. She tells him "I can't believe you're asking me this."</p>
<p>Josie's family (her kids and her parents) all go to church. After the service there is a pot-luck for the church members. People look at Josie with disapproving expressions and whisper to each other. Two ladies in the kitchen who are supposedly friends with Josie's mother discuss how Josie humiliated her family by having a child out of wedlock at the age of 16.</p>
<p>There is a flashback of Josie at the age of 16 with her friend Bobby. They are attracted to each other. They are shown skipping class and going out to the field to kiss and making out. A teacher catches them and punishes them with a whole day spent in detention.</p>
<p>Cut back to the pot-luck at church. Alice enters the kitchen with a plate of rice crispy squares and overhears the ladies badmouthing her daughter. She doesn't respond and just makes a comment about the rice crispy squares and how they are being consumed so quickly. The ladies look embarrassed. They make a nice comment about Alice's rice crispy squares just to suck up to her.</p>
<p>Josie meets Glory at the church. (It's not clear whether they knew each other from before.) They go out for drinks and play darts at a bar. Glory offers Josie an opportunity to work at the mine where Glory works at. Josie is hesitant. Glory tells her she would be making the same amount of money as her dad. Two men notice Josie playing darts and one of them try to smooth-talk the ladies. Glory gives them attitude and they leave. Josie tells Glory to lighten up. Glory tells her she needs to learn how to be tough if she wants to work at the mine.</p>
<p>At home during dinner, Josie tells her parents and the kids of her plans to work at the mine. Her dad disapproves and asks if she's trying to be a lesbian. Karen (Josie's daughter) comments "I want to be a lesbian." The tension on the table is broken by this comment. Josie continues to reason that she needs to learn how to provide for her family on her own.</p>
<p>While she is driving with her kids Josie fills out the application form. She takes it to the head office at the mine.</p>
<p>Josie then goes through a medical exam to assure her employers that she is not pregnant before she is hired.</p>
<p>At her first day of work at the mine, Josie is late for a meeting which is taking place in the ladies' locker room. When the meeting finishes, the manager makes a joke about what he heard from the doctor who physically examined Josie. The manager tells Josie that the doctor was really impressed with how she looked underneath her clothes. Josie is embarrassed and uncomfortable. A young, attractive young girl named Sherry starts laughing and says that the manager seemed like a homo. All the ladies laugh.</p>
<p>When they get out to the work area Josie recognizes Bobby Sharp and gets flashbacks of moments they spent together when they were 16.</p>
<p>The next scene is of Glory out in the work field. Glory is a part of the union and she has a superior position at the mine. She is tough with the guys and it is evident that they do not try to disrespect her.</p>
<p>At a union meeting Glory tells the other superiors that the ladies need a porta-potty out in the field because one of her girls got a bladder infection since she was prevented by her male superiors from using the bathroom.</p>
<p>Lunch time rolls around. Glory instructs Josie to check her lunch box first before taking it to the lunch room. Josie opens it and finds a sandwich and a drink--the stuff she originally put in there. Glory tells her she's lucky today, it could have been something else.</p>
<p>At the lunch table Sherry opens her lunch box and finds a dildo. All the men start laughing. Josie takes the dildo and makes a joke about it. She says "Well, it won't fart in bed or leave the toilet seat up. You might as well marry it." All the women at the table have a hearty laugh. The men around weren't impressed with the women's amusement. The ladies continue to socialize and Josie meets Big Betty and Peg.</p>
<p>Josie and her kids move out of her parents house and move into Glory and Kyle's home for a while so that they can have some time to establish themselves. In the basement Kyle shows Sam a watch that is really old and is worth a lot of money. Sam doesn't seem to be interested in the watch. He asks to Kyle if he can watch his TV instead.</p>
<p>Josie takes the kids out to an average looking diner and has a talk with them about her plans for their life. She said that from now on she'll be taking them to more nice restaurants like this one. Sam playfully makes fun of Josie in the middle of her heart-felt speech to the kids. The family laugh together and they are happy. After their meal Josie meets Mr. Pearson, the owner of the mine, since he was also eating in the same restaurant. He tells her that if she ever needs anything she can always come to him. Josie feels assured by this.</p>
<p>Employees of the mine go out to a bar. There is drinking and dancing. Josie is on the dance floor with Sherry, along with Big Betty and Peg. Glory and her husband Kyle are at the bar with Kyle's friend Bill White (Woody Harrelson.) A drunken and rude miner approaches them at the bar and pokes fun at Kyle since he is a stay-at-home husband and Glory is the one who makes the money in the marriage. Bill tells the guy to back off. Rude words are exchanged and Bill ends up hitting the rude guy and he falls to the floor.</p>
<p>Later on Sherry tries to pick up Bill. He declines and says she's probably too young for him. Sherry is persistent and says "You're not a homo, are you?" Bill is unyielding and continues to decline Sherry's offer to dance. Offended by this rejection Sherry gets up and says "You really are a homo." She walks away.</p>
<p>While Glory and Kyle are at the dance floor they notice Bill sitting at the bar all by himself. Glory motions for bill to come on over and ask Josie to dance. Bill shakes his head. Glory continues to motion to him to go ask Josie. Finally, Bill gets up and goes over to Josie, but he's too late because Ricky (another mine employee) has already stepped in front of him and asked Josie to dance. Bill sadly walks back to the bar area. While Josie is dancing with Ricky she drunkenly tells him that he seems like a nice guy. She asks him if he's different from the other guys.</p>
<p>At work, Josie continues to get a lot of attention from the men because she is attractive. But it is a negative kind of attention and they verbally harass her on numerous occasions.</p>
<p><br />
On one occasion, Josie is alone hosing off one of the machines and Bobby Sharp comes up to her and starts talking to her in a manner that makes her uncomfortable. Josie just walks away.</p>
<p>Josie's sacrifices at work seem to be worth it for her family. They are seen looking at a new house, hoping to buy it. Josie and her kids examine the house and then she tells the agent that she'd like to take it if he would let her put down a 5% down instead of 10. The agent accepts.</p>
<p>Next we see Josie present Sam with a gift. It is a set of hockey equipment. She also surprises Karen with a trampoline in the backyard. All three of them try out the trampoline and they seem so happy as a family.</p>
<p>At work, Sherry and Josie are cleaning tar off the walls with hoses. There is graffiti on the wall of a stick figure giving a blow job to another stick figure. Sherry's name is also written on the wall with an arrow pointing to the obscene picture. Josie hoses it down.</p>
<p>One of the guys starts talking trash to both of them and Sherry banters back. Then he asks Sherry for some cigarettes. Sherry takes off her glove to reach for the cigarettes in her breast pocket but the guy says not to worry, he'll go get the cigarettes himself. He slides his hand in Sherry's breast pocket and feels her up for quite a long while. Sherry feels helpless and does not retaliate.</p>
<p>Josie goes to complain about this to the manager. The manager tells her that if she doesn't like the harsh reality of what goes on in the mine, then perhaps she should quit. Josie leaves the manager's office dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Later, the ladies enter their locker room to find the walls covered in obscenities which are written with feces. The ladies are angry at Josie for causing this by tattle-taling to the manager. Big Betty hands Josie the mop and tells Josie that it's her mess and that she should clean it up.</p>
<p>Out in the field Big Betty is operating a machine. She asks one of the men to help her with something. They just laugh at her from outside her booth. Then we see that they wrote graffiti all over the outside of her booth saying "Blow-Jobs for $5" etc.</p>
<p>Later, Bobby comes up to Josie and asks her to check out a machine which is located at an upper level of the factory. She goes up to the factory scared because she has never done this before and she does not really know what she is doing. When she reaches the top which looks out to the mine field Bobby shows up behind her. They have small talk and then he makes sexual advances at her. Josie rejects him and pushes him away then leaves.</p>
<p>Next scene is of Josie with Karen, Glory and Kyle at Sam's hockey game. Josie's parents, Alice and Hank show up but sit in another area. Later, Bill shows up and looks around for them. Josie notices him and asks Glory why she invited Bill. Bill sees the group and sits with them. Bill White and Josie get acquainted. They go to the lobby to buy chilli. When they get back to the bleachers, a woman comes up to Josie and asks her if she is Josie Aimes. Josie says "Yes." The woman then starts yelling at her, telling her to stay away from her husband Bobby Sharp. Josie is shocked and confused. Bobby must have told this to his wife to spread rumors about Josie since Josie rejected him. Then the wife tells Josie to stop throwing herself to all the other men who work at the mine because they're already married. The woman calls Josie a whore and walks away.</p>
<p>Josie is embarrassed and is shaken because everybody heard what the woman said. Sam, who was on the rink, stopped in the middle of his game and also heard what the woman said. After the hockey game a teenaged girl comes up to Josie and says "Mrs. Aimes I'm Sam's girlfriend." Josie is shocked to learn that Sam even has a girlfriend. The girlfriend tells Josie that Sam doesn't want to go home tonight and he'll be staying at her house instead. Josie does not approve of this and she storms outside and finds the girlfriend's parents car and starts screaming at Sam causing a big scene. Everyone stops to stare at them and Josie starts screaming at all the bystanders. She then opens the door of the car that Sam is sitting in and starts yanking Sam out of the vehicle. Glory yells at Josie to stop and Josie lashes out at her too, telling her "You're gonna tell me how to be a parent now, Glory? With all your personal experience?" Glory is hurt but ignores the comment. She and Kyle just walk away.</p>
<p>At work, the women experience more trouble as Josie receives more sexually harassing comments. Later, Sherry goes to use to porta-potty. Inside, she carefully places toilet paper on the seat, being concerned about cleanliness. Outside, the guys disturb her by rocking the porta-potty. Sherry hysterically screams for them to stop, but they keep on rocking it and end up tipping the porta-potty over. The men open the door and laugh at Sherry who is covered in feces and is crying. She crawls out of the tipped porta-potty and tries to stand up, still crying. Ricky, who is a nice guy, helps her up and holds her. He lets Sherry cry into his arms but he cannot do anything to the other guys.</p>
<p>Josie makes an arrangement to have a meeting with Mr. Pearson, the owner of Pearson mines. When she gets there they receive her warmly and let her sit down on the table with them. Josie is thankful and she takes out some crumpled sheets of paper from her purse. She says she wrote everything down to make sure she doesn't forget to bring up any issues. Mr. Pearson cuts her off. He speaks in a nice tone but he tells her that he understands that she wants to resign from the mine. Josie is confused and looks at the manager who must have misinformed Mr. Pearson about her intentions. Mr. Pearson continues talking and tells Josie that they normally require 2 weeks notice for an employee to resign, but they will make an exception for her and allow her to resign immediately. Josie cuts him off and clarifies that she doesn't want to resign, she just wants to talk about some problems that the women are experiencing at the mine. Mr. Pearson basically says this is how things run at the mine and he doesn't want to change it. He adds that if she wants to keep working at Pearson Mines then she would just have to be tough about it and stop stirring up trouble.</p>
<p>The next day at work Bobby is angry at Josie for her attempt to tattle to Mr. Pearson. Bobby attacks and roughly feels her up. Josie cannot fight back because he is much stronger than her and she is pinned down underneath him. When he gets up to leave she just cries. Josie goes to the lunch room and confronts Bobby about the attack in front of Ricky. Ricky is concerned and sternly asks Bobby if this is true. Bobby denies it and another guy covers up for him saying that Bobby was with him the whole time and that Josie is just a lying whore. Ricky can't really do much so he just takes a sip of his soda can. Josie walks away. Towards the exit, the manager approaches her to ask where she's going. She tells the manager that she quits.</p>
<p>At Josie's parents' home her father is disappointed in her again. Her mother tells him to lighten up, that Josie is still his daughter. Hank says that Josie has embarrassed this family enough. Alice defends Josie saying that "She had a baby, she didn't rob a bank."</p>
<p>Josie goes to the skating rink where Bill White is shooting pucks all by himself. When Bill sees her, she motions for him to come over. She tells him that she wants to sue the mine and that she needs a lawyer. He tells her good luck finding one. They talk more about Josie's problems and Bill is hesitant but he tells her that their best shot is to get a class-action lawsuit in which a group of 3 or more people stand together to sue the corporation.</p>
<p>At Josie's house she's holding a small get-together for all the ladies who work at the mine. There are Sherry, Big Betty, Peg and another lady. Sherry is also there to sell some of her beauty products. Sherry lets Big Betty try on some cream. Big Betty likes it and asks for the price. Then Big Betty says she refuses to pay a lot of money for a silly little face cream. Josie is concerned that Glory still hasn't shown up to her gathering. She phones Glory's house and Kyle answers the phone. He tells Josie that Glory is not coming because she's sick. Josie is persistent in wanting to speak to Glory. Kyle tells her she can't he hangs up.</p>
<p>At Glory's house we see that she is not well. She is pouring herself drink from a bottle and she can barely grip the bottle. Kyle, frustrated, helps her pour the bottle and sets it down on the table and walks away. Glory is even more frustrated for being helpless and she slaps her cup off the table causing it to spill on the floor and break. Kyle stops in his tracks but does not turn around.</p>
<p>Cut back to Josie's house on the same day. The girls tell Josie that they are not interested in joining her in her lawsuit because they don't want anymore trouble, they just want to earn their money and mind their own business.</p>
<p>Later, at Josie's parent's house Alice, is upset with Hank for being so hard on Josie so she leaves the house to be away from him and checks into a motel.</p>
<p>At a Pearson Mine Employee's meeting Bobby is at the podium talking trash about Josie and telling everyone that she is trying to shut down the mine. This gets all the men riled up. Josie enters the large room and stays at the back listening to what Bobby is saying. When he is finished talking the emcee asks if there is anyone else who would like to speak. Josie walks to the front of the room and says that she would like a turn. As she is walking all the men are "booing" her.</p>
<p>Josie takes the mic. She tells everyone that she does not want to shut down the mine. She just wants to go to work like everyone else and be respected. The men at the audience keep shouting obscenities at her, interrupting her speech. The men are making noise and telling her to get out. Then the emcee tells Josie that the 3 minute rule is over and he starts grabbing the mic from her hand. Josie yanks the mic back and says there is no 3 minute rule. The noise in the room gets louder as the men want Josie to step down and get out. Suddenly Hank stands up from among the audience and walks to the front of the room telling everyone to please be quiet because Josie has a right to speak. Hank tells the men that "Rules are rules. If you want to speak you can come up here and take the mic, but right now she's got the mic and she has a right to be heard." This quiets the men down for a bit and Josie continues to speak. The men listen to her for a short while but they get riled up again. Hank asks Josie to give him the mic. Josie refuses. Hank pleads for Josie to just give him the mic and Josie finally gives in. As Josie is about to walk away Hank tells her to just stay there by his side. Hank takes the mic and addresses the audience. He says that he considers these men his "brothers" and people who he can trust and depend on. He mentions that when there are employee barbecues and family parties the men bring their wives and daughters. These wives and daughters are respected by the other men and are not called "bitches" or "whores." Hank reminds them that Josie is still his daughter, so why are they disrespecting his family? Hank says he feels he has no friends right now. He adds that he is ashamed of everyone in the room, and the only person he's not ashamed of is Josie. Josie is touched by what her father said.</p>
<p>When Hank gets home he finds the note from Alice and he goes to the motel to get her back.</p>
<p>In the courtroom Josie's high school teacher is brought in to sit in the audience. A series of questions are asked from Josie about the identity of Sam's father.</p>
<p>We see flashbacks of what happened that day when 16 year olds Josie and Bobby went to detention after getting caught by the teacher. When their detention time is over Bobby leaves and offers Josie if she needs a ride home. Josie says it's ok. Bobby leaves the room before her. As Josie is about to exit, the teacher stops her and starts talking to her in a manner that made her uncomfortable. He also starts touching her. When she tells him to stop, he gets more forceful and eventually ends up raping her.</p>
<p>Bobby, who is now at the witness stand, keeps denying that it was a rape that occurred.</p>
<p>Josie's father lashes out and rushes at the teacher, grabbing him by the collar. Two bailiffs grab Hank and lead him outside.</p>
<p>Billy White keeps pressuring Bobby to tell the truth. Bobby finally says "What was I supposed to do?" Everyone in the room is shocked that he confirmed the rape charges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at work, more harassment occurs. Sherry goes into her locker and finds her sweater with semen on it. She starts crying and throws the sweater on the floor. She also finds her jar of expensive face cream tampered with and there is also semen in there.</p>
<p>Sam runs away from home for a while. Josie goes over to Glory and Kyle's house to check up on Glory since she hasn't been to work. Josie learns that Glory is really sick with Lupus. Glory tells them she hasn't seen Sam but hopefully he will show up sometime soon. As Josie leaves she looks back and sees Kyle and Glory being affectionate and realizes how much they really do love each other.</p>
<p>The next day Glory struggles to go to work with a walker, just so she can join the union meeting. The guys tell her she doesn't have to be there, but they are very respectful to her. One man offers to help Glory walk out, but she refuses and tells him if he treats her like a helpless person she is going to cry.</p>
<p>At Glory and Kyle's home, Kyle finds Sam in their basement checking out the old watch. Kyle tells Sam he'd rather give him money than have Sam take the watch. But Sam is not interested in taking the watch. He just wants to talk. He tells Kyle that he is angry at Josie because she lied to him about his dad. Josie told Sam that his dad died in the war, but really he is just a rapist.</p>
<p>Kyle tells Sam that he should be grateful to Josie that she kept him, that Josie could have given him away but instead decided to care for him.</p>
<p>Sam goes back home and finds Josie sitting on the backyard porch crying. She tells him that at first she didn't want to keep him, but then each day she grew in her belly and she felt attached to him. She said that she really wanted to be his mom. The mother and son hug and they resolve things.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearson's lawyer, who is a woman, advises him to go for a settlement because he wouldn't want other people to stand up and join Josie's lawsuit. Pearson refuses and wants to continue with this in court.</p>
<p>Pearson's lawyer approaches Glory at the hospital to talk to her about the case. Kyle angrily tells her to leave. Bill White also goes to the hospital and catches Pearson's lawyer in Glory's room. They have a short banter and Kyle throws both of them out of Glory's room.</p>
<p>Back in court, a helpless Glory who is sitting on a wheelchair starts tapping hysterically. Kyle stands up on Glory's behalf and says there is something she needs to say. Kyle reads the note from Glory saying that "I'm not dead yet, and I stand with Josie."</p>
<p>Bill White is happy about this and looks around to see if anyone else would be brave enough to stand with Josie also. Sherry is sitting with Peg and Big Betty. She is a little shaky, but eventually she stands up very slowly. Bill is smiling now. Josie is in disbelief. Suddenly, Josie's father Hank stands up also, along with Alice, her mother. Other men who work at the mine stand up slowly. Ricky stands up as well. Finally Big Betty and Peg stand up along with more people until there are about 20 people standing up in the court room joining Josie with her class-action lawsuit.</p>
<p>At the skating rink, Josie thanks Bill for winning their case. Bill tells Josie that Sam told him their family is rich now. They exchange a few words and Josie leaves. In the car Sam asks Josie if she will buy her a car. Josie tells him "Not just yet." In the middle of the road Josie stops the car and Sam asks what is going on. Jose tells Sam he needs driving lessons before he gets his car. Sam is thrilled and they switch seats.</p>
<p>Josie and Sam drive off on the empty road.</p>
<p><br />
THE END.</p>
<p>A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE</p>
<pre>
movie trailer (quicktime)
</pre>
<p>NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by Kristin. who says... "...this movie was incredible as was the acting..."</p>
<p>The movie opens with two men checking out of a motel. It is the middle day but it looks like they have been up all night. The older man (Goat) tells the younger one (Pup) to pull the car up to the front desk while he checks them out. (Sorry, can't remember if they even had names so I will call them Goat and Pup). Pup drives the car up to the office (about 50 yards away from their room) and waits. Goat comes back to the car, mentions that check out went fine, but had some trouble with the maid. He then orders Pup to get some water from the cooler in the back of the office for their drive west. Pup takes an empty milk jug and heads toward the office. As he is heading to the water cooler, the camera pans behind him and you see a man's body on the floor lying in a pool of blood, and then you see a woman's (the maid's) body also in a pool of blood. He seems unfazed by this, but suddenly hears a noise in the adjoining room. A little girl comes out of the room holding a stuffed toy and she is whimpering and looking at the woman's body – presumably her mother's. Pup starts to comfort her as he reaches behind him where he has a gun tucked in his pants. You see him aim the gun at her and hear a gun shot and a little girl screams.</p>
<pre>
The scene cuts to a little girl, Sarah Stall, in bed screaming. Her father, Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) comes in to comfort her. She tells him she had a bad dream about monsters being in her bedroom. Her dad tells her that there is no such thing as monsters. Then her brother, Jack Stall comes in the room to find out what was going on, followed by her mother, Edie Stall (Maria Bello). They all comfort the little girl.
</pre>
<p>The next morning everyone is having breakfast together. The son and father seem to have a tense relationship where the son keeps refusing the father's efforts to serve him breakfast. The father asks his wife for a ride in to town as his pick-up truck is still not working. The wife drives him in and drops him off at Stall's Diner. His cook is already there, as is a customer. They are having a discussion about the craziest girls they ever dated. Tom smiles and acknowledges them but does not participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Later that evening, Edie picks him up, says the kids are away and she has something planned for him. We cut to a bedroom with Tom sitting on the bed trying to get comfortable. He starts to take off his pants when Edie comes out of the bathroom in a cheerleader outfit. She says that since they weren't teenagers together they can pretend now. They joke about her parents being in the other room and needing to be quiet. They fool around a bit and then Tom goes down on her and she wraps around to go down on him. At this point several people in the audience gasp, pretty steamy scene. We then see them lying in bed together and Tom saying he knew right when Edie loved him as he could see it in her eyes.</p>
<p>So, more scenes filling out the family dynamic and intense love between Edie and Tom. Worth mentioning is that Jack, the son, is something of an outcast in his high school and one of the popular boys threatens to beat him up after Jack makes a miraculous catch to cause the bully's team to lose a P.E. baseball game. Jack stops him uses his wry sense of humor, but the bully still clearly hates this kid.</p>
<p>Later Jack and a girl friend are sharing a joint outside the post office on the main drag. They talk about how pointless it is that kids in high school go cruising and Jack depresses her by talking about how soon they will grow up and enter loveless marriages and hold down boring 9 to 5 jobs. The bully from before is cruising past with a buddy and sees Jack. He starts to pull an illegal U-turn to go beat Jack up but a car gets in his way. He yells at the guys in this car but stops short as the guy in the passenger seat (Pup from the first scene) gives him a rather vicious look. Now we follow Goat and Pup driving through the town with Pup complaining about these tiny little Midwest towns and how they have no money. Goat says he knows how to fix that.</p>
<p>Cut to an evening at Stall's diner, two kids are at a booth sharing an ice cream float, the waitress is joking with a customer and the cook at the grill. Goat and Pup enter and Goat orders a cup of coffee. Tom assessing the situation says sorry, we are closed. Goat then demands a cup of coffee and a piece of pie. Tom relents and pours some coffee as the waitress goes to cut some pie. Tom takes the pie from her and tells her she can leave for the evening. The whole diner is looking tensely at Goat and Pup as we watch the waitress leave. When she gets to the door. Pup stops her and locks the door. She is trembling and looks at Tom for help. Tom says they don't have a lot of money at the diner, but Goat and Pup are welcome to it. Pup then shoves the waitress against a stack of chairs by the door and pulls out a gun. Goat takes out his gun and says something like there was no question they would get the money as Pup starts to force himself on the waitress.</p>
<p><br />
Tom, still holding the coffee pot from before, sees that these guys are planning something far worse than robbing his diner, swings the coffee pot and hits Goat in the side of the head and jumps the counter, grabbing for the gun dislodged from Goat's hand. Pup turns at this commotion and aims at Tom, who has since recovered Goat's gun. Tom shoots and kills Pup. Goat grabs a knife from his boot and stabs Tom in the foot. Tom then shoots Goat in the head.</p>
<p>The camera lingers on Goat's blown apart head a second or two and then cut to police interviewing the folks in the diner when this happened. Everyone saying that Tom saved their lives.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing Tom in the hospital with his foot bandaged. He is flipping through news reports of his heroic actions. He is clearly uncomfortable with all this attention. Edie comes in to take him home and news crews are waiting. They go inside the house and Edie mentions that one news crew is still sitting there. It is a black Cadillac (or something similar, not good with cars).</p>
<p>Next day, Tom goes to the diner, which is now packed with customers. Everyone cheers Tom. Edie comes by to help with the new rush of business. The door opens and three men walk in wearing sunglasses and dark suits, clearly not from around here. Two sit at the counter. One of them, Fogarty (Ed Harris) asks Tom for some coffee. And when Tom drops it off says "Thank you, Joey!". Several exchanges of this kind and then Fogarty takes off his sunglasses. The right side of his face is badly scarred and he has a glass eye. He says maybe this will refresh your memory, Joey, you removed my eye with a strip of barbed wire. Fogarty talks about how Joey Cusack is a mob boy from back in Philly. Tom is confused but Fogarty keeps calling him Joey from back in Philly and is not dissuaded despite Tom's protests. The three Philly guys leave and Edie calls Sam, the elderly police office. Sam pulls the guys over as they are leaving town and tells them not to come back as this town protects their own. Sam then meets with Edie and Tom and asks about this Joey character and why these guys think it is Tom. Tom is baffled by this and says it is a simple case of mistaken identity. Sam mentions that he can not find any records on Joey Cusack, but there is a Richie Cusack in Philly who is reported to be a mob boss.</p>
<p>Next morning, Tom walk to the diner. He is sitting having a cup of coffee when he sees the black Cadillac go by. He freaks out and calls Edie, who is just waking up. He tells her to grab the shot gun, the guys from the diner are coming to their house. Cut between scenes of Tom running home, limping because of the knife wound to the foot and Edie dropping shot gun shells on the floor. Tom finally gets there and Edie is standing opposite of the front door with a shot gun aimed at the front door. Her and Tom hug and Tom takes the gun from Edie and puts it on the coffee table. Sarah comes downstairs, talking about going shopping for shoes and Edie takes her upstairs to get ready. Cut to the kitchen and Jack is sitting there with a what the %^&amp;? look on his face. Tom says he was worried about the mobsters heading this way and Jack wonders why he would run all the way home if they got the wrong guy.</p>
<p>Edie and Sarah are shopping. Edie finds a great pair of shoes and turns to have Sarah pick out a pair when she realizes Sarah isn't with her. She runs out of the store screaming for Sarah and sees Fogarty sitting on a bench. He points in front of him and Sarah is there, looking at the toy store window. Sarah tells Fogarty that he has the wrong guy and Tom is not Joey. She then tells him to stay the hell away from her family. When they get home, Edie tells Tom about Fogarty being at the shopping center. Tom gets worried, but Edie says she handled it by telling Fogarty off and filing a restraining order. Tom does not look comforted, but says nothing.</p>
<p>Jack and his girl friend from before are walking through the halls of their high school, when the bully comes up to Jack and asks if his big hero father is ashamed to have such a coward for a son and pushes Jack. Jack looks angry but does nothing. Bully says "say something funny now, coward." Jack turns and then beats the crap out of bully.</p>
<p>Cut to Stall kitchen, Jack is sitting at the table when Tom comes home. He yells at Jack for getting suspended and says we don't solve our problems with others by hitting them. Jack says, no, in this family we shoot them. Tom slaps him and Jack storms out.</p>
<p>Edie and Tom are talking when the black Cadillac pulls up. They both go outside and Fogarty is there with his two goons. Goon #1 gets out of the car, pushing Jack in front of him. Edie screams for her son and Fogarty says he will make a trade. Joey comes with them back to Philly and Jack gets to go free. Tom agrees, and Fogarty lets Jack go. Tom tells Edie and Jack to get inside the house. They run in, Edie sobbing and heading upstairs with her children. Fogarty asks Tom to step closer. Tom moves a few steps. Fogarty says no, a little closer. Tom moves forward. We can see Edie in the upstairs window crying. Goon #1 draws a gun and steps next to Tom. Fogarty says something like, now get in the car, Joey. And Tom suddenly grabs and breaks Goon #1's arm and smashes his nose into his head repeatedly. Tom grabs now dead Goon #1's gun and shots Goon #2. Fogarty takes a shot and hits Tom in the shoulder causing Tom to drop the gun. Tom starts to crawl towards the fallen gun, but Fogarty beats him to it. Fogarty is now standing over Tom and asks if he has anything to say. Tom says "I should have killed you back in Philly." Fogarty says "yes, Joey, you should have" and cocks his gun. You hear a shot and then Tom/Joey is covered in blood and bits of flesh. Tom looks up and Jack is standing there with the shotgun from before. Tom hugs Jack. [In the interest of continuity, I will keep calling him Tom, although at this point we know it is Joey].</p>
<p>Now we see Tom in the hospital with his shoulder bandaged. Edie comes into the room and demands the truth about who Tom is as she can not believe that a peaceful, diner owning family man would know how to kill men that quickly and violently. Tom tells her he was once a mob guy in Philly but decided to change his ways. He went to the desert, killed Joey and became Tom. Edie runs to the bathroom and throws up. When she comes out she asks if he is schizoid or split personality. Tom says he thought he killed Joey.</p>
<p>We see Tom taking a cab back from the hospital to his house. No one is there to greet him. So Tom goes outside to fix his pick-up in an obvious attempt to keep things the way they were instead of the way they have become. Sam pulls up and asks to have a word with Tom. Tom invites him inside. As they are sitting down, Edie comes in. Sam looks at her and says maybe him and Tom can have a talk another time. Tom says no, and Edie says she will stay since she is interested in what Sam wants to talk about. It is clear that Edie no longer trusts Tom and is incredibly angry and betrayed by him. Sam says – these mob guys are a secretive bunch and tend to stay hidden from public view; he has a hard time believing that they would expose themselves like this unless they were sure they got the right guy. Edie stares hard at Tom, waiting to see what he will say. Tom stays quiet. Edie speaks up, saying "Sam, you have too much time on your hands." Sam leaves, but does not look convinced.</p>
<p>Tom and Edie start to argue and he slaps her. She runs up the stairs and he chases her, grabbing her and pulling her down by the ankle. Just when it looks like he’s going to get even more violent, they kiss intensely. He pulls off her underwear and they have sex on the stairs. The only nudity is part of Tom’s buttocks, but the whole scene straddles the boundary between sex and violence. Afterwards, Tom is sleeping alone downstairs on the living room couch when the phone rings. It’s his brother Richie who says they have unfinished business. He says either Tom can come to Philly or he will come visit Tom in Indiana.</p>
<p>Tom arrives in Philly and meets one of Richie's men in a bar. The guy asks "Are you Joey or Tom?" And Tom answers "Joey." The guy then drives Joey to Richie's house as Joey coolly notes how nice the neighborhood is, how nice the front gates are and how grand the mansion is. The two go inside Richie's mansion and there are two other armed men there. Tom is frisked and then taken in to see Richie, who has Goon #3 and Goon #4 standing in the back of the room. [This scene and William Hurt are fantastic, you should go see it for yourself]. Richie says how angry he is with his brother Joey for not ever sending him word about where he was or how he was doing and Joey says that even though they are brothers, he thought Richie would choose the business first. Richie then talks about how Joey was nuts and truly a violent SOB, but how they are still brothers. He then mentions how Joey ripped out one of their guy's eyes with barbed wire and how this cost Richie his sure shot at becoming boss, and how it took him a long time to earn back trust to get to where he is today. Joey asks what he can do to make it better and Richie says "you can die" and turns his swivel chair around. Goon #3 approaches with wire tensed in his hand, and Joey sensing his approach, throws his hands to his neck in time to catch the wire. The two struggle and Joey breaks free and knocks Goon #3 unconscious. Joey and Goon #4 struggle as Richie reaches in his drawer and pulls out a gun. Joey shots Goon #4 as Richie starts shooting at Joey. Joey manages to get outside of the office and Richie looks around dumbfounded at how Joey managed to get away. Goon #5 comes in as Richie kills unconscious Goon #3 for messing up a perfect set up. Richie and Goon #5 head out to look for Joey. The front door is open and Richie goes out, only to have the door shut on him. Richie is all 'what the hell is going on' as he reaches into his pocket for his keys. He drops his key when he hears a shot from inside the house and as he is bending down, the door opens. It is Joey, who shoots Richie in the head.</p>
<p>Tom goes to the back of the mansion where there is a lake and washes the blood off him, his clothes, and then kneels in the water.</p>
<p>Cut back to the Stall's kitchen. Edie, Jack and Sarah are eating dinner. No one is talking. The door opens and Tom slinks in. No one says anything. Tom goes to sit at the kitchen table. No one says anything. More silence and then Sarah gets up and gets him a plate. More silence. Jack passes the roast. Tom looks up at Edie, and she slowly raises her head. She is crying, but Tom can see from her eyes that she still loves him. THE END.</p>
<p>THE CONSTANT GARDENER</p>
<pre>
movie trailer (quicktime)
</pre>
<p>NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by Jacqueline.</p>
<p>The movie opens with a black screen. We hear two voices, saying goodbye to each other. The woman is telling the man that there is no need to see her off.</p>
<p>Visuals are introduced, and we see Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), standing next to his wife, Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz). A prop plane stands in the background. They are in Kenya. Justin continues his goodbye, and tells Tessa to be careful. Tessa kisses him and promises to be home soon from Loki. Justin waves goodbye, and says goodbye to Arnold (Hubert Kounde), who is accompanying Tessa on her trip.</p>
<p>As Tessa boards the plane, Justin flashes back to when they first met. Justin was giving a speech in London as a member of the British High Commission. The lecture subject was on the virtues of diplomacy when he was interrupted by Tessa, who asked a series of questions related to British foreign policy with regards to Iraq, and whether diplomatic avenues were really exhausted before war was declared. Most of the crowd starts booing Tessa, and many start to leave. Justin, however, answers her questions – though somewhat ineffectively. The room empties, leaving the two alone. Tessa is upset at her outburst, and apologizes for being rude. Justin is gracious and they two end up going back to Tessa’s flat. They sleep together. Tessa tells Justin that he makes her feel safe.</p>
<p>Back in the present, Justin is in his office in Kenya, tending to a couple of his plants. Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston), a colleague of Justin’s at the High Commission, comes in with some bad news. He gently tells Justin that Tessa was found dead near Loki, with a black driver in an overturned Jeep. Dr. Arnold Bluhm was nowhere to be found. Justin’s reaction is understated and controlled. He thanks Sandy for passing on the news.</p>
<p>Another flashback, this time, Justin is packing up in his London office, presumably as preparation for his assignment in Kenya. Tessa turns up and asks that he bring her along. He hesitates, and tells her that she will need to be some sort of relative/family member to qualify. She asks to go as his wife. Justin is flattered by the implication that she has just proposed, but conflicted with the knowledge that the marriage is a means to an end. He agrees.</p>
<pre>
Back in the present, Justin and Sandy are at the morgue. They pass through a room with corpses lined up on tables – all African – until they come to a body with white skin. The coroner lifts the sheet and Justin recognizes the body to be that of Tessa’s. Sandy throws up. Justin’s countenance does not change, and we flash back again, to the days before Tessa left for Loki.
</pre>
<p>Tessa is walking through one of the towns/villages (my knowledge of Kenya is non-existent, so this is not going to be very accurate to what exists). It is a poor shantytown that lies alongside the railway track. Tessa is walking with Arnold, and the two seem to be flirting and also, at other moment, talking seriously about the project they are working on. There is a makeshift theatre, with a troupe performing. The subject matter is AIDs. A child comes up to Tessa and gives her a wind chime made out of bottle caps. She is delighted.</p>
<p>Tessa is pregnant and in the bath. Justin is playing with a camera that’s linked to Tessa’s computer (presumably used for a/v linkup). Justin returns to the computer and notes that there is a new email. He tells Tessa, who asks that he open it. Justin complies. The email to Tessa asks if Justin knew that Tessa was at the Grand Hyatt (or some equivalent) with Arnold. The implication here is that something was going on between Tessa and Arnold. Justin blinks and deletes the message, telling Tessa that it was junk email offering a free stay at the Grand Hyatt. Tessa believes him and doesn’t go any further.</p>
<p>Justin presses the Grand Hyatt and suggests that they take up that email offer and go for a free stay. Tessa demurs, saying that she was just there with Arnold and it wasn’t anything to write home about. Justin is shocked by Tessa admitting to being there with Arnold, but doesn’t say anything. Tessa hangs up the bottle cap wind chime and then asks if Arnold has thought more about what to name the baby. Tessa then suggests that they should name the baby Arnold if it’s a boy. Justin is taken aback, and insists that the baby will be a girl. They also argue about where Tessa is going to have the baby. Justin wants Tessa to go to the British military hospital (or equivalent) but Tessa insists on going to the local hospital.</p>
<p>Back in the present, Justin and Sandy leave the morgue. Sandy suggests that Justin put it all behind him, but insinuates that Arnold may have had Tessa killed because Tessa was cheating on Arnold with the driver of the jeep. Justin tells him it’s preposterous.</p>
<p>More flashbacks. This time, we are at a British High Commission event. Very fancy and well to do. We meet the Head of the High Commission – Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) – who is meeting and greeting several high level officials from the Kenyan Health ministry. Tessa decides to confront the small group with Arnold. They challenge the High Commissions motives, and accuse the health ministry officials of selling out to the big budget drug companies and endangering the lives of poor Kenyans who need serious medical help. Pellegrin’s staff quickly separates Tessa from the “dignitaries”. Sandy, who has witnessed the whole thing, seeks out Justin and asks that he “rein Tess in”. Justin refuses to, saying that Tessa lives her life the way she wants to.</p>
<p>We see Tessa, later that night, at her computer, with an a/v hookup with another woman, talking about how bad the situation is getting. Tessa says she is close to finishing up her report on what the big pharmaceutical companies are doing in Kenya and will be passing it along to someone at the High Commission.</p>
<p>We cut to Justin walking quickly through a hospital. He looks worried and harried. He walks into a ward, where Tessa is a patient. She is sitting up and nursing a baby child. The baby’s skin is dark. Arnold is sitting by the bed. Justin sits down on the other side and tries to reason with Tessa about going to another hospital. Tessa says no. She looks over at another bed where a Kenyan woman is receiving medicine. She tells Justin that the doctors are killing her on purpose. The boy standing by the Kenyan woman comes over to Tessa. Tessa hands over the baby she is nursing to the boy, who returns the baby to the arms of the dying woman. We then find out that Tessa lost her baby in childbirth.</p>
<p>Sandy arrives at the hospital. Arnold is requested to go attend to a patient. Tessa asks Justin to bring her some water. When they are alone, Tessa tells Sandy that the dying woman, whose last name is Kilulu, is being killed on purpose by the drug companies. Sandy is disbelieving. Tessa tells him that she has proof that the drug companies are testing their drugs on poor women in Kenya and not reporting the deadly side effects and women are dying because of it. Sandy still refuses to believe her, but Tessa insists that she has a report and makes him promise to pass it on to Pellegrin at the High Commission. Sandy promises.</p>
<p>Tessa indeed passes the report on, and we see her confronting Sandy at his house, asking if he’s had a response from Pellegrin. Sandy says yes, but only in form of a letter, which he is not allowed to share. Tessa promises to sleep with Sandy if he gives her the letter. Sandy agrees, and sets up a “date” with Tessa after her trip to Loki.</p>
<p>We cut to Justin working in his garden. He goes to the porch where Tessa and Arnold are talking, and overhears Tessa say, “… this is nothing but a marriage of convenience that produces dead babies.” Justin apologizes for interrupting, but Tessa goes into a rage when she sees the pesticide box that he is holding in his hands. She storms out. Arnold assures Justin that she will be back and asks him to be patient.</p>
<p>That night, it is raining hard and Tessa is late home. Justin is up waiting for her. When she comes in from the rain, Justin asks her to stop working on her project. Tessa refuses, saying that it is too important and they are too close. She insists on going to Loki the next day.</p>
<p>We then cut back to the scene at the beginning of the movie with Tessa and Arnold saying goodbye to Justin.</p>
<p>We come back to the present and move very quickly through scenes of Justin trying to figure out what Tessa’s work was about. He travels to London, where he meets up with her cousin, Ham (Richard McCabe) and nephew Guido (Rupert Simonian). Guido is a teen computer whiz and hacks into Tessa’s server and retrieves all sorts of documents and emails. Justin recognizes the logo of one of the companies Tessa was investigating – it is the same company (called Three Bees) that makes the pesticide he uses. Turns out that the company was distributing and marketing drugs that are manufactured by DHS (a big global pharma company) – and, specifically in Kenya, an experimental drug called Dypraxa. Dypraxa is a very effective against a new strain of tuberculosis (which is apparently going to sweep through the world, making Dypraxa a multi-billion dollar blockbuster drug if approved). However, Dypraxa also kills people.</p>
<p>As Justin retraces Tessa’s steps, he finds out that DHS and the Three Bees have partnered up to distribute all sorts of medicines in Kenya – but in order for those who need the medicines to get what they need, they need to sign a consent form that signs them up for the Dypraxa study. Justin also finds a love letter to Tessa from Sandy and fears the worst.</p>
<p>As Justin gets closer to what Tessa knew, he starts getting anonymous threats, telling him to stop before what happened to Tessa happens to him. He continues unfazed, and tracks down the woman with whom Tessa was having the a/v hookup conversation. The woman gives Justin more leads, taking him all the way to Pellegrin. Other facts come up, including DHS not willing to re-engineer the drug because of the hundreds or so deaths that have been caused by Dypraxa. DHS was apparently not going to report the side effects. One other important revelation was that Dr. Arnold Bluhme was gay, and therefore could not, in any way, have been having an affair with Tessa.</p>
<p>Justin flies back to the UK and meets up with Pellegrin for lunch. . It comes out that the British High Commission owed DHS a favor (after persuading DHS to open a manufacturing plant in the UK). The High Commission was responsible for brokering and protecting the “marriage” between DHS and Three Bees. Pellegrin then off-handedly mentions that the letter was regrettable. Justin thinks Pellegrin is referring to Sandy’s letter and agrees, but says it’s out of his control. Pellegrin says it was in a moment of anger that he wrote the letter and it shouldn’t have been written then. Justin then asks for clarification – and lies through it, saying that he indeed has that letter after finding it in Tessa’s diary. Pellegrin is shocked, “I didn’t know Tessa has a diary.” Justin understands that more eyes are on him than he had previously estimated.</p>
<p>Justin decides to go to Loki. There, he finds Dr. Marcus Lorbeer (who was administering drugs to the dying woman – Kilulu – in the Kenya hospital), who has been sent to Loki by DHS. We find out that he has a copy of Tessa’s report, and also a copy of Pellegrin’s letter to Sandy.</p>
<p>Justin mails the letter and the report to Ham, and sets off to the location of Tessa’s death. There, Justin imagines talking to Tessa, saying that he knows all her secrets, and how he wishes she had trusted him. She replies, telling him that she was only trying to protect him. He says she is his home, and he will be coming home soon.</p>
<p>We cut to the inside of a Church in England. Sir Bernard is giving Justin’s eulogy, saying that he committed suicide at the very place where Tessa died. He lauds Justin’s service to the High Commission and his love for Tessa. Ham then takes the stage and reads Pellegrin’s letter. The letter reveals how Pellegrin was complicit in the Dypraxa scandal, how he threatened to end Tessa’s life, and how he vowed to protect DHS at all costs. Ham also noted that Justin was killed from bullets from three guns.</p>
<p>We cut back to Justin, sitting in the middle of the desert, turning to face three men with guns – probably men from DHS, sent to finish the job. He turns to them with a subtle smile, and complete peace in his eyes.</p>
<p>FOUR BROTHERS</p>

movie trailer (quicktime)
</pre>
<p>NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by Marcus. (Marcus loves long spoilers)</p>
<p>The film starts off on a cold snowy night in Detroit. An El Camino car is following another car around town. The car they are following parks, the driver gets out, and goes inside a liquor store. Inside, we see the driver of the car is Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), a good-hearted sweet old lady. Evelyn is scolding a young boy for trying to steal candy. She tells the clerk to call the police, but we see that they are only playing with the little boy. The boy promises not to steal again, apologizes to the clerk, and leaves for home. Evelyn laughs about it and starts to look for a good Thanksgiving ham to bring home. The two people in the El Camino get out and burst into the store, demanding the money from the clerk. They are dressed in black and have hoods on. We can see that one of the robbers has a goatee and the other robber is obviously black. Evelyn remains unseen and hides from them. When they get the money, they blast the clerk away with a shotgun. They hear Evelyn make a noise and go to where she was hiding. Outside of the store, we hear gunshots and then see the two shooters running away.</p>
<pre>
The opening credits come up as Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) is driving back into town. He attends Evelyn's funeral with his brothers, Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund). Afterwards, everyone goes back to Jeremiah's house for the reception. Outside of Jeremiah's house is Lt. Green (Terrence Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles). Green grew up with the Mercer brothers, and is on good terms with them. He mentions that he's surprised to see Bobby back in town, as no one has seen him in years. Green proceeds to provide some background information on the Mercer family to his partner: All four boys were wards of the state. They didn't have any families and were constantly getting in trouble. Because no one would accept them in foster homes, Evelyn Mercer took all four of them into her own home and adopted them. Green goes on to say that Jeremiah is the only brother to grow up and leave his past behind. He even has a family and his own legitimate business now. Jack is the youngest family member, and is seen smoking a cigarette outside while crying. Bobby and Jeremiah get him inside where it's warm. Green says that Bobby is the oldest and worst Mercer brother, and his presence could mean trouble. Green also makes a note that the fourth brother, Angel (Tyrese Gibson), is absent from the funeral and reception.
</pre>
<p>In the backyard of Jeremiah's house, Bobby and Jack say hi to Jeremiah's kids. They mention that they are their uncles, but the kids tell them that they are white. Bobby tells them that they were adopted like their father. Green and Fowler go into the backyard and talk to Bobby. Meanwhile inside the house, Jeremiah talks with his wife about Bobby. She thought he said that Bobby wasn't coming, but Jeremiah said that he wasn't sure if he was coming. She doesn't want Bobby in the house, and Jeremiah reassures her that he isn't going to stay there. Green gives his regards to Bobby and mentions that some basketball player saw the two men run out of the liquor store, and that they are looking into it. Fowler is rather cold about the affair, having no emotional connections with the Mercer family. This prompts Bobby to tell him and Green to leave.</p>
<p>Bobby, Jack, and Jeremiah drive that night to the old Mercer home. This is where Bobby and Jack will stay. As they walk onto the porch, Bobby sees Angel sitting there. He gets after him for missing the funeral, but they hug and horse around with each other. Jeremiah opens the front door and it really hits the brothers that their mother is gone. They all walk inside and Bobby tells Jack and Angel that they will be staying in their old rooms, while Bobby will stay in Evelyn's room. Bobby goes to unpack his clothes and such while everyone else does the same except for Jeremiah, who goes to see if they have enough food to have. While in Evelyn's bedroom, Bobby notices everything is in its place. He goes into the bathroom and cries. When he leaves the room, he washes his face to cover up his crying. Bobby walks into Jack's room where he is playing the guitar. Bobby makes fun of Jack for crying, but its all in good faith. Jeremiah also walks into Jack's room and says that he is goi! ng out to get a Thanksgiving turkey. Even though their mother died, they should still celebrate the holiday. Angel also mentions that he is going out to get some fresh air. All the brothers laugh at him, because they can read him like a book. They all know that he is going back to "La Vida Loca", a local Spanish girl who used to be Angel's girlfriend. Angel says that he is not going to see that girl, but in the next scene we see him running with Sofi (Sofía Vergara), aka "La Vida Loca", barely dressed. They are running away from Sofi's current boyfriend, of whom is chasing them in his car and trying to shoot Angel. They escape safely.</p>
<p>Later on, Jack is cooking their meal while the other brothers hang out in the living room. Bobby makes fun of Angel for going back to Sofi, and tells him that he doesn't want her to stay there. Angel tries to tell him that he has real feeling for this girl, but the brothers make fun of him again. Jeremiah tries to watch a football game when Angel starts to throw some things at him, distracting him from the game. One of the things hits Jeremiah in the head, and he dares Angel to throw another one. Angel asks what he's going to do, but Jeremiah dares him again to find out what he will do. Angel throws something at Jeremiah's eye, and Jeremiah gets out of his chair and wrestles with Angel while Bobby is encouraging Jeremiah. It eventually ends with Jeremiah pinning down Angel, and them all laughing about it later.</p>
<p>Dinner is ready, and they all gather to the dinner table to eat. They say grace and start to serve themselves. Quietly they all look at the empty seat where Evelyn would have been. They start to eat. Jeremiah chews with his mouth open and looks at Evelyn's empty seat. He imagines her telling him to chew with his mouth closed and that he isn't a farm animal. Jeremiah corrects himself and sees Angel chewing with his mouth open too. He chastises him for it and says "what, are we on a farm?". Angel then imagines seeing Evelyn and her telling him to keep his elbows off of the table. He then tries to hide his tattooed arm, but Evelyn asks him why hide it. She then shows him that she has a tattoo and Angel smiles. Jack is having a hard time with the dinner. He stares at the table and gets really emotional with the absence of Evelyn. He imagines her telling him to keep his feelings under control and that everything is okay, and that he is safe. The only one who doesn't imagine Evelyn! is Bobby, who stops eating and says that they should all do "The Turkey Cup" now. Angel doesn't want to do it now, but Bobby makes him. The Turkey Cup is their annual hockey game that they play during this holiday. Bobby loves hockey, and so he got the rest of his brothers into the game as well. They play hockey with some other neighborhood friends. Everything is in good spirits, and Jack is working hard to get the puck. Jeremiah talks with his wife on a cell phone, but Bobby snatches it away, puts it on the ice, and smacks it away.</p>
<p>Later on, they all go to a bar and have drinks in memory of Evelyn. Jack gets really drunk and starts babbling on about how he gets girls. Bobby, Jeremiah, and Angel are clear headed though and start to talk about Evelyn's death. Jeremiah thinks they should leave it for the police to figure out, but Bobby and Angel tell him how corrupt the cops are and how they won't find the killers. The bartender comes around to them and starts to talk about how he heard the shooting was gang-related. Bobby wants to know what gang he heard was responsible. Jeremiah tells his brothers "don't call me when you are all shot up" and leaves. He wants to stay a good family man. After they all sober up Bobby, Angel, and Jack go somewhere and pop the trunk. Bobby gives Angel his favorite pistol and grabs a shotgun. Bobby gives Jack a tire iron and makes fun of him. He also gives some gasoline to Jack and orders him to carry it. They all go inside a place where a party is going on (this is where the gang the bartender was talking about is located). The brothers all storm into the place and shout that they are the police, scaring mostly everyone away. They fire a couple of rounds to get more people to run away, and make their way to the back. They get to the gang leader (Mpho Koaho) and douse him with gasoline. Jack fires up a cigarette and Bobby threatens to set him and his remaining crew on fire unless he gets answers. The gang leader says that they weren't responsible, but they know that the witness was lying about seeing the shooters at the liquor store. Bobby thinks he's lying, but the gang leader says that the basketball court lights go off at 10, and the witness says that he saw the shooters at 11, making it impossible for him to be playing basketball at that hour. The brothers take the gang leader for a ride.</p>
<p>They go to the backetball court across the street from the store. Bobby checks his watch. It's a little past 10, and the lights are still on. Bobby and Angel get ready to kill the gang leader when the lights in fact do go off. They let the gang leader go home and wonder why would there be a lying witness. They go back to the family home and discuss their findings with Jeremiah. Bobby makes fun of Sofi, who is by this time staying at the house, and gets her mad. Angel is not amused.</p>
<p>Sometime later, the four brothers go to Evelyn's lawyer. He says that even though he met her once, she left quite an impression on him. The lawyer gives the brothers her safety deposit box with her valuables inside. He leaves to give them time to sort out and divide her belongings. Bobby opens the box and sees a couple of envelopes with Jack and Jeremiah's names on them. The envelopes have their birth certificates in them and detail where they are from and who their parents were. They are happy to finally know, but Angel and Bobby didn't get any envelopes. Bobby searches further and finds a good amount of money. He splits it up evenly between himself, Angel, and Jeremiah. Jack wants some too, but Bobby gives him some jewelry and says that it'll look pretty on him (some more younger brother teasing).</p>
<p>The brothers eventually go to an abandoned parking complex which Jeremiah wants to redo and make his own. While Jack pees on the floor, the brothers ask Jeremiah about how he's going to get the money to make his dream come true. Jeremiah says that it's easy to apply for a loan and get money, and that he's 100% positive that money is not an issue. Later, they go to the liquor store that Evelyn died in and meet the owner. They view the surveillance tape of the incident. Bobby says that it doesn't make sense because they already have the money. There was no need to kill their mom. When it comes to her actual death, they see that she talked to them a little bit before she was shot. When they see it on the monitor, each brother looks away. The brothers ask the owner if he knows who was the "witness" that night, and he tells him that he forgot the name but he recognizes his appearance. He hardly ever wears a jacket, wears a basketball uniform, and has big hair. He plays basketball ! at the nearby community center. The brothers walk outside and Bobby is pissed that their mother was set up. They walk straight to the community center basketball court.</p>
<p>Once inside, they see that there is a basketball game going on. Jeremiah wants to know Bobby's plan, but he tells him that they're winging it. Jack says that they're going to get killed, but Angel says "what do you mean we, white boy?". Bobby sends Angel off in one direction and leaves Jack and Jeremiah where they are. Bobby walks onto the basketball court and takes the ball. A player tries to get it back, but Bobby hits him in the head with the ball and pulls out his gun. This causes a great deal of commotion in the crowd and everyone gets pissed at Bobby. Jeremiah runs onto the court too and tries to calm Bobby down. Bobby says that he's looking for the witness to the shooting, and describes his appearance. Jack is watching the stands and sees a black guy getting real nervous and making his way down the stands. He motions to Bobby that they got their guy, and Bobby thanks everyone for their cooperation. Jack chases the black kid down the hallway, and Angel comes about and corners him. They want to know why he was running, and want to know who the witness was. The kid says that it was his brother, and he's not telling them anymore. Bobby says "what a coincidence" and tells him that he's with his brothers right now. The kid eventually cracks and tells him that his brother's name is Damian (Lyriq Bent), and tells them where he lives. The brothers mention that they wouldn't give up each other for anything, and make fun of his bling bling necklace that he is wearing.</p>
<p>The brothers wait outside Damian's apartment complex in Bobby's car. Jeremiah has to leave because he has to take his little girls to their dance practice. Jeremiah leaves and they make fun of him. Jack, who's in the backseat, sings a little song and draws on the window. While Angel and Bobby talk, Jack thinks he sees Damian. The others look at the guy walking into the apartment complex and decide that he's the guy. They run out of the car and into the complex. Damian is waiting for an elevator when Bobby pulls out his gun and asks if he is Damian. He freaks out and shoots at the brothers, all of whom take cover. The elevator opens and Damian gets in. They try to get in too, but the doors close. Bobby and Angel take the stairs and order Jack to stay there and tell them what level Damian is going. Angel is not in the best shape and has to stop. Bobby keeps on going. Jack sees that Damian got off on level 6, and Bobby runs to level 6. Damian is already at his apartment, and sen! ds his rotweiler dogs onto Bobby. They grab and chomp on Bobby's arm and leg. Angel finally makes it to level 6 and runs off when he sees the dogs. Damian opens his window, ties some rope down, and begins to climb the rope outside. Angel comes back with a fire extinguisher and gets the dogs off of Bobby. They rush into Damian's apartment and see that he is escaping. Bobby says that they just want to talk, but Damian shoots at them. Angel shoots back, and Bobby cuts the rope with a knife, sending Damian to the ground.</p>
<p>Angel, Jack, and Bobby go outside and see that Damian landed hard. His bone is sticking out of his left knee and he can't move. Bobby threatens to leave him there to die unless he tells them why he lied. Damian says that he was paid off by some guys to tell the police the story. Damian, however, knows who the shooters are but won't tell the brothers. They all turn to leave when Damian cracks. He tells them who the shooters were and where he can find them. Bobby, Jack, and Angel go out to a bar where Damian said that the shooters would be. He described them correctly, as we see the goatee shooter sitting at the bar with the black shooter. The brothers are at the door and are looking for them when the shooters get suspicious of them. Jack spots them and the shooters pull out their guns. Bobby pulls out his gun and they try to catch them, but the bar patrons are frantic and trying to escape. Some guy tries to take away Bobby's gun, but he knocks him away and they proceed to give chase. The shooters get in their El Camino and speed off. The brothers get into Bobby's car and follow them. This car chase takes place in a snowstorm and the road is very slippery, especially at their high speeds. Bobby is determined to get these guys now, because they will most definitely lose them for sure if they escape. Angel leans out the window and shoots at the El Camino while the shooters do the same. Bobby runs into the car with his own and does damage to both sides. He does this once or twice more when his front left wheel starts to come off. Time is delicate, as Bobby's car can't last very long. Bobby smashes his car into the El Camino one last time, and this makes the El Camino to flip over and crash. Bobby stops the car and tells Jack to stay there. Bobby and Angel run over to the flipped over car and pull out the shooters. They drag them out into the snow, beat them up a little, and them shoot them both. Jack is shocked by this violent act, and they all leave.</p>
<p>The next day the police arrive, with Green and Fowler being called to the scene. They see the corpses and the car damage. These two were obviously murdered. Green and his partner might have a pretty good idea that the Mercer boys had something to do with this. Back at the Mercer house, Sofi is taking care of Bobby's dog bites when Green and Fowler knock on the door. Jack warns them that its the cops, and Bobby puts on a bathrobe to cover up his wounds. Jack lets the cops in and they walk into the living room, where they see Bobby in a very colorful bathrobe. They question him and the others if they had anything to do with last night. They play dumb and say no. Green says that it is peculiar that the contract killers of Evelyn Mercer turn up dead, shot execution style. Angel asks how they got from robbers to contract killers. Green then notices that blood is trickling down Bobby's hand. He asks him what happened, and Bobby says that he got it from playing hockey outside. Fowler pulls out an evidence bag with a piece of hair and says that they found it at the car wreckage. The hair belongs to Bobby. Bobby laughs off this trick, seeing how it is one of the oldest ones in the cop interrogating book. Angel makes fun of Fowler and they almost fight, but Green breaks it up. He says "you keep knocking on the devil's door, and sooner or later someone's going to answer". He tells the Mercers to be careful and leaves.</p>
<p>Later on Bobby wants to go back to Damian's and see if they can find anything that will help them figure out who was behind the hit. Angel prepares to go with Bobby and Jack when Sofi orders him to stay home. She talks about how bad it is for her and how he doesn't spend that much time with her. Bobby and Jack make fun of both of them and leave for Damian's. Angel closes the door and goes to talk with Sofi. When he finds her, she's sitting on top of the washing machine. She says "it'll be just like when we were 15", and they proceed to have sex on top of it. In the middle of this, someone from the bank comes to the Mercer house. Angel and Sofi stop and get clothed. Angel talks to the guy while Sofi gets upset with Angel about stopping midway sex. In short, the bank guy tells Angel that Jeremiah is bankrupt and he is receiving 400,000 dollars in the event of Evelyn's death. This gets Angel suspicious of Jeremiah, who receives financial gain from their mother's death.</p>
<p>Back at Damian's apartment, Bobby and Jack continue their search. Bobby pulls off the mattress of Damian's bedroom and finds a cache of guns. Bobby collects them in a bag and goes to see how Jack is doing. Jack is looking through Damian's CDs, and Bobby gets after him for it. However, Jack also finds a digital camera that might help. They leave and go back to their home. Bobby unloads the guns onto the dinner table and wonders how Damian got all these. Jack is fooling around with the camera when he sees that the shooters were following Evelyn around and taking pictures. Jeremiah comes by and sees how they are doing. Angel comes out from another room and obviously doesn't trust Jeremiah much. They all see that there is a picture of Evelyn with her lawyer the day she was killed. This prompts the curiosity, especially since the lawyer said that he only met with her once.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we go to another part of Detroit and we go inside a fancy restaurant. Inside Evan (Jernard Burks), Charlie (Tony Nappo), and other gangbangers are eating dinner. In walks Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), their leader. Evan and the others order the females with them to go away while Sweet walks in. He gets mad at all of them because he asked for out of town shooters, but they got in town shooters. If the shooters were out of town, there wouldn't be much of a problem. But since they were in town, the police are looking into it and the heat is getting too close. Evan eats a little while Sweet is talking, and this gets Sweet pissed off. He asks him if he's hungry and throws his plate onto the floor. Sweet orders Evan to eat the food off of the floor like a dog, publicly embarassing him. Evan's girlfriend gets mad at this, but Sweet orders her too to eat like a dog. Evan and his girlfriend eat off the floor like dogs.</p>
<p>That night, the brothers decide to check out the lawyer's home for any clues. Angel leaves this time with them, as does Jeremiah, but Sofi is pissed at Angel for going. They leave her at home fuming with anger. They go to the house and Jack gets into the lawyer's computer. They see that in his daily planner that he met up with Evelyn numerous times and don't know why he would lie. Unexpectedly, Sofi shows up in the driveway and honks her car, yelling that there is a robbert going on. Bobby and the others get pissed at her for ruining this for them when the lawyer pulls up into his house. Bobby grabs him and gets him on the snow, asking why he would lie about Evelyn. The lawyer confesses that he was romantically involved with her, and that they didn't want it to be known. Bobby apologizes for breaking into his house and roughing him up a little bit. They leave.</p>
<p>The next day, Angel follows Jeremiah around town. He sees Jeremiah go into a bank with a check for 400,000 dollars. Angel looks into Jeremiah's financial problems and sees that Councilman Douglas (Barry Shabaka Henley) was responsible for Jeremiah going bankrupt. Angel meets up with Jack and Bobby and tells him what he has found out about Jeremiah, and that he wasn't being honest with them. Angel tells Jack and Bobby to go to Douglas to get whatever information they can out of him while Angel will follow Jeremiah some more. Bobby and Jack surprise Douglas in a parking garage and want to talk to him. Douglas says that this isn't the place or time, and walks past them. He enters his car when he notices a funny smell inside. Then he notices that one of his back windows was smashed in and he realizes that the funny smell is gasoline. Jack lights up a cigarette and Bobby threatens to turn Douglass into the "black gingerbread man". Bobby wants to know why he shut Jeremiah down, and! he says that he was ordered to. Bobby demands to know who his boss is, and Douglas cracks and says that it is Victor Sweet. Jack and Bobby leave.</p>
<p>They meet up with Angel at a bowling alley where they talk about Victor Sweet. They talk about how he was small-time a couple of years ago, but now he pretty much runs Detroit. He has connections in congress, the police department, and everywhere. Bobby asks why Angel brought them here to the bowling alley. Angel directs their glance over to a bowling lane, where they see Jeremiah giving Evan a yellow envelope. Jermiah leaves. The brothers go to Evan, who gets visibly scared and tries to get his family to leave. Bobby demands the envelope that Jeremiah gave him, of which Evan gives him. Later in the car, Bobby is near crying and is angry at Jeremiah. He opened the envelope and finds that it is filled with money. They are parked outside of Jeremiah's home, and Angel calls him. He tells him that they need to talk tomorrow morning, and tells Jeremiah to come to the house. Bobby wants to kill Jeremiah right then and there, but Jack and Angel calm him down and they leave.</p>
<p>Later that night Douglas goes to the home of Victor Sweet. He is playing cards with Evan, Charlie, and his other goons. Douglas is visibly nervous and tells Sweet that the Mercer brothers visited him that day. Sweet asks if he gave up his name, and Douglas says no. Sweet says that he could smell it on him the moment he walked in, and orders Douglas to wait at the kiddie table nearby. Douglas sits down at the kids table and the kids ask him if he is in trouble. Suddenly, all the women and children get up and leave. Sweet walks over to Douglas and requests his pistol from one of his goons. Douglas is killed off-screen, and Sweet realizes that the Mercer brothers know too much. Also that night Green is reviewing the surveillance tapes at the police station from when Evelyn Mercer came by. Green sees that Evelyn was greeted by Fowler, and that they talked for an hour before she left. This is strange, though, because Fowler didn't mention anything about this.</p>
<p>The next morning, Jeremiah comes to the Mercer house and asks what they found out. Bobby pushes Jeremiah on the floor and asks him why he killed their mom. Angel punches him in the face and tells him what he found out about his financial problems. Jeremiah is angry that they think he killed mom. He gets up, pushes Bobby back, and punches Angel in the face. Jeremiah then tells them that he had financial problems with starting up his business. Sweet wanted to be Jeremiah's partner in his business, but Jeremiah turned him down (he wants to stay legitimate). So Sweet pulled his strings across town and made it impossible for Jeremiah to get financial aid in his business. Evelyn found out about it and was trying to help Jeremiah with his dream. Jeremiah thinks this is why she was killed. While they continue to talk, the doorbell rings. Jack gets up to answer it. He sees someone in a hooded jacket with their back towards him give him the middle finger and throw a snowball at his fac! e. Jack gets pissed and runs after him. Bobby realizes that Jack is gone, grabs a shotgun, and runs outside. A parked van opens and tosses the person that Jack is following something. It's a hockey mask. He turns around and shoots Jack in the shoulder. Jack screams in pain. Bobby shoots the guy with the shotgun and kills him. The van opens and numerous people get out. They spray the house with machine guns, and a good amount of the bullets hit Jack in his legs. He can't move and is stuck outside where he screams for Bobby to help him. Bobby has to go back inside and says that he will come for Jack.</p>
<p>Angel and Bobby use the guns that Damian had and fire at their attackers. They kill a good amount of them, but there are still several of them alive. Sofi stays on the floor and takes cover. Jeremiah turns a bit cowardly and tries to run out the back, but a masked man comes in the door first. Jeremiah sneaks up on him and stabs him to death with a kicthen knife. Jeremiah is horrified that he has gone back to this and goes to his car. During this shootout, Jack is choking on his blood in the snow. The masked men fired so much on the house that they created a big hole in the brick part of the house. Angel goes upstairs and fires down on the attackers. Soon enough though, everyone runs out of ammo. Bobby tries to find bullets, but it is to no avail. Angel is empty upstairs, and the last attacker is out too. But the attacker finds another machine gun clip and loads it. Bobby throws a piece of brick at his head and lunges at him. He bashes his head in with a piece of brick. Angel sees that a wounded attacker is getting ready to kill Bobby. Angel jumps from upstairs to the snow covered ground outside and kills the attacker. The van that held the masked men still has the driver left, and he puts the van in reverse on a straight path to run down Bobby. Angel starts to run over to save Bobby. Just before the van can hit them, Jeremiah runs into the van head on, saving both of them. Jeremiah, Bobby, and Angel go to Jack, who's still lying on the ground dying. He coughs up blood and dies very painfully. Bobby cries. He picks up a gun and walks over to the driver of the van. The driver says that Victor Sweet ordered the hit. Bobby lowers his gun. The driver says "thank god". Bobby raises his gun and says "Thank god? You killed my mother and my brother. Thank Victor Sweet!". Bobby blasts the drivers brains out.</p>
<p>The police arrive at the Mercer home. Green wants to know what happened. The remaining brothers are pretty emotional about Jack being killed. Bobby gets mad at Green, but he tells him that he has his own problems. Green has to deal with a dirty cop in his midst, and Angel puts it together that it's Fowler. Green says that he will take care of him in his own way. Green says that he is sorry for Jack's death, and tells the other cops that this incident was an act of "self-defense". Green leaves.</p>
<p>Green visits Fowler while he is playing pool at a bar. He asks him why he didn't tell him that he met up with Evelyn Mercer, but Fowler just says that he didn't think it was important. Green tells him that he should have told him anyways, and Fowler apologizes. He gives Green the pool stick and tells him to give it a shot. Green takes the pool stick and whacks Fowler in the leg with it. Green says that he can't stand dirty cops and takes Fowler's gun and badge. He exits the bar at the back. Fowler limps over to the exit and tells Green that he forgot to tell him something. Green asks what, and Fowler pulls out a hidden gun and shoots Green in the chest. Green drops down and Fowler shoots Green to death. He takes his badge and gun back, and calls on the radio for police backup. He says that two black men shot Green and that he needs an ambulance right away. Fowler even fires off a couple of bullets to make it sound like he's helping. Evelyn filed a police report against Victor Sweet, but she did so with Fowler, of whom works for Sweet. Fowler got rid of the file and alerted Sweet, who ordered the hit.</p>
<p>Bobby goes to Green's funeral, and knows that Fowler was behind it. Jeremiah, Angel, and Bobby discuss killing Fowler, but it would bring down a lot of heat on them for killing a cop. Plus, they still have a contract out on their lives from Sweet. They then discuss a plan. Jeremiah says goodbye to his family, and Jeremiah's wife calls over Bobby to talk to her. She asks Bobby to take care of Jeremiah and make sure he doesn't get hurt. Bobby assures her that he will be fine. Jeremiah goes to Evan's house and tells him that he wants the hit on the Mercer's to be called off. Evan says he can't do anything about it, but Jeremiah offers to give Sweet 400,000 dollars if he complies. They talk a little bit more, about how Jeremiah and Evan were cool with each other back in the day. Then we can't hear them talking, and Jeremiah leaves. He goes back home, and tells him that he's going to meet up with Sweet in a couple of hours. Bobby told him to make it in a couple of days, but Sweet wants to meet Jeremiah in a couple of hours and there's nothing they can do about it. Bobby sends Angel to go somewhere. Angel goes to the house of Fowler and puts a plastic bag over his head, suffocating him. Angel tells Fowler that he knows that he killed Green. Fowler gets out of the bag and breathes again. He asks him what he's going to do about it. No one is going to believe Angel. We see at the police station that Sofi is telling the cops that she overheard Angel talking about killing a cop.</p>
<p>Evan, Charlie, and the other Sweet goons pull up to the Mercer house and ring the doorbell. It's time to go, but Bobby won't let Jeremiah go until he gets word from Angel that Fowler is finished. Angel eventually calls Bobby and tells him that it's okay. He sends Jeremiah with a duffel bag full of the money out of the door. Jeremiah plays it off as putting the money into the bag took a good amount of time. The goons frisk Jeremiah, but see that he is unarmed. They drive off with him, leaving Bobby alone. Angel tells Fowler that he is wearing a wire, and that the police are outside. Fowler calls his bluff, but he looks out the window and sees that the cops are actually outside. Angel talks into his jacket and says that he is bringing Fowler out to them. While trying to get him outside, Fowler breaks free and grabs the gun. Angel is now his hostage.</p>
<p>Jeremiah is getting nervous in the car ride. He asks where they are going, and Evan tells them that they are going to meet Sweet at an iced over lake a good distance away. Fowler walks outside his house and holds the gun to Angel's head. He threatens to kill him. This confuses the cops outside, as they thought Fowler was the hostage. Fowler fires a couple of shots at the cops and is promptly shot in the leg by a cop. Angel breaks free and takes cover. A sniper shoots Fowler in the chest and he dies. Jeremiah and Sweet's goons finally make it to their destination. When they get there, they see there is already another SUV there and there are goons who are making a hole in the lake with chainsaws. Jeremiah asks where Sweet is, but Evan assures him that he's on his way. Victor Sweet arrives in another SUV wearing a fur coat and a white beanie with a white sweater. Jeremiah throws him the bag full of money and wants the hit to be put off. Sweet opens the bag and sees that the mon! ey is all there. Jeremiah said that Bobby was worried that Sweet would kill him right then and there after he gave him the money. Sweet calls for his pistol so that he can kill Jeremiah. However, no one gives him his gun. Jeremiah reveals that he offered the 400,000 dollars to Sweet's crew instead, and none of them help him. Evan calls Sweet a bitch and is happy with this revenge. Sweet assures them that Fowler will show up anytime now and arrest them, but Jeremiah tells him that he's not going to make it. Sweet asks which one of them is going to take him on. "Which one of you is going to take on the champ?". That's when we see in the distance Bobby, walking alone, and ready to kick some ass.</p>
<p>Sweet takes off his coat and raises his hands. Bobby takes off his coat (he's wearing a gray sweater and a gray beanie). The goons form a circle around the two and they proceed to fist fight each other. Sweet gets in some cheap shots, but Bobby beats on him harder. Bobby nearly beats Sweet to death when he stops. Bobby orders the men to throw Sweet in the ice cold water, and they do. Victor Sweet dies. Jeremiah wonders what the cops will think of this, but Bobby tells him that the cops love the Mercers. In the next scene we see Angel, Bobby, and Jeremiah all being beaten up by the cops in seperated interrogating rooms. They try to pull the hair evidence trick on them, but they all say that they had sex with the interrogator's mother last night. They get beaten harder, but are let go. Sofi and Jeremiah's wife are waiting at the station. Jeremiah is let go and hugs his wife. Angel is let go and is kissed by Sofi. Bobby is finally let go and waits to get his belonging from ! the police. While he does, Jeremiah asks if any of them cracked. They all say no, and they all talk about how they said the same thing ("I had sex with your mother last night") and laugh about it. Their plan worked.</p>
<p>The film ends around Christmas, and we see the remaining brothers fixing up their home. Sofi and Jeremiah's wife stop Angel and Jeremiah from working to come inside and relax a little bit. Bobby stays outside and contiunes to work. A hockey puck hits his leg, and he throws it back to Jeremiah's kids and the kids playing hockey. One of the kids asks if their grandma (Evelyn) is coming back, and Bobby tells them no. The kid asks if it is because she is dead, and he tells him yes. They go back to playing hockey. Bobby imagines talking to Evelyn again on the porch. She asks him if he is going to stick around, and he says that he's thinking about it. He makes peace with her and goes inside.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>THE GREAT RAID</p>
<pre>
movie trailer (quicktime)
</pre>
<p>NOTE: This Spoiler was sent in by William Gill who says: "...the movie was a very solid, accurate, moving and entertaining portrayal of the actual events that the movie attempts to recreate. As someone who is extensively knowledgeable in the events that surround this film I can tell you they did a much better job at handling the material and making it work than most other recent WW2 films have. Highly recommended!"</p>
<p>The film starts off with a brief voice-over synopsis by actor James Franco, who plays Captain Robert Prince. Prince’s commentary essentially describes the events of the WW2 in the Pacific leading up to the events of the raid. Essentially it recounts the sneak attack of Pearl Harbor and how that was the starting point for a massive Japanese assault on the entire Pacific region. One of the places the Japanese hit hardest following the attack on Pearl Harbor was the then American controlled Philippine Islands. Although the Americans and Filipinos carried on a desperate fight to defend the islands for months Prince explains, eventually Gen. Douglas MacArthur was forced to admit defeat, but he did so with a solemn pledge to eventually return and retake what the Americans had lost. The commentary then recounts how the American troops left behind were essentially left to their fate by a "Defeat Germany First" policy. The Americans taken prisoner were then taken on a forced march through the Bataan Peninsula during which many horrific atrocities were committed. This obviously being the "Bataan Death March". Anyway long story short (the commentary is a little bit tedious going on about a minute too long) its now January of 1945 and the Japanese victories of 1942 have now been reversed and the Americans have now fulfilled MacArthur’s pledge to return to the Philippines. It is at this point that the movie shifts from just showing old authentic "black and white" footage of WW2 and into the actual film. We see a group of American prisoners being lead by Japanese soldiers at the Palawan POW camp (one of the main American POW camps the Japanese run in the Philippines. As we see them being lead Prince’s commentary continues telling us that as American soldiers continued their advance through the islands the Japanese were given specific instructions to eliminate any POWs before the Americans could liberate them. We see the American soldiers brought to a group of subterranean air raid shelters. The American POWs wonder why the Japanese are sending them inside. The truth then becomes horrifying clear as the Japanese throw fuel canisters into the shelters and set them on fire immolating the helpless Americans trapped inside. A few men set on fire manage to run out of the shelters but they are quickly cut down by Japanese machine gun fire. It is after this scene that the title card "The Great Raid" comes up.</p>
<p>The movie then shifts to a scene on a beach on the main Philippine island on Luzon in late January of 1945. The film explains that the events depicted take place during the last 5 days of January of that year. Prince’s commentary continues telling us how they main landing on Luzon involved more than 250,000 men. It is at this point that he begins telling us about himself and his men. Prince introduces himself telling us how he was a graduate of Stanford University. He is now a part of America’s 6th Army Ranger Battalion. Although he does not feel overly confident in himself and his abilities to perform within the squad he acknowledges he has no choice. We then the Battalion’s leader, Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt).Mucci is clearly a formidable leader with a somewhat impulsive nature and a surly and churlish personality. However, despite this he is an extremely competent and capable leader. We are then introduced to a few less prominent members of the battalion. These include Lieutenants Riley and Foley. We then see Mucci talking with a general (played by famed war film actor and real life Marine Dale Dye) about a prison camp near the city of Cabanatuan. This POW camp run by the Japanese holds around 500 American POWs. The General explains to Mucci that just recently over 100 American POWs were burned to death at the Palawan prison camp primarily because American forces were advancing towards the camp and the Japanese did not want them to be liberated. With American forces now advancing towards the area of Cabanatuan concerns are clearly being raised that an incident very similar to Palawan will be repeated if someone does not rescue the prisoners in time. They begin discussing plans for a rescue mission.</p>
<p>The scene then shifts to the Cabanatuan camp itself. Here we meet Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) an American POW who serves as sort of an unofficial leader of the POWs in the camp. We also meet his close friend Capt. Redding (Marton Csokas). The two discuss with other POWs the recent news that Americans have landed in the Philippines and that liberation seems imminent. However, both Gibson and Redding express their doubts and how "we were abandoned once by MacArthur". Their misgivings about the American forces seem to be reinforced by the rampant disease and famine afflicting the camp. Redding then asks Gibson about the love interest he had in the Philippines before he was taken prisoner, a woman named Margaret Utinsky. Apparently Utinsky was married to another man who never really loved her or treated her right. Then she met Gibson and the two had a fleeting relationship. Margaret’s husband later died in one of the Japanese POW camps. Gibson expresses his skepticism about her stating that he wonders if she even thinks about him after all this time. Gibson also knows that Margaret now works with the Philippine underground resistance and that she probably has more pressing matters on her mind then him. We then see Gibson and Redding with a group of Japanese soldiers outside the camp. They are part of a detail of manual labor used to transport food back to the camp (nearly all of which goes to the Japanese). Gibson bribes one of the Japanese soldiers to let him go off and get some food. However, Gibson really uses the opportunity to get medicine for the sick prisoners from a Filipino resistance contact.</p>
<p>We then move to a warehouse in the capital of Manila. Here we meet Margaret (Connie Nielsen). She is performing one of her clandestine duties for the underground meeting with a group of Filipino smugglers. Margaret is attempting to procure vital medicine for the men inside the camp along with her cohort in the underground Mina (Natalie Mendoza) and a group of fellow Filipino underground members in a truck. Margaret strikes a deal with the nefarious smuggler and everything seems OK, but as Margaret makes her way back to the truck to get the money she tells Mina her intuition tells her this is a setup. She quickly jumps in the truck with Mina and a shootout ensues between the two groups. Shortly after this we see a group of Japanese soldiers emerge from a concealed position in a truck. Margaret’s premonition was correct. We see them run into the warehouse and try to stop Margaret from escaping but she manages to drive the truck outside through the streets to safety.</p>
<p>We then shift back to the main Ranger force. Col. Mucci is addressing his men about the forthcoming rescue operation. He tells them that while they are superbly trained soldiers they still have yet to be combat proven and that this is their chance. He says that the men in that camp have suffered greatly and endured tremendous hardship and that it is their duty to bring them home and that he has complete faith in his men to get the job done. The men cheer him and we then move back to Margaret. She is now back with the fellow primary members of the Philippine underground. They believe there are Japanese moles within their ranks and it is no longer safe. Although they ask Margaret to get to safety Margaret tells them this is not an option while there are still men in the camps. In the end they all follow her lead and agree to keep the operations going. We then briefly go back to the Cabanatuan camp where Major Gibson and Capt. Redding see an American POW being dragged and beaten by the Japanese. Redding comments that he tried to sneak food from the Japanese carelessly. The Japanese tie the man to a pole and beat him relentlessly while the POWs look on in sorrow and disgust powerless to help him. After a few more brief scenes including one involving Lt. Riley convincing Capt. Prince to let him go on the operation despite the fact he is married and the leaders want to discourage married men from going we then move to the next day.</p>
<p>The next day Major Gibson and the other POWs wake up to an unexpected site. The Japanese guarding their camp are now leaving. At first the man are puzzled by this. Redding explains that all Japanese are committed to the principle of fighting to the last man and their former guards are now going off to take positions to fight the oncoming Americans. Some of the men including Redding want to immediately flee the camp. Gibson tells Redding this is a huge mistake. Even unguarded the area is still abounding with Japanese soldiers who will kill them on site. Redding still persists on trying. Gibson then asks Redding of what will become of the sick men who cannot move from the camp on their own if the healthier men try and flee and leave them behind. Redding says he is not very concerned about them and that this is why he never made too many friends at the camp beyond Gibson. Redding and the others go outside the camps fences and get the dead man who was tied to a post and beaten to death the previous day. They then break into the Japanese dining tents to take what food they can. Gibson and the other man discover a huge stockpile of Red Cross packages full of food. Gibson tells his fellow prisoners that the food was meant for them and that the Japanese were starving them on purpose.</p>
<p>We then see the men of the 6th Rangers heading off on their journey to the POW camp. They pass through a forest and come to an area brimming with thick tall grass. The Rangers carefully negotiate their way through this grassland until they come through to a road. The Americans remain under cover because a Japanese convoy is passing through the area. Some of these men are coming from the Cabanatuan camp. Capt. Prince tells Mucci they obviously cannot continue this way without giving themselves away. He suggests going to a point where a river they need to cross is more shallow and can be crossed. Mucci realizes that such an area of passage is likely to be heavily patrolled by Japanese but the men now have no choice.</p>
<p>We see Margaret going on about her business for the underground. She acquires more medicine from the Manila hospital where she works as a nurse. She then hides the drugs on herself and tried to leave. However, on her way out a group of Japanese soldiers storm the building and bring everyone outside. The Japanese bring out a Filipino woman who is obviously an informant. The informant picks out a bunch of people from the line who have been helping the resistance, but she does not give up Margaret. The people picked out are then shot. Margaret severely shocked and traumatized by the killings makes her way away from the hospital. Later she meets up with Mina again on the streets. However, Mina is visibly shaken. She tells Margaret that a Japanese agent is following her. Margaret gives Mina the medicine she is carrying and tells Mina to flee. She says if Mina can possibly get the medicine to the camp to try but if she cannot just to flee with family to the mountains. Margaret then sends Mina off and crashes into the man pursuing Mina and attempts to occupy him until Mina can leave the area. However, as Margaret leaves we see another man begin following her.</p>
<p>We then rejoin the men at the camp again; they are lounging around enjoying their seemingly newly received freedom when a whole new force of Japanese arrives. Redding says the men do not look like regular military. Gibson confirms this and says they are elite military police who perform the works attracts to keep the populace repressed. A Japanese officer comes upon them and shoots one of the American prisoners attempting to remove a radio from a Japanese barracks. One of the prisoners infuriated begins to charge the officer, but Gibson holds him back. The leader of the new group of Japanese Col. Mori tells the officer to not bother since all the POWs will be dead soon anyway.</p>
<p>Later on in the evening we see the American Rangers sneaking near a bridge at the river crossing that was discussed early. Many Japanese are patrolling near the area. One of them goes down to a river near the Rangers to collect some water. The Rangers realize the imminent danger they are in. The Japanese soldier hears one of them and goes near to investigate. The Americans cannot shoot him but one of the Rangers sneaks up behind the soldier and strangles him. The Rangers quickly vacate the area.</p>
<p>The next day we see Margaret who has now been taken by the Japanese. They are interrogating her. The main Japanese interrogator asks Margaret about her Filipino underground contacts. However, Margaret reveals nothing and adamantly maintains she is Lithuanian, which means she is from a neutral country. The Japanese officer pulls out a Bible and asks if it’s hers. He shows Margaret a photo of a man inside. It appears to be Major Gibson from the POW camp. He asks her how this man is connected to Margaret but she still reveals nothing.</p>
<p>The focus returns to the Rangers again. They are now approaching a Filipino village. They see a large group of the villagers standing near a smoky ditch. As the Rangers approach they meet Filipino Guerilla leader Pejota (Cesar Montano) who will play a prominent role in the rest of the film. Prince asks Pejota what happened and Pejota explains that the Japanese brought up a force with tanks to the village and killed around 100 villagers for them helping the guerillas. The soldiers look at the charred corpses of the villagers with disgust. They then spot some Alamo Scouts who are special American reconnaissance who operate behind enemy lines. The scouts tell Mucci and Price that the camp has been reinforced by more Japanese and that even more are arriving. Mucci tells the scouts to go back and attempt to ascertain exactly how many Japanese the Rangers are looking at. Pejota says Mucci might have to delay the rescue, but Mucci is obstinate in his belief this must go forward and says the men inside have had 3 years of delays.</p>
<p>We then move back to the POW camp again. Major Gibson who is now deathly ill with malaria is taken from his friend Redding and is brought before the new leader of the camp Col. Mori. He explains to Gibson that anyone who escapes will have ten men killed in his place. Mori shows Gibson a photo of Margaret and asks him about his connection to her. Mori realizes that Gibson is clearly quite fond of Margaret and he tells him that the Japanese is now holding her. He tells Gibson that if he can convince Margaret to give up her contacts in the Philippine underground he will allow both of them to leave the islands together. However, Gibson recognizes that if they are talking to him then Margaret clearly was given the same offer and gave them nothing. He refrains from going along. Mori asks if Gibson has any reason to see the war end. Gibson replies, "I want to see you surrender".</p>
<p>We come back to Margaret. She is being shackled in an extremely straining position. However, the Japanese come in and release her from her restraints. Margaret is surprised the Japanese are letting her go. However, on her way out she sees the bodies of Mina and several others. They have clearly been shot by the Japanese. Margaret is not completely overwhelmed by what has occurred and leaves the prison looking in a state of shock. The main Japanese officer tells another man to have her followed so she can lead them to the other resistance members.</p>
<p>Mucci and Prince meanwhile are discussing the layout of the operation and how they will use the Filipino guerillas. Pejota insists he and his men can cover the two bridges on either side of the camp while the Ranger force assaults the main camp. However, Mucci is skeptical of the guerillas abilities and is unyielding in his desire that the guerillas merely protect the flanks of the Rangers. However, the Alamo scouts return with even more bad news. Not only has the camp been further reinforced with numbers now reaching around 250. The bridges on either side of the camp now are being watched by around a thousand men each, Mucci and Prince go with a scout party to have a look and see that these reports are accurate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile back at the camp Redding is clearly now determined to make a real escape attempt. Gibson now clearly very indisposed by his illness warns Redding that if he does this, 10 men will be killed because of it. Redding again says this is why he never made many friends at the camp. Gibson tells one of the other prisoners to get two men to watch Redding so he cannot leave,</p>
<p>We then see Margaret with Father Connor. A Priest who is one of the key underground members. They are in his church, Margaret tells Connor about the death of Mina but Father Connor assures her it was not her fault and that now she must focus on escaping into the mountains. However, a group of Japanese arrive and Margaret is forced to quickly depart once again as the church is overrun by the Japanese. She narrowly manages to escape.</p>
<p>Rejoining the Rangers, Mucci now comprehending the tremendous odds the Rangers face agrees to give the Filipino guerillas under Pejota a much more essential role in the forthcoming rescue. He agrees to let Pejota’s men hold the bridges that lead towards the camp. Mucci expresses apprehension about the ability of the Filipinos to hold the bridges since the Japanese have well-equipped forces including tanks. Pejota says that they merely need to plant explosives on the bridge. Mucci tells Pejota they don’t have enough to blow the bridges. However, Pejota insists they only need enough so that the bridge sustains enough damage to make it impassible to tanks. Mucci then claims that the Japanese will then just go around and try and flank the guerillas, but Pejota contends that the Japanese will not do this because the Japanese always underestimate the Filipino Guerillas and disregard their abilities and that because of this they will simply charge them. Mucci and Prince concur with the plan and get ready to make final preparations.</p>
<p>Back at the camp in the morning the two men who were guarding Redding awake to see one of them fell asleep while he was supposed to be watching him and he is now gone. However, a truck quickly arrives and Redding is dragged from it. Remaining veracious to his word Mori has ten men dragged out from among all the prisoners. Gibson and the other men watch in revulsion as Redding and the other men are all methodically shot to death one by one. We then briefly see Margaret in a scene where she is trying to depart with a group of Filipino refugees to safety.</p>
<p>Now we rejoin Captain Prince for the final phase of the film, the raid itself. First Prince goes over to a bit of loose ground and begins drawing out a depiction of the POW camp into and begins laying out the strategy that the Rangers will employ. Essentially this involves surreptitiously crawling towards the camp from cover across largely flat, open ground until nightfall. Once in position just outside the camp the Rangers will take positions along all the side of the camp and lay down a heavy barrage of fire to neutralize most of the defenders using surprise and then move into the camp itself and secure the prisoners. Special attention is given to a building within the camp that apparently shelters a few tanks. A bazooka crew is assigned to obliterate this structure.</p>
<p>We then move to the actual raid. We see the Rangers moving in clandestine fashion towards the camp and then getting into position. Lt. Riley who has been assigned the first shot initially hesitates to ensure everyone is in position. During this time we see the Filipino guerrillas taking up their place near the bridges getting ready to lay down a withering fire upon the Japanese once the Americans have launched their assault.</p>
<p>Finally with everything assured Riley lays down the first shot and the action begins. What follows is a series of spectacular and frenetic battles. The Rangers initially open up on the Japanese who are caught completely unaware and vulnerable. And many are cut down before they can adequately respond. Away from the camp the Japanese near the bridges hear the commotion and begin to move towards the camp only to be halted by the proficiently placed guerilla positions. It goes back and forth between the two groups for a while. The Rangers press further into the camp with the bazooka team destroying the building housing the tanks. The guerillas blow the bridge and the Japanese try and charge headlong towards them only to be mercilessly cut down. Mucci takes a small team of Rangers and guerillas to intercept a small contingent of Japanese attempting to flank the guerillas, while Prince moves into the prisoner barracks to find the bewildered men and tell them their time to go home has finally come. Prince finds Major Gibson who looks like he is nearly ready to pass. He says he will carry Gibson out of the camp and tells the others to start proceeding to the main gate out.</p>
<p>Around this time most of the Japanese in the camp have been killed. However, Col. Mori is still alive. He finds another Japanese soldiers and a few others near a machine gun, He asks the Japanese soldiers if the mortar near him is still operational and the soldiers tells him it is. He uses the mortar to target the prisoners making their war towards the gate with Prince while the other soldier mans a machine gun. Mori fires off a few shells that land near the POWs. Lt. Riley who is near the mortar position sees this and he and another man rush in to assault the position. They kill a few Japanese near it and then begin putting fire on the main mortar position. Riley tells the man with him to put covering fire on it while he flanks it. The soldier putting covering fire on the machine gun kills its operator. However, Mori picks it up and goes after Riley. He gets near Riley and fire off a burst at him. However, Riley hides back behind the building he is near. He then gets under this structure and waits for Mori to pass. He points his sub-machine gun at him and tries to fire but to his consternation the weapon jams. Mori tries to shoot him but Riley jumps on him. A struggle ensues and Mori tries to kill Riley with a knife but Riley manages to grab with 45 automatic and shoot Mori. He then pumps several subsequent rounds into Mori to ensure the job is done. With the situation secured Major Prince at the main gate with a look of disbelief that his men have pulled it off then fires off a flare signaling the operation is over and its time to evacuate with a look of exhilaration.</p>
<p>The Rangers and prisoners escape back to American lines and everyone has a look of jubilation. Mucci goes to see to one of the Rangers who was wounded upon hearing of the death of another Ranger to a sniper. He tells the wounded man everyone got out OK. Later back at the main American camp we see Margaret who is looking for Major Gibson. She finds him but tragically discovers that Gibson has succumbed to his illness and is now deceased. She sobs over his body and one of the soldiers gives her a letter he wrote to her shortly before the raid commenced. In it he expresses (this is done with voice over by Fiennes) his love for her and his deep thanks for everything she not only did for him, but for all of them men at the camp and that she is owed a great amount of gratitude for giving them hope during the worst of times. We then see Mucci and Prince back with the General from the beginning. He congratulates them on their success and tells them this operation will bring great pride not only to the army but also to the American people. We then see Major Price walking away and his voice over from the beginning returns. He tells us that the operation may have had no significance to winning the overall war, but it had a more important purpose. Righting the wrong perpetuated against the POWs by leaving them behind and helping to restore the honor and pride of the American people they lost when the islands were surrendered. We then see some brief information set against archival footage explaining the end results of the raid. That well over 500 men were rescued and that Mucci and Prince both received the Distinguished Service Cross.</p>
