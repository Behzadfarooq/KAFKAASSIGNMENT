<p>Here we go again. Someone is trying to disguise the fundamental, undeniable, self-proclaimed fact that this wacko is a fascist in the purest "Salute il Duce", totalitarian sense of that term. Her party is a breakaway from the National Alliance (formerly MSI of Benito Mussolini) because she was disgusted with Fini's rejection of fascism as "the absolute evil" and his demonstration of anti-racism in going to visit Isreal. She is extremely proud of her grandfather and has always done everything within her power to defend his sickening and horrifying fascist record. I wish the footsoldiers of Sam Spade and others on this 'pedia would cut out the attempts to whitewash the history of fascism, nazism and all the other abominable right-wing isms which have caused such damned destruction to humanity over the last century. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 13:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah its weird. Nazism was an extreme right and it was under a socialist heading. Additionaly Hitler didn't really give a damn about the workers, he used them as weapon building puppets, which created an illusion that he gave them work. Right parties concentrate on giving power and wealth to the government while left parties concentrate on helping people. I am guessing Hitler used the socialist logo in order not to appear to radical and different, virtually all his opponents were other socialists, so he also decided to introduce himself as a socialist, which he obviously wasn't since he used all the resources gathered by population to supply Germany with weaponry. His socialist stance was however justified by the fact that during his reign German people always had work, mostly in war industry. Other than that, no other examples of socialism in Germany were in practice.--<a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGusiman_15d0.html" title="User:Gusiman">Gusiman</a> 07:06, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This a very helpful and informative excerpt from the article <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> which helps to clear up the relationship between fascism and socialism on the one hand - fascism was fundamentally anti-socialist from the very beginning - and provides a throughly documented account of the actions of Allesandra's beloved grandfather on the other. Please read and educate yourselves just a tiny bit (if that is even possible):</p>
<p>"In this fluid situation, Mussolini took advantage of the opportunity and, <b>rapidly abandoning the early socialist and republican program, put himself at the service of the antisocialist cause.</b> The fascist militias, supported by <b>the wealthy classes</b> and by a large part of the state apparatus which saw in him the restorer of order, <b>launched a violent offensive against the syndicalists and all political parties of a socialist or Catholic inspiration</b>, particularly in the north of Italy (Emiglia Romagna, Toscana, etc.), causing numerous victims though the substantial indifference of the forces of order. These acts of violence were, in large part, provoked by fascist <i><a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadristi.html" title="Squadristi">squadristi</a></i> who were increasingly and openly supported by <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Grandi_3ea4.html" title="Dino Grandi">Dino Grandi</a>, the only real competitor to Mussolini for the <i>leadership</i> of the fascist party until the Congress of Rome in 1921.</p>
<p>The violence increased considerably during the period from 1920-1922 until the March on Rome. Confronted by these badly armed and badly organized fascist militias attacking the Capital, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Italy_4029.html" title="King of Italy">King</a> <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Emmanuel_III_of_Italy_026d.html" title="Victor Emmanuel III of Italy">Victor Emmanuel III</a>, preferring to avoid any spilling of blood, decided to appoint Mussolini, who at that moment had the support of about 22 deputies in Parliament, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">President of the Council</a>. Victor Emmanuel continued to maintain control of the armed forces: if he had wanted to, he would have had no difficulties in booting Mussolini and the completely inferior fascist forces out of Rome. Therefore, it is not appropriate to refer to Mussolini's rise as a "coup d'etat" since he obtained his post legally with the blessing of the sovereign of the nation.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's reign were characterized by a coalition government composed of <b>nationalists, liberals and populists</b> and did not assume dictatorial connotations until the <b>assassination of <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giacomo_Matteotti_be14.html" title="Giacomo Matteotti">Matteotti</a></b>. In domestic politics, Mussolini favoured the complete restoration of State authority, with the integration of the <i>Fasci di Combattimento</i> into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the <i>Milizia Voluntaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale</i>) and the progressive identification of the Party with the State. In political and social economy, '<b>he emanated legislation that favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatizations, liberalizations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions).</b></p>
<p>In June of 1923, a new majoritarian electoral law was approved which assigned two thirds of the seats in Parliament to the coalition which had obtained at least 25% of the votes. This law was punctually applied in the elections of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">6 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, in which the fascist "listone" obtained an extraordinary success, aided by the use of shenanigans, violence and intimidatory tactics against opponents.</p>
<p>The assassination of the socialist deputy <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giacomo_Matteotti_be14.html" title="Giacomo Matteotti">Giacomo Matteotti</a>, who had requested the annulment of the elections because of the irregularities committed, provoked a momentary crisis of the Mussolini government. The weak response of the opposition (the secession of the Aventine), incapable of transforming their posturing into a mass antifascist action, was not sufficient to distance the ruling classes and the Monarchy from Mussolini who, on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">3 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, broke open the floodgates and, in a famous discourse in which he took upon himself all of the responsibility for the assassination of Matteoti and the other squadrist violence, proclaimed a <i>de facto</i> dictatorship, suppressing every residual liberty and completing the identification of the Fascist Party with the State.</p>
<p>From 1925 until the middle of the 1930's, fascism experienced little and isolated opposition, although that which it experienced was memorable, consisting in large part of communists such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Gramsci_4acd.html" title="Antonio Gramsci">Antonio Gramsci</a>, socialists such as <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietro_Nenni_1747.html" title="Pietro Nenni">Pietro Nenni</a> and liberals such as <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piero_Gobetti_46a1.html" title="Piero Gobetti">Piero Gobetti</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Amendola_1495.html" title="Giovanni Amendola">Giovanni Amendola</a>.</p>
<p><b>While failing to outline a coherent program, fascism evolved into a new political and economic system that combined corporatism, totalitarianism, nationalism, and anti-Communism in a state designed to bind all classes together under a capitalist system.</b> This was a new capitalist system, however, one in which the state seized control of the organization of vital industries. Under the banners of nationalism and state power, Fascism seemed to synthesize the glorious Roman past with a futuristic utopia.</p>
<p>Despite the themes of social and economic reform in the initial <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_manifesto.html" title="Fascist manifesto">Fascist manifesto</a> of June 1919, the '<b>movement came to be supported by sections of the middle class fearful of socialism and communism.</b> Industrialists and landowners supported the movement as a defense against labour militancy. Under threat of a fascist <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_on_Rome_63ee.html" title="March on Rome">March on Rome</a>, in October 1922, Mussolini assumed the premiership of a right-wing coalition <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a> initially including members of the pro-church <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Democracy_%28Italy%29_8ca9.html" title="Christian Democracy (Italy)">Partito Popolare</a></i> (People's Party).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regime.html" title="Regime">regime</a>'s most lasting political achievement was perhaps the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lateran_Treaty_d8b5.html" title="Lateran Treaty">Lateran Treaty</a> of February 1929 between the Italian state and the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a>. Under this treaty, the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papacy.html" title="Papacy">Papacy</a> was granted temporal sovereignty over the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_City_edb3.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a> and guaranteed the free exercise of Roman Catholicism as the sole state religion throughout Italy in return for its acceptance of Italian sovereignty over the Pope's former dominions.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Italy recovered from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, and achieved economic growth in part by developing domestic substitutes for imports (<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autarky.html" title="Autarky"><i>Autarchia</i></a>). The draining of the malaria-infested Pontine Marshes south of Rome was one of the regime's proudest boasts. But growth was undermined by international sanctions following Italy's October 1935 invasion of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> (the <a href="../../../a/b/y/Abyssinia_crisis.html" title="Abyssinia crisis">Abyssinia crisis</a>), and by the government's costly military support for Franco's Nationalists in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>The invasion of Ethiopia was accomplished rapidly (the proclamation of Empire took place in May of 1936) and involved several '<b>atrocities such as the use of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_weapon.html" title="Chemical weapon">chemical weapons</a> (<a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_gas.html" title="Mustard gas">mustard gas</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosgene.html" title="Phosgene">phosgene</a>) and the indiscriminate slaughter of much of the local population to prevent opposition.</b></p>
<p>The armed forces disposed of a vast arsenal of grenades and bombs loaded with mustard gas which were dropped from airplanes. This substance was also sprayed directly from above like an "insecticide" on to enemy combatants and villages. <b>It was Mussolini himself who authorized the use of the weapons: "Rome, <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_27.html" title="October 27">27 October</a> '35. A.S.E. Graziani. The use of gas as an <i>ultima ratio</i> to overwhelm enemy resistance and in case of counterattack is authorized. Mussolini." "Rome, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">28 December</a> '35. A.S.E. Badoglio. Given the enemy system I have authorized V.E. the use even on a vast scale of any gas and flamethrowers. Mussolini." Mussolini and his generals sought to cloak the operations of chemical warfare in the utmost secrecy, but the crimes of the fascist army were revealed to the world through the denunciations of the International Red Cross and of many foreign observers. The Italian reaction to these revelations consisted in the "erroneous" bombardment (at least 19 times) of Red Cross tents posted in the areas of military encampment of the Ethiopian resistance. The orders imparted by Mussolini, with respect to the Ethiopian population, were very clear: "Rome, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. A.S.E. Graziani. All rebels taken prisoner must be killed. Mussolini." "Rome, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">8 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. A.S.E. Graziani. I have authorized once again V.E. to begin and systematically conduct a politics of terror and extermination of the rebels and the complicit population. Without the <i>legge taglionis</i> one cannot cure the infection in time. Await confirmation. Mussolini." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Candeloro"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlessandra_Mussolini_2137.html#endnote_Candeloro" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlessandra_Mussolini_2137.html#endnote_Candeloro" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span></b> The predominant part of the work of repression was carried out by Italians who, besides the bombs laced with mustard gas, instituted lagers, installed public gallows, killed hostages, and mutilated the corpses of their enemies. Graziani ordered the elimination of captured guerrillas by way of throwing them out of airplanes in mid-flight. Many Italian troops had themselves photographed next to cadavers hanging from the gallows or hanging around chests full of detached heads. One episode in the Italian occupation of Ethiopia was the slaughter of Addis Ababa of February, 1937 which followed upon an attempt to assassinate Graziani. In the course of an official ceremony a bomb exploded next to the general. The response was immediate and cruel. The thirty or so Ethiopians present at the ceremony were impaled, and immediately after, the black shirts of the fascist Militias poured out into the streets of Addis Ababa where they tortured and killed all of the men, women and children that they encountered on their path. They also set fire to homes in order to prevent the inhabitants from leaving and organized the mass executions of groups of 50-100 people. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Del"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlessandra_Mussolini_2137.html#endnote_Del" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlessandra_Mussolini_2137.html#endnote_Del" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>International isolation and their common involvement in Spain brought about increasing diplomatic collaboration between Italy and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. This was reflected also in the Fascist regime's domestic policies as the first <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitic.html" title="Anti-semitic">anti-semitic</a> laws were passed in 1938. From that year on, with the publication of the <i>Manifesto degli scienziati razzisti</i> (Manifesto of the Racist Scientists) (in reality about 90% written by Mussolini himself), fascism declared itself explicitly anti-Semite. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 09:12, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So the Italian fascist government seized control of major industries and banned labor unions. This is exactly what the doctrinaire Communist parties did when they were in power in Cuba, China, Russia and every other communist state. In fascist countries, a middle and upper class clings to state power; in communist countries, a new class of privileged party members pops up and takes all the power from the other classes. To this day, in fact, independent labor unions are illegal in Cuba. The point being there are tangible similarities between fascism and communism. Socialism seems to mean different things to different people. I would argue socialism in its traditional definition hurts the "workers" (who doesn't "work"?) in the long run, but whatever. Governments with the least state control tend to prosper economically, while those with autarky-type governments and heavy economic govt intervention falter (exceptions are countries with NO government, those tend to fall into disarray; a govt needs to exist to enforce laws and contract agreements). --68.11.45.124 17:39, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree that there are many similarities, in practice, between communism and fascism. I know there are people who donìt like the use of this term, but to me they are both just different manifestations of totalitarianism. But there are essential differences, in principle, between the two: nationalism is definitional of fascism and is almost contradictory (<b>in principle</b> of course) to the internationalist socialism. Racism is usually definitnional of fascism; not of communism. My point is very simply that fascism is NOT just a warped form of <i>socialism</i>. As you yourself point out, the defintion of socialism is enormously diverse, probably to the point of subjectivity these days. The fact is that many conservative Republicans think that Bill Clinton was a socilaist, for example. There are even some extreme libertarians who consider George W. Bush a socialist (he has, after all, expanded the size of the State rather enormously in the military, homeland security and even Medicare sectors and the national debt has exploded on HIS term). On the other hand, most Western European governments are far to the left of the US on economic issues (more governmental intervention) but far more "Libertarian" than the US on such matters as legalization of drugs, abortion, gay marriage, sodomy laws and these kinds of things. The fact is that all modern economies are "mixed economies". They are neither completely socialist nor completely capitalist. There is a simple reason for this: both of these extremes do not work. I tend to favor much more government intervention <i>in the economy</i> than exists in the US but much less than exists in Italy. On the other hand, I favor complete drug legalization, unlimited abortion rights, gay marriage, infinitely reducing the size of the militaty and the security budgets, extreme civil libertarianism in the legal sense, universal acess to contraception, pornography, etc.. Where does that put me? I am almost certainly classified as a socialist in the US, while I am classified as something I know not what in Europe. In any case, it should be clear why I think it is ridiculously simplistic to insist that fascism is a form of socialism. I despise any form of totalitarinsim or authoritarianism, though, no matter what how it labels itself. But I don't beleive that the free-market is the answer to all of the world's problems either.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 08:14, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote this comment in an edit summary to this article this morning:</p>
<p><i>she would not deny it; why cover it up; It is better to be a fascist than to be a homosexual "freak" like yourself)</i>.</p>
<p>Just wanted to clarify: this last sentence is NOT an assertion of MY opinion. I wrote very hastily and hope this is not misunderstood. The point was: I think this is clearly what A.M. meant by her phrase, in Italian, "E meglio essere un fascista che un frocio." It was clearly intended as an anti-gay, anti-transgender insult in the sense of "it is better to be fascist than a faggot" .No need to beat about the bush. Though, now that I think of it "Faggot" may not be sufficently insulting to get the meaning across. Well, let's leave it as frocio them.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 17:25, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Haha its funny how you are not making sense at all: "Im 100 precent Italian",but then you say "My Americano father".Clearly that you never visited Italia.if you were you would have knew that Alternativa Sociale is at about 5 precent right now,more then ever,and with a new coalition it is bounded to be in the goverment after this election.</p>
<p>As for Partitio d`Azione,I dont wanna be the one to break your ilusions,but it was a mafioso organisation that terorised Italy for many years.Il Duce was famous for fighting criminals,and thats why even the best Italiano player ever PAOLO DI CANIO admitted that Il Duce was a greatest many in our history,not to mention many other people,but I know Americanos like to have it simple,so I`ll just mention Prime Minister berlusconi who said that Duxx was a great man.</p>

<dd>What?? I said I was 100% Italian in genes and ancestry. My father was born in the US but his father and mother were BOTH immigrants from Italy. My father married my mother (another immigrant from Italy). That's 100% Italian blood (to use a term you would probably prefer). I was born and raised in the States; I now LIVE in Italy and have been LIVING HERE for the last five years. I don't know what Alternativa Sociale's numbers are, but I think you are certainly overestimating them. The polls I have seen put them down at 1% to 2%. As to the Partito d'Azione: it was a party of intellectuals of both the left and the right who opposed fascism. Period. Mafiosi my ass. However, since you did bring it up: better mafiosi than fascista, nonno!! Also, you have already <b>been in power for the last five years</b>, you will be out on April 11 and then Berlu and his henchmen will be in jail, while the rest of you porkers will be eaten alive by the Chinese Communists.

And yeah,"better mafiosi then fascista" ----thats why you`ll lose this election,cause Prodi and other criminals were destroying this country for waaaay to long,now its time to fight back,I personaly dont like Forza Nuova,but they really done exposed communist mafiosi,now its time for real patriots to take the power.Its all over,you be happy if you get 30 precent in the north,because you wont get more then 10 % in the south.</p>

I will tell you how,you are probably from out of Italia so you dont see it.Well,because Alessadra announced that she will run for Major of Rome in May,now communists are trying to make plots against her,ridiculing her modeling days.</p>
<p>The point is,what her modeling days have to do with a fact that she is one of most respected and loved Italian politicians in lsat 15 years.She is member of Europian Parlament,and putting her toples picture just goes to make her look like some model.</p>
<p>Why dont you put Jackie Kennedys toples pictures that were made on italian beaches while she wasnt looking?</p>
<p>Because everyone would think that it is digusting.Same thing hereDzoni 21:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I still disagree. You're absolutely right that she is a member of European Parliament, and most of the article talks about that; you will notice that is the first picture of her I put up. However, she was also a well known model, and there is nothing disgusting about that. Being featured on the cover of Playboy is not negligible for models. Anyone can have their picture taken on a beach when they weren't looking, but very few will pose for the cover of Playboy. It's very notable. You can't just focus on the part of her career that you like and take out the rest - that would be no better than another writer trying to minimize all mention of her in politics, and focusing only on the modeling. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 13:26, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Why dont you then write abou prosecutions of Fascistas after the World War 2.There are areas in Italy where Fascistas still cant say what are their politic conviction,even today.People still look(in some towns like Livorno)at fascistas like they are as bad as comunistas.</p>
<p>In that light,you can see why this picture is bad,because people who see it will say:"Huh.she is not decent enough to represent Duces ideals,she is not as honourable as her grandfather was."</p>
<p>I agree,that Wikipedia,being a encyclopedia,should have as many photographs and writings as posible,but I think it would be a good gesture to remove the picture until the May elections(where Alessandra will run for Major of Rome)are over.Because now she is around 10 precent of support,but thing looks like improving,and this picture can only hurt this good trend.So,please remove it until the elections are over and then I will totaly agree to put this picture and I will even post my picture with Alessandra so you can add that one too.But,until then,please remove it,and after its over I will support it all the way.Dzoni 20:50, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oo,You are either a comunista or a frocio,because no right thinking Italiano would ever say that Duce was the"worest dictator".Mussolini was a greatest statesman in Italia historia,but clearly you dont even know of Piazzale Loreto because that could not happened to "worst dictator",that could only happened to an innocent victim.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about how great man and statesman Duce was,but tring to educate comunista is useless job,so think what you will,but let me tell you:EVERY PATRIOT IN ROMA WILL VOTE ALESSANDRA FOR MAJOR.</p>
<p>And yes,she do not "favour fascismo over democracy",she is fascista,off course,but she also is a democrat,so be quiet if you dont know anything about her.Only an uneducated man could talk the way you do,so i will forgive you,but you better ask someone who is either not frocio or who is not comunista about those times and they will tell you that it was glorious times for Italia and they will also tell you that every wise Italian supports Alternativa(although many of them vote other right parties,but still everybody know how great person Alessandra is).Dzoni 07:40, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

In the same way, the Boston Tea Party (a new political party here in America) is a libertarian party (small-L), but only the Libertarian Party is Libertarian (big-L). The Democratic Party here in America is Democratic (big-D) but definitely not democratic (small-d). The Republican Party here is Republican (big-R) but hardly republican (small-R).</dd>
<dd>Now, whereas fascism is not inherently anti-Semitic, Nazism is inherently anti-Semitic; and the Fascist Party <i>definitely</i> had anti-Semitic policies.</dd>
<dd>The Nazi Party, the Fascist Party, and fascism in general, are all forms of socialism (small-S), but only the Socialist Party is Socialist (big-S). Likewise, the Communist Party (big-C), communism in general (small-C), communitarianism, and syndicalism are all socialist (small-S), albeit they're not as far-right as fascism.</dd>

<p>The degree information contained in the "Education" section seems a little dubious, given that the American University of Rome dosen't grant anything higher than a bachelor's degree. Is there any credible internet source indicating she holds a PhD from there?<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondonIce_b613.html" title="User:LondonIce">LondonIce</a> 06:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
