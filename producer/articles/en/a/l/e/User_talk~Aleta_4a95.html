<p>While it's approaching <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">patent nonsense</a> in presentation this does sadly document a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6168697.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6168697.stm" rel="nofollow">current event</a>. I'll see what I can do about Wikifying it, although really it belongs on Wikinews... Hmmm. I wonder if there's a {{Transfer to Wikinews}} template? No. Pah!.

<dl>
<dd>I've prodded it as a neologism. The term is being used by exactly one newspaper over here (so far). If it catches on I'll de-prod it and try to make an article out of it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 20:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The author has de-prodded it. I'm taking it to AfD now (again, as a neologism). Note that <i>none</i> of the extra sources added by the author use this term. "Ripper", yes, "East Anglia Ripper", yes (which is more cognate with <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Ripper_e6ba.html" title="Yorkshire Ripper">Yorkshire Ripper</a>, as you'd expect from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>) but no "Ipswich Ripper".

<dd>Aha! I see you did. Nothing wrong with that, but technically that goes as an opinion to <b>Keep and rename</b>. Which when I think about it is probably a better idea than deletion. See <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> for all the procedural stuff.

<p>Hi Aleta. Just wanted to say that the word in the homosexual women section of the article is meant to be 'allusions' and not 'illusions'. An allusion is a reference to something, or an indication that x is the case. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 03:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologise if I came across as patronising. On reflection I don't think either word really means what is trying to be said. I've changed the sentence to avoid using them. Do you think its now OK? <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 04:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for having joined the <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7ERELIGION_9da2.html" title="WP:RELIGION">WikiProject Religion</a>! It is basically only a recently reformed group, and, as you probably saw from the project page, there is still a lot that needs to be done. Any help you might be able to give in any area of the project would be more than welcome. I noticed in particular that you expressed interest in the Unitarian Universalist faith. That makes you the second member of the project to specifically do so. This is good, because our aims are to improve and maintain the articles relating to religion which do not fall within the scope of any of the other projects, as well as to potentially create new task forces or other projects to deal specifically with those other faiths. Generally, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/WP%7ECOUNCIL_bae4.html" title="WP:COUNCIL">WikiProject Council</a> guidelines call for at least five members to create a new differentiated project, but those numbers can drop considerably if the proposed project is more a task force or work group of another project. With any luck, we may have enough interested parties soon to create a special group to deal with the Unitarian Universalists. Also, I have just now begun to catalogue all the relevant articles, and am finding that there is a huge number of articles which deal with religion subjects in general, without any particular focus on any specific religions. Any contributions you might be able to make on these articles, or any other articles that might interest you, would be more than welcome. If you should ever have any questions, or wish any sort of assistance, please do not hesitate to let me or the other members of the project know. Happy editing, and thanks again for joining the project! <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Thanks for the note about the wikify tag I applied to <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelley_Armstrong_047b.html" title="Kelley Armstrong">Kelley Armstrong</a>. I apologize for not having left a note on the discussion page, but was in a bit of a rush and had placed the tag, in a way, to remind myself to look at the entry today. I have three concerns:</p>
<p>1) The entry contains an unreferenced quote.</p>
<p>2) The biographical section contains contradictory information as to the number of children Armstrong has (see the first and final sentences).</p>
<p>3) Despite your improvements, I find much of the tone and content of the biographical section unencyclopedic and... well, chatty.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Thanks for your good work. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 16:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Aleta, You are, of course, correct, the wikify tag is not quite correct. I suppose clean-up would have been better. Thanks for pointing that out. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 22:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just read back over <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and I think this is ambiguous. It does, of course, say you can link to official websites, but to avoid MySpace sites. Which rule trumps the other when they are in apparent opposition? I'm not sure, but I won't fight you on this one anymore, particularly as I agree links to official MySpace pages can be useful. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleta_51a2.html" title="User:Aleta">Aleta</a> 06:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not ambiguous. Right before listing "restricted pages," the page specifically states "In addition to the restrictions on linking, <b>and except for a link to a page that is the subject of the article or is an official page of the subject of the article</b>, one should avoid." Break it out literally. "Except for a link to a page that... is an official page of the subject of the article... one should avoid links to... MySpace." Since it's her official MySpace it's explicitly allowed by the guideline. - <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 06:48, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Since you're interested in the history of geology, you might want to take a look at the new article on it. (It wasn't in the nav bar because until recently, there was no article!)

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_LGBT_studies_Jumpaclass_41de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject LGBT studies/Jumpaclass">Jumpaclass</a> is picking up slowly, with nine people having entered.

<li>There is an ongoing discussion about the current LGBT categorisation system <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_LGBT_studies_9dd1.html#Category_and_assessment_point." title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject LGBT studies">here</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_LGBT_studies_Notice_board_8347.html#Overlapping_categories" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject LGBT studies/Notice board">here</a>, and <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category_talk%7ELGBT_2082.html" title="Category talk:LGBT">a little bit here</a>. A special page has now been set up <a href="../../../l/g/b/Portal%7ELGBT_Categories_7350.html" title="Portal:LGBT/Categories">here</a> to deal with this.</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_LGBT_studies_Translation_e8fc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject LGBT studies/Translation">Watchlist</a> has been set up to monitor controversial and/or highly vandalised articles. It can also be used for article disputes, just add a note explaining the nature of the dispute.</li>
<li>With the influx of so many active members, there is now enough support for a LGBT studies peer review, which may be found <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_LGBT_studies_Peer_review_9cc2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject LGBT studies/Peer review">here</a>.

<p>Seeing that you are an active member of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_9928.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography">WikiBiography Project</a>, I was wondering if you would help lend a hand in helping us clear out the amount of unassessed articles tagged with {{WPBiography}}. Many of them are of stub and start class, but a few are of B or A caliber. Getting a simple assessment rating can help us start moving many of these biographies to a higher quality article.

<p>Hi, I received your support on the reggaetón page to include the diacritic on the first word of the article and to state that both spellings appear in the English language. User Sfacets has however begun an edit war and removed the diacritic, and latter on added the sentence that the diacritic is used less often. I’d like your support in defending the accent and removing the redundant information about frequency seeing as how it has already been established that both spellings are widely used in English. The frequency fact is also unnecessary because that’s apparent since the anglicised version dominates the page except for two occasions. Thank you. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reggaeton" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reggaeton" rel="nofollow">Link to reggaeton discussion</a> --Noé Æ 06:15, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The vetting of the barnstars that could be listed on the <a href="../../../b/s/_/WP%7EBS_05bb.html" title="WP:BS">WP:BS</a> page initially developed because of the chaos that was being created. Over time, the awards pages have grown to four classes of awards. Anyone can create any award (as can any wikiproject), but to get listed on the page they had to first be vetted. There are now fifteen pages of archived ideas, most of which haven't made it to the page. The flip side of the vetting was the relative freedom of listing something on the <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html" title="WP:PUA">WP:PUA</a> page - anyone can post almost anything there.</p>
<p>Initially, the <a href="../../../b/s/_/WP%7EBS_05bb.html" title="WP:BS">WP:BS</a> pages were a wikiproject, but that was deleted after the idea was moved to the Wikipedia pages. After some conflicts last year about 'process' <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Awards_0286.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Awards">Wikipedia:WikiProject Awards</a> ws recreated.

<p>Hey Aleta, check my talk page, I actually didn't revert you, it was KhoiKhoi. Even though the consensus on the talk page is to keep the first word of the article consistent with the title, he changes the page without explaining why. I keep telling him to look at the talk page, but he refuses to do so, he changes it because he personally believes the word requires an accent. I went ahead and reported him to the other administrators, he's going to see that and immediately block my account (kind of feel like I'm in a third world country reporting a corrupt policeman). But you, myself, Sfacest, Gtbacchus are all in agreement, the first word should reflect the title. KhoiKhoi apparently doesn't want to follow the consensus and is editing based on what he thinks the page should say. I may request a full block on edits of the page if he continues. 68.155.70.91 02:33, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest you look at your edit of March 26 and compare it to mine immediately preceding it. You removed the reference I had added and reverted the opening line of the second paragraph that previously had been removed. Clearly you cut and pasted an old edit without giving any thought to the consequences. Before getting so defensive, take a careful look at your own handiwork. Whether or not you intended to vandalize the article, the bottom line is the edits you made did.
