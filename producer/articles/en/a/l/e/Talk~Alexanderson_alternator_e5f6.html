<p>Didn't Nikola Tesla invent the "Alexanderson Alternator?" Tesla described experiments with high frequency multipole alternators at his several international lectures in 1892, and he used alternators as part of his high-power transmitter experiments prior to 1898. Critical question: what is the difference between Tesla's alternator patent <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=447921" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=447921" rel="nofollow">447,921</a> and others, versus Alexanderson's? Was it just a matter of marketing and publicity (where Alexanderson won the race to market, even though Tesla first invented the device?) --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 13:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That depends on what the meaning of "invent" is. I've read "My Inventions" and "Man out of Time" and it seems to me that nothing Tesla invented after the polyphase patents ever had much commercial success. I think the "purpose of radio communications" point is key; Tesla was too busy with his Wardenclyffe dreams to stoop to commercialization of a mere CW transmitter. However, I've learned to never cross the Teslaphiles on Wikipedia. An analysis of the claims of the respective patents would doubtless show many differences. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 21:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wtshymanski, your POV show clearly. Nikola Tesla's U.S. Patent 447920 had a frequency that was in the longwave broadcasting range (VLF band). Tesla continued research into higher frequency devices and, by early 1896, he attained the means to produce undamped (or "continuous") waves around 50,000 cycles per second for radio transmission. 172.162.29.30 15:55, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>However, I've learned to never cross the Teslaphiles on Wikipedia.</b> Lol. We're very scary. BOOGA BOOGA! Anyway, I thought Tesla was using exactly these devices for wireless communications experiments in Manhattan and later in Colorado. His goal of wireless power doesn't magically cancel out other accomplishments. What's more important: that an invention was the first of its kind, patented, and used? Or do you really think such issues become irrelevant, since selling the devices is more important?</dd>

<dd>The situation appears to be this: Tesla patented a high-frequency alternator in 1891, and used it for high-power radio transmission experiments famous at the time. Then twenty years later, after memories have dimmed, Alexanderson patented an improved high-frequency alternator and used it for radio transmission. The edge of Alexanderson's rotor is different than Tesla's, his frequency was 10x higher than Tesla's, and his patent claims "higher power than other alternators of this type." (OTHER alternators? This WP entry says that Alexanderson was the inventor!) But maybe the 10x frequency increase was a critical change. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 02:16, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think the people who bring an invention to the public and make it work on a regular useful basis have a better claim to be the inventors than laboratory stunts. "The value of an invention lies in the using of it", paraphrasing Edison. It's not like you could *ever* have walked up to Tesla's transmitter and sent a telegram to your Aunt Minnie - but a significant amount of the world's business was carried over Alexanderson alternators in their heyday. 10 kHz is an exceptionally lousy frequency for radio, as you can appreciate - and makes 100 kHz look very good; or at least enough better to make wireless communication commercial, instead of a stunt. We remember Ford and Daimler, not all those decadent aristos who fooled with steam carriages; Edison, not all the lab stunts with strips of platinum in jars that needed a full-time grad student to keep running; Marconi, not Tesla or Popov, as the founder of practical radio, etc. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 17:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hold on a sec. For other devices described on WP, do we declare one person as "Inventor," and then delete all the documented early history of the device prior to that inventor? Sounds like intentional distortion to me, and not appropriate to an encyclopedia. But that's what's happening here. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 22:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps the present article should move to a more general title, analogous to the "Incandescent bulb" rather than the specific "Edison carbon filament bulb." I'd recommend against it, since our goal should be to enlighten the non-experts and not confuse them with in-fighting ploys. Since WP has no other entry like "high frequency radio alternator," and since the term "Alexanderson alternator" is the long-accepted generic name for these devices, this article is the appropriate place for describing the complete historical development of this form of radio transmitter. Note well: nobody's suggesting that we delete this article and replace it by one called "Tesla Alternator." (grin!) So why are the Tesla references being deleted? By analogy, in an article about "<a href="../../../i/n/c/Incandescent_light_bulb.html" title="Incandescent light bulb">Incandescent light bulb</a>," it would clearly be both POV and inaccurate to try to delete information about Edison's failed predecessors such as Humphry Davy, Swan, etc. Rather than deleting refences to Tesla because Tesla's radio company failed, it's more honest and professional to describe the wireless alternator history accurately. Unless there are earlier inventors, Tesla was the first to publicly employ these devices for wireless ...but they certainly were ignored until Alexanderson. -<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 22:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's an arc lamp, not a radio! Where in "My Inventions" does Tesla claim invention of radio? Surely he'd mention it. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 18:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
