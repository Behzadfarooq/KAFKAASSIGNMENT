	    <p><b>Alexander Dalzeel</b> (c. <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/1/1715.html" title="1715">1715</a>) was a 17th century pirate and former officer under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Avery_fcdc.html" title="Henry Avery">Henry Avery</a>.</p>
<p>Born in Port Patrick, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, Dalzeel went to sea as a child and, by the age of 23, Dalzeel now captained his own ship with six successful voyages under his belt. Earning a reputation of dishonesty, Dalzeel arrived in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madagascar.html" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in 1685 and soon enlisted into the ranks of Captain Avery.</p>
<p>According to pirate lore, Dalzeel participated in the capture of the treasure ship <i>Ganj-i-Sawai</i>, which carried The Great Mogul's daughter to her <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arranged_marriage.html" title="Arranged marriage">arranged marriage</a>. Avery, who had decided to take her as his own wife, gave Dalzeel his own ship and crew within Avery's fleet. Dalzeel would continue to serve under Avery until finally leaving for the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a> on his own.</p>
<p>However, upon their arrival in the Caribbean, the pirates search for were targets were fruitless. With their supplies slowly running short, starvation soon began to set in before a Spanish vessel was sighted. As the ship came into view, Dalzeel realized the Spanish ship was a well armed Spanish war galleon which had presumable become separated from its escorts. Despite their smaller size, Dalzeel ordered to close in on the ship.</p>
<p>Although the ship's captain had been informed of the ship's presence earlier, he felt it too small to be a threat and retired to his cabin for a game of cards. As the ship approached the galleon, Dalzeel ordered a hole to be drilled in the side of his own ship so as his crew would be forced to fight to the death. Catching the Spaniards completely off guard, the crew offered little resistance as Dalzeel's crew boarded the galleon. Within minutes the ship was theirs and, storming into the Captain's quarters, demanded his surrender at gunpoint.</p>
<p>After sailing his prize to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, Dalzeel was captured while attempting to capture a fleet of twelve Spanish pearl ships escorted by a Spanish <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man-o-war.html" title="Man-o-war">man-o-war</a>. In exchange for his surrender, Dalzeel and his crew were not forced into slavery or hard labor as was common practice for captured pirates.</p>
<p>Released ashore, Dalzeel soon made his way back to Jamaica where he began outfitting another ship soon sailing for <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Again the outnumbered crew was captured by a Spanish naval patrol of three warships bound for <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a>, where he was sentenced to be hanged at sea. Dalzeel however, quickly made his escape after stabbing a guard and using two empty jugs to float to shore. Soon encountering another band of pirates, Dalzeel was able to convince them to attack and successfully capture the warship which had held him prisoner. As the pirates neared Jamaica, their ship was wrecked and sunk in a sudden storm although Dalzeel was able to survive the storm in a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canoe.html" title="Canoe">canoe</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession_0fca.html" title="War of the Spanish Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, Dalzeel was granted a French commission as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privateer.html" title="Privateer">privateer</a> enjoying considerable success against British and allied nations against <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Louis_XIV_34e8.html" title="King Louis XIV">King Louis XIV</a> before his eventual capture in 1712. Taken back to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, he was tried and convicted of treason and sentenced to be drawn, hanged and quartered. However, on behalf of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Mar_0b1b.html" title="Earl of Mar">Earl of Mar</a>, Dalzeel received a royal pardon and, upon his release, sailed for French waters where he captured a French ship. He then had the captured crew's necks tied to their heels and thrown overboard to watch them drown.</p>
<p>Eventually captured in Scotland, he was returned to London where he was hanged on December 15, 1715.</p>
