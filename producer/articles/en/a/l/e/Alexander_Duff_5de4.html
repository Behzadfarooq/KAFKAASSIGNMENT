<p>After an adventurous voyage during which he was twice shipwrecked, Duff arrived in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> on May 27, 1830. He at once identified himself with a policy which had far-reaching effects. Christian missions in India had been successful only in converting a few low-caste groups from a needy socio-economic background. The upper caste <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> communities had been practically untouched. Duff shrewdly assessed that these affluent communities could not be accessed by traditional evengelical methods. He recognised that holding out the prospect of upward mobility, by offering a western education, would bring the children of the affluent classes into his range of influence, which could then be extended to encompass religion. Duff devised the policy of an educational mission. The success of his work had the effect:</p>
<ol>
<li>of altering the policy of the government of India in matters of education;</li>
<li>of securing the recognition of education as a missionary agency by Christian churches at home; and,</li>
<li>of securing entrance for Christian ideas into the minds of high-caste Hindus.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Duff_5de4.html" title="Edit section: Education in English">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education in English</span></h2>
<p>Duff opened a school in which all kinds of secular subjects were taught, from the rudiments upwards to a university standard, alongside the Bible. The English language was used as the medium of instruction on the grounds that it was the key to Western knowledge. Duff wrote a pamphlet on the question, entitled <i>A New Era of the English Language and Literature in India</i>. A government minute was adopted on March 7, 1835, to the effect that in higher education, the object of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">British government in India</a> should be the promotion of European science and literature among the natives of India, and that all funds appropriated for purposes of education would be best employed on English education alone.</p>
<p>Within the British Indian community of that era, there were not lacking those 'Orientalists' who saw value in the traditional learning of India and wished to support and encourage it. They opposed Duff's policy of stringently disregarding the same while assiduously promoting the spread of western education, culture and religion. In 1939, the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Auckland_1c9a.html" title="Earl of Auckland">earl of Auckland</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-general_of_India_d743.html" title="Governor-general of India">governor-general of India</a>, yielded to them and adopted a policy which was a compromise between the two perspectives.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Duff_5de4.html" title="Edit section: The institute(s)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The institute(s)</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after landing in India in 1830, Duff opened his institution in a house located at upper Chitpur Road in the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorasanko.html" title="Jorasanko">Jorasanko</a> neighbourhood of Calcutta. The house was made available to him by Feringhi Kamal Bose, an affluent Hindu. The school soon began to expand into a missionary college, known as the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Church_College%2C_Calcutta_805a.html" title="Scottish Church College, Calcutta">General Assembly's Institution</a>. In 1834, Duff returned to Britain broken in health. During this sojourn, He succeeded in securing the approval of his church for his educational plans, and in arousing much interest in the work of foreign missions. In 1836, the Calcutta institution was moved to Gorachand Bysack's house in the Garanhata neighbourhood. On 23rd February 1837, Mr. MacFarlon, the Chief Magistrate of Calcutta, laid the foundation stone for a new building belonging to the mission itself. The building was designed by Mr. John Gray construction was superintented by Capt. John Thomson, both of the <a href="../../../h/e/i/HEIC_d66d.html" title="HEIC">HEIC</a>. The construction of the building was completed in 1839.</p>
<p>In 1840, Duff returned to India. At the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disruption_of_1843.html" title="Disruption of 1843">Disruption of 1843</a>, Duff sided with the Free Church. He gave up the college buildings, with all their effects, and with unabated courage set to work to provide a new institution, which came to be known as the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Church_College%2C_Calcutta_805a.html" title="Scottish Church College, Calcutta">Free Church Institution</a> (these two institutions founded by Duff, i.e., the General Assembly's Institution and the Free Church Institution would be merged later to form the Scottish Churches College. After the unification of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, the institution would be known as <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Church_College_202e.html" title="Scottish Church College">Scottish Church College</a>). He had the support of Sir <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Outram_1c38.html" title="James Outram">James Outram</a> and Sir <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Lawrence_f483.html" title="Henry Lawrence">Henry Lawrence</a>, and the encouragement of seeing a new band of converts, including several young men born of high caste. In 1844, governor-general <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount_Hardinge_0eb3.html" title="Viscount Hardinge">Viscount Hardinge</a> opened government appointments to all who had studied in institutions similar to Duff's institution. In the same year, Duff co-founded the <i>Calcutta Review</i>, of which he served as editor editor from 1845 to 1849.</p>

<p>In 1849, Duff returned to Britain. He was moderator of the Free Church assembly in 1851. He gave evidence before various Indian committees of parliament on matters of education. This led to an important despatch by <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount_Halifax_8519.html" title="Viscount Halifax">Viscount Halifax</a>, president of the board of control, to governor-general the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess_of_Dalhousie_4b0b.html" title="Marquess of Dalhousie">marquess of Dalhousie</a>, authorizing an educational advance in primary and secondary schools; the provision of technical and scientific teaching; and the establishment of schools for girls. In 1854, Duff visited the United States, where what is now <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a> gave him the degree of L.L.D.; he was already D.D. of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>In 1856, Duff returned to India, where the mutiny broke out the following year; his descriptive letters written during this period were collected in a volume entitled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Indian_Mutiny_d5fa.html" title="The Indian Mutiny">The Indian Mutiny</a> - its Causes and Results (1858)</i>. During this stint in India, Duff gave much thought and time to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Calcutta_57d2.html" title="University of Calcutta">University of Calcutta</a>, which owes its examination system and the prominence given to physical sciences to his influence. In 1863, Sir <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Charles_Trevelyan%2C_1st_Baronet_b5ae.html" title="Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet">Charles Trevelyan</a> offered him the post of vice-chancellor of the University, but his health compelled him to leave India. As a memorial of his work, the Duff Hall was erected in the centre of the educational buildings of Calcutta.</p>
<p>In 1864, Duff visited <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, and on his return, became convener of the foreign missions committee of the Free Church. He raised money to endow a missionary chair at New College, Edinburgh, and himself became first professor. Among other missionary labors of his later years, he helped the Free Church mission on <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Nyassa_19cb.html" title="Lake Nyassa">Lake Nyassa</a>, travelled to <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> to inspect a mission at <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, and assisted Lady Aberdeen and Lord Polwarth to establish the Gordon Memorial Mission in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natal.html" title="Natal">Natal</a>. In 1873, the Free Church was threatened with a schism owing to negotiations for union with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Presbyterian_Church_f064.html" title="United Presbyterian Church">United Presbyterian Church</a>. Duff was called to the chair, and guided the church through this crisis. He also took part in forming the alliance of Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian system.</p>
<p>Alexander Duff died on February 12, 1878. By his will, he devoted his personal property to found a lectureship on foreign missions on the model of the <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bampton_Lectures_742f.html" title="Bampton Lectures">Bampton Lectures</a>.</p>
