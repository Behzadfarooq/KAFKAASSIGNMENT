<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Smith_24ba.html" title="Edit section: 2005 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2005 season</span></h3>
<p>Entering training camp, 49ers coach <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Nolan_fd6c.html" title="Mike Nolan">Mike Nolan</a> declared an open competition between Smith and incumbent <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Rattay_83a3.html" title="Tim Rattay">Tim Rattay</a> for the starting quarterback position. Rattay won out and started the first four games of the season. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, however, Nolan declared Smith the starter for the fifth game, against the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>. He was injured the next week on a scramble when hit by <a href="../../../l/a/v/LaVar_Arrington_b917.html" title="LaVar Arrington">LaVar Arrington</a> when the 49ers lost to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>.</p>
<p>He threw his first touchdown on January 1, 2006 against the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Texans_c5f6.html" title="Houston Texans">Houston Texans</a>. He struggled mightily through his first NFL season throwing for 875 yards, completing just 50.9% of his throws (84/165), along with one touchdown, 11 interceptions and 11 fumbles to finish with a 40.8 <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passer_rating.html" title="Passer rating">passer rating</a>; that touchdown came in the 49ers' last game of the season.</p>
<p>His rookie statistics are among the worst of any rookie in NFL history, and many have attributed it to his long windup throwing motion, and the spectacularly poor play of the rest of the offense - the offensive line in particular. Speculation also arose over a report that Smith's hands were too small for an NFL quarterback, but at the NFL combine his hands were measured and rank average among NFL quarterbacks.</p>
<p>Though Smith had an unimpressive first season, his final two games, against the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">Rams</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Texans_c5f6.html" title="Houston Texans">Texans</a> were his two best of the year. In St. Louis, He completed 12 of 16 passes and threw no interceptions en route to a 98.7 rating and a win for his team. In Monster Park against Houston, Smith threw his first touchdown, and won the game in overtime.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Smith_24ba.html" title="Edit section: 2006 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006 season</span></h3>
<p>After the challenges faced by his rookie campaign, Smith went into the 2006 season with a new offensive coordinator (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Norv_Turner_4ec4.html" title="Norv Turner">Norv Turner</a>) and an improved set of offensive weapons around him. The 49ers spent their top draft choice on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Davis_a142.html" title="Vernon Davis">Vernon Davis</a>, a playmaking tight end from Maryland. They also upgraded their wide receiver corps and traded underachieving running back <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevan_Barlow_61e7.html" title="Kevan Barlow">Kevan Barlow</a> to the Jets, making <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Gore_2b75.html" title="Frank Gore">Frank Gore</a> the feature back.</p>
<p>Smith also spent the offseason working daily with his new coordinator, wide recievers and tight end, while working to improve his technique and add bulk. The improved offensive cast clearly helped Smith develop in his second year, especially early. Smith's first three games of the season saw him thow three touchdowns, no interceptions, and 814 yards. After struggling in Kansas City, he then threw for three touchdowns in one game against the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, setting a career high.</p>
<p>The next seven games saw Smith struggle again, averaging only 153 yards per game while throwing only 6 touchdowns and 9 interceptions. Despite these struggles, he lead the 49ers on a three game winning streak in November. However, after rather difficult losses to the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis Rams</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_Saints_b2f5.html" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>, Smith's poor play began to be viewed as holding the team back.</p>
<p>In need of a statement game, the 49ers traveled to Seattle for a Thursday Night Football game against their division rivals the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Seahawks_2af6.html" title="Seattle Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>. During the broadcast on NFL Network, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Collinsworth_0738.html" title="Chris Collinsworth">Chris Collinsworth</a> noted that were he starting an NFL fanchise, he'd take the Broncos rookie quarterback <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Cutler_%28football_player%29_b9ed.html" title="Jay Cutler (football player)">Jay Cutler</a> before Alex Smith and fellow rookies Matt Leinart and Vince Young - and that Smith wasn't even close to the others.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Going into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were trailing the Seahawks 7-3, and pulling out a win looked unlikely. Smith however performed exceptionally in the fourth quarter, and drove the 49ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early, taking a narrow 10-7 lead. Late in the quarter, with the same score, Smith struck again with one of the most memorable plays of the NFL season - shaking off an almost certain sack, rolling to the left and completing a pass to Frank Gore for a touchdown to give the 49ers a 10 point lead. On the next drive, Smith cemented the victory by leading yet another touchdown drive, and rushing for a touchdown on a naked bootleg. Upon seeing Smith's fourth quarter, Collinsworth was forced to recant his earlier statement, saying <i>"Alex Smith is the best I've ever seen him. That drive is the best I saw."</i> and <i>"One of the best plays I have seen this season. What a second-half he has had!"</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After losing to the Cardinals the following week, the 49ers final game of the 2006 season was against a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> team looking for a playoff berth. In a major upset, the 49ers defeated the Broncos and knocked them out of the playoffs. During the game at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile_High_Stadium_9a4f.html" title="Mile High Stadium">Mile High Stadium</a>, Smith threw for 194 yards and a touchdown, leading the team to a come from behind victory for the second time in three weeks.</p>
<p>Overall, Smith improved significantly in his second year. He threw for 16 TDs, 16 interceptions, 2,890 yards and a 74.8 quarterback rating, all dramatic improvements over his rookie year.</p>
