<p>Off topic: be careful when you call 25 December the "Catholic Christmas day". And now for the real thing: can I wish you Happy Hanuka? If so, ברשות, לחיים! (sorry, wrong order, I know, should come out as "b'rshut, lekhaim")</p>
<p>As for the people who now find themselves acting in a bad movie, I hope the season of good will, will provide a good issue to all of this mess.

<p>I've read your comments here and there, and I feel the same as you about the loss of good editors in the past few days (let's hope they come back); and it's actually upsetting me, as I can tell it is you. I know we both have experience of Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish editors, many of whom make Giano look like a mouse: they include some of my favourite editors—I mean characters like Ghirla, Piotrus, Irpen, and Halibutt—because they are so hard-working and brilliant. It depresses me when their work is distracted by any of this wretched civility lawyering: I hope we don't lose anyone more of the great "mastodon" or bulldog article-making wikipedians, because they are some of the best we have. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 19:06, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex, thanks for your message on my page. Do you know if Ghirlandajo is really out of here, or just on a very determined wikibreak? He doesn't even reply to e-mail, so it's not looking good...

<dd>Yes, I asked him to create an account to <i>answer your accusations against WikIran</i> - he is the main administrator there (and I assume he started the project) and I believe he has a <i>right to know when someone is attacking that project and making libelous and bad-faith accusations</i>. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhodavand_fbc2.html" title="User:Khodavand">Khodavand</a> 11:09, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, do not fight. So far nothing is worth fighting. WikiIran seems to be so far small but harmless site. If it will be moved to a user or portal space it is fine, left in the main space - no big deal either. The Hessam's references show only some civil talk on the WikiIran's talk pages, that would fit perfectly well to our talk pages as well (still better keep discussion Wikipedia business on Wikipedia's talk page and WikiIran's business on WikiIran). There is a theoretical possibility that WikiIran might become a new ED or WR, etc: the place there nasty personal attacks against our editors are started and there all sorts of stupid flashmob actions are coordinated. If it will become true we would have to purge the references to the site and ban their most active contributors. I am sure the creators of WikiIran are smarter than that. Otherwise see no harm from the new site or the article about it. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 11:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Question: what is "ED" and "WR"? Anyway I appreciate your rational comments on this issues. There is nothing bad faith about WikIran that I can see (and I am an editor there) and I am positive it would never go in a bad-faith direction. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhodavand_fbc2.html" title="User:Khodavand">Khodavand</a> 11:12, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Article was deleted as "non-notable based on WP:WEB and WP:RS" - but those are guidelines, so is there a point to take it to deletion review or let it go? You suggest a move to portal space - how is this done? <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhodavand_fbc2.html" title="User:Khodavand">Khodavand</a> 11:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello Alex Bakharev. It is problems with Halibutt again, I know that he and other his Polish friends trusts you, so I thought that maybe you could help in this case again. I do not going to describe his "left" of wikipedia (in quite a disruptive style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Halibutt/News&amp;oldid=96116194" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Halibutt/News&amp;oldid=96116194" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) but by his "left" he his doing disruptive edits again - mocking from Lithuanian language again - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALaurynas_Gucevi%C4%8Dius&amp;diff=100636190&amp;oldid=100636137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALaurynas_Gucevi%C4%8Dius&amp;diff=100636190&amp;oldid=100636137" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>; uses nonconstructive edit summaries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vilnija&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vilnija&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, mocking from living persons (violation of living persons biography) by adding various names <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnija" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnija" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> like Kazimierz Garszwa instead of <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazimieras_Gar%C5%A1va_0513.html" title="Kazimieras Garšva">Kazimieras Garšva</a>.

<p>M.K., the incivilities you mention are relatively minor. Halibutt is just returned after some crisis with his relations with other editors and I do not want to start the thing again.

<dd>I will try to do as you say, but i do not know how long, if such behavior will continue.

<li>There are many conflicts in these regions. So people understandably do not trust each others and keep the battleground mentalities. If we ban all such editors there will be almost no development in these areas. If we ban some but not the others we could get highly biased articles.

<dd>The Arabs in Khuzestan are immigrants. Some from Qajar times like Bani-Torof. Thus they are not only not indigenous, but they are non-indigenous relative to the Indo-Iranian elemnts of the aea and you brought the issue up. You know how much the claim <i>indigenous</i> has to do with land claims. (Look at Israel and Palestine). Thus this needs to be mentioned. As per the so called groups, it is well knownn that Saddam supported Arabic separatist groups you mentioned and thus their POV is not valid either. Critism from human rights organization directly refer to reports from these groups and it needs to be mentioned that these groups had an input on those reports. As per the treatment of Shi'ites in the Arab world, this will have an entry. It doesn't matter if it raises your suspicisions or not, since it is a valid entry. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 21:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">User:Oden</a> is doing useful and unthankful job of enforcing our increasingly more strict policies of the fair use image by patrolling old images. It is a delicate task there it is critical to explain users that how their images that were celebrated catch just a few months ago now are considered shameful policy violations. Obviously, the users should receive all the explanations over the policy changes, be encouraged to find the free equivalents of the fair use, there should be an honest dialog over their reasons while the free images are unsuitable for the articles. The most important the users should not feel that tagging of their images is a sort of a personal harassment or a vendetta. I am not sure Oden is doing a right thing in this respect. He has chosen to patrol the fair use images based on the uploader. Often he has a disagreement with a user, then "review" all his her image over years. As a result the uploader feels harassed and persecuted even if Oden's claims are valid. From the point of view of stimulating the search for free images mass tagging of images by a single uploader are counterproductive: if tagging one..two images per week stimulate users to find free substitutes or releasing the images under free copyright licenses, mass tagging just lead to apathy.</i></dd>

<dd><i>I have counted at least five different admins and two prolific users in good standing. Still after all this warnings he behaves exactly the same. E.g. after a mild personal attack from [[User:Kuban Kazak] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Yanukovych_brussels.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98960001" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Yanukovych_brussels.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98960001" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Oden within minutes started tagging Kuban's images: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Truda5.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98969006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Truda5.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98969006" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Vostok.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98969808" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Vostok.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98969808" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Moskmostnoch.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98970013" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Moskmostnoch.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98970013" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Zhovtnevaya.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98970119" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Zhovtnevaya.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98970119" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Artema3.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98970308" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Artema3.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98970308" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. He never had any ineterest in Kuban images. I wish to apply <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> but it is difficult not to see the usage of copyright issues as a weapon in a personal conflict, the thing a few admins including me specifically asked Oden not to do. Very similar methods are used by Oden in his personal conflict with Irpen. Irpen is not a problem user out of hundreds of the images he uploaded only a couple were found wrong but he does not take the stalking lightly. I specifically asked Oden to leave irpen's upload log along. Still after all these warnings Oden is still bragging about searching this log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlex_Bakharev&amp;diff=99783806&amp;oldid=99685766" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlex_Bakharev&amp;diff=99783806&amp;oldid=99685766" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.</i></dd>

<dd>Removing images tags without addressing the fundamental issue in apparent bad faith can be considered harmful.

Some of the images I tagged as replaceable (listed above), in other instances I added a detailed fair use rationale (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AZhovtnevaya.jpg&amp;diff=98988886&amp;oldid=98985988" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AZhovtnevaya.jpg&amp;diff=98988886&amp;oldid=98985988" rel="nofollow">diff 1</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AZolotyeVorotastar.jpg&amp;diff=98984883&amp;oldid=87138451" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AZolotyeVorotastar.jpg&amp;diff=98984883&amp;oldid=87138451" rel="nofollow">diff 2</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ALvovskiyeVorota.jpg&amp;diff=98984460&amp;oldid=85862207" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ALvovskiyeVorota.jpg&amp;diff=98984460&amp;oldid=85862207" rel="nofollow">diff 3</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Uruche2.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98984094" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Uruche2.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98984094" rel="nofollow">diff 4</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ABorisovskijtrakt.jp4&amp;diff=98983776&amp;oldid=84221037" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ABorisovskijtrakt.jp4&amp;diff=98983776&amp;oldid=84221037" rel="nofollow">diff 5</a>) <u>Alex: if my intention was to harass or stalk this user, why did I then add detailed fair use rationales to these images?</u></dd>

<dd>As for stalking, it is common practice at <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a> and other similar venues to examine and list the contributions of editors. Recent changes, new page and newbie patrollers also interact with users who disagree with them in a similar manner. If such behaviour is acceptable there it should also be acceptable elsewhere (or in contrast if such behaviour is unacceptable elsewhere it should also be unacceptable there). As I have stated before if a user makes an edit which indicates that they do not fully comprehened our policies then examening that user's logs and taking necessary action is not stalking. Of course I would prefer to interact with any user in a positive manner.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Stalking is a disruptive, out-of-process bad-faith edit. <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> says:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor."</dd>
<dd>"This does not include checking up on an editor to fix errors or violations of Wikipedia policy, nor does it mean reading a user's contribution log; those logs are public for good reason. The important part is the disruption - disruption is considered harmful."</dd>

<dd>I have much respect for Alex Bakharev, but I find Alex's continued insinuation that I violate <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> to be less than helpful. Consider events from my perspective: being reported to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> several times by users who do not comprehend our image use policies is very frustrating. Alex's repeated claim that I am a wiki-stalker can hardly be aimed at improving my experience.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Alex Bakharev also removed the copyright notice from Image:Yanukovych brussels.jpg (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AYanukovych_brussels.jpg&amp;diff=99048788&amp;oldid=98961128" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AYanukovych_brussels.jpg&amp;diff=99048788&amp;oldid=98961128" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but the image has been reported to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_2007_January_6_Images_e654.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2007 January 6/Images">Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2007 January 6/Images</a>. Alex knows that removing copyright tags applied in good faith is not proper etiquette, so I have to presume that Alex's action was based on an assumption that the copyright notice was added with malice. It wasn't, since the copyright status really is being called into question.</dd>

And how can a personal attack be "mild"? (Interestigly enough the edit which Alex refers to as the personal attack is the one that precedes the edit which I regarded as a personal attack. That makes two personal attacks.)</dd>

I also found it strange that <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">user:irpen</a> first uploaded a free image, replaced it with a fair use image (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nataliya_Dmytruk&amp;diff=46489826&amp;oldid=46489349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nataliya_Dmytruk&amp;diff=46489826&amp;oldid=46489349" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), and then did not make the rest of use aware of the existence of a free image when Irpen presented arguments for why the fair use image could not be considered replaceable.</dd>

<p>Hi the Arab speakers of Khuzestan are non-idigineous relative to the indo-Iranian population of the area and displaced them historically. Most of their major tribes came in during the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavid.html" title="Safavid">safavid</a> and <a href="../../../q/a/j/Qajar.html" title="Qajar">qajar</a> era. This is well known that after the Islamic conquest, many Iranians were brutually killed or wiped out. I am not sure if admins can take side on this issue, but I can definitely provide more than enough facts with this regards. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Persianism_by_Arabs" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Persianism_by_Arabs" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>]--<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 01:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought you were talking about modern emigrants from Saddam and post-Saddam Iraq. I think it is stronly POV to label as emigrants people who lived on the land for a millenium. By the same criterium Persian in Iran, Slavs in Russia and Anglo-Saxon in Britain are all non-indugineus immigrants. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 03:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Arabs have been living in Khuzestan since Sassanid times. Attempts to cast them as immigrants and not entitled to consideration or tolerance are racism pure and simple. Blaming current-day Arab citizens of Iran for actions committed 1300 years ago (actions that Ali is exagerrating) is also racism. I haven't been working on the Khuzestani articles for a while, being short on time, but I am quite familiar with the ethnic Persian nationalist viewpoint. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:25, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See the talk-page. The majority of Arabs of Khuzestan came during the Safavid and Qajar era. There is no Arab presence in Khuzestan before Islamic invasion of Iran. You are talking about Shapur and his settlement of Arabs around <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerman.html" title="Kerman">Kerman</a> based on Tabari. <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerman.html" title="Kerman">Kerman</a> is far from <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a>. As per racism, I think you need to look no further that some of the groups in that page were suppored directly by Saddam and Saddam expelled many Iranians from iraq and also killed many Iranians in Iraq (Kurds) and dropped chemical bombs on Iranian civilians and yet some of these groups mentioned in that page were backed by him. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 06:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, we have been trying to resolve this on the talk page. Though Khoikhoi hasn't been in agreement with the majority there, and instead s/he appears to be constantly pushing his own differing viewpoint onto the article. You will notice that when s/he reverts there is no reason given. As such would you please look at the recent entires to the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Talk%7EDistricts_of_Israel_45b5.html" title="Talk:Districts of Israel">talk page</a>.

<dd>That you are separatist is from the fact that you had statement in your page calling for <i>Arab unification</i>. You didn't deny it , but just erased it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ahwaz&amp;oldid=66070478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ahwaz&amp;oldid=66070478" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. So it is not accusation. And that is the political stance of the Ba'athist party and Saddam as well and Saddam was a racist. The other user Khorshid who is half Arab is discussing racism amongst arab separatist groups, so his accusation is valid. As per removing OR that is part of wikipedia rule. Specially when it comes to distorting history. I asked for names of Professors in major universities who agree with the historical manipulations made by Bani-Torof. You didn't respond neither did Zora. If you find such a Professor, and none exist actually, then it is perfectly valid source. Note nobody removed Amnesty international or HRW, even though their information is manipulated by separatist groups. But you can not reference separatist groups as making valid claims. Sites such as HRW and amnestry are okay. I would read Wikipedia's policy on OR and also the part that wikipedia is not a soap box. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 19:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. I am entitled to put what the hell I want on my user page, so long as it is within Wikipedia rules. Who are you to demand that people cannot put up a legitimate user box on their user page?</dd>
<dd>2. You state that it is the political stance of the Ba'athists to call for Arab unity and that means anyone who calls for Arab unity is a racist and a Saddam supporter. Consequently, you are calling me a racist simply because of a user box I had on my user page months ago. Get over your stupid paranoia about Arabs, will you? I find you deeply offensive.</dd>
<dd>3. There is nothing original in the sections you deleted unilaterally. It was all sourced. Your deletions are vandalism and you are a vandal.

<dd>You are entitled to do it. But then I am entitled to call you a separatist based on that since by definiton of the tag, you believe separating the arab speaking portion of Khuzestan. Thus you can not claim to be unbiased in the issue as you portray it. As per OR, you must refer to sites that are neutral. Sites that directly supported Saddam <a href="http://www.arabistan.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabistan.org/" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> and praise Gammal Abdel Naser <a href="http://www.arabistan.org/7_2007/zekra_jamal_abdolnaser.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabistan.org/7_2007/zekra_jamal_abdolnaser.htm" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> are not neutral. Note Iranian users did not delete amnesty or HRW although they are partially biased, but the other sites like the ones supporting Saddam are not neutral when it comes to sections on Human Rights. And note pan-arabism by its legacy has been racist politically. Since <i>Arab unity</i> does not take into account Iraq's diverse population and for example its result was the genocide of Kurds. Note the sites I removed contain both political support for the likes of Saddam and Gammal Abdel Naser and also advance historical revisionism (Bani-Torof's article which has been fully criticized in the talk page). If you want to create an article on historical revisionism by pan-arabist be my guess, but an article on Khuzestan should not contain OR. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 19:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have never supported separatism in Khuzestan, so get that straight. Nor are you unbiased - you clearly are, as is everyone. I can only see a passing reference to Saddam Hussein's execution on just one of those sites you have deleted (www.arabistan.org), which the site seems to oppose (as do many people, including many Kurds). It is just another bit of your paranoia. Note that Iranian nationalism has always tended to have a Persian chauvinist tendency. I don't know whether you are a Persian chauvinist, but you clearly have a problem with Arabs and Arab editors on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 20:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One point on the issue of Arab unity. The Arab unity user box contains the emblem of the Arab League, which Iran has said it wishes to join <a href="http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/031203/2003120313.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/031203/2003120313.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. Iran also sponsors organisations that support Arab unity. So how is calling for Arab unity anti-Iranian?--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 20:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Note Iran's government is not my concern. Pan-arabism is racist as shown by Saddam, Gamal abdel Naser and etc. The site has maps that have clearly separated Khuzestan regions of Iran (all the Lur,Bakhtiari, Persian parts) and even extends to Bushehr!. I am sorry but that is not a relible site by wiki-standard. I am all ears to people who are full Phds and have doctorates or encyclopedias. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 20:44, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But you also removed other sites - basically anything you can get away with. And Nasser was married to an Iranian! You can't get away with this "all Arabs are racist" nonsense. As for people with full PhDs, the director of the Ahwaz Human Rights Organisation is Dr Karim Abdian <a href="http://www.ahwazstudies.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=689&amp;Itemid=0&amp;lang=EN" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahwazstudies.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=689&amp;Itemid=0&amp;lang=EN" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, but you insist that this organisation is separatist and is not a reliable source.

<dd>Nasser was anti-Iranian and changed the name of Persian Gulf. I have a PhD also, the arabistan site is totally unreliable. The site is POV. It has a map claiming all of Khuzestan (which is mostly non-Arab) alongside Bushehr. It praises the likes of Saddam and Nasser (major propoent of pan-arabist nationalism) and those it is not a reliable academic site and can not be considered factual. Note its meering with HRW also shows why the reports were biased. As per director of Ahwaz is not a full professor with publications in peer-reviewed journals. He quotes historical revisionists like Bani-Torof. Thus it is not reliable (although much less radical than arabistan.org) site. Note I did not say all Arabs are racist, but I said when a matter of factual objectivity is at stake, we can only quote qualified academics who are recognized and have peer reviewed journals. Random web-sites (even if the owner has a PhD) does not account. Else I can create a website and put all of my ideologies and beliefs and quote it as fact in Wikipedia. This is against wikipedia's policy. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 23:00, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So, now a phd is not enough to be sourced by Wikipedia. All sources must be academic. Could I have clarification that this is Wikipedia rules? Also, there is a professor from Shaw Univesity in the US named Dr Ali Al-Taie who states that "The Arabs of Khuzistan/al-Ahwaz have been in the area before the Persians arrived. Ethnic Arabs maintained this presence as the allies under the Persian Achaemenis Empire (539-333 BC). Despite the various political changes, Arabs have remained subject to systematic 'Persianization' and have been deprived of their collective ethnic rights."<a href="http://www.aei.org/events/filter.,eventID.1166/summary.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aei.org/events/filter.,eventID.1166/summary.asp" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.

<dd>IS Professor Shaw a historian that writes on Achaemenid, elamite issues? I have not seen a single journal article or book about Achaemenid empire from him. Where are his articles in major journals on Achaemenid and elamite history. By the way if PhD is enough, then I will start quoting my own opinion. How is that?Please do not make a circus out of wikipedia. Each study has its own experts. Elamite/Achaemenid history has its own expert (Potts, Frye, Brian..etc.). AEI is also a political organization. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 23:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Alex, following Biophys accuses and his reverting of your edit article on Stomakhin I was arbitrarily blocked by English speaking users. It is evident that they cannot validate statements of Biophys that I have violated BLP. Is the court sentence is enough reliable source? This is now the most important matter in the dispute. By the way, if we would apply the same criteria to Stomakhin supporters statements they should be deleted too since they contradict to offcial materials, news articles and so on. Biophys wants only his sources to be in the article. It is evident he doesn't consent to any version made by you, me or Mikka. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.184.225.28_9c31.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.184.225.28">213.184.225.28</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.184.225.28.html" title="User talk:213.184.225.28">talk</a>) 07:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I agreed long time ago that the court sentence is enough reliable source. Only RKO site and citation by Sokolov are unreliable. If this citation does not appear, everything else can be hopefully negotiated. My position was not to use any unreliable defamatory sources at all (as Wikipedia requires). The compromise position is to describe the citation by Sokolov in general words (as I did it) but do not provide direct citation, since it contradicts the alleged source, and Sokolov himself do not refer to any source. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alex. I see that you removed the copyvio notice from this image. I don't want to just override another administrator's action, but all rights reserved means, well, all rights reserved. Nowhere do they say that they are permitting the image's use in all cases, or in any case. "If the image is used, attribution must be given" is not the same as "if attribution is given, the image may be used." The all rights reserve tag very clearly indicates that they could take action against those responsible for any use of the image that they disapproved of; thus the {{<a href="../../../a/t/t/Template%7EAttribution_e22d.html" title="Template:Attribution">attribution</a>}} tag is incorrect. This image should be deleted, and if you do not object I will do so. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 21:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
