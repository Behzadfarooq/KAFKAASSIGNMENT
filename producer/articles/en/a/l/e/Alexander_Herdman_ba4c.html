<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Herdman_ba4c.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Herdman was born in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunedin.html" title="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>. He studied at <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otago_Boys%27_High_School_882e.html" title="Otago Boys' High School">Otago Boys' High School</a>, and then gained a law degree while working part time. He was <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admitted_to_the_bar.html" title="Admitted to the bar">admitted to the bar</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>, and established a practice in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Naseby%2C_New_Zealand_dc54.html" title="Naseby, New Zealand">Naseby</a> the following year. He also worked in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmerston%2C_New_Zealand_4ccc.html" title="Palmerston, New Zealand">Palmerston</a>, where he joined the local <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> lodge. He would retain his connection with the Freemasons over his career, eventually grand master of the Grand Lodge of New Zealand.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Herdman_ba4c.html" title="Edit section: Early political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h2>
<p>Herdman began a political career in Naseby, being elected mayor in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>. He eventually decided to abandon this by moving to <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington.html" title="Wellington">Wellington</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>, but shortly after he arrived, he was invited to return and stand as a parliamentary candidate in Mt Ida, the electorate which encompassed Naseby. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1902_6751.html" title="New Zealand general election 1902">1902 election</a>, Herdman ran on a strongly anti-government platform, harshly criticising the governing <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Liberal_Party_1c8b.html" title="New Zealand Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a>. He was elected, and joined the unorganised group of independents who opposed the Liberals. He did not, however, move back to Naseby, instead representing his seat as an absentee.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1905_ed03.html" title="New Zealand general election 1905">1905 election</a>, Herdman was defeated. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1908_eb3f.html" title="New Zealand general election 1908">1908 election</a>, he contested the seat of Wellington North, and was elected. The following year, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Massey_8fda.html" title="William Massey">William Massey</a> organised the opposition into the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Reform_Party_4b81.html" title="New Zealand Reform Party">Reform Party</a>, which Herdman became part of.</p>
<p>One of Herdman's early concerns in Parliament was the reform of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_public_service_71de.html" title="New Zealand public service">public service</a>. Herdman believed that the service was poorly organised and subject to political patronage, particularly under the government of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Seddon_7356.html" title="Richard Seddon">Richard Seddon</a>. In the 1912 election, the Reform Party won office, and Herdman was able to push through his reform proposals â€” the Public Service Act of 1912 established uniform conditions of appointment and promotion, and established a supervisory commissioner.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Herdman_ba4c.html" title="Edit section: Ministerial career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ministerial career</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Cabinet_4434.html" title="New Zealand Cabinet">Cabinet</a>, Herdman served as <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney-General_%28New_Zealand%29_db3c.html" title="Attorney-General (New Zealand)">Attorney-General</a>, Minister of Justice, and Minister of Police. In these roles, he gained a reputation as a hard-liner, being described by a contemporary as "ready to employ force ruthlessly for the purpose of upholding law and order". Herdman is believed to have had a major role in the suppression of the <a href="../../../w/a/i/Waihi_miners%27_strike.html" title="Waihi miners' strike">Waihi miners' strike</a>, and of the waterfront strike the following year. Both were criticised by many left-wing groups as heavy-handed and repressive, but were defended by the government as necessary steps to preserve order. During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Herdman supported strong measures against anyone protesting New Zealand's participation. As Minister of Police, Herdman also responded harshly to attempts by police officers to form a union, prohibiting the move and attempting to drive the instigators out of the force.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Herdman_ba4c.html" title="Edit section: Judicial career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judicial career</span></h2>
<p>In addition to his political ambitions, Herdman was also interested in becoming a <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judge</a> of the (original) <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_New_Zealand_8d57.html" title="Supreme Court of New Zealand">Supreme Court</a>. As Attorney-General, he had powers to appoint judges, and in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, when a position became vacant, he appointed himself. This move was criticised by many as self-interested, especially as Herdman's career as a lawyer had not been particularly distinguished. He served as a judge both in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch%2C_New_Zealand_20a5.html" title="Christchurch, New Zealand">Christchurch</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland.html" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>, and briefly acted as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Justice_of_New_Zealand_d687.html" title="Chief Justice of New Zealand">Chief Justice</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, resigned from his judicial position to seek re-election to Parliament, contesting the Auckland seat of Parnell. He was officially an independent, although he had close links to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Democrat_Party_d3a9.html" title="New Zealand Democrat Party">Democrat Party</a>. He was unsuccessful, and subsequently retired to the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Okataina_6382.html" title="Lake Okataina">Lake Okataina</a> area. He died in <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotorua.html" title="Rotorua">Rotorua</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">13 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>.</p>
