<p>I edited the article to clarify that even if Prince Albert legitimates (in the sense of the private law) Alexandre by marrying Nicole Coste, or even by adopting him, it is not a certainty that such an action would legitimate Alexandre with respect to inheritance of the throne because at least some readings of the relevant Monegasque constitution and law of succession seem to preclude illegitimately born children (even if later legitimated). —<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanaxp_4e21.html" title="User:Ryanaxp">Ryanaxp</a> July 6, 2005 18:48 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Charlotte became an heir when her father, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_II%2C_Prince_of_Monaco_bd49.html" title="Louis II, Prince of Monaco">Louis II adopted</a> her. Her parents never married, making her illegitimate. As her father had no other children, he adopted her to keep Monaco from being reabsorbed by France. As he had several legitimate children and they had legitimate heirs, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainier_III%2C_Prince_of_Monaco_b72a.html" title="Rainier III, Prince of Monaco">Rainier</a> had that option removed as part of the constitutional change of 2002.<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 16 April 2006 03:30 CST</dd>

<li>Adoption is now no longer an option. Charlotte was adopted because there was no other choice. Monaco would have reverted to France. Under the 2002 constitutional change, only a legitimate child of married parents can be heir. No adopting. If it were possible, Albert might have adopted his nephew Andrea and bypassed the whole question.<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 12 April 2006 05:30 CST</li>

Their subsequent marriage legitimized them not only legally but allowed them to be placed into the line of succession. If they were placed into the line of succession by their parents subsequent marriage, I don't see why Monegasque law would differ if Prince Albert were to marry Nicole Coste.

<p>I understood children took their nationality from their father according to Monegasque law, therefore he would be Monegasque and the Ducruet children French citizens.</p>
<ul>
<li>The law recently changed in Monaco so that as long as one parent is Monegasque, their child can apply for Monaco citizenship. ALL of Stephanie's children are Monegasque though one father was French and the other neither French nor Monegasque. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 12 April 2006 05:30 CST</li>

<ul>
<li>Eric Alexandre is Monagasque, because his father is a monegasque. He don't need to apply for a citizenship. Daniel Ducruet and Stephano Casiraghi were granted the monegasque citizenship after their mariage, so their Children are Monegasque. Daniel citizenchip was taken back after the scandal. In Monaco, the father is the head of the family,that's why a child automatically takes his father citizenship. Up until recently, a child born with a monegasque mother couldn't takes her citizenship, unless the father was unknown.</li>

<p>The following have Monégasque nationality:</p>
<p>- <b>any person born in Monaco or abroad of a Monégasque father;</b></p>
<p>- any person born in Monaco or abroad of a mother born Monégasque who still had this nationality at the time of the birth and of an unknown father;</p>
<p>- any person born in Monaco of unknown parents.</p>
<p>With regards to legitimate offspring, Monégasque nationality is passed on without it being necessary to fulfill any other condition; on the other hand, in the case of natural offspring, this handing-on of nationality only takes place if the child is recognized or legitimized by marriage of its parents...<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParis7891_41d3.html" title="User:Paris7891">Paris7891</a></p>

<dd>The rules now are not retroactive. For example, if Camille Gottleib (daughter of Princess Stephanie) had been the daughter of a casino dealer, she would now have to file paperwork to claim citizenship as she was born when the rules were different. However, as a member of the Royal Family, she was given citizenship because of who her mother is and the claim of her father being 'unknown'.</dd>

<p>When exactly did Albert become sovereign Prince? Does a new Prince acsend the throne the moment his predecessor dies (as in the UK, Denmark, etc)? Was the enthronment ceremony <i>just a ceremony</i> or was it legally required to make him the sovereign? (<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphaboi867_e144.html" title="User:Alphaboi867">Alphaboi867</a> 02:34, 14 July 2005 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>Albert became Sovereign Prince technically at Rainier's death, though he wasn't officially called or recognized as such until he investiture in July, after the three months of official mourning had passed. The enthronement ceremony was held in a 'second part' in November as Albert wanted Monaco's National Day of November 19th to continue to be recognized. That has to do with when the Prince is enthroned becoming National Day. Albert wanted the same November date as his father but protocol demanded the official start of his reign in July. It was a political move. ____ From his legitimate birth, Albert was the Sovereign Hereditary Prince though he went by His Serene Highness/HSH Prince Albert. Now as the reigning Prince, he is His Serene Highness, The Sovereign Prince of Monaco, Albert II. Though he's still generally addressed as Prince Albert or Prince Albert II (for those that do their research). <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 12 April 2006 05:30 CST</li>

<p>I wanted to add that changing Eric Alexandre to Alexandre will be a waste. His legal name is important to note, no matter what his mother wants the press to call him. Nicole ideally wants the kid to become legitimate. Should Albert actually do it, the kid would be Prince Eric. Yes, people use different names than their given birth names. But in this kid's case, his legal name is what binds him. He is not a Grimaldi. People would be looking for Eric Coste. By leaving Eric Alexandre, it allows for people to find Eric or Alexandre. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 12 April 2006 05:30 CST</p>

<dd>I wasn't trying to start a war. Technically, he should be called Eric only. The press refers to him both ways, depending upon if they're using information from previous interviews by Nicole Coste. I think a fair compromise is Eric Alexandre, allowing for both names to found in a search. ______As for my edit comment, it was a tad harsh. I'm not a CAPS ABUSER. So consider it overdone and this an official admission to such.____Regarding my above talk comment, if his name isn't Marie-Ségolène Royal Chirac II, then no one should call him that, it wouldn't be official. Nicole can call her kid Albert Rainier II if she wants and wikipedia would need to title the main article that, but the article itself should call him by his real name until he decides what it is or his father titles him something else. That is my only point. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 06:40, 18 April 2006 (CST)</dd>

<p>This is a part of Nicole interiew in PM: Page 57: Q: Quels prénoms avez vous choisis? A: D'abord nous l'avons appelé <b>Eric</b> <b>Alexandre</b> <b>Stéphane</b>. Je n'aimais pas Eric,et finalement, Albert non plus. Il a été d'accord pour le changement et a financé la procedure.Notre fils s'appelle Alexandre qui est aussi le deuxième prénom d'Albert. Il porte mon nom de famille.</p>

<p>.... Et, dans les jours qui suivent, un officier d'état civil de la mairie du XIVe arrondissement devrait ajouter le nom prestigieux du père, Grimaldi, à l'acte de naissance d'un certain <b>Alexandre</b> <b>Eric</b> <b>Stéphane</b>, né dans l'anonymat le 24 août 2003, à 18 h 45, à l'hôpital Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, à Paris…</p>

<dd>I'm not disavowing his name. His mother choses to address him by one name to the press. The legal papers she filed with the French court seeking support state an different name. Even Prince Albert now refers to him as "the kid" because Nicole got mad after he called him Eric--even though its his legal name.</dd>

<dd>Hektor, if you want it straightened out, stop changing what is correct. I am working from French legal papers. You are working from an article that appeared in a French "US Weekly"-like magazine--you even cite paragraph and verse directly above this reply. Because the Palace of the Prince will not comment and Nicole is holding back from further interviews after reactions, this is what there is to work with. If magazines trump legal papers, this is a poor article indeed. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 08:57, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In a statement reaffirming neither of his current recognized children will be in the line of succession, Albert referred to his son as Eric Alexandre. Also, Nicole's legal papers have been dismissed as a settlement has been made. BOTH of his parents have now addressed the child as Eric Alexandre, so any further changing of his name is silly. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 20 June 2006 05:40 {UTC}</p>

<p>I added the lines regarding the child being given Royal staus, the name Grimaldi and addressed as Prince <b>Eric</b>. This is what an interviewer asked Prince Albert. He said it would not happen (as there are many other options), but that the interviewer was correct in what might be done. Since I have the source of the information, including the exact wording, I am curious as to why someone would change it to Prince Alexandre. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphabeter_a441.html" title="User:Alphabeter">Alphabeter</a> 23:48, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anyone know why an image was requested? The only ones that wiki can afford are through the Paris Match article, which was already deemed inappropriate.
