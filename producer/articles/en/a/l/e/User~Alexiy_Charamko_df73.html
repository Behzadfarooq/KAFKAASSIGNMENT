<p>Alexiy was born in Russia on the 27th of January 1990. He likes to play soccer, study for unimportant tests, study for important tests, study for no apparent reason at all and just plain study.</p>
<p>Alexiy has lived in the USA for most of his life and currently resides in Sydney, Australia. This is where he picked up his shit and threw it in the lake only to realise that he sucked at counterstrike 1.6, counterstrike source and warcraft 3 really badly, lol.</p>
<p>When a friend was enquired about the suckyness of Alexiy's counter strike 1.6 skills, they recalled a time when in de_dust 2, alexiy was camping near the T spawn just outside the tunnels, and he expected his friend to come out of the tunnels and kill him, but he came from the T spawn instead and shot him in the face, lol. ^_^</p>
<p>It was also recalled by the same friend that in warcraft 3 DotA one time, goodall was on level 16 and they were on level 13 and the other people were on 13 or 12. Alexiy was on level 8.</p>
<p>uhh what else... oh yeah! It is alleged by that friend again that playing certain counter strike sound files in conjunction can bring great mirth to Alexiy, as well as objects in visual python arranged in a certain fashion.</p>
<p>Oh, lol and there was that time where Alexiy let off some smoke grenades in the bathroom of the house in cs_militia and had a 'rave' in the bath tub. His friend came and they let off some flash grenades as strobes and moshed in the bathtub, whilst throwing their weapons at each other. It ended when alexiy shot him. &gt;:( b*tch</p>
<p>Another mate of his remembers a time when Alexiy was especially stingy and ran around looking for a 10¢ coin on the oval</p>
<p>"I think my sister has a dollar somewhere" was Alexiy's response when a friend told him that he owed him some money at a birthday party where Alexiy had given his friend a burnt computer game as a gift.</p>

<p>On the 21st of July 2006 Alexiys Gmail user account was hacked lol (or so he says), two emails were sent from his account while it was compromised. One where he claims to be in love with the person who received the email, and one (sent to at least 50 people) where he openly states his homosexuality (i knew he'd come out of the closet sooner or later).</p>
<p>Alexiy points out one of the indicators that the email was not sent by him is that he signs his emails off as the following:</p>
<p>ASC</p>
<p>v-o-x-y-n</p>
<p>whereas the 'hacker' signed the emails as:</p>
<p>-ASC-</p>
<p>v-o-x-y-n</p>
<p>with the extra hyphens. Also, the spelling and grammar was really bad, even below alexiy's level of communication. This may have been purposely done by the 'hacker' in order to make alexiy seem unintelligible.</p>

<p>Alexiy is also known to enjoy Rantcore, LOLCORE (capitalisation preserved), Progressive Breakcore and Post-Emotive-Hardcore-Punk-Rock (aka emo). He really loves emo, and wearing tight girly jeans.</p>
