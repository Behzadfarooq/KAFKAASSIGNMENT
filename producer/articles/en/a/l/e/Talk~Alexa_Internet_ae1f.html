<dd>The information about Alexa support of other browsers is very misleading at its website. One place contradicts another. In order to support representativeness of the sample Alexa says one thing: "Alexa's sample includes users of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Mozilla browsers." and "Alexa sample includes toolbars built for Windows, Macintosh and Linux." <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. However, when I tried to download a toolbar for linux/firefox, Alexa's website tells quite a different story and encourages me to create one myself <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=127" class="external autonumber" title="http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=127" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. One question is unclear: if somebody creates this toolbar, will Alexa count visits generated by this toolbar or not? IMHO, Alexa should disclose the sample size on which its ratings are based. Howard Metzenberg estimated this sample to be around 180,000 in 2003 <a href="http://forums.seochat.com/alexa-ranking-49/how-accurate-is-alexa-4536.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.seochat.com/alexa-ranking-49/how-accurate-is-alexa-4536.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, but now it seems not possible to reestimate using the same method, since Alexa no longer shoing the daily data of low traffic websites on which that estimation was based. Information about number of downloads of the toolbar really tells nothing. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Kosorukoff_b17c.html" title="User:Alex Kosorukoff">Alex Kosorukoff</a> 03:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You could ask Alexa how they count. My understanding of their methodology is that any application that uses their service gets counted. Essentially, related links is a web service, and traffic stats are computed from an analysis of this service's web logs. So if you created a Linux Alexa client, it could contribute to Alexa's stats.</dd>

<dd>Are the Alexa traffic rankings determiend solely by this toolbar (this is all I've read). This seems like it would lead to a huge selection sampling bias in the stats produced by this.

<dd>One problem is that Alexa has changed greatly over the years, going from a startup whose focus was to provide related links (that is, you're looking at a web page, what else might you want to see) to its acquisition by Amazon, where for a year it was focused on creating a comparison shopping service called zBubbles (which only barely went live, in the sense that the service was barely promoted), and since then, has largely been known for collecting and publishing statistics on the popularity of websites. In this role, many webmasters use Alexa's free stats as a way to tell how they are doing vs competing sites.</dd>

<dd>I agree, the article does need a major rewrite. I'd be happy to fill in details about the company if needed -- I was there before and after the Amazon acquisition. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 05:54, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree completely with you. I was extremely puzzled, I had a very very vague notion after reading the article.

<p>I believe Alexa bills itself as the "Web Information Company". The Alexa toolbar tries to make your browsing easier by providing information on "Where you are" and "Where to go next". The Alexa website give the same information as the toolbar, but in greater detail and without requiring you to install a toolbar. More details on Alexa are available at <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/company/index.html" class="external free" title="http://pages.alexa.com/company/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.alexa.com/company/index.html</a> and at <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/company/history.html" class="external free" title="http://pages.alexa.com/company/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.alexa.com/company/history.html</a> These pages give a much better picture than this article. The way Alexa determines its web traffic numbers is described at <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" class="external free" title="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html</a></p>

<dd>I have some experience with Alexa's numbers. I wrote the first scripts Alexa used to generate site traffic reports. I suspect the methodology and sampling issues are similar, if not the same, as what I first did for Alexa in 1998. Note, I'm not offering that we put original research into the article, only that I am willing to help interpret primary documentation on how the service works for the purpose of this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One point I note is that, while I was there, Alexa was not IE only, but was also built into Netscape as the "What's Related" feature. We also offered a bookmarklet version of the tool for AOL and Mac users. Prior to the bookmarklets, there was a Mac toolbar as well. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 02:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any discussion of whether an off-site link should be included prominently that doesn't at least pay passing mention to the 65 character's worth of Wikipedia's attention to the street address of the company (in the first faqqin paragraph no less, which is great) that were previously deemed appropriate, and were also left by the most recent reverter/updater will be a fun discussion in which to participate.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the subject of my initial sumission, a primary motivation was the inappropriateness of the word "website" being made to be a link to the Wikipedia article on website, at least as it was in the then current version of the article. It just didn't fit with current norms or current online grammer. Simply put, if you're gonna allow an article about something that is, essentially, a web site.</p>
<p>Additionally, if somewhat disconnectedly: if you're going to furthermore ordain that if someone who comes to wikipedia.org and searches for "alexa.com" is then REDIRECTED without explanation to an entry that doesn't include "alexa.com", then perhaps the prominent inclusion of the site in question is in order. -:)<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzyslovechild_ce2d.html" title="User:Ozzyslovechild">Ozzyslovechild</a> 02:15, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi everyone. have you ever typed the name of a website and read the details about how alexa does its traffic ranking? i find it really confusing. for exemple in the part called "what is reach?", they talk both about percentages and million users. let's take wikipedia as an exemple.&#160;;-) if the figure "reach per million users" is written 30,860, does it mean that 30,860 million users went on it? or is it the percentage of a million of users. so only around 30,860 people went? or 30,860 people in a million..which means that on a population of 10 million people you multiply it by 10? why then choose such a weird way of calculating? instead of an easy percentage or total number of users?!!! seriously..how can such a confusing method based on fancy way to rank the traffic be famous and successful... thanks for your help if you can give more explanation about it. Manzanita.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's the number of people who watch it out of every million who use the internet (and run alexa). The reason they don't use percentages is that some sites have 1 person in a million watching - 0.0001% - and this is a bit small as a percentage. For example, my company's site, <a href="http://www.forbidden.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.forbidden.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Forbidden Technologies</a>, has a few people out of every million watching it. % is per hundred - and for rarer events, people use per thousand or per million or per billion. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 21:18, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>ok thank you Stephen, i better understand. so for exemple 30,860 "reach per million users" means that as alexa is supposed to have 10 million people using its toolbar, then it means that basically 308 600 people of these 10 million using the toolbar go on wikipedia. which is anyway 3% of those users. i just still find that their explanation in "what's this?" is confusing..ranking.com looks for exemple clearer, even if their sample of people is only of 200,000 people using their BrowserAccelerator toolbar. thanks anyway.
