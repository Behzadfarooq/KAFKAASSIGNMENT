<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is the Correct Spelling of Mr. Jones's Middle Name?</span></h2>
<p>Is the correct spelling of Mr. Jones's middle name Emerick or Emric?</p>
<p>In the below Travis County, Texas document it lists an Alexander Emerick Jones:</p>
<p>Travis County Commissioners' Court Minutes, March 24, 1998:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.co.travis.tx.us/commissioners_court/minutes/1998/03/980324vs.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.co.travis.tx.us/commissioners_court/minutes/1998/03/980324vs.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.co.travis.tx.us/commissioners_court/minutes/1998/03/980324vs.pdf</a></p>
<p>Alex Jones is highly active in the local politics where he lives and has been for some time, so I would be somewhat surprised if that's not a reference to him. Austin, where Alex Jones lives, is the county seat of Travis County.</p>
<p>I'm the one who originally put the "Emerick" spelling in the Wikipedia article, based on the fact that that was the only "Alexander Emerick/Emric/etc. Jones" that I found doing a Google search, i.e., in the above document. I've heard Alex Jones say his middle name on air, but he didn't spell it. This Wikipedia article on Alex Jones has had the "Emerick" spelling for some time now. Google still lists no other spelling variation on the name Emerick/Emric other than "Alexander Emerick Jones."</p>
<p>An edit was only made to the "Emric" spelling on 15:00, 27 February 2006 by 81.153.133.216 ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Jones_%28journalist%29&amp;oldid=41465109" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Jones_%28journalist%29&amp;oldid=41465109" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Jones_%28journalist%29&amp;oldid=41465109</a> ), and of whom left no comment concerning the edit.</p>
<p>So which spelling is the correct one?--209.208.77.177 00:21, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">All-Being</span></h2>
<p><i>Is anything NOT truth?</i> Knowledge is the light revealing that which was unknown. If we are honest with ourselves, then we will be honest with the world around us, from perception to communication. We owe ourselves to face every aspect, every facet, of life, and accommodate each one, even if they do not agree. Let us learn to befriend ourselves and others, and treat our own lives as a devoted farmer would his beloved animals. All life has its place, even if some parts of it kill other parts. Even if one cannot exist in the presence of the other, both still exist. Basically, we just need to understand that we are dumb fucks, and we don't know shit about much of anything. That way at least we can look at things with a less pompous eye.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jones has approval from a range of supporters as well:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>for his ability to draw from a majority of references to mainstream sources, and relate it to a grand theme.</li>
<li>for being willing to stand for his rights as was the case when he was arrested after resisting a thumbprint scan.</li>
<li>for offering a solution to fight the patriot act by appearing in front of a council with an allotted time of 15 minutes.</li>
<li>for speaking out against fear, which we are all so afraid to do.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jones can appear to be very energetic and impassioned over his alternative journalism. He appears to have a high level of vocabulary.</dd>

<p>Either he is very intelligent and very cracked, or he is very honest and very dedicated, and these days, who the hell's gonna know the difference?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No need to apply censorship here</span></h2>
<p>The fact some of us don't like what Mr. Jones says doesn't mean facts about Mr. Jones should not be put here. On that basis only good people would qualify, no Hitlers and such. Kindly let me decide if I want to read about Alex Jones.</p>
<p>It's not about Jones anyway, it's about us and you. Do we get to learn about things if I'm inquisitive about them? Or do we let YOU filter out what you don't like?</p>
<p>The criteria for these types of entries in my opinion is whether someone has had some influence on society or has been newsworthy (not that he has a great vocabulary or eloquence, etc.), but some significant enough basis to be noticed maybe not by you, but by a lot of others.</p>
<p>Jones clearly has changed a lot of public opinion on important current events, which is not at all easy, and in areas the regular media would not dare touch, not for intelligence but for fear or corruption. On the other hand he's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. Hey, that's life.</p>
<p>I suggest we who think its a good topic focus on accurate and relevant content, as a lot of it still seems missing, and keep an eye out for vandals.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anti Semitism</span></h2>
<p>Some people tend to add the term "anti-semitic" to "controversial" in the first paragraph. This is f**cking bullshit. With this logic you could label anyone who talks about anything jewish an "anti-semite". It really, really hurts me, as this only helps those who are real anti-semites.... Yes, he talks about Jews, and not in favourable terms, but he doesn't talk about "The Jews", he talks about wealthy individuals who happen to be jewish. If i write "The History of Banking" and i mention Amschel Bauer Rothschild am i an anti-semite&#160;????</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you are. First of all, "Jewish bankers" is the classic anti-Semitic codeword for "Jews." Anti-Semites have been attacking the Jewish people under the guise of criticizing "Jewish bankers" for hundreds of years. Why do people like you, who claim to not be anti-Semitic, only ever attack <i>Jewish</i> bankers like the Rothschilds (who BTW, are not the shady people you make them out to be)? Jews are but a tiny minority in the banking industry, yet people like Alex Jones and his followers always single them out for attack. Why? Secondly, I've actually heard Alex Jones' radio show, and you're not fooling anyone. He spends half his time on the air railing against the <a href="../../../a/d/l/ADL_17ed.html" title="ADL">ADL</a> and Israel. It's obvious the man is an anti-Semite, and I strongly suspect that you are one as well. HGinsburg 06:38, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're confusing the globalists with people who simply want to be free and be left the Hell alone when you speak of "codewords." The globalists have a major fetish for codewords and codephrases, e.g., "New World Order," "A bridge to the 21st century," "A thousand points of light," "New Order of the Ages," etc. HGinsburg, the previous poster which you are here responding to is speaking literally and clearly. To accuse him of using "codewords" is dishonest on your part, as the literal meaning of his words is perfectly rational and understandable. There is no need to imagine that he means something other than what he is saying, as the literal meaning of what he is saying is perfectly coherent on its own terms (unlike actual codewords and phrases, which are nonsensical unless you already understand their special meaning). It is an *actual fact* that a number of supposed "Jews" are central bankers around the globe. By your logic, HGinsburg, one could never criticize the existence of, or the system of, central banking without thereby being guilty of using "codewords" (which apparently then makes the Jewish libertarian, Murrary N. Rothbard, the king of anti-semites). Of course, this is simply dishonest, inflamatory rhetoric on your part, HGinsburg, used to provoke an emotional response and to thereby shut down rational thought on vital issues. Concerning your two examples of Alex Jones's supposed "anti-semitism": the ADL is an truly horrible, freedom-destroying organization; and the government of Israel is an utterly racist and Nazi-like, ethnic-cleansing government (but then, all governments are diabolical). To criticize these two nefarious organizations is to therein be just and righteous. And no, Alex Jones spends very little time on the ADL and Israel. Recently Alex Jones has been speaking more on the Israeli government regarding the 100,000-plus so-called "ringworm children," who were Sephardi children that, during the 1950s, the Israeli government irradiated with 35,000 times the maximum safe life-exposure dose of X-rays through their heads (i.e., all of them got this same dose). The U.S. government paid the Israeli government today's equivalent of 50 billion U.S. dollars to conduct these radiation experiments, even though the ill effects of massive doses of X-rays were well-known since the 1920s, and even though the actual radiation experiments only cost about a million dollars (in other words, the rest of the money was simply a payoff to the Israeli government by the U.S. government for it conducting these radiation tests). The Israeli government called them "ringworm children" as a pretext to massively irradiate their skulls, even though almost all of them were perfectly heathly. Many of the children died within a few days of the radiation exposer, with virtually all the rest being left with brain-damage and/or cancers. Most of the so-called "ringworm children" are now dead, having died early deaths from the lifelong complications that resulted from their massive irradiation.209.208.77.184 20:48, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are both incorrect; Alex Jones never talks about Jews in regard to their race or religious beliefs. He does talk about certain corrupt individuals like Kissenger and the Rothschild family as well as hundred of other people of all races and beliefs. But the idea that criticism of corrupt individuals who happen to be Jewish is somehow racist or anti-Semitic is itself one of the most racist things I’ve ever read. For a start you say the Rothschild’s aren’t as bad as they’re made out…please show me some good deeds they have done to neutralise the thousands of negative ones (like the total manipulation of the financial system of the world, which rich white men are involved in equally). Secondly the idea that Jews are a tiny minority is absurd, come on man, lets have some honesty from you. You may think your Gods chosen people but denial is still denial whatever race you are. Only 3 % of the US population are Jewish but half of US billionaires are Jewish. Which is fine, but please, people do not become billionaires by being virtuous, far from it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What Alex Jones does talk about however is political Zionism, as a creation of bankers/ industrialists in London, which is being used essentially as a frontier for Anglo-American Imperialism (globalization) in the Middle-East. Unfortunately most Jews over-react to such ideas as being the racist ravings of right-wing ‘goyims’. But a glance at www.jewsagainstzionism.com amongst others shows that real Jews (followers of Judaism) are opposed to political Zionism and the neo-imperialism they’re promoting, exactly as Alex Jones is.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since when has criticism of Israel and the ADL being racist or anti-Semitic? You may think that, as gods chosen people (lol), non-Jewish beings aren’t allowed to say such things, even if they’re true, but that’s only because you are the racist Jewish supremacist that is hiding the massive criminality of the state of Israel and the ADL by using censorship and the labelling of people as ‘anti-Semitic’. If you had listened to Alex Joes you would know that he vehemently opposes the idea that Jews are planning world domination, or that it is Jewish related in any way.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">thorough explanation needed</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, here's what I think would be great for this article. I'd like to see a more thorough and even-handed explanation of Jones' theories, main theses, background information, and so forth. I think if it were presented in a straightforward, undramatic way, it might present him in a more informative light than the present article does. This way, readers could make some basic judgement or take away some basic understanding of the issue. For one thing, I think, as it stands, the concentration of the article on the Bohemian Grove bit just bolsters the casual reader's perception that, "Yeah, this guy's clearly a nutjob or a fraud." Whether or not the Cremation of Care bit is factual, it's easily the chunk of Jones' work that would seem most rediculous to a casual observer, especially out of the context of his other pursuits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the moment, I'll leave it up to someone who has maybe delved deeper or more recently seen Jones' movies and kept up with his progression, but I might give it a go if the article just sits in its present state for a while. By the way, does anyone have a citation for the bit of the article that claims that the BBC funds Jones' movies? I have never heard that tidbit, and it seems a bit far-fetched. --SamClayton 09:25, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That probably derives from confusion over some small connections Jones had with a group of British documentary makers when he did the Bohemian Grove film (don't know in what capacity the Brits worked for the BBC, if at all). Also, some BBC bloke (sorry) seems to have praised him on several occasions. But the BBC certainly doesn't fund his films. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettBrown_6a82.html" title="User:BarrettBrown">BarrettBrown</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notes</span></h2>
<p>Alex's Christianity ought to be mentioned somewhere, as it molds his whole world outlook. <small>I will second that. Even though I happen to agree with the analysis and research of Mr. Jones I totally agree with that his christianity be mentioned in the article. Often it is this naivety that leads him astray even though he does have exceptional insight. Jones knows fully well that the pyramid has many sides to climb and for that reason he ridicules the <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicca.html" title="Wicca">wiccan</a> protestors outside the gates of the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Grove_0df1.html" title="Bohemian Grove">Bohemian Grove</a>. It is only when we look to the top of the pyramid when Mr. Jones "refuses to see the light" which I find utterly disappointing.</small></p>
<p>Also, I think it would be relevant to note his hostile attitude toward anything/anyone of power disagreeing with his position. (He called Professor Noam Chomsky a "shill" for the NWO after interviewing him and verbally attacked him--after the telephone interview with Chomsky ended.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You would probably be hostile too if you know someone in opposition to you is lying, or if people called you a lier when you weren't lying (by the word "lying" I mean the motive to decieve; not by being correct or incorrect in what you say), or if people lied about you in order to paint you as a lier.</dd>

<dd>Alex is hostile towards anyone trying to control him. It doesn't matter if they're trying to control his body or his mind. Well, no wait... I think he gets more upset by people trying to control his mind then he does by them trying to control his body. Though I'm sure he gets upset by both greatly.</dd>

<dd>I'm not surprised to see Jones attacking Chomsky. In Jones' mind, I'm sure every person of Jewish descent is a "shill" for the "New World Order." HGinsburg 07:04, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>HGinsburg, not to insult your intelligence or research, but I've been listening to Alex Jones for about two years now and haven't heard him say anything regarding the common Jew as being the basis for evil. In fact, he attacks those who equate common Jews, Christians, Catholics, etc. as being seperatists who want to break up groups, instead of fighting globalism and the globalists who push it. Zionism does not equal Judaism, as Alex once put beautifully. Fight the real enemy, not some perceived enemy just because alot of prominent people are Jewish.Massacabre 08:14, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I must concur with Massacabre; I do not think that Jones can be accurately construed as an anti-Semite. With evidence to the contrary I would reverse that statement, but... I think HGinsburg's concern is misplaced. The accusation of anti-Semitism seems to me to be a generalization of philosophies that you (HGinsburg) perceive as threatening. Ironic that we'd have this accusation on the talk page of somebody accused of being a conspiracy theorist; but at any rate I think this is pretty unverifiable and does not belong in the article. Criticizing the actions of a person who happens to be Jewish does not equate to anti-Semitism; if it did, he would be guilty of being anti-[insert ethnic, political, racial, or religious group here]. That they are a Jew isn't what he's criticising. If you can provide evidence to other ends, by all means, set the record straight. The worst thing that could happen from me challenging the veracity of your claim is that I'll learn a thing or two. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyscale_5a16.html" title="User:Greyscale">Greyscale</a> 03:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with both of you. I don't mean to accuse HGinsburg of having a persecution complex, but that's what all his commentary seems to point to (and keep in mind that I, myself, am Jewish). The idea that the actions of a member or members of a certain ethnicity or race represent the character of that entire group is the most fundamental principle of racism and all other prejudice. Jones never makes any such assertions about Jews or any other ethnic group. The fact that Jones repeatedly rails against the wars being waged in the world as being racist in nature should be enough to tip anyone off that he does not hold any such views. Add to that the fact that he is as harsh a critic as any of the Nazi regime and its program of mass-murder (name for me an anti-semite who holds those same views) and you get a pretty clear idea that the guy holds no racial or ethnic biases. In his world view, power and money are corrupting forces, and corruption knows no race, religion or ethnicity.</dd>
<dd>I don't personally agree with everything Jones says, and find some of the conclusions he has drawn to be rather spurious and unfounded, but to suggest that the guy is in any way a racist or anti-semite is intellectually dishonest.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaltech22_ed56.html" title="User:Baltech22">Baltech22</a> 05:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"He is one of the most well-supported and intense investigators in his field today." This seems to be POV (as was most of this article), and the phrase "well-supported" is vague, at best. Also, someone could easily doubt the veracity of the Bohemian Grove movie or what it purports to depict. I don't really think it merits inclusion.

<dd>I've softened the language further ("purportedly" and "allegedly"). I also am curious about the statement "Among conspiracy theorists, he's thought to be among the the most well-supported investigators in the field today." Does this mean that he is more well-supported than other conspiracy theorists or that other consipiracy theorists consider him well-supported? Furthermore, does "well-supported" mean that his allegations are well-documented, that he receives ample donations for his work, or that he has comfortable underwear? <a href="../../../j/h/c/User%7EJHCC_e2b8.html" title="User:JHCC">JHCC</a> 17 May 2004</dd>

<dd>I think the "well-supported" line is clear POV. I'm sure there are even people who lend credence to other conspiracy theories that don't buy his version of events or motives. It comes off as Wikipedia endorsing his claims. Maybe something along the lines of "highly-regarded" would be a little less biased? Suggestions? I also think it would be worthwhile to include, possibly verbatim, some of his claims (ex. the Kyoto Accords outline a plan for massive concentration camps, etc.), so that readers can judge for themselves and have some context. --SamClayton 18:16, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have read this article; as there is nothing in the article that is non-factual, I don't understand why this is under debate. The article states Jones's beliefs as that--Jones's beliefs--and correctly represents them. What it reports him as saying, he has in fact said. Therefore there is no veracity dispute, and those tags should be taken down immediately.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The use of the word "beliefs" is a very poor choice. Alex Jones is a journalistic researcher who relies on observation and tangible facts to challenge the activies and agendas of the corporatist elite. Give the man his due, and express the nature of his activities in the proper context. Alex Jones calls upon us not to subscribe to a belief, but to observe with our own eyes and draw upon our own abilities to see through the veritable lies and deceptions of our age. (RPC)</p>
<p>The argument people are having on this talk page (and it is simply that, an argument) is about whether or not Jones is right, not whether or not the article is. Wikipedia is not intended to state views about or judge those topics on which it has articles. The article for the Three Stooges is not a place to say, "I think slapstick comedy is in poor taste," and nor is this article a place to say, "I think Jones is right/wrong".</p>
<p>Jones is controversial, about that there is no doubt; however, that discussion, and the one that has utterly consumed this talk page, belongs on blogs and forums and not on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">conspiracy theorist</span></h2>
<p>I don't like the label "conspiracy theorist." It's a euphemism for "crazy kook," and "don't believe a word this guy says." Alex Jones is about as much a conspiracy theorist as say... George W. Bush, the boys at Fox News, and just about everyone else in this country. What was the pretext for invading Iraq? A conspiracy theory; the Iraqis were a conspirin' to get us Americans, and yet nobody referred to the government officials or mainstream media people as conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>While I don't agree with everything Jones says, much of what he puts on his site is drawn from other sources; often times mainstream internet sites. For example, he seems interested in the whole microchip implanted into the body as a means of control angle. But this is both well-documented as well as advertised in the mainstream media. God forbid somebody draw the conclusion that the microchips were designed for reasons other protecting children from kidnappers or old folks with alzheimers. We'll have to brand them a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>Is Noam Chomsky a conspiracy theorist? What about Howard Zinn? The best description of what Jones does is draw conclusions, some correct &amp; some incorrect, from the news he gathers while making comparisons to known historical events. This is what everyone with an interest in history and politics does. Jones predicted 9/11 several years before it happened [assuming the video I observed was dated in 1997]. Bush predicted we'd find WMDs, that the Iraqis would greet us with flowers, and he was wrong on both counts. The people whose views aren't popular, or whose views don't have much influence get marginalized as conspiracy theorists. But consider the fact that the American public took the CIA's, the Executive Branch's, and the Senates "theories" and "views" on Iraq very seriously. They basically swallowed a bunch of hogwash... in fact many are still swallowing it. What's essentially happening is a battle for control of public perceptions. Anyway, the point is, have an open mind. Don't penalize non-mainstream info/disinfo sources when the veracity of 99.9% of everything else out there is suspect. [ATreiDeezNutz!]</p>

<dd>Fret not, Nutz, as the interesting and telling part of Wikipedia is the Discussion/Talk -- 'twas ever thus, and ever thus will be. This is where folks come to get the real story, and what archaeologists of the future will dig for like Tut's gold.</dd>
<dd>Jones has produced a veritable treasure trove of artifacts whose value will not be understood until long after he's gone (assuming he's not high on the desaparecidos {we can speak the truer words here in "Talk}" list) -- from his investigation of the Satanic cabal of world leaders which meets annually at Bohemian Grove near Monte Rio, California in an ancient redwood grove, to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=independent_news&amp;collectionid=911theRoadtoTyranny" class="external text" title="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=independent_news&amp;collectionid=911theRoadtoTyranny" rel="nofollow">unmatched coverage of the terrorist attack on Oklahoma City, to relentless pursuit of the terrorists responsible for this and for 9/11,</a> to expert analysis of the abominations "Patriot" Act I and II. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamizdat_70d0.html" title="User:Samizdat">Rick Wilson</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nutz: I've lived in Austin all my life, and I've listened and watched Jones' programs on a regular basis for years. Much of what you say is on point. He does draw most of his data from the credible old-school media, and the majority of the facts he presents are independently verifiable. In fact, I share many of his concerns about civil liberties, media compliance with government agendas, uncritical assessments of what is presented as fact, and so forth; I simply disagree with his ultimate conclusions in many cases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What's core to this discussion is that Alex Jones is a de facto conspiracy theorist; he forms theories (more correctly, hypotheses) about conspiratorial cabals. In every sense of the phrase, the shoe fits. Simply because "conspiracy theorist" has gathered negative connotations over the years doesn't mean it is in any way an inaccurate description of Alex Jones and his M.O., nor does it discredit his work out of hand. If someone reading the article dismisses what he presents out of hand on that basis, then that is their decision. It should, however, at least be prominently noted in the article that even a large subset of his listeners, fans, and admirers would (correctly) describe him as a conspiracy theorist, and so would just about any writer for any publication.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are qualitative differences between conspiracy theory and the theories provided by historians, Noam Chomsky, and the other groups of people that you mention. Most centrally, conspiracy theorists generally assert that history unfolds largely on the basis of hidden cabals of powerful individuals or organizations whose existence, structure, or importance are typically, by their very nature, unproven or unprovable. Once again, I'm not denigrating this line of thinking, but this would be its major difference and, in some senses, its major disadvantage in gaining mainstream credibility. There are arguably other factors, including stylistic differences, presentation, level of credulity, and so forth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Chomsky is more a kook than Jones. Did Jones ever say the Afghanistan invasion would result in the death of millions of Afghanis in a "silent genocide"? He's also the guy who pretends Pol Pot's reign of terror never happened. Jones may make ridiculous and wildly inaccurate theories, but Chomsky lies through his teeth and ignores evidence. I don't agree with Alex Jones one bit, but he's more credible than Chomsky is, yet isn't seen that way to most people. And Rick Wilson, I hope to God you're being sarcastic. Unfortunately, the cynic in me says you're serious. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatGatsby_4c96.html" title="User:GreatGatsby">GreatGatsby</a> 04:55, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting "conspiracy theorist" in this article is akin to putting "WASP" in GWB's. While it may literally be true, it is a remark that has negative connotations, and is stated with intent to defame. Therefore this is not NPOV, and the term does not belong on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">rhetorical style</span></h2>
<p>I think Jones's biggest strength &amp; weakness is his rhetorical style. He knows that most people are turned off by dry political debate, so he sensationalizes to get his points across. I watched one of his documentaries and found much of the footage [Oklahoma City, etc.] intriguing, however, his face-to-face speaking style could be grating. However, he's a radio personality and a shock-jock of sorts, so its to be expected. I doubt that he would convince an audience of academics or professionals, because they are used to the Ted Koppel, illusion of objectivity, style.</p>

<dd>Alex's 'style' is unrefined. He's human. His style is lack of style (and I mean no offence to him in that way). I think part of his 'sensationalizing' is because he himself gets so emotional about the issue that is in the message he's trying to get across. And the other part is in that most of his documenteries are definately designed to (in my own words:) "Keep the viewer awake."</dd>

<dd>Alex gets real candid on his radio show. He reads news articals, but he doesn't read from a pre-written script for the show like the large majority of news anchers and 'personalities'. It's hard to stay calm when you feel like your country is being stolen away from you, your freedom is being stolen away from you, and ontop of that nobody seems to care.

<dd>Many people believe that people who 'believe' in conspiracies (note that I'm not using the word theory here) 'want' to believe in the conspiracies. TV Shows and other media present anyone who believes in 'conspiracies' as a nutcase. Yet, believing the "official story" about 911 (the one by the government.. which-ever one by the government you pick) is still a "Conspiracy Theory". It's a theory that "A Group of Hijackers go onto airplanes and all together took them over and flew them into buildings, and attempted to fly them into buildings." Anyone who believes hijackers took over the planes on 9/11 and flew them into buildings believes in conspiracy. (And since the government's investigation is shotty at best, it is also IMO a theory. Especially since people said to be hijackers have been found alive. There is no way that it is all fact.)</dd>

However, knowledge in all it's power is also a terrifying burden. It's why (I believe) most people actually rather believe in falsehoods that are happy then trueths that hurt. Most humans do not enjoy pain, and there is alot of painful knowledge. Finding out you've been lied often causes pain and anger at yourself for being 'duped'.</dd>

For many people they're willing to create teh utopia inside their own heads, and just believe everything is alright or will turn out alright.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Secret cabals</span></h2>
<p>As for what he puts on his site, I think the articles he collects on the implications of new technology are worthwhile. The business about secret cabals generally provokes skepticism just because it appears so ridiculous and cliched on its face, and yet consider the following: It's well documented that both presidential candidates came from the same secret society within a few years of one another at the same school. The school itself is a powerful institution; Yale graduates are at the top of U.S. power structure. For example, 30% of all law professors come from Yale Law School alone, and the vast majority of the rest are from the other Ivies and Top Tier schools like University of Chicago. But 30% from Yale alone. Yale alums try to hire as many Yale alums as possible. It is very, very, very difficult, if not impossible, for a law graduate to teach if he did not attend Yale or a few other select schools. Likewise in England, the barriers of entry to become a barrister, and then a judge are exceedingly difficult. The entire practice of law in England used to be conducted in Norman French, with documents written in Latin. This went on up until the 19th-20th centuries with a brief respite during the Puritan revolution. This made it easier to rule the commoners. Another example are the fraternal greek systems. Affluent men and women typically enter them so they can retain a social network of individuals from similar backgrounds. Upon graduation, they find it easier to find jobs in many cases. They have a network that makes life easier for them. And then let's not forget think tanks, intelligence agencies, the military, etc. I feel that cabalism is a way of life, a way of doing business, not some Hollywood plot. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can't be avoided. Jones says that really powerful cabals exist that consist of extremely wealthy and well-established families, and that influence world events. While I've never met any of these people, we could look at royal families as examples. And in the democracies, certain families create political or industrial dynasties. Once people acquire wealth and power, they typically try to preserve it through their children, and through social networks.

<p>[Previous comment is unsigned and not mine.] Re: the <i>Inside Bohemian Grove</i> video: I believe Jones worked with a British TV documentary crew. IDK about any local journalists or controversy with them. Will research and edit if necessary, unless someone (hopefully) knows for sure and can fix. Jones seems to stand out amongst others in that he isn't just a talker, but he goes on site and confronts people (and not in a mean-spirited way) and institutions.

<dd>The problem with Alex is sorting out the wisdom from the bullshit, basically. A lot of the stuff that gets put on PrisonPlanet comes from sources of rather ill-repute, including the American Free Press [a noted White Supremacist front organization] and Counterpunch. So failing to discriminate with regard to mixing these in with more reputable sources, and internal documents from organizations he puts under suspicion, Jones, in his editorializing, sometimes reaches conclusions that don't stand on solid ground. And unfortunately, he possesses the same confirmation bias that all journalists [and really, all people in general] possess, so being caught up in his own mission as he is, he sometimes does sloppy work in pursuit of the truth.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaltech22_ed56.html" title="User:Baltech22">Baltech22</a> 00:42, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No it's not wrong, he's mentioned several times in his broadcasts to how much work he puts into 'fighting the new world order' and has often been heard quoting his sleeping patterns, and how much he works compared to his ratio of sleep.

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com" class="external free" title="http://www.infowars.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.infowars.com</a> free alex jones videos. One per week you can download. I have seen most of his videos and agree with most of his reasoning. The Bohemian grove incident was film from among an audience, which leads me to believe it was just some ritualistic show without the demonic influences that Alex Jones would like us to believe. But then again, that's really the only subject he has investigated that I have ever found fault with. The Bohemian Grove video should be taken with a grain of salt, unless you think there's a problem with our leaders performing even "show" rituals to "Mammon."</p>
<p>In all other respects, I have found Mr Jones reporting to be fact based and compelling. In some cases disturbing. It's hard to wake up from a dream and find out that you might have woken to a nightmare.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those Bohemian Grove rituals weren't to "Mammon". They were to Moloch. Again, the implication is that the evil "elite" like to sacrifice children to Moloch, just like the ancient Israelites did. In other words, this evil elite is composed of Jews. It's always about the Jews with Alex, isn't it? It won't shock me if in his next video he resurrects the blood libel.

<dd>The Old Testament does say that the Israelites sometimes sacrificed their children to Moloch. So did the Caananites. So did many other ancient tribes. Is the Old Testament therefore anti-semitic? As many things are in this world, it's a matter of perspective. Our way of looking at the world in many ways forms an psychological reality on the individual as well as collective levels. This is something I think is virtually impossible to eliminate from any writing. The writer will always imbue his work with a reflection of his world view. However, somebody has to be correct--there must be an objective reality otherwise all is random and therefore meaningless and there is no distinction between sanity and insanity, rationality and irrationality. Alex Jones's perspective tends to be correct. There is no universal condemnation of Judaism on any of Alex Jones' websites as far as I can see. I suggest that if you find something from one of Alex Jones' websites, documentaries, radio or TV shows that you feel is anti-semitic, that it be vetted. Instead of making claims, provide some documented evidence, otherwise it's just a subjective interpretation which, if widely publicized and given credence could open whoever spread it around up to libel and slander suits. Of course, if your interpretation of someone being an anti-semite is based on prerequisites such as not supporting the ADL or being opposed to certain policies of the government of Israel then Alex Jones fits the bill. I happen to think that the Israeli government nuking the brains of over 100,000 Jewish children happens to be Nazi behavior. Thinking that being anti-Israeli government is the equivalent to being a Jew hater is consistent with a persecution complex since there are many Jews who also don't agree with the ADL or the government of Israel. Calling him "anti-what-he-perceives-to-be-corrupt-government" would be more accurate. I wish I were like HGinsburg and had the ability to read minds and intentions through the TV screen. To me it's tortured logic.</dd>

<p>The membership lists of the Bohemian Club are mainly white people with protestant affiliations, so where the inference of anti-semitism comes from merely from sneaking in and filming the ritualized ceremony I don't know. There's an interesting Sociology paper by Professor Peter Phillips (<a href="http://libweb.sonoma.edu/regional/faculty/phillips/bohemianindex.html" class="external free" title="http://libweb.sonoma.edu/regional/faculty/phillips/bohemianindex.html" rel="nofollow">http://libweb.sonoma.edu/regional/faculty/phillips/bohemianindex.html</a>) regarding the Bohemian Club that, if memory serves, statistically examines the membership along sociological lines. It should be noted that Bohemian Grove consists of over 100 different camps, each has a cabin. The camp cabins range in size from a shack to a mansion. There is camp stratification, with Mandalay being one of the most elite. So the "audience" filmed watching the Cremation of Care ritual are considered amongst the profane, in other words the ritual is most understood only by an inner circle within Bohemian Club. Externalizing the ritual to the 2000 or so members who have little to no understanding of its true significance is part of the ritual itself. There was recently a set of photographs taken in the Bohemian Grove sold on Ebay that were taken in 1916. In one of them was a man--or a figure designed to look like a man--hanging from a tree. Even the National Geographic released a 99 year old photo from inside the grove that consisted of a man in a hooded black robe with a candle looming over a man laying flat on the ground. These types of photos are already under the Wikipedia article regarding the Bohemian Club, but more could be added. There are also scans taken from offical Bohemian Club Annals available online, including at Jones' websites. I know they're valid because I also own a copy of a Bohemian Club Annals Vol. VI and there are images of the Cremation of Care ceremony in them, and they call it a "rite" and a "ritual" in their own internal publications. By this time some of their publications should be in the public domain, so they can look forward to them popping up on line. Whatever else it is, the Bohemian Club clearly has an occultic hierarchy. Sociologically speaking the centralization of power and the cementing of that bond through ritual is ancient and the historical norm, and it's verifiable not conspiracy theory. It has been the controlling influence in many civilizations, including the Roman Empire, ancient Egypt, the Aztecs, the ancient Peruvians, etc. There is not always a clear delineation between theater and ritual, in fact the two often intertwine (e.g., The Magic Flute, Cremation of Care). But again it's a matter of perspective. Jones' world view is a sociological blend of the Iron Rule of Oligarchy and C Wright Mills' Power Elite from a Christian perspective. If you think it's healthy for the world to be run by people obsessed with death and macabre ritual that symbolizes their mastery over their own consciences and the will to dominate, then of course you'd dismiss things such as Bohemian Club, Skull and Bones, the Thule Society, etc. On the other hand if you think these are negative influences on historical trends then you'll be very interested indeed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jews and "The New World Order"</span></h2>
<p>From reading the comments on this article as well as others, there seems to be so much gray area on the subject. There are no shortage of Jews and even Rabbis that have presented scathing condemnations of the globalist banking system and the government of Israel. How are such Jews to be categorized? To the overly conditioned liberal, conservatives and anti-racists this is quite an enigma that never clears up. After much study, let me help. A Jew is someone who is of the Jewish religion. That is simply all. They are not usually bankers or government officials. They may or may not support the State of Israel. They may or may not be racist. But then again, all human behavior applies to them because THEY ARE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. So how did this portrayal of Jews come about? When you see Netanyahu on TV acting like the Jewish Pope, it isn't hard to see why.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. A quick examination of the Zionist movement (a movement that, like virtually all other political movements, has been compromised over time) reveals that all through its history there has been a significant number of Jews who opposed it.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaltech22_ed56.html" title="User:Baltech22">Baltech22</a> 05:19, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is still laced throughout with POV language and assumptions -- specifically the POV of Jones' loyal viewers who ascribe to his worldview. It's fine that this worldview is communicated, giving the uninitiated reader a sense of who Jones is and the themes and tone of his work. However, the <i>dominant</i> and opposing worldview that regards him and his work as delusional, factually unsound, or sensationalistic is almost unrepresented. If nothing else, language should be clarified, works not published by Jones himself should be cited, and a section should be added which clearly delineates the controversial nature of his claims. At present, the article appears to be written by people who uncritically accept Jones' claims and thus parrot his POV. I am going to attempt some edits to improve neutrality and generally poor writing, but this page is clearly violates NPOV as it stands. --SamClayton 12:00, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can only agree with most of the above comments. It seems Jones's accolytes are working overtime to avoid any kind of criticism be represented in the main article, in what looks like a poster-boy entry for "asymmetric controversy".</p>
<p>[The latter being a controversy between two sides, one of which is particularly interested in the issue and fanatical in defending its POV, while the other doesn't care about the issue a whole lot. Articles on such issues will inevitably be biased in favor of the fanatical side, because they put most effort into writing about it.</p>
<p>Thus, an asymmetric controversy can be described as any controversial idea that is popular enough to attract a band of loyal supporters to defend it on wikipedia, but not popular enough to attract critics. Paradoxically, this means that any idea widely considered too insane to be criticized will have a favorable article written about it, since its advocates are fanatical about the issue while its opponents consider it too crazy to bother with. Keep in mind that what makes these controversies asymmetric is not the number of people on each side, but the intensity with which they defend their views. One single-minded user with a lot of time on his hands can hold off many disinterested users at once.]</p>
<p>Indeed, that seems to describe the Alex Jones article (as well as most controversial wikipedia entries) quite well. Or so the Grand Lodge told me to post&#160;:-) 193.92.81.49 19:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">unfounded criticism and accusations Mr Ginsberg</span></h2>
<p>In response to HGinsberg - If your points were raised to promote sense then you need to back up your bleating about anti-simetic bias. Moloch/Molech was worshipped by the people of Lavant and phoenecians. Lavant is defined in mythology as an area that has Israel on it's extreme NW, coastal boundary. It was the Canaanite culture most often associated with child sacrifice. Israel was mentioned in papers in 1975 but since this is only 1 year after Alex's birth he's hardly responsible for the finger pointing, is he? If the statement 'Israelis' sacrificed children' is based upon disputed facts that's fine they'll come out in time. I believe racism is to support an unreasonable view of different culture's or people's then you Mr Ginsberg are the racist for denying healthy debate about child sacrifices to Molech and supporting a rose-tinted view of Jewish culture. I'm from the UK I'd like to believe we're all lovely sensitive human beings but that is not our history. Also Zantastik the term Molech is the correct name for Bohemia Grove's idol owl. The source is a washington Post article from 1968 84.64.24.224 04:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then you should cite and quote that <i>Washington Post</i> article and state that it is the opinion of the author's article (or someone quoted therein) that such an Owl (1.) exists and (2.) is somehow an ancient near-eastern god, if the article does in fact quote someone who holds such a view. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik"><font color="black">Zantastik</font></a> <a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZantastik_58c9.html" title="User talk:Zantastik"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 04:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Past Jones Assertions</span></h2>
<p>To help everyone understand how insightful and accurate Mr. Jones is we can cite his predictions from a few years ago. I discovered Mr. Jones on shortwave shortly after 9-11. I had heard of conspiracy theorists before, but what I heard from my radio was absolutely amazing. I first thought I was hearing a BBC satire. During the next several months Mr. Jones talked about concentration camps that were being set up for use during the next emergency. He asserted that these camps were already built and stocked. After 9-11 several states did enact laws dealing with emergencies and evacuations. I was living in New Mexico at the time and there was a new law enacted dealing with evacuations and designated areas for evacuees to be sent to. New Mexico had no pre-existing, designated areas. As far as the government herding people into camps, all one has to do is examine what happened during and after the hurricane Katrina assault on New Orleans to understand that the U.S. Government does not have any ready made camps. Another one if his pet issues was his assertion that the CIA flew the planes into the World Trade Center by remote control. He seemed to forget that the morning of 9-11 was crystal clear on the East Coast, and it did not take any great navigation skill to find the towers. He was and is still claiming that the Bush Administration is bent on confiscating guns from lawful owners. George Bush has been in office nearly six years and not one single new gun control law has been enacted. (He just has slightly more than two years left.) I noticed that there was no effort whatsoever on the part of the White House to extend the Assault Weapons Ban. I do not believe that there is a single new gun control law sponsored by any Republican. Gunshows are still being held every three months where I live. The actions of a few over zealous and possibly corrupt New Orleans cops in the aftermath of Katrina does not mean that there is a national effort to disarm the populace. His other assertion during the invasion of Iraq was that the CIA was going to release an unnamed gas on our own troops to help justify the invasion. He even interviewed some guy who said that he planted some explosive cannisters. I think he was wrong on that one too. While I was living in New Mexico the German Air Force (they still call themselves Luftwaffe) was involved in joint training exercises with the USAF at Holloman AFB. This is probably what sent Mr. Jones into his "foreign powers on US soil” period. It was no secret that the Luftwaffe was in NM; it was reported everywhere. Mr. Jones always has "the documents" but we never see them. I regret that I did not tape record those old shows, but I never thought that Mr. Jones would ever be in a serious reference source of any kind. If somebody has the recordings or a log of his statements please present them. A proper discussion of Mr. Jones' accuracy and ability needs to have a record of his assertions form the past. I am not going to edit the Alex Jones entry in Wikipedia because all I have are my own recollections, and I have wasted enough time already. Calling him a "journalist" is really, really POV.

<dd>Well then lets drop that title, 'Father of 9/11 Truth Movement', because Alex would reject it. But what I would like to have mentioned is that on July 25, 2001, Alex warned viewers on his cable access show of possible terror attacks from our own Government using a Bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset. He urges his viewers to call the Whitehouse, for what he calls 'Operation Expose the Government Terrorists', to inform them that if we are attacked we know exactly who to blame. And here's the link to that, also from a site ran by Alex Jones. <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.tv/articles/august2004/082604alexwarned.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.prisonplanet.tv/articles/august2004/082604alexwarned.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.prisonplanet.tv/articles/august2004/082604alexwarned.htm</a> - Harvey B 13:46 PST, 11 March 2006</dd>

<p>Juliani and Thorn's inclusion does not contribute any useful information to this article. Their attacks on Jones mostly include ad hominem personal attacks, and unverifiable hearsay that is not relevant to Jones' credibility (his credibility being the main point of interest, since he is listed as a journalist).

<dd>Striver: I can tell that you're an Alex Jones fan, so am I. Seperate from my appreciation for Alex's work, however, is my duty as a member of Wikipedia. I believe that the recent edits are not censorship, but the removal of unencyclopedic, POV information. I believe this comes at a particularly opportune time, since the page was recently edited to include slander from the Wing TV crowd. In order to keep this entry from becoming a POV-ridden nightmare, we should stick to the new version, and gradually add more information about Alex as it arrives from well-cited sources. With the new page, Wikipedia users can still learn the fundamentals of what Alex Jones is all about, and even get to his websites and learn about the content of his videos and radio broadcasts from there. As much as I believe in the fight against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Order_%28conspiracy%29_92d5.html" title="New World Order (conspiracy)">New World Order</a>, the purpose of this page is to provide an encyclopedic description of Alex and his work. They can be further exposed to Alex's POV if they wish to follow the links to his websites and view his movies. So, I implore you, let's stick to the leaner version of the page, and add facts about Jones along with sources cited. Thanks. Johnny Watson 08:04, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There's an entry on 9-11: The Road to Tyranny, so I don't see any reason to object to having individual entries for each of his works. With the possible exception of <i>Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed</i>, I'm sure almost all of them have exceeded 5,000 viewers (and perhaps that one too). I'd feel a bit better about it if we had some independent verification that the audience for his films is at least that big, though intuitively I'm sure it is. Maybe Google Video or Archive.org has a view counter we can use to prove that Jones has a substantial audience. You might want to take a look at the <i>Road to Tyranny</i> talk page and history (and perhaps the composition, talk page, and history of other controversial works) to see how you should go about putting the pages together. Be prepared to revise and defend your efforts, since the <i>Road to Tyranny</i> entry has been nominated for deletion in the past. Johnny Watson 11:33, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having previously AfD'd the 9-11 The Road to Tyranny and seen it go through repeated edits from several editors and independent good faith efforts to locate secondary sources for the film, we've found NONE. The article currently cites the meager IMDB entry, the archive.org user ratings, and the movie itself. As it's purportedly the most famous of his films; this does not bode well for the rest. One of the main arguments for keeping the movie page was the length of the Alex Jones page. Now that it's been edited, how about a smerge? --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 01:04, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Documentary" Label</span></h2>
<p>According to Answers.com, a documentary is "A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration." I know you've probably never seen more than five minutes of an Alex Jones film an probably have vendetta against him for whatever reason, Silverberg, but by that definition, Jones is as much a documentary film maker as Moore or Riefenstahl. <a href="http://martiallaw911.info/" class="external autonumber" title="http://martiallaw911.info/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I don't care what your opinion of him is, so unless you can prove to us that his work does not fit under that definition, stop editing the article to conform to your opinion.

<dd>I think the burden is on you to prove that he is, not on everyone else to prove that he isn't. I've re-written it as "video producer", which is accurate. If there's a description of him in some reliable source as a "documentary film maker", then we can put that in. Maybe we could say something like "describes himself as a documantary film maker", but I think that's less than informative. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 17:00, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I know quite a bit about him and even interviewed him a couple of years back. He is indeed a documentary film maker, because he makes documentary films and people buy them. If you need a reliable source for that info, you can check out one of his websites from which he sells these. If you look elsewhere on this talkpage, you'll see he's been featured in plenty of articles in publications like Vanity Fair, appeared on Good Morning America, etc. This article definitely needs to be neutral, and calling him what he is won't make it otherwise. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettBrown_6a82.html" title="User:BarrettBrown">BarrettBrown</a></dd>

<dd>The argument isn't whether he makes videos that a couple of people buy, its if his videos can indeed be called documentaries since they do not make a distinction between fact, opinion, and illogical speculation. Also his website would definitley not be admissble since it is neither reputable nor reliable. Being mentioned in those magazine doesn't necessarily add any credibility, since it is prbably he was only mentioned for the sideshow values of his strange theories.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't offer an opinion regarding his website or his personal credibility; I mentioned it so that one may verify that he indeed makes and sells videos. I would also suggest that if Michael Moore can be regarded as a documentary filmmaker, so can Alex Jones. Both make documentary films. They may very well be flawed documentary films, but they are documentary films nonetheless. Furthermore, I would also suggest that since, in your own words, you "know very little about him," you might best serve wikipedia by avoid making statements like "they do not make a distinctioning between fact, opinion, and illogical speculation," particularly since you appear to have never seen any of these videos, and also because "distinctioning" is not actually a word. You might also avoid claiming that only "a couple of people buy" his videos, because they actually sell quite well, particularly for independent films. Go to amazon.com, and you can see this for yourself - not only does he have decent sales rankings there, but the figures don't even reflect the entirety of his sales, as many are conducted through his web sites and other venues. Also, there is a great difference between establishing for the purposes of an article that he is a documentary filmmaker and claiming that he is right; the former is a proper procedure for a wikipedia article, and the latter is not, but all I'm trying to do is the former. And finally, I would point out that by identifying a few of the various magazines and television programs in which he has been featured - and I left out quite a few, like CNN and MTV, particularly after Charlie Sheen came out of the closet as an Alex Jones supporter - I was clearly addressing your comments regarding Jone's "importance" as a cultural phenomenon. I do like your screen name, though. But focus, Constantine! Focus! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettBrown_6a82.html" title="User:BarrettBrown">BarrettBrown</a></dd>

<dd>As flawed and biased as Michael Moore is I do not think he is as bad as Alex Jones. Basically Moore mostly takes facts (with the exception of Farenheit 9/11 which I probably would not say is a real documentary) and presents them in a very POV and skewed way to serve whatever point he is trying to make. Since I have become involved on this article I have listened to some of Jones' radio shows that are somtimes linked from the article and it is seems to me that Jones really just says stuff without providing any clue to his source (or if he actually has one). Obviously this is original research so I would not include it in the actual article but it is clear that in this case "producer of videos" is just the most matter of fact title to attach to the guy.</dd>

<dd>Well, I didn't mean to hurt any feelings; I'm just a little irritated here. But whether Alex Jones is as "bad" as Michael Moore or not, or whether Michael Moore is "better" in your opinion or not, the definition of documentary does not hinge on whether one approves of the subject matter or the conclusions. Jone's videos fall under the category of documentary nonetheless; that's how everyone else categorizes them. And, again, a definition of "documentary" has already been provided for you. Jone's work clearly fits the bill. And "video producer" just doesn't fit, because that really describes another occupation. So "documentary filmmaker" it must be.

Until you can prove that CNN and vanity fair refered to him as a documentary maker like you claim then I really don't see how we can refer to him as anything but a producer of videos. Also what I meant by "worse than Michael Moore" was not anything subjective, but the actual quality of their supposed "facts".- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 23:56, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's the most popular radio show in the United States, and produced by a subsidiary of Clear Channel. If you're really interested in determining this, you might start by looking it up on Wikipedia. Ditto The Austin Chronicle, which claims a readership of 250,000. "Alternative" is not a technical term in the newspaper world; you can call it "alternative" because it's not run by Belo Corp or whatever, but it's still a respectable publication that makes endorsements, reports on Texas politics, etc., and which any Austinite can tell you is an important Texas medium. So, are you going to agree to the demonstrable fact that the U.S.'s most popular syndicated radio program as well as a respectable news publication have both called Alex Jones a "documentary filmmaker," or do we need to get arbitration? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettBrown_6a82.html" title="User:BarrettBrown">BarrettBrown</a> 00:28, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said that "I seem to recall" that they did, I haven't had a chance to find them yet, because it will take some digging, and I've been unusually busy today. You obviously know nothing about the Austin Chronicle. It has been the recipient of several awards from the AAN, as described here <a href="http://aan.org/gyrobase/Aan/AwardsView?publication=oid%3A5" class="external free" title="http://aan.org/gyrobase/Aan/AwardsView?publication=oid%3A5" rel="nofollow">http://aan.org/gyrobase/Aan/AwardsView?publication=oid%3A5</a>. It has 250,000 weekly readers. And Coast to Coast doesn't cover anything odder than does Larry King, who also unfortunately stoops to having some of the same psychics on (Sylvia Browne, for instance). Whatever the subject matter, Coast to Coast can be depended on to accurately portray what sort of occupations its guests are employed in, which is the only thing that matters in this case, since the occupation of Alex Jones is what we are trying to establish. And even aside from that, Alex Jones makes documentary films. They are sold as documentary films. He is, thus, a "documentary filmmaker." You have fought me on this despite acknowledging that you know little about Alex Jones, you have attacked the ability of Coast to Coast to identity its own guests despite admittedly knowing nothing of Coast to Coast, and you have now attacked The Austin Chronicle despite knowing little or nothing about The Austin Chronicle.

My lack of any previous knowledge about some of these topics allows me to look at it objectively, which was something that was lacking from the article before I happened upon it.

<dd>I suspect that you're wrong, but we'll find out for sure in a couple of days. Does the fact that they've won awards for news reporting make them valid enough to identify what a man does for most of his income, and thus what his occupation is?

<p>Virtually every kinda of organization like this attempts to show off awards that really don't mean anything. Also this isn't a subject like math, you act like you are an acknowledged expert in a field that doesn't exist and that I am being presumtuous by even editing this article.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Mediation</span></h3>
<p>I am responding to a request for mediation made by <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettBrown_6a82.html" title="User:BarrettBrown">BarrettBrown</a> <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-05-14_Alex_Jones_e140.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-05-14 Alex Jones">here</a>. I think there are two seperate issues here that need stepping back from and considering seperately. One side thinks the title <i>documentary film maker</i> is appropriate, the other thinks <i>video producer</i> is appropriate. In my opinion, <i>video producer</i> is actually only a substitute for <i>film maker</i>, and not for the documentary part. Therefore, the two things to be decided are - (a) does he makes documentaries, and (b) is he a producer or a film maker. To take the second point first, it seems that he is a <i>film maker</i> as opposed to a producer. A producer performs a very specific role in the production of a film, whereas it appears (from my brief skim search) that Alex does not fall into the producer definition, but rather is the overall <i>maker</i> of the films. <i>Video maker</i> as a title simply doesn't work, <i>film maker</i> does. So, a first solution to the disagreement, and what I think is a good compromise from both parties, would be to use the descriptor <i>radio host and film maker</i>. I think this gives a good general description of him and avoids the contentious point. The nature of his films becomes evident from the <i>Videos</i> section, and that section could, perhaps, be used to discuss the reasons for the argument over what his films are.</p>
<p>Resolving the point over whether the films are documentaries or not is going to be very difficult and will always lead to one party feeling themselves to be the "losing party". A better solution, in my opinion, is to avoid the problem as suggested above - I think its a simple, elegant, solution that doesn't lose any information and allows everyone to move on to building a better article. <a href="../../../k/c/o/User%7EKcordina_3fec.html" title="User:Kcordina">Kcordina</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/c/o/User_talk%7EKcordina_5ecd.html" title="User talk:Kcordina">Talk</a></sup> 12:50, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>WHAT IS THERE TO PROVE!?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The guy makes documenteries by the definition of the word. Anyone who's watched one of his documenteries can attest to that. You don't need some news artical to say it to prove it. It's looking to me like this guy who doesn't want to call Alex Jones a documentery film maker is just trying to discredit the guy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The opinion of ONE man is going to display on a website that is supposed to be about FACTS. This is sickening. This Wikipedia Project-thingy, whatever you want to call it is a JOKE! The guy who edits is is obviously bias. He's not taking a neutral stance if he's going to say a guy isn't a documentery maker just cause there's not a newspaper he's heard of that says so!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are plenty of people who make documenteries and never make it into the news. There are people who make documenteries that nobody buys and THEY STILL ARE Documentery makers!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alex's videos very clearly display facts and distinguis between facts and opinion. And whether or not his conclusions are logical or not is a matter of opinion. But that doesn't change the fact that they are documenteries. A documentery is a film about history, politics, or about "something". It documents things: Hence the name. His documenteries document events, and thus they're documenteries whether you believe the events or not doesn't matter. (Your free to live in a world where you claim the sky is purple if you want to. Just don't go telling me I have to believe it is. And for that matter, your free to make a documentery about it too if you want to.)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia ain't about someone feeling like they lost or someone feeling like they won for that matter. Feelings are not to have bearing on facts. Feelings have bearing on opinions. I thought this page was about facts? This isn't about winners or losers, we all lose if the facts are misrepresented!</p>
<p>Arguing over a definition of a word and comprimising on the facts so someone's feelings don't get hurt is how trueth is hidden. People rather dance around the facts then just address them head on... and that is one thing that Alex Jones is all about! He addresses the facts head on. He wouldn't stand for this implying the trueth that he makes documenteries instead of just coming right out and saying it. Alex Jones ia all about coming right out and saying it.. and dealing with it! No matter how much it hurts. Cause lies are like cancers or infections, they have to be cut out and cleaned out not matter how much it hurts or in the end they'll be worse then if we just faced them head on.</p>
<p>Alex Jones makes documenteries. Whether you agree with his views or his documenteries that's still what they are. And it's not a matter of my opinion that he's a documentery filmakers. Opinion doesn't come into the truth. Opion has nothing to do with it. Not my opion, not your opinion, not Alex's Opinion.</p>
<p>If Alex Jones is not a documentery film maker, then neither is Moore, or Pierre Rehov, Erica Soehngen, Elizabeth Barret, Albert Maysles, or anyone!</p>

<dd>You pick any peron's point of view, someone else will disagree with it. This is a fact of life. We can not all agree when opinions are involved. So why don't we all agree to agree on the facts.

<p>Link to the Popular Mechanics debunking article has nothing to do directly with Jones (he is not mentioned anywhere in the article, and the 16 claims which are addressed in the article do not necessarily reflect his viewpoint). The article is about 16 claims popular among 9/11 conspiracy theorists, not 16 claims from Alex Jones specifically.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FEMA and Martial Law? (How about some fair and balanced coverage?)</span></h2>
<p>I think the article deserves a little bit about Alex Jones and his belief that FEMA will enforce Martial Law across America in order to turn average Americans into slaves. I think the recent news criticism of FEMA's inability to do anything pretty much conflicts with his 'prophetic' statements. Although I think he has some interesting topics, such as THE GROVE we should provide some fair and balanced coverage of these statements with their counterpoints.

<p>Updated section. If there are problems talk here first. (88.101.172.224 10:09, 12 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like it or not, Jones thinks FEMA is "trying to prepare Americans for mass slavery in prison camps." The current status of FEMA, or Michael Brown, is irrelevant to Jones's general claim. If people want context, then they can click the FEMA link. I just don't see why all this extra material is necessary in a biographical article (esp. the Michael Brown stuff). --mtz206 (talk) 03:13, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok I agree. It shouldn't be included in Jones' view. So I created another section which allows for these topics to be addresses outside of Jones' biography. (Simonapro 09:12, 18 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't this page Jones' biography? FEMA prison camps would go in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Order_%28conspiracy%29_92d5.html" title="New World Order (conspiracy)">New World Order (conspiracy)</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 11:34, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Precisely. Seems as if this inclusion is meant solely to discredit Jones's view, which isn't the purpose of an encyclopedia article. It might be ok to find a brief way to say that Jones's view is unique or unpopular, but we shouldn't start listing all the blemishes of FEMA in order to illustrate that Jones's view is ridiculous.--mtz206 (talk) 12:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well its inclusion was to show the current political view as opposed to Jones' political view. But I think also that it should go if we also exclude Jones' political view. If we start to teach politics on the biography page then we need to show the current political model of that view. Since it has been removed entirely now there appears to be no need for it.(Simonapro 14:25, 18 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Once again, while the conclusion Jones draws regarding FEMA is not necessarily the correct one, the factual foundation upon which he builds that conclusion is irrefutably accurate. I suggest you take a look at Exec. Orders 11004, 11005, 11051, 11310 and 11921.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaltech22_ed56.html" title="User:Baltech22">Baltech22</a> 05:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Terrorstorm has just been released on his site, google has it <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5948263607579389947" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5948263607579389947" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Martial law is <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6495462761605341661&amp;q=Martial+Law" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6495462761605341661&amp;q=Martial+Law" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There are others, but Alex has referred to each of these has his best yet when they were first released. What do you think? <a href="../../../w/e/1/User%7EWe11er_f014.html" title="User:We11er">We11er</a> 10:29, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that the section on the films he has made should have links to said films if they are available on any video service. -- <font color="#FF0000">×</font><font color="#990000">×</font>×<small><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../j/i/j/User%7EJijinmachina_0104.html" title="User:Jijinmachina">jijin+machina</a> | <a href="../../../j/i/j/User_talk%7EJijinmachina_ca8e.html" title="User talk:Jijinmachina">Chat Me!</a></font></small>×<font color="#990000">×</font><font color="#FF0000">×</font> -- 16:12, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linkfarm</span></h2>
<p>Recent edits to this article has turned it into a linkfarm. While listing common phrases by Jones <i>might</i> be notable, we don't need to provide links to clips for each occurrence. Similiarly, while listing guests on his show <i>might</i> be notable, we don't need to provide links to clips for each occurrence. See <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a>: similar content is provided, but not with 40 links to his websites.

<dd>Bro, what you cited is only applicable to the "External links" section, not to refereces. The refereces is not there to link farm, most of the links go to the same video. The same references would be just as valid witout the links, they are only provided for convineance. The refereces are needed, otherwise, i would have to prove that he is <i>actually</i> saying those words a lot. As for the interviews, we all know that the entire section would have been deletred as unrefereced original reaserch if i had not provided references. I know that your comments is made in good faith, but i sometimes feel that no mater what i do, somethings "is wrong". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:31, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that <i>especially</i> since "most of the links go to the same video" these multiple external links are redundant, unnecessary, and could be construed as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#External_link_spamming" title="Wikipedia:Spam">link spamming</a>. Why not just have one link to the video? --mtz206 (talk) 23:33, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not external link spaming since its NOT in the "External links" section and they all link to the same target. If the links are so extremly bothersom, ill remove them and only keep the references, whould that defacto hardening to reach the sources make you happier? If yes, then ill remove the link and keep the referens. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 00:55, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I saw your recent edit, and if that is the extent of yourr objection, then its ok for me so far. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 00:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Personal Info Lacking</span></h2>
<p>Unlike many other good Wiki articles about semi-famous people, this one does not contain any personal information about Alex Jones in the biography section. It also leaves out any information about him during the first 20 years of his life, starting with the beginning of his career in 1994 (assuming he really was born in 1974). Where did he live during this period of time? Who were his parents? Where did he go to school? What degrees did he get? Is he straight or gay (sometimes this is relevant to the person's professional career)? Did he ever get married? I'm a real novice re: Wiki, but thought I'd introduce this comment in hopes someone may be able to "fill in the blanks." He certainly didn't pop up on earth in 1994, unless he really did come from another planet, ha ha. --66.82.9.58 23:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Chuck Franklin</p>

<dd>I have not found any references regarding that, so i have nothing to add... --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:03, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
