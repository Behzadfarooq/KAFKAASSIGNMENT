<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "it's either Mandarin or Chinese, not Mandarin Chinese". Mandarin can be used as an adjective to describe the specific type if Chinese. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 20:23, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's a bit different when you say, for example, British English or American English or Australian English. There are differences between these forms of English but basically, speakers can understand each other if you put them together in the same room. If you put native monolingual speakers of only, say, Hokkien, Mandarin and Cantonese together in the same room, they almost certainly will not be able to understand one another. I guess it would be acceptable to say they are each speaking some Chinese dialect, but the pronunciations are so different it's more like the difference between English and Irish than between British and American. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 06:19, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that's a good comparison. Irish English is completely understandable to a British English speaker, and vice versa -- Irish Gaelic is another language entirely.</dd>

<p>Hi, I've been trying to recruit people who might know the language to the <a href="../../../../ms/index.html" class="extiw" title="ms:">Malay Wikipedia</a>.

<p>Hi Alex, thanks for your message on <a href="../../../s/p/h/Talk%7ESphygmomanometry_29e0.html" title="Talk:Sphygmomanometry">Talk:Sphygmomanometry</a>. Nice to have other docs around. Have you any idea if there is going to be some systematisation effort on the medical side of Wikipedia? I've just been writing articles and updating the ones that were just hugely POV (such as <a href="../../../o/n/c/Oncology.html" title="Oncology">Oncology</a>). Do you think we could have these nice light-blue boxes linking, for example, all the <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nephrology.html" title="Nephrology">Nephrology</a> articles together? I'd be delighted to put some work in, but not on my own... <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> 08:32, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex, have you tried using the drug identification pages in MIMS (or E-MIMS). It classifies the tablets/capsules into colours, then shows either a photo or diagram of the tablet/capsule - I find it quite useful when helping my patients (well... "customers", I guess) to identify their medication. Or is there an international equivalent of MIMS which might have that sorta thing? <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechelf_1565.html" title="User:Techelf">Techelf</a> 1254, 1 July 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, yes, I've tried that before when I had the tablet in front of me. That was some years ago. It's harder when the patient doesn't have the tablets and says "the white one, for my hypertension" as opposed to the "yellow and green one" for something else. In any case, that's in the big version of the MIMS, yes? Don't have that in the polyclinics in Singapore. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 08:23, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I did some edits to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peritoneum.html" title="Peritoneum">peritoneum</a> to define "peritoneal cavity". It seems to me however that some people define that term differently, not as the space between the two peritoneal layers, but as the whole space surrounded by the peritoneum. For instance, I find statements on the web like "the stomach is located in the peritoneal cavity". Are those statements simply wrong, or is that just an alternative valid definition? Thanks, <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 21:51, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The peritoneal cavity or "peritoneal space" as it should be called is the space enclosed by the peritoneum. It is not equal to the abdominal cavity though it appears to approximate this. The stomach itself is within the peritoneal cavity though structures such as the duodenum are not. The distinction is important for medical purposes. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 08:05, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oops, then my edits on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peritoneum.html" title="Peritoneum">Peritoneum</a> were wrong: I defined "peritoneal cavity" as the potential space between the two peritoneal layers, which contains the fluid between the two layers (but obviously not the stomach). What is the correct term for that space? I worked off of <a href="http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/gastrointestinal_system/peritoneum_ans.html#1" class="external free" title="http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/gastrointestinal_system/peritoneum_ans.html#1" rel="nofollow">http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/gastrointestinal_system/peritoneum_ans.html#1</a> .

<dd>Sorry but I think I should clarify myself a little better. Structures in the abdominal are classified as being intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal, depending on whether they have a covering of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visceral_peritoneum.html" title="Visceral peritoneum">visceral peritoneum</a> and a <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesentery.html" title="Mesentery">mesentery</a> or not.

<p>I am pretty sure the lymphatic system has no mechanism for sorting out fats from dissolved vitamins, dissolved iron and dissolved carbohydrates in the area around the small intestines. Since there is no mechanism for keeping other nutrients out of the lymph system the chyle has a lot of other material besides fat in it. It just picks up what's there, in other words, just like in the rest of the body. In fact I have read that the lymphatic system is the only way for any nutrient to get into the body and bloodstream. I am pretty sure about this. I mean, <i>how exactly</i> would vitamins and iron and glucose enter the bloodstream? I don't believe they would just pass through the walls of the capillaries. It may be that digestion is the main attribute of the lymphatic system. Think about it. Wouldn't the vitamins and glucose be dissolved in the fat?--<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 16:11, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You think about it. Why does the portal venous system exist if the lymphatics take all the nutrients from the gut? Why don't the intestines have veins that drain to the vena cava instead of to the liver? Sure, some stuff ends up in the chyle but definitely not everything and certainly not most. Most of the fats end up in the lymph but not the rest. They go straight to the liver. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 01:05, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the lymphatic system is very interesting but I am certainly in no position to research it in depth. I am a little surprised that the text I referred to was so emphatic about the point I was making. It stated quite clearly that all the nutrients were present in chyle. This was in 1990 and I thought it was very interesting so I remembered it years later. As my mycetoma reading is more or less up-to-date at this point I am not really worried about my science credibility vis a vis my contribution to <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycetoma.html" title="Mycetoma">Mycetoma</a> and mycetoma-linked articles. I am puzzled by the medical textbook I read in 1990, however. Multiple research input is always an important value. I shouln't complain. Hmmm. I must say I am disappointed in my own Spidey-Sense in this case, but that's par for the course for Spiderman. There is no way I can remember which text it was, unfortunately. I think its amazing that there could be such an important differential between portal system pickup and lymph system pickup of nutrients in the small intestinal or gut area. I wish I had more time spent with the books on this one. And I certainly wish the answers to this issue were more perfectly obvious. I noticed that you have been active in writing articles about Malaysia; I have been going through Asian and African FA pages and creating them and filling them out with lists of teams. I think I actually started <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Association_of_Malaysia_e1ba.html" title="Football Association of Malaysia">Football Association of Malaysia</a> just yesterday. It certainly needs someone to fill it out as it currently just a list and an introductory statement. For instance, Johor and Johor FC both are clubs, in Division B. How is one to know which clubs to add 'FC' to, if any? --<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 16:45, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex. I noticed your comments at Cerebral hemorrage and thought I'd point out that the article used to be a redirect to <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebrovascular_accident.html" title="Cerebrovascular accident">Cerebrovascular accident</a> but was made into its own mini-stub a while back (since expanded a bit). I posted several inquiries as to why this was, but got no response. I didn't want to mess with it myself because I don't know anything about medicine. But as I see your a doctor I'll encourage you to go ahead and merge/redirect it back where it seems it belongs. It's good to have knowledgable people working on these articles, as opposed to the kid you made the initial stub. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if you can help me. I first came into contact with you from my adding to the lymph page. Thanks for explaining that to me. I came back to your page, and to WikiDoc, and I noticed that you have taken a participatory role there. The issue is that I contribute to and create medical pages, mostly in helminthology, and I need to check them with a qualified medical person because I don't want to end up with professionalism issues from producing medical articles in an important science-based encyclopedia. My qualifications would fall into two categories: 1. advanced science study, a mild contact with medicine including 5 years working as a medical terminology typist and in a medical software corporate setting as customer support administrative assistant, associations with medical people within my biological family, a long, successful, involved relationship with a woman from a big Asian-American medical family and 2. a situational qualification in that the articles I have started or added to (<a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycetoma.html" title="Mycetoma">Mycetoma</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/m/Eumycetoma.html" title="Eumycetoma">Eumycetoma</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actinomycetoma.html" title="Actinomycetoma">Actinomycetoma</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mycetoma_Research_Center_af0f.html" title="The Mycetoma Research Center">The Mycetoma Research Center</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracidium.html" title="Miracidium">miracidium</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/g/EPG_da11.html" title="EPG">EPG</a>, and soon <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cercariae.html" title="Cercariae">cercariae</a>) were all completely unrepresented on the Wikipedia. In other words, if a real doctor had written these articles in the first place I wouldn't find myself in a position of being Hippocratic about the complete lack of documentation of these subjects. On the other hand, if I can write to someone here each time I input some necessary information I wouldn't have to worry about it from the standpoint of professionalism. I am not planning on writing medical articles, but I do like to go through the peer review at EntezPubMed:Schistosomiasis and the Mycetoma Research Center from time to time and it is quite mind-boggling to me to find key words and concepts without even so much as a sub-stub here. It is no problem for me to create stub articles as long as I can report here directly to you when I have completed. <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycetoma.html" title="Mycetoma">Mycetoma</a> is an example of such a subject. I couldn't find a figure on the number of people afflicted with Mycetoma but it seems like a huge problem. At any rate, I only started Wikipedia'ing a month ago, so it has taken me this long to write to you (or WikiDoc). Let me know if it is a problem for me to notify you when I write cercariae and other potential non-existent articles. I really need someone to check them over and edit them after they are input, to make sure there is nothing wrong with them whatsoever. Also, importantly, the people at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Khartoum_7c51.html" title="University of Khartoum">University of Khartoum</a> need someone on this end to talk to about mycetoma; I really can't be there for them. And, as far as enhancing my role at WikiDoc, I am far too diversified at this point to begin contributing. Sorry for such a long discussion article. Feel free to move it to an archive when you feel like it. Thanks. --<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 18:03, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the research side, there is a problem insofar as, as I can assure you, European and American doctors do not grow up with any kind of serious parasitology as part of their background. The closest that schistosomiasis comes to the US is in the form of a few scattered Caribbean emigres in the cities, and the odd tourist mishap, neither of which has any media presence that I know of. There are absolutely no troublesome parasites in Florida or Texas, AFAIK. The closest thing to it is the fire ant problem, and Mexican mycetoma south of the border which has no media presence either at this point, so there is a huge hole in the Wikipedia. On EntrezPubMed:Schistosomiasis there is a huge tranch of articles based on work being done at Dongting Lake south of Wuhan. I get a feeling that the lake is being used as a study area because of its proximity to research centers in China and because of the strong infrastucture in Wuhan. It attracts researchers from all over the world. I would love to write an article about Dongting Lake and link it to this research role, but how do I make a statement about it in a context that is basically peer review, albeit on the Wikipedia? I don't know how to write that. Also, since Hong Kong, Singapore and many other cities lie in the tropics, there must be medical personnel somewhere there who could work on this series of articles. There are 200m diagnosable people at any time on the planet and it doesn't help the Wikipedia to not have produced a commensurate amount of coverage. Again, I apologize for a long article on your discussion page. As soon as I find native Asian tropical medical experts here to consult with on Dongting Lake et al I will try to talk to them instead. I went to ZH and translated about 30 short periodic element pages like <a href="../../../s/b/_/Sb.html" title="Sb">Sb</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/_/Ta.html" title="Ta">Ta</a> in a long afternoon; it only takes me about a minute to translate a Chinese language medical peer review journal page, using software, and 10 minutes to rewrite it in English, so I can develop some solid knowledge for writing on the Wiki about this stuff, again for review by someone at your level. I only spent a little time reading about this, 15 years ago, and it feels good to get back in the saddle.

<p>I disagree with your recent edit on <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproduction.html" title="Reproduction">Reproduction</a> to remove the statement that sexual reproduction has the advantage of being able to mask "bad" genes.

<p>Secondly, I wish to let you know that a recent VFD that you took part in has closed.

<p>Hi there, I removed the text from the arm so that I could redistribute on separate pages. To be strict, the arm should only contain information from the shoulder to the elbow. The hand, forearm and such should be placed on forearm and separate pages. If there should be general information, it should be moved to upper limb as that is anatomically correct.

<p>Personally, I agree that the technical term should be the main article. Thus, "dental caries" should be the article "dental cavities" is directed to, but I did not do that because I figured that essentially it ends up being the same thing. The two should be the same article since they have the same definition, but I do agree with your assessment that *technically* dental cavities should redirect to dental caries (in my humble opinion). - <a href="../../../d/o/z/User%7EDozenist_62e6.html" title="User:Dozenist">Dozenist</a> <a href="../../../d/o/z/User_talk%7EDozenist_5328.html" title="User talk:Dozenist"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 03:00, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have had a go at the pneumonia investigation section (see entry in talk page) as this was very much written from a medical textbook/hospital approach, whereas most cases are treated in the community. Hence most cases (in UK) get no investigations, sputum culture often done, Xray less frequently and the rest rarely.

<p>I noticed you did some cleaning up on this article; thanks! Is it common wikipedia style to have section titles with only the first word capitalized and the rest lowercase? If so I shall be sure to follow that in the future. Also, I notice you removed my horizontal lines from the article. I thought those helped section the article a bit, as it looked a bit crowded with all the anatomy subsections. I'd like to hear why you disagree with their use.

<p>Hi Alex</p>
<p>I'm new to editing, so if you're the wrong person, whoops&#160;:-)</p>
<p>There have been a few edits on the hydrogen peroxide entry, and some of the stuff has been removed, with 'removed unciteable reference'. What does that mean, and how do I fix it? Or rather, what do I need to provide? One of the items I included was a URL to the page on the FDA server that mentions that H2O2 is GRAS, and that was also removed.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>"Squatting is believed by some (absent medical evidence) to relieve and prevent virtually all colorectal disorders (constipation, Crohn's disease, colitis, etc.)"</p>

<p>"Squatting has been shown to relieve and prevent hemorrhoids (see external link below)"</p>
<p>I added a link to the Townsend article on this subject. --Jonathan108 16:49, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I read that article and it states "One proposed way to prevent and cure haemorrhoids is to squat for defaecation. The evidence for this approach is ambiguous." - I take that as sufficient to mean that they did not prove anything. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 01:00, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did read it. That was just the best quote from the article and besides, the article did not give any good evidence that squatting (or not squatting) causes hemorrhoids. Another notable quote from <i>your</i> quoted article is "Our conclusion is that the question of the efficacy of squatting as a way of preventing or curing haemorrhoids remains to be resolved.". You want to quote this article as evidence for your statement as stated above, yet the article itself says it did not prove anything conclusively. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 20:23, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If a 90% cure rate is not "good evidence" I don't know what is. The article states: "Sikirov (1987) advised 20 patients who suffered from haemorrhoids to change their toilet habits in two ways: to wait until the urge to defaecate was strong and to defaecate in the squatting position. Of the 20 patients, 18 reported within a few days to a few months a significant reduction or complete absence of symptoms. The two who showed no improvement had previously had surgical treatments for haemorrhoids. Follow-up examinations, 12 and 30 months later, revealed no recurrence of haemorrhoids."</p>
<p>--Jonathan108 00:53, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. The article does not explain its own comment that the evidence is "ambiguous" or that the efficacy is "unresolved". So, I agree that this article would not be an ideal link. Perhaps the link should be to the Sikirov patent. His paper in the peer-reviewed Israel Journal of Medical Science does not seem to be available on line, but the patent has all the same information. --Jonathan108 15:34, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Despite being a truly bad article (extremely biased, outrages claims are made, and the sources used to back up those claims consist largely out of tiny newspaper snippets that are blown up out of proportion to make the subject sound like the second coming of the christ), the vote is so far flooded with "keep" votes, which might be because of dozens of sockpuppets, so I'd like to invite you to add your vote about this matter to tip the balance.

<p>Recently an article was deleted, entitled Nochaa.</p>
<p>This article was refered to as a vanity article. Everyone from south wales would like to let alex.tan know that he is an idiot and that Nochaa are one of those most important bands in our small corner of the world. Our small corner that houses TJ's, a peice of music heritage, the place where kurt cobain proposed to Courtney Love, the place where Iron Maiden were asked to turn their Amps down, the place where every band in existence wants to play.</p>
<p>This page was designed to be informative and give information to fans that they wouldnt find ANYWHERE else on the net but certain people on this website disagreed with this and out of either fear or plain envy they deleted the bands article. As the bands closest fan i would like you to know that when nochaa make it to the top, which they will do soon, i will let all of our fans know exactly who it was that didnt beleive in the band and exactly who it was that tried to slow their progress.</p>
<p>Nobody should be allowed to just decide whats good enough for the users of this website to read. This is supposed to be an open forum for the world. If Certain members of this forum wish to cleanse the archives to meet THEIR desires and no-one elses then that doesnt seem fair to me. There was another group of people that cleansed to meet their satisfaction and they were called NAZI's.</p>
<p>When Nochaa make it to the top of their industry im sure we'll be able to stop this website from publishing any article on the band at all, denying you thousands of website hits everyday.</p>
<p>good day</p>

<p>In 2003 you suggested such an article was needed (Vaccination - talk). The owner of Whale.to set up one called vaccine critics, which was later rfa'd and deleted. There is one now at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationists.html" title="Anti-vaccinationists">anti-vaccinationists</a> which is a horror, but I think a nucleus out of whcih something usable may come.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>What was the nature of the image you deleted from the TCard article. As the filename has DSC####.JPG, i believe this may well have been a valid image, if so it can be undeleted. Was a license tag given with the image? User A1 08:18, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you look carefully at my edit history, I did not delete the image, only the text which was lifted as a copyvio from the website cited. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 10:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Dr. Tan</p>
<p>I am in Newark, New Jersey, United States and I recently came across your 2000 everything2 post regarding copper and glaucoma. I represent a blind man who made brass (alloy of copper and zinc) lamps for many, many, many years. He used a metal grinder on a daily basis. His eyes were chronicly inflamed and irritated by brass particals in his eyes. He lost his sight to glaucoma.</p>
<p>I am looking into the connection between his work and his glaucoma. I suspect that the copper in the brass caused uveitis that progressed to glaucoma. But, I can't seen to find any supporting authority on the internet. I was delighted to find your post on the subject.</p>
<p>Your post reads:</p>
<p>chalcosis (thing) by alex.tan (2.7 y) Fri May 26 2000 at 7:44:56 Eye irritation caused by fragments of copper or copper alloy being lodged in the eye. It may lead to glaucoma, uveitis, abscess formation, and loss of the eye.</p>
<p>Finding your post was like finding a message in a bottle.</p>
<p>Please reply by e-mail with any information or advice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
