<p>Wise did produce a newscast for MSNBC on Comcast cable 14 in Fort Wayne for about 5 years. Next time you better get your facts right before pulling something out of a story. Just wondering what backround you have with WKJG since I worked there for about 16 YEARS! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.245.221.128 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.245.221.128_26df.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.245.221.128">contribs</a>) 12:49, 7 June 2006 (EDT).</small></p>

<dd>I guess I was mis-informed. The original text implied that WISE produced the newscast for MSNBC themselves, which was obviously not true. It makes <b>a lot</b> more sense when you say that it was produced <i>for</i> Comcast and seen <i>on</i> Channel 14 (MSNBC), since cable companies override satellite signals for local stuff all the time. I didn't know that WISE did this, as I live in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angola%2C_Indiana_47e7.html" title="Angola, Indiana">Angola, Indiana</a>, far far away from Comcast's market. Thank you for the info, I cleaned up the wording a little bit... it should be agreeable to you.&#160;:-) I have no desire to get into a flame war/edit war over this. By the way, if you worked for WISE/WKJG, would you like to contribute more to the article? It has (apparently) got some serious problems right now, and I'm not knowledgeable enough in those areas to fix it.

<p>Also another FYI the 10pm news produced by INC will not be available on cable systems outside of Fort Wayne, just like when 33 did it.</p>

<p>If you are still here, I'd just like to ask you about your WBY10 (W10BM) article. Is this station still on the air, or did you just feel like documenting an old TV station? According to the FCC, the station was off the air two years ago. Just so you know, I've cleaned up the article, and managed to dig up the FCC's records on this station. Feel free to leave your reply here or on my talk page. AlexDW 19:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have made up a new list of full-service/class-A US television stations, called <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_StationCounting_d6dc.html" title="User:Alexdw/StationCounting">User:Alexdw/StationCounting</a>. I have limited the scope in this way so it would only contain notable or semi-notable stations. Not a perfect method, but it was fairly easy to do. I hope to use this list to update the TV station list further, and to get an accurate count of TV stations in the US (for the progress table). -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 18:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That list looks good to me as well as your plan. Let's wait until the original list is complete so that those items can be removed from your new list. That way stations that already have an infobox do not have to be pruned yet again. --<i><a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7EReflex_Reaction_620a.html" title="User:Reflex Reaction"><font color="#D2691E"><b>Reflex Reaction</b></font></a></i> (<a href="../../../r/e/f/User_talk%7EReflex_Reaction_64a3.html" title="User talk:Reflex Reaction"><font color="#A0522D">talk</font></a>)• 19:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks!&#160;:-) I could prune the semi-finished articles from the list fairly easily. I don't plan on putting this information into the main list <i>at least</i> until the "wrong article", "needs infobox", and "cleanup" categories are finished. I am also trying to de-redlink all of the translator stations on this list, to get them out of the way of the real work. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 22:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was thinking of implementing one. Also, I was thinking of merging my list with the one at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles_List_of_U.S._television_stations_55ab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles/List of U.S. television stations">WikiProject Missing articles</a> with a more complete list. That list is more visible, although sadly out-of-date and innaccurate. Many of the stations that were listed there have incorrect call letters, mostly due to a missing "-LP" or "-CA".</dd>
<dd>At one time, the list supposedly didn't contain low-power stations. It was based on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_television_stations_in_the_United_States_by_call_sign_%28initial_letter_W%29_b856.html" title="List of television stations in the United States by call sign (initial letter W)">List of TV stations (W)</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_television_stations_in_the_United_States_by_call_sign_%28initial_letter_K%29_f30d.html" title="List of television stations in the United States by call sign (initial letter K)">List of TV stations (K)</a>, which originally didn't, and still doesn't, have the proper prefixes. Those lists, and the state lists, all need to be updated. I want to try to get <i>at least</i> the non-repeater low-powers on those lists as well. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 12:04, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right. I recall when we were building those lists, a year and a half ago, we were simply using the lists provided from the network web-sites, which themselves contained a few errors (and The WB had no official affiliate list at all!). Add a year and a half, a little neglect, and some bad edits, and you end up with two lists in need of serious attention. And, yes, the states lists could use an overhaul, too.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Perth_38c5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Perth">WikiProject Perth</a> has a progress bar which has been useful on other projects I've worked on. I don't know if you want to use it, but I have found it very useful.

<dd>Thank you for your compliments! I have been programming in various langugages for many years now, so WikiSyntax was fairly easy to pick up. I came to this project after trying to make a <a href="http://www.mgzi.net/tv/" class="external text" title="http://www.mgzi.net/tv/" rel="nofollow">TV station database</a> of my own, and noting how hard it was to find decent information on many low-power stations, most of whom had not web sites of their own.</dd>
<dd>I think I'll use the Perth progress bar when I update these lists. I might make three separate progress lists... full-service, Class A, and low-power. Since most of the low-powers (and many of the Class A's) aren't really notable, the last one will probably languish for a while. Does that seem like reasonable dividing points, or should they be further broken down into east and west (W/K)? I appreciate your input. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 13:30, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds reasonable to me. At the rate we're building, I don't anticipate any of those lists will be that large for too long. I agree that WP is a great place to find obscure information, or of finding someone who knows how to find obscure information. And with so many editors, it has a big advantage over the website/webmaster model. Do you have popups? It's an extremely useful MetaWiki tool great for finding really short stub articles. You hover your mouse over any wikilink, and it will tell you how large the article in question is. I believe it is a must for any list-maker, and I use it on my lists. It is just a suggestion. Thanks again for your lists!

<p>Hello, Alex. I'd ask you not to take it personally, but I suspect from the "rvv"s (that tag's for vandalism, isn't it?) that you already did. For starters, it's not just U.S. articles I've been doing it to -- here's some examples from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bredsten&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59324348" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bredsten&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59324348" rel="nofollow">Denmark</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beanley_Island%2C_Queensland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59320326" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beanley_Island%2C_Queensland&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59320326" rel="nofollow">Australia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Izzatnagar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59167200" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Izzatnagar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59167200" rel="nofollow">India</a>. If you'd care to take a look at the "Geographical bias" section on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_Examples_bee0.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Examples">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Examples</a>, you'll see it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Location: You are writing a universal encyclopedia to an international audience, so any assumption over location or "common sense" familiarity with geography should not be taken.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifying "United States" in an article about <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Valley%2C_Minnesota_2241.html" title="Apple Valley, Minnesota">Apple Valley, Minnesota</a>, might seem like pedantry (or even vandalism) to someone, like you, from that country, but you can't expect every possible reader in other countries to be perfectly au fait with the names of all 50 U.S. states (I know I get bogged down among all the ones that begin with Ms and Is). How many <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_of_Malaysia_fd95.html" title="States of Malaysia">states of Malaysia</a>, or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Argentina_38c8.html" title="Provinces of Argentina">provinces of Argentina</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Ireland_391f.html" title="Counties of Ireland">counties of Ireland</a> could you list (or even recognize) off the cuff? That's why, on my <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">Special:Random</a> excursions around the Wikipedia, I've taken to adding the country of context to those articles lacking it. I really don't see why you'd have a problem with that. Again: "universal encyclopedia" for an "international audience", from a "neutral point of view". The USA is a big country, an important country, for both the world and en.wikipedia.org, but please don't take call it vandalism when someone else thinks it'd be useful to indicate just what country Iowa or Wyoming or Vermont is in for the benefit of a potential reader in <a href="../../../k/e/b/Kebbi.html" title="Kebbi">Kebbi</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balochistan_%28Pakistan%29_b6b0.html" title="Balochistan (Pakistan)">Balochistan</a>.

<dd>I apologize for the "rvv" ... you can't edit your edit summaries.&#160;:-( I assumed it was a random edit, but I wasn't (at the beginning) aware it was a long string of good-faith edits.</dd>
<dd>However, I still take issue with some (not all) of the edits, specifically those in the "City, State, Country" format. Although it is informative, it is also extremely <i>verbose</i>. That type of geographic information is readily available in the page about the city, which is just "a click away". If I was refering to a <i>local</i> topic in, say, <a href="../../../g/w/a/Gwandu.html" title="Gwandu">Gwandu</a>, I (myself, not refering to some general opinion) would probably call it Gwandu, Kebbi; not Gwandu, Kebbi, Nigeria; or Gwandu, Kebbi, Nigeria, Africa, Earth, .....</dd>
<dd>I'm not looking at this as a national bias problem, but a taxonomic one. For a non-geographic example, look at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Wolf_07d4.html" title="Gray Wolf">Gray Wolf</a> article. It mentions the entire taxonomy of the wolf, from its Kingdom (<i>Animalia</i>), all the way to its genus and species (<i>Canis lupus</i>). However, in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animals_of_Yellowstone_8dd7.html" title="Animals of Yellowstone">Animals of Yellowstone</a>, the article simply calls it <i>Canis lupus</i> in one place, and a wolf elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>For radio/television station articles, at least, I could see editing the article to say:
<dl>
<dd><b>WXXX-FM</b> is a radio station in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, located in the city of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>However, the wording:
<dl>
<dd><b>WXXX-FM</b> is a radio station in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>is just clunky, and overly verbose. I have not altered articles written like the former, but have generally re-written or reverted articles written like the latter. (<i>At least that's how I remember it. YMMV.&#160;:-)</i>) Generally speaking, I edited the articles once, then dropped them off of my watch-list. I have no desire to get into a silly edit war over two words... I have neither the time nor the inclination. I just thought it looked bad, and I "fixed" it. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 02:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the answer. You're probably right about "<a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>" looking kind of clunky (with a touch of air-mail envelope, too). Previously, whenever I hit one of those millions of RamBot U.S. city articles ("Armpit is a town in Remote County, Somestate.") what I did was change it to "Armpit is a town in Remote County, Somestate, in the United States", which at least breaks the comma, comma, comma rhythm. (Better still would have been "Armpit is a city in Remote County, in the U.S. state of Somestate", but that meant a lot more cutting and pasting of the various components.) However, in recent weeks, I see someone's let a bot loose on all of those, and most of them now read "... in Remote County, Somestate, United States". Which is probably why I abandoned the "... in the United States" formula in the face of overwhelming numbers. Long live air-mail.

<dd>According to <a href="http://radiostationworld.com/Locations/United_States_of_America/Illinois/tv_information.asp?m=chi" class="external text" title="http://radiostationworld.com/Locations/United_States_of_America/Illinois/tv_information.asp?m=chi" rel="nofollow">RadioStationWorld's list of Chicago market stations</a> and the <a href="http://ekb.dbstalk.com/19" class="external text" title="http://ekb.dbstalk.com/19" rel="nofollow">Echostar Knowledge Base's locals list</a>, <a href="../../../w/w/t/WWTO-TV_44d9.html" title="WWTO-TV">WWTO-TV</a> (and <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Salle_County%2C_Illinois_9fb4.html" title="La Salle County, Illinois">La Salle County</a> itself) is part of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> market. How well that actually reflects local viewing habits, I do not know. It is possible that Nielsen has moved La Salle into the Peoria DMA since these pages were last updated, but I don't have access to the county and community DMA lists. (Other sources that say Chicago: <a href="http://tv.backchannelmedia.com/station/show/WWTO" class="external text" title="http://tv.backchannelmedia.com/station/show/WWTO" rel="nofollow">BackChannel</a>, <a href="http://www.nab.org/newsroom/Issues/digitaltv/DDTV/1102.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nab.org/newsroom/Issues/digitaltv/DDTV/1102.pdf" rel="nofollow">NAB (brief, PDF)</a>, <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA525332.html?display=Special+Rep" class="external text" title="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA525332.html?display=Special+Rep" rel="nofollow">Broadcasting &amp; Cable</a>.)</dd>
<dd>WWTO-TV's standing as a "Chicago" station is not without challenge, however: <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1997/da970545.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1997/da970545.txt" rel="nofollow">Time Warner v. WWTO-TV</a>. If I were a cable operator in that area, I know I would have a hard time accepting their claim on Chicago, as they don't provide very good primary coverage there (although they do have a repeater in Arlington Heights.) Still, at least for the moment, Chicago does seem to be their "market", with repeaters elsewhere to provide greater coverage.</dd>
<dd>I wouldn't have any objection to putting in templates for the other markets. W9WI's <a href="http://www.w9wi.com/tvdb/states/il.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.w9wi.com/tvdb/states/il.htm" rel="nofollow">list of stations in Illinois</a> shows some of the repeaters I have listed as <i>WWTO (35 TBN)</i> and others as just <i>TBN</i>; since (I assume) WWTO-TV is itself a repeater of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Broadcasting_Network_0af7.html" title="Trinity Broadcasting Network">TBN</a> satellite feed, these nearby stations could be easily classed as repeaters of WWTO. If WWTO does originate programming, their affiliation with the station is still likely, given that, in many cases, the stations listed as WWTO repeaters are more distant than the stations listed as TBN repeaters.</dd>
<dd>In any case, it is highly unlikely that the individual TBN repeaters, regardless of programming, are actually notable. Mentioning them here seems like a good compromise (to me) between creating a few dozen more TBN repeater articles and ignoring them altogether. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 18:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I don't encourage it, I do typically let it slide when people futz around with pages in my user space. It generally has to be something minor, but if it's not fiddling around with things I did on purpose, like the way I format them, or introducing errors, I don't do any reversions.</p>

<dd>It comes from Ojibwe/Potawatomi ledgends from around Lake Superior, where copper was often extracted from the waters to make jewelry. Mitzupishu (or any other take-your-pick spelling) is, of course, the spirit guardian of the waters — and became associated with this craft. Ledgend has it that Mitzupishu would give copper pieces to Nishnabe for their jewelry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also have story about Mitzupishu and Nanabuzho. Nanabuzho was not the greatest fisherman in the world -- many times the other young men in the village would go fishing and come back with plenty of fish to feed their family, while Nanabuzho had only one or none at all. Nanabuzho finally decided that he wanted to show them he could catch fish too. He prayed to G'dje-Manido to make the fish come to him. After he finishe his prayers, he went out into the lake in his canoe -- and caught many fish. The fish just kept coming and coming, he didn't know when to stop. Finally, when his canoe was full of fish, he realized that he had more fish than he could use -- more than the whole village could use. He was so ashamed that he took all of the fish and buried them in the woods, and returned to the village empty handed. Mitzupishu saw what he had done, and was very angry. He went to G'dje-Manido and said, "look what Nanabuzho has done! Look how he murdered my fish people!" (It was considered murder because he killed them not to feed his family, but out of pride and greed.) Mitzupishu asked G'dje-Manido what he was going to do about this, and G'dje-Manido decided to punish Nanabuzho and his village, and sent the thunderbird to bring great rains, and caused a great flood. Nanabuzho, out sulking in his canoe, was the only person to survive. He floated for many days, and finally came across an otter with mud in his mouth. Nanabuzho took the mud, and blew it out over the water, and made an island for him to live on. This is one of the many stories of Nanabuzho passed down to me by my father. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 23:28, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ClairSamoht is vandalizing the site. He is making dangerous assumptions about Granite Broadcasting. He is very close to legal action. User:Josephblowhard</p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I can tell, based upon evidence presented, Granite defaulted on a payment, and then later made that payment (albeit one month late). One would be correct in saying that they <i>had</i> defaulted, but not (necessarily) that they were <i>currently</i> in default, if the quoted SEC statement is true. After checking Granite's last quarterly report, I see that this is, in fact, the case. The potential truthfulness of these statements, however, is not particularly relevant to my (minor) spelling and markup fixes. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexdw_19ae.html" title="User:Alexdw">AlexDW</a> 16:57, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realize that it is not you making the changes but Mr. Smoht is quite militant about putting Granite in bankruptcy and that is not correct. I was hoping for your help. I would like to dispute facts in this article but everytime I do I am said to be commiting vandalism. User:Josephbloward</p>
