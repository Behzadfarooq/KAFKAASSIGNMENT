<p>The biographical info on Jones in this article has a lack of info about his life before his radio shows in the mid '90s. Is there any information about where he graduated from high school, and if he went to college?</p>

<p>This entire article needs NPOV cleanup. There is absolutely no material about refutations of Jones' ideas. Additionally the whole thing reads rather like PR. I have removed the term "Conspiracy Realist" from the page because it is an inherently POV waesel word term. Jones deserves a comprehensive fair article, what we have is far from that.</p>
<p><br />
I disagree entirely. If anything, this is propaganda against Alex Jones. I have very little bias with regards to this, I just googled to find out who he was. I can see how he might be seen as a bit over the top, but undeniably he is also a critical journalist who brings out some valid points. Claiming that this is propaganda FOR Alex Jones is completely skewed, and takes the discussion off track. My impression reading this article was that the authors were desperate to make him look like a looney, especially with the first section ("Views") and the very poor descriptions of his filmography, which I believe is what most people will look at. 84.210.30.185 02:39, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, the people on this page calling for more criticism of Alex Jones should start signing.... 84.210.30.185 02:41, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are there any concrete refs on Alex's take on homosexuality? (I'm not saying he's gay so relax.) Listening to his show some of his guests (like Alan Watt) have implied homosexuality is being promoted by the NWO as a way to bring down society. But searching around I haven't found any "Alex Jones: homosexuals are evil." articles. (The fact that Alex is a Christian doesn't necessarily mean he is anti-gay.) --Anonymous Coward</p>

<dd>Does it really matter? I've never once heard Jones refer to gays, except in the context of hypocritical 'Christian Conservative' politicians engaging in gay acts.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaltech22_ed56.html" title="User:Baltech22">Baltech22</a> 02:53, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jones has said several times on his radio show that while he morally opposes homosexuality due to his religious persuasion, he very strongly supports equal rights for homosexuals due to his libertarian political beliefs.Vulcanhacker</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlex_Jones_%28radio%29_bb9f.html" title="Edit section: Jones On The Bible">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jones On The Bible</span></h2>
<p>Jones often claims that the Bible is "all about" standing up against evil and corruption. On the June 5, 2006 Broadcast of his show, a caller challenged this claim, citing Matthew 5:39, and asked Jones "was Jesus lying in that verse" (referring to Matthew 5:39 of the Bible), to which Jones replied "Yeah!" Jones went on to claim that Jesus "beat" the money changers and "smashed their heads." He went on to call Christians who don't resist corruption and tyranny "scum" and said they would all "burn in Hell". On the October 16, 2006 broadcast of his show, Jones responded to the same caller's implication that David's submission to Saul despite Saul's repeated attempts to have David killed disproved his claim about the Bible by saying, among other things, "God cursed Israel with a king because they asked Him for one."</p>
<p>The archives at GCN live provide access to all previous broadcasts of "The Alex Jones Show". Anyone can pay a nominal fee to access them and listen to the shows themselves for verification of the content. I include this because I feel that Jones misrepresents the Bible to justify his "infowar". No matter how worthy his cause is, I feel this is very wrong to do.</p>
<p>Jesus never lied. Come on, its the same guy who claims the government caused 9/11. 66.218.13.249</p>
<p>This is misinterpretation. I even remember hearing this... He said 'yeah' in a sense 'yeah and moon is a blue cheese', or 'yeah, thats nice opinion of yours, good bye'. If this is the best 'Bible' attack on Jones you can bring on, you are pretty weak. Come on, stop using text out of context. Do you really have to lie to make him look bad?</p>
<p>TRee Hugger- WTF? A large part of the old testament was about God telling prophets to go against the Machine or fight the man. Prophets criticise unjust kings commonly. While the rest of the old testament is about God telling the Isrealites they are the chosen ones and can run amok slaughtering anyone they choose and stealing their land.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jones is right on alot he says about the Bible. Yes, God does require rulers (and everyone else for that matter) to be just and God requires people that have the wherewithal to do so, to stand up for the oppressed, weak, helpless, and poor. I am constantly amazed at how many silly jackasses there are out there that have no knowledge of the God of the Bible. - NoSnooz</p>

<p>Jones has also predicted that WW3 will begin before the Elections in November.

<dd>He puts those among his non-official views, he has done that a lot of times. But he has never called any of those fears by any "operation" name, he only did it pre-9/11. And of course, now. Other than that, he sometimes will go into "daydream" mode. Remeber that he is a talk show host also, and its easy to find quotes on things he have said during the year.

<p>He does say he is speculating on many occasions, guessing, theorising, based on many collections of supposedly credible media outlets reports that may get sanitised later or be archived on the sites.</p>
<p>When Alex makes predictions, I say consider them more like scenarios to ponder. No individual in our country has a more scrutinizing eye on what's going on in the world than Alex. Of course, he is not going to call a majority of events right. Who could? I only know, and we all do if we're honest, the way history is playing out, we are in perilous times now.

<p>Ok, fine, that might be using Wikipedia to document Wikipedia. But simply read the first few paragraphs under "Views". Assuming that this is an accurate description of Jones' beliefs, then this much is true: he claims that a secret, powerful group controls banking and the media and is manipulating public opinion to destroy, or weaken, US sovereignity.

<dd>The term "conspiracy theory" has a clear pejorative conotation in the english language. Even if factualy correct, the pejorative conotation is enough for not endorsing it. And then, Alex does not view his statments as "Theories", he belives them to be factual. A "conspiracy theory" is usualy meant to mean STRONGLY unlickely theory, such as Bush being a lizard-man.

<p>In my opinion, perhaps "conspiracy theorist" should be replaced with "investigative journalist." Somewhere it could be mentions that his critics consider him to be a "conspiracy theorist."

<dd>It's interesting how people argue that Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist because he theorises on conspiracies, yet these same people would go berserk if someone were to change the page on 9/11 to say that the official story on what happened is nothing more than a conspiracy theory in itself, because it is a theory about a conspiracy and is not fact. Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist, however I would resist the use of such a POV term on Wikipedia unless people who promote the official theory are counted as such also. <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECoconuteire_a162.html" title="User:Coconuteire">Coconuteire</a> 19:14, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you can't prove it, it's a theory, hence "conspiraacy theorist". Jones has never submitted any of his ideas to be vetted by an impartial third party.

<p>It seems to me that sections of the now-deleted articles on the Jones' movies need to be readded to this page, to establish his notability. I would say no more than two or three paragraphs per movie, to summarize Jones's key theses. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:33, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most of his "movies" are chopped and pasted home movies with continuity problems and really nice intros followed by a introduction rant that is usually too long. I have just about all of them up to the martial law including the "emergency" releases. His Blairwitch style on Bohemian Grove was above average. But his 'movies' as movies go, are not that critially aclaimed from a production value or videography perspective. If you want to establish notability the videos arent the direction to go. Anyone doing research on Jones will find the videos easy enough. I have researched most of the videos subjects claims and find they are verifiable and worthy of further study and wariness. Wikipedia is culturally biased as a web community against reform efforts of folks like jones and there are plenty of troll like editors to censor your best efforts to NPOV and source your postings. They selectively enforce the "rules" from my experience. Efforts for most are best spent elsewhere at somepoint you have to conclude. Waste all the time you want.</p>

<p>Newcomer here...so don't bite. This article has no opposing view points or criticisms of Alex Jones. This is the first I've read of him but I doubt that a controversial figure such as this is without criticism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We need to put together a consensus of the kind of criticisms he is subject to. The problem is, we can't seem to arrive at one, and a lot of the harsher criticisms leveled at Jones come from sources who are 'crazier' than he is often accused of being. I will say that the most significant criticisms of Jones that seem to emerge repeatedly are that:</dd>
<dd>a) He takes some of his information from dubious sources [publications and websites on the fringe right and fringe left, as well as books written from a conspiratorial perspective similar to his own on subjects that lack a great deal of mainstream/reliable scholarship].</dd>
<dd>b) When the facts he cites are solid, the conclusions he draws do not necessarily follow from those facts.</dd>
<dd>Jones seems to have critics and enemies on all corners of the spectrum. In the 2 months or so that I've been following and reading about him, I've seen him referred to as a 'conspiracy nut', 'government disinfo agent', 'anti-semite', 'crypto-zionist', 'hatemonger', 'pacifist', 'gullible idiot', 'clever snake oil salesman', 'left wing lunatic', 'right wing lunatic', 'friend of David Icke', 'critic of David Icke', 'Bullhorning jackass' and 'Rush Limbaugh wannabe'... So yah, he must be doing something right. --baltech22 18:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

Some articles on productions by Jones have been deleted in September 2006. Perhaps these could be included sort of as an appendix in this article?

<p>I also noticed this. It seems very odd, given TerrorStorm's success and high visibility on Google. It occurs to me that whoever pulled the articles is, ironically, helping lend credence to the belief of Alex Jones and his adherents that he is being conspired against. --- Buddy-Rey</p>
<p>Somebody put those back in. This whole article is rediculous. Looks like it was just meant to make this guy look bad. I just saw "Terrorstorm", and although this guy sadly goes over the top a few times, it was teeming with very interesting information, which seems accurate. This article does nothing to clarify matters though. I was looking for real info, and this article is pretty much a disgrace.

<dd>Don't be too hasty about this. Context is extremely important when you're talking about labeling someone with a potentially pejorative tag.

<dd>Unfortunately you are incorrect. Jones has constantly referred to Arnold and other naturalized citizens as "foreigners." He intentionally misquotes U.S. law - instead of accurately saying that the law prevents "foreign-born" citizens from becoming President, he simply lumps all naturalized citizens with "foreigners" which obviously refers to non-citizens (and non-residents) and on top of that, refers to them as "foreign usurpers." That is really pathetic and it's a flagrantly cheap shot, to attack someone, a citizen of the United States of America, because they weren't born here. Simply put, he is a classic xenophobe. I'd like to know if he also considers "hyphenated" Americans (Italian-American, Polish-American, etc.) as "foreigners" and potential "foreign usurpers." VivaRiva 06:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whoa, whoa, hold up there. Jones' whole agenda is in resisting the creation of a one-world government, and part and parcel with that is the resistance against the United States losing its sovereignty and voiding its constitution (i.e. as part of a Pan-American Union that's in the works). The law against foreign-born individuals becoming President is on the books specifically to prevent foreign agents from compromising U.S. sovereignty.</dd>
<dd>And furthermore, the term 'foreigner' might be semi-colloquial [or at least, not P.C.], but it's not intrinsically pejorative, I suggest you check out [<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/foreigner" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/foreigner" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] before suggesting someone is xenophobic simply for using the term.</dd>

<dd>I do not find Alex Jones to be racist. You speak about his apparent xenophobia as if it is a bad thing. It is perfectly natural for one to be protective of one's culture, identity and nation and to resist all attempts to usurp them by outsiders. His concern with Arnold Schwarzenegger's attempt to become US president is, in my opinion, entirely justified. If I were, heaven forbid, to move to the US and become a naturalised citizen, I would not find the term "foreigner" offensive whatsoever, because that's EXACTLY WHAT I AM TO THE AMERICANS AND VICE-VERSA! <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECoconuteire_a162.html" title="User:Coconuteire">Coconuteire</a> 19:20, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not think he should be tagged as an investigative journalist. As someone who used to read and watch his stuff (I know better now), I have to say I have never come across any material of his that could be considered investigative journalism. Has he uncovered anything? Has he reported things that have gone unreported (and I mean <i>anywhere</i>, including some dude posting rants on the internet)? Has he ever broken any stories? If not, he is not an investigative journalist. Oh, and, no I am not a shill for the Bush administration. So, don't even go there. I'm a left-wing commie.

<dd>Mate, I'm a far lefty and I still consider AJ to count as an investigative journalist even though I haven't listened to him in a long time and probably won't again. IJs travel a lot, conduct interviews, break stories, expose crimes and attempt to put pieces of the puzzle together. Alex Jones does all of these things. <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECoconuteire_a162.html" title="User:Coconuteire">Coconuteire</a> 19:25, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I have moved away from the way that Alex Jones communicates his opinions and information, I would still disagree with you and say simply that a few of the things Alex has independently researched and looked into and reported were recognized as something he essentially "broke", according to lots of folks in the "alternative media". I'll leave it to others to list some specific examples, but to be honest, I disagree with your premise that someone needs to have their own "I'm the only one who discovered this" credit to deserve the I.J. label&#160;:)</p>
<p>The lead para states that he "questions the standard accounts of the September 11th terrorist attacks" and reading further on, it emerges that he promotes the notion that the US government was knowingly involved in this and other atrocities. That makes him a conspiracy theorist. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 00:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Labelling anyone a "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theorist.html" title="Conspiracy theorist">conspiracy theorist</a>" is not very helpful, since some conspiracies actually exist, and others do not exist but are mere products of imagination.

<dd>It is my honest opinion that Jones' work involves research and investigation in a manner very similar to that of a journalist.

<li><b>Support</b>. No question, today more people are interested in this Alex Jones than the others. I find the suggestion that he's "non notable" to be off the wall- if he's not an example of a notable conspiracy theorist, who is? I can sympathize with those who take umbrage that he could overshadow a Pulitzer winner; for instance, I find it maddening that at <a href="../../../p/a/u/Talk%7EPaul_O%27Neill_2cbe.html" title="Talk:Paul O'Neill">Talk:Paul O'Neill</a> they could decide that someone who swatted balls was equal to a cabinet secretary. But though one might wish that the general public was more familiar with Pulitzer winners, at this point he is a Trivial Pursuit question. Still, in fifty or a hundred years, this Jones might be as obscure as the others, so I'm not going to sweat it. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWacoKid_d7ce.html" title="User:WacoKid">WacoKid</a> 16:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Not notable, largely unsourced conspiracy theorist. I presume the paragraphs about bodily functions are vandalism.

<p>I heard on His show a few weeks ago that He almost lost his index finger. He almost cut all the way off. I cant recall though if it was the left or right although I think it was the right.

<p>Is this really a good introduction for a biography? I think there should be something about what his recent activities are, his claims to fame, what he is praised for and what he is shunned for etc.. At present, this article presents some of his seemingly most extreme theories (if they are actually his theories, I don't know) as a guide to the man, which is very misleading if you are trying to find out what people in most cases mean when referring to him. The section on his views should mention his emphasis on examples of historic falsifications of data, which are not controversial anymore (eg. the pretext for the Vietnam War), and his scepticism towards the nature of present day administrated mass media. Although I agree that some mention should also be made about his more "far out" claims, the specific examples given are not very informative. 84.210.30.185 03:36, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Statements further down the page (in the comments about his movies) says that he believes "that all major 20th and 21st century terrorist attacks were orchestrated by governments". That sounds pretty far out, is that accurate? It sounds very strange to me that he would dismiss the IRA, ETA, Hezbollah and so on like that, even if he doesn't attribute all, or even most, terrorist attacks to such organisations. In any case, this should be moved to the "Views" section, or rewritten, as it is a poor movie description. 84.210.30.185 03:36, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me also urge you all to remember that this page will, conspiracy or not (I believe not), be targeted not only by people with mental problems and Bush haters or lovers, but also by professional PR companies, as this guy does attack political campaigns and big businesses. PR companies are big business (I even have a friend that works for one), and to try and sway public opinion is what they do. Wikipedia is an obvious target for PR. 84.210.30.185 03:36, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
