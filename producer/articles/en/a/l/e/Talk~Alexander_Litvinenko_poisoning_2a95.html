<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">3. Personal essays or Blogs that state your particular opinions about a topic. Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge. It is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of human knowledge. In the unusual situation where the opinions of a single individual are important enough to discuss, it is preferable to let other people write about them. Personal essays on topics relating to Wikipedia are welcome in your user namespace or on the Meta-wiki. There is a Wikipedia fork at Wikinfo that encourages personal opinions in articles.
<p>4. Opinions on current affairs is a particular case of the previous item. Although current affairs may stir passions and tempt people to "climb soapboxes" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced so as to put entries for current affairs in a reasonable perspective. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete.</p>

<dd>Who knows? Of course, the episodes with Nikita and Skuratov are well known. But we know surprisingly little about the actual Putin's life and career. One person who tried to investigate the actual biography of Putin was Artem Borovik (editor of newspaper "Top secret" - probably it does not exist any more), and he died in a puzzling plane crash (Putin said: "those who are against me will be dead in three days" - just a few days before this crash if I remember correctly). Another person who knows a lot about Putin is <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Berezovsky_b4d4.html" title="Boris Berezovsky">Boris Berezovsky</a> (so he might be next on the hit list). However, Berezovsky is guilty as sin in many things, so he probaly is not going to come forward and tell anything, unless his life is really threatened. I only hope that he is clever enought to write down everything he knows and keep it in a secret place (in the event if he is killed too). <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 03:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er, if actual traces of polonium were found at all these places, that raises the possibility of suicide. That Litvinenko is said to have converted to Islam then becomes vital info. Still hearsay, but we could cite it as unconfirmed hearsay. This is a self-destructing theory of course, because now that the possibility of a "theatrical" suicide has been raised, Litvinenko's entourage will probably not dare to publically bury him as a Muslim, so we may never know for sure.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, it is not always clear when reading these reports whether the police mean traces of radioactivity or traces of actual polonium. And the presence of polonium at all these places could also mean that someone very close to Litvinenko was involved. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 09:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Po-210 is 250 billion times more poisonous than cyanide, and yet American websites are selling it online without a licence?? So much for the "poisoners had their own nuclear reactor" hypothesis.. I just hope Osama hasn't noticed..</p>
<p>There was a reference at the end of the main article to the American website, <a href="http://www.unitednuclear.com/isotopes.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.unitednuclear.com/isotopes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unitednuclear.com/isotopes.htm</a>, which sells Polonium-210 over the internet, and a remark afterwards "debunking the claim that the poisoners must have been experts with access to a nuclear reactor". I've deleted the "debunking..." remark because it is untrue (or at least highly POV), but I've kept the link to the website because that appears to be a fact. In fact if you look at the website itself you will see that (i) they don't keep the Po-210 themselves - they arrange for it to be shipped from a reactor, (ii) the units they sell are only 1/15,000 of a lethal dose, (iii) it is highly infeasible to combine 15,000 of their units to make a lethal dose, (iv) and in any case they only sell 1 or 2 units every 3 months, so it would be very noticeable if someone tried to do this.89.241.1.1 22:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the original language (Russian of English) of the posthumous statement and his last words? Russian media has no consistent translation (e.g. bastards is translated to подонки or ублюдки), so it may be said in English, also there are some claims of Russian linguists that some phrases (as a passage about the wings of an angel of death) are uncommon for a person of Russian origin.--213.148.27.40 18:33, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The angel of death statement is a bit strange for a Russian-born man but remember he was living here for six years. My theory is that Mr Litvinenko had picked up some English phrases like the angel of death part and I reckon he probably tried to make the statement in English (perhaps parts in Russian as his English was said to not be very strong) whereas his last words were possibly in Russian.

<p>It's disputed, but some sources give October 30 as the birth date and some give December 4th. I've inserted both since there appears to be no proper source on this matter. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 23:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My theory on his birth date is 4th December, as being born in '62 would mean he would be 44. Most newspapers, no matter what they'd put his birth down as, claimed he was 43, which shows his birthday couldn't have passed yet. As for the 30th August thing, who's to say his relatives felt up to talking to a newspaper about when their deceased loved one was born? I think it likely that if it was a friend, his friend at the time confused the birth date with someone else's. It's very easy to do that. Plus, the only thing we can be sure of is that his medical details have it right, and they're not about to give them out to just anyone, are they? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Lilac_Pilgrim_ac78.html" title="User:The Lilac Pilgrim">The Lilac Pilgrim</a> 13:58, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Rupert Allason, the British intelligence expert, commented that he would be most surprised if the FSB had tried to kill Mr Litvinenko because it would fly in the face of 65 years of Soviet or Russian practice: Neither the FSB nor the KGB has ever killed a defector on foreign soil and their predecessors, even under Stalin, did so only once in the case of Walter Krivitsky in Washington in 1941.[38]</p>
<p>Is this a joke?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it isn't. Most of the Americans were brainwashed with anti-russian propaganda and KGB was not as evil as some might think. Actually, IMO, this whole "Litvinenko poisoned by ruskie hitmen", thing is pretty stupid and all these conspiracy theories were created mostly to undermine Russia's democratic status. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.70.38.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.70.38.90_6315.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.70.38.90">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>Either there is hidden information about gas and oil companies, which should not be revealed (Kremls interest to see Litvinenko mute), or the image of Putin should be decreased (Putins contrahents interests).

Even more, Putin made war with Tschetschenien, which was Ruschailos project for consensual peace. The murderer must have an organization in his background to steer suchs things.

<dd>I think it is by the same guy who on this talk page produced the part entitled "Further recherche". He uses the German version of Chechnya, for instance. And Kreml may look Russian, but is also German. As for POV, it seems the guy is repeating what the Aktuel site he is quoting is saying about the Litvinenko affair. <a href="http://www.aktuell.ru/russland/kommentar/litwinenko_politkowskaja_der_cia_der_fsb_und_putin_293.html" class="external text" title="http://www.aktuell.ru/russland/kommentar/litwinenko_politkowskaja_der_cia_der_fsb_und_putin_293.html" rel="nofollow">Also this page.</a> The intelligence guys Litvinenko met, were not straight from Russia as tends to be believed, claims this version. POV? It is one version among many, of course. Another version, that this same guy alludes to as well ("Litvinenko was killed by unknown people with FSB contacts because he had recently learnt too much about Yukos and had to be silenced") is to be found <a href="http://www.aktuell.ru/russland/news/musste_litwinenko_wegen_yukos_affaere_sterben_16595.html" class="external text" title="http://www.aktuell.ru/russland/news/musste_litwinenko_wegen_yukos_affaere_sterben_16595.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>Sorry for Babelfish, but not really - "Daraus folgt natürlich noch nicht, dass Litwinenko im Auftrag des CIA oder Boris Beresowskis umgebracht wurde. Es macht es aber unwahrscheinlich, dass der Mord im Auftrag des Kreml geschah." I read this as "That does of course not mean that Litvinenko was killed on orders of the CIA. It does make it unlikely, however, that the murder happened on orders of the Kremlin". A big if here, of course: this is only one of the ends at which poisoning is claimed to perhaps have happened. If one of these guys was indeed CIA, as Aktuel claims, the poisoning did not happen at that end, probably. But there is still this Italian guy. The Scaramella, professor at Naples University, seems to be a woman, called Maria Scaramella. Mario Scaramello is discussed in some detail <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23375897-details/Exclusive:%20Sushi%20bar%20man%20is%20nuclear%20waste%20expert/article.do" class="external text" title="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23375897-details/Exclusive:%20Sushi%20bar%20man%20is%20nuclear%20waste%20expert/article.do" rel="nofollow">here</a> I am still supposing the fact that at the beginning some authors thought that the Scaramella that Litvinenko met, was a woman, to be pure coincidence. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 08:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is very clear that Alexandar Litvinenk was linked to the mafia.</p>
<ol>
<li>He lived free of charge in a house owned by Boris Berekovsky.</li>
<li>He was paid wages by the same Boris Berekovsky - how could he afford to eat at the expensive sushi bar and stay in an expensiv hotel?</li>
<li>Boris Berekovsky is a fugitive from justice and Russia is seeking to extradite him to stand trial for fraud in Russia.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main beneficiary of the murder is the Russian Mafia such as Boris Berekovsky as it is harder for Russia to apply for his extradition now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by BigEasyGuy (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigEasyGuy_fcf6.html" title="User talk:BigEasyGuy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigEasyGuy_bd60.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigEasyGuy">contribs</a>) 06:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>This is OT but why? If Boris Berekovsky killed Alexander Litvinenko then I would presume it'll be easy for Russia to extradite him since the UK won't want him any more.

<dd>Not really. There's no reason to assume he lied. He could have just been deluded, confused or unaware the truth of what was really going on. Remember the fact that he said it was Putin doesn't make it true. It simply suggests he believed it's Putin. I personally do accept he believed it's Putin, although I'm not so sure it really was. However the above story does seem bizzare, at least as presented <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you think about this case (Litvinenko death) it *can* be beneficial to many people including russian mafia, FSB, Putin, Berezovsky, Chechnya, CIA, even Scotland Yard (less likely), etc. That is what makes this case hard to solve. However if Putin wanted to kill Litvinenko to shut him up, there would have been a different poison used - the instant (!) one, not polonium, which causes a slow dying. So I think someone really wanted Litvinenko to speak before he died. And that "someone" knew what Litvinenko would say. So who will benefit from what Litvinenko said after he got sick and before he died? That is a 5 million dollar question. =Alexei</p>

<dd>To be honest, I think Introduction is too long. It could be made at least 3 times shorter - as in biographies of other people in Wikipedia.

I basically summarized his life. Also, it said he worked for counterintelligence in the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Litvinenko_be48.html#Career_in_Russian_security_services" title="Alexander Litvinenko">Career in Russian security services</a> section of the article. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 01:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I simply think that such version of Introduction includes a lot of secondary details, so main facts are lost. It would be enough just to tell in Introduction that his main work was about fighting organized crime; that he appeared on Russian TV with Trepashkin claiming that FSB wanted to include him to a death squad; that he was prosecuted; that he escaped to UK; that he wrote a book claiming that Russian aparment bombing and other bombings were conducted by FSB (that was main idea; everything else is of secondary importance); and that he was poisoned. Everything else could be described below.

<p>I think the introduction is a kind of long. How about this introduction:</p>
<p>Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko (Russian: Александр Вальтерович Литвиненко; December 4, 1962 or August 30, 1962 – November 23, 2006) was a former middle-ranking Russian FSB officer and one of the most furious critics of the Russian President Putin. He accused during his press-conference in Moscow in November 1998 his superiors of ordering him to assassinate a billionaire Boris Berezovsky. He was twice arrested and acquitted by courts. After been charged third time he illegally left Russia for the UK in 2000. He is a co-author of two books, Blowing up Russia: Terror from Within and Gang from Lubyanka, and number of articles severely criticised the FSB and Vladimir Putin. On November 1, 2006 Litvinenko unexpectedly felt ill and became hospitalized. Upon his death on November 23, it was established that he had died from Polonium-210 poisoning. Litvinenko's illness, notoriety as a former FSB officer, and his public accusations that Russian government officials were behind his poisoning, led to worldwide media coverage.</p>
<p>Please let me know is it worth to put it in the article.--Ovc 06:20, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why do you need to mention <i>" unexpectedly felt ill"</i> if you do not mention the contacts. - I think to current intro is good; there is <b>no need</b> to make it shorter. -- <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetri_Krohn_f1f9.html" title="User:Petri Krohn">Petri Krohn</a> 06:44, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why I shortened it. Please read <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> which recommends it is concise. Also some of the sentences don't flow well. The first sentence <i>was a Russian Security Service agent [with a link to FSB] and later a Russian dissident</i> is a much better summary than <i>was an ex-FSB lieutenant-colonel with KGB experience in fighting organized crime.</i> <a href="../../../t/p/b/User%7ETpbradbury_562a.html" title="User:Tpbradbury">Tom</a> 10:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise. I promise you, the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one. The longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence, it goes straight into a narrative without any gap: "After working in...", it doesn't make sense in English,"his superiors had ordered for the assassination" should be "his superiors had ordered the assassination". You can't be a dissident of an organisation, see <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissident.html" title="Dissident">dissident</a>. Its got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of 4 short clearly defined ones.</p>
<p>Please can people say which introduction they prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Litvinenko&amp;oldid=91129757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Litvinenko&amp;oldid=91129757" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Litvinenko&amp;oldid=91128044" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Litvinenko&amp;oldid=91128044" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. <a href="../../../t/p/b/User%7ETpbradbury_562a.html" title="User:Tpbradbury">Tom</a> 11:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a matter of which is better. Why would I come here in the first place if I had no intention of trying to shorten it a bit? Even though there wasn't much discussion on this, I think the current introduction is fairly decent, and I'll try to make copyediting corrections and such later on. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 15:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope no one minds. Feel free to revert it. There are still some overly long sentences there but I didn't want to change too much. Nice article by the way.<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntesvensk_3c9e.html" title="User:Intesvensk">Intesvensk</a> 11:07, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sentence is actually "IF Also Moro was held" which requires the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subjunctive.html" title="Subjunctive">subjunctive</a> to be used, which means "If Aldo Moro were held" is gramatically correct.

<dd>You're wrong. The verbal form connected with "if the tip (that) .... " is "had its origin in the KGB". Everything in between is a subordinate clause (containing more subordinate clauses) depending on the "that" in the first part. "Had" is a past tense, no need for a subjunctive there.</dd>
<dd>The second use of "were" (and "if the KGB were behind ...") is, however, grammatically correct AMERICAN English. In British English, subjunctive "were" is mandatory when the proposition is contrary to known facts, and old-fashioned elsewhere. The trick involved is the use of "would" or "could" in the main clause. See<a href="http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673933" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673933" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and [<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/radio/specials/1535_questionanswer/page24.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/radio/specials/1535_questionanswer/page24.shtml" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>], for instance. However, in this sentence, even British people would prefer "were", because they would think of "KGB" as a singular with a plural meaning, like the word "police". Nice ambiguity - which means we do not really have to decide between British and American English here, and "were" is perfectly neutral.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 10:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone know why the ICU photo was deleted? I was of the opinion it should qualify (see above) under fair use.

I've never been good at using the deletion log but I can't find it there and I can't seem to see any discussion on the "possibly unfree images" either so unless it was speedied I'm confused where the discussion took place.

<p>I'm encountering resistance to the Liberal Russia information.</p>
<p>In the article, there is a quote from <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolay_Kovalev_%28FSB%29_20c0.html" title="Nikolay Kovalev (FSB)">Nikolay Kovalev</a>, retired FSB commander, who says "I'm sure it wasn't the FSB, and I think it was Berezovsky".</p>
<p>This on its own is highly unbalanced because there is no information here given about the other events that have occured between the FSB and Berezovsky, which must be stated or this part of the article is entirely pro-FSB, by dint of not stating existing opposing information.</p>
<p>Berezovsky, along with a few others, founded the party Liberal Russia. One of the founders was shot and killed shortly after founding, and the co-founders were found guilty of the murder and jailed. The FSB accused Berezovsky of being behind the murder.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that Berezovsky was not involved in the murder (check the article for <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Yushenkov_e8ac.html" title="Sergei Yushenkov">Sergei Yushenkov</a>) and the FSB is suspected of being behind the murder and convictions of the co-founders to disrupt the thread posed by Berezovsky's political activities. Indeed, Berezovsky was expelled/fled from Russia after this incident.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind this sequence of events, it is entirely improper to quote a retired FSB commander accusing Berezovsky of the murder without so much as a word of the possible issues that must be considered.</p>
<p>(In fact, it's worse than this; Kovalev's quote is followed by a quote from a British intelligence officer who says, seperately, that it's highly unlikely the FSB would commit a murder outside of Russian territory. These two quotes, given with no balancing information, simply mislead the reader by only presenting one side of the argument when the other side would have a significant impact upon the reader's consideration.)</p>

<dd>I cleaned up your section because it was POV-ridden. This was your my cleanup of your edit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Litvinenko&amp;diff=91002444&amp;oldid=91002131" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Litvinenko&amp;diff=91002444&amp;oldid=91002131" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and the re-addition of the Allason quote (which should be explained more). Encyclopedia articles are supposed to maintain neutrality. You're using words such as "It seems unlikely" or "judicial system in Russia is non-functional" (needs source for 99% and regardless, you shouldn't write your own views on the issue). I agree that it is something of very high importance and I will work with you on trying to get a NPOV entry for that particular section. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 22:30, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True that <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Litvinenko_be48.html" title="Alexander Litvinenko">AL</a> was in the Internal Troops; however, he was also in the KGB and FSB and we don't show pics of their logos or troops in the AL article, because (a) they fit perfectly well at the appropriate KSB/FSB articles and (b) while relevant to AL, IMO they aren't sufficiently relevant to justify having them illustrate a part of his article, even the 'career' part of it.</dd>
<dd>As to a correct way of writing something, i thought it was prudent to follow the spacing of the document that is (at least purportedly) signed by AL himself, provided by another user in an edit summary and viewable <a href="http://images.ctv.ca/archives/CTVNews/img2/20061124/450_ap_statement_061124.jpg" class="external text" title="http://images.ctv.ca/archives/CTVNews/img2/20061124/450_ap_statement_061124.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</dd>

<dd>You make an interesting argument, with perhaps some validity, on the quotation, although its unfortunate it takes-up more space. It's also not in the same font as the source and doesn't have his signature in our article. Sorry I'm being difficult! It's a good source but I don't think it's correctly referenced yet, next to the quotation in our article, so one of us should try and do that soon. Pictures: you make some good points. I was trying to get some relevant pictures to make article look nicer/more colourful (it's about a tragic subject i know). I was going to include a diagram on polonium.

<p>Dear 72.183.125.111!</p>
<p>I'm not absolutely sure that this statement is really necessary here (despite I suppose that it is worth metioning), but you descriptions to the edits are certainly wrong.</p>
<p>First you wrote that there are no any authorities. But Dr Prof Adamov is a nuclear scietins and former head of the Russian nuclear ministry, so you comment was at least incorrect.</p>
<p>Second you name it "fraud". It is not a fraud of any kind, it is a statement made by a professional. It may be wrong, but it is definitely <b>not</b> fraud. And any allegations of crimes of Adamov do not matter.</p>
<p>So I'm reverting your removal again and ask to discuss it here and find a community consensus here before any further removals.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><br />
Здрасвуите, Dr. Bug:</p>
<p>With all due respect, I made no comment -- at all -- that there are not any authorities. My comment was that Dr. Adamov is a fraud. My source for this was Wikipedia's entry, which states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In 2005, he was arrested in Bern, Switzerland, on fraud charges. The arrest was made at the request of the United States. The US accused Adamov of diverting up to $9 million which the US Energy Department gave Russia to help improve security at its nuclear facilities. Extradition requests were filed first by the USA and then by Russia, which has actively protested the move by the US. Adamov was finally extradited to Russia. The move was widely covered as a successful ploy by the Russian government to prevent Adamov from telling US authorites state secrets (and perhaps some criminal secrets) that he knew. Now he is free, waiting for a trial in Russia."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps most important to Wikipedia's content accuracy, Dr. Adamov's statement regarding the availability of Po-210 is not backed up by any credible authority. With its very short half-life, Po-210 is quite rare, and must effectively be generated via the following sequence in nuclear reactors: 210Po84 is made by a β- decay chain from Pb-210 to Bi-210 to Po-210; the Polonium alpha decays to Pb-206 with a half-life of a little over 138 days, with a decay energy of about 5.4 MeV.</p>
<p>I don't feel that a "consensus" -- i.e., a show of hands -- is the heart of the matter here. Truth is.</p>
<p>You may feel free to quote Dr. Adamov, but you must also be willing to carry the above baggage. It's the truth.</p>

<dd>We are talking here only about Litvinenko allegations. So, the only relevant question is if he made a certain claim or not (if his allegations are true is a completely different story). But we must be sure that he indeed made a certain claim. To be on the safe side, we should only cite sources that provide actual words of Litvinenko and make sure that his words are properly reflected in the text. There are many distortions about this in newspapers, because journalists are looking for sensations. We should not do that. Yes, he made claimes about Ayman al-Zawahiri in Dagestan and pedophilia - I checked this. He did not do any specific claims with regard to September 11 or London's bombings.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have hidden one part of the "Poisoning" section from view: "Those who administered the poison were experts in the subject, as precisely the right amount was used to cause a prolonged death; too great a dosage would have resulted in immediate convulsions and death, and too light a dosage would have resulted in a possible recovery though with a good likelihood of subsequent long-term health problems."

<dd>Go ahead. What you should include as well imo is a remark made by Alex Goldfarb, who said that the dose wasn't the right amount of poison at all. If he had gotten about five times as much, Litvinenko would have died the same day from severe internal bleeding, and noone would have thought of radiation poisoning. Because they used so little, he developed the symptoms of radiation poisoning (e.g. the loss of hair), which made people suspicious. If the killer/killers had used a higher dose, he/they would have had a good chance of getting away with it. According to Alex Goldfarb, IIRC on BBC's Newsnight. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">Dancing</a> to electro-pop <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">like a robot</a> from 1984.</sup> 23:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't read this before but has no one commented on the fact radioactivity was used at all? It seems to be this was a big mistake since it probably makes it a lot easier to track then if it were a more ordinary biological or chemical agent... It also causes a greater degree of general hysteria which may not be a good idea as it may mean there will be far greater attention to the investigation.

<dd>Biophys seems to be turned to conspiracy theory of the evil FSB. Please, Biophys, take facts, not conspiracy rumors (when we laugh at that FBI prepared 9/11 to start the war in Iraq, you are serious about Litvinenko accusations in his book). The facts is that Russia was very-very criminalized (you even cannot imagine) during the years 1991-2001, it seems to be better now, but still we have echoes of this period. Also recently on a russian TV was shown that a case of Starovoitova is closed, no politics found in there (i.e. FSB involved), only criminal business motives (we have not confuse big money with politics). Also, I wouldn't consider <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> as a credible source towards Russia, since top heads from CIA go retire there. Biophys, if you are interested in killings in Russia, I think you would like to know that there are many killings of politics you don't know, possibly because they weren't fierce critics of the government.

Nobody from FSB - this I cannot say, since I am sure there are also may present corrupt people, even this year I remember many cases of taking people (even groups of people) to jail from the government and milicia. Also I would point that a simple internet link is not a credible source, even a book is not a credible source. What verified is that KGB killed Trotsky, as for other - since the end of Stalin KGB/FSB don't use killings of political dissidents to shutting them up. I don't think that they now to do it, starting from the pawns (mostly unknown to the russian public). Maybe you would like to know the situation from place: in Russia, there are some state controlled three main channels 1st main, 2nd Russian, 4 NTV, 3rd Moscow pro-Lugkov Moscow major (remember, till 2000 Beresovsky and Co controlled 1st and 4 NTV channels - and RenTV possibly), we have also two anti-Putin channels RenTV (really, I watch it from time to time and they criticize Putin in many points, they usually show a western point) and TNT (they stopped show news a long time ago, AFAIK), also we have Euronews in Russian (on the air to the public, but from 12 to 9 nighttime). And we have satellite and cable TV - so CNN and Euronews there (I don't include anti-Putin paper media, but mostly it's red - communist). And, here we have internet, as you see.

<dd>You seem to be missing the point. You seem to be suggestiong we mention Starovoitova in connection to Litvinenko. However we can't do this because no credible source has been provided that links these 2 murders. Furthermore, we also can't suggest Starovoitova was murdered by the FSB because no credible source has suggested she was. AI have simply suggested the investigation should not be carried out by the FSB. It might be okay to write about this in the Starovoitova article. However we cannot and should not suggest AI is saying she was murdered by the FSB because they did not. And as I've stated, we still can't link these 2 murders in any way shape or form without a credible source having done so.

<dd>Although we greatly prefer English language sources, if and when reliable English language sources cannot be found there is nothing specifically wrong with using a foreign language source provided it is a reliable source. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> provides some help. Foreign language sources have the key problem that it's much more difficult for our readers to verify that the source actually says what it says it does and also a reader who wishes to read further can't do so unless they understand the foreign language. I.E. the sources are much less accessible. However we also have a related problem with many primary sources (i.e. journals) in that they are usually subscription based, if they are even on the web and for old articles they may only be available in the hard copies. These will not be available from most libraries only university libraries. (They will also usually be hard for the lay person to understand). Similarly other hard copy sources, books etc may not be widely available. However in all cases, while we prefer more accessible sources, provided the source is a reliable source, I don't think we're likely to implicitly reject it if it adds something and there is no more accessible source. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 08:12, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, we have to take care to ensure that people don't add crap and pretend it's from a source that people either don't understand or can't access. Also, if there is dispute as to what a source actual says and/or if a source fulfills our reliable sources requirement, we will usually have to leave the info out until the dispute can be resolved.

<p>I looked up the half-life of Polonium - this stuff decays to lead with a half life of only four months. So either VAST quantities of this stuff was provided for the purpose - or it had been produced fairly freshly for the purpose. To put 50 mCi worth of Po into food, you'd have had to aquire 100mCi if it was four months old, 400mCi if it was a year old, 3,200mCi if it were two years old, 25,000mCi if it were three years old...eight times more for every year since you made the stuff. So it's not like someone had a bottle of the stuff sitting around since Soviet era reactors might have made it. You'd need a hell of a lot of the stuff if that were the case.</p>
<p>But worse still, what you end up with when Po-210 decays is lead. So sit on a pile of Po for a few years and the AMOUNT of the stuff you'd have to feed someone gets quite large. If you're going to put it in someones food - it's gotta be reasonably freshly made.</p>

<dd>Remember that the <i>source</i> of any given radioisotope can be held for longer periods than the resultant if there's a short half-life. This is why they either ship Technetium 99 from short distances or more often ship it's source, molybdenum. See <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technetium-99m_generator.html" title="Technetium-99m generator">Technetium Cow</a>. So while you have a point, one would simply work around the short half-life with something like a "cow" or source substance.

<dd>Irina Hakamada tells approximately the following about this Litvinenko claim: "What he is telling is a complete nonsense! I have not been in Kremlin already for three months!". That means she actually WAS in Kremlin three months ago and earlier (note that Litvinenko did not say when exactly Putin issued his threats). Most important, Hakamada is a Kremlin's insider. What does it mean? She wrote herself about this in her recent book "Sex in big politics" (this is an interesting book!). See some fragments: <a href="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/45n/n45n-s22.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/45n/n45n-s22.shtml" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>,<a href="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/40n/n40n-s25.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/40n/n40n-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, <a href="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/43n/n43n-s25.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/43n/n43n-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. To be a Kremlin insider means to play all their games by their rules. If someone do not follow the rules, like Tregubova (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bayki-Kremlevskogo-Diggera-Tregubova-E/dp/5933210730/sr=1-2/qid=1165214671/ref=sr_1_2/104-5859887-8050345?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Bayki-Kremlevskogo-Diggera-Tregubova-E/dp/5933210730/sr=1-2/qid=1165214671/ref=sr_1_2/104-5859887-8050345?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>), she will find a bomb under her door like Tregubova <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Proschanie-kremlevskogo-diggera-Tregubova-Elena/dp/5933210951/sr=1-1/qid=1165214671/ref=sr_1_1/104-5859887-8050345?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Proschanie-kremlevskogo-diggera-Tregubova-Elena/dp/5933210951/sr=1-1/qid=1165214671/ref=sr_1_1/104-5859887-8050345?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.

<dd>You fight againt facts with your insinuations and consp. theories. A FACT - Litvinenko told that Khakamada were passing threats to Politkovskaya from Putin. Which is insane to a russian mind - who is Putin and who is unknown Politkovskaya - but this this seems to be ok to non-russian because of lack of knowledge of russian politics and situation. A FACT - Khakamada denied everything. But you insisnt that Khakamada lied but criminal and betrayer Litvinenko was telling the truth. Also down here you argued that russian media has different theories about Litvinenko death. Of course! Even anti-Putin pro-western forces do not copy (even decline) many wester official theories because they seem clearly absurd from russian political view. We have different situation here than in the west. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandre_Koriakine_f125.html" title="User:Alexandre Koriakine">Alexandre Koriakine</a> 09:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Earlier today, a user named Ekraus was adding POV information to the article. I saw this and removed all the unsourced info he added, and I warned him and subsequently blocked him indefinitely as he was a single-purpose account adding unsourced POV info to one article. I felt I jumped the gun so I asked other admins at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">Admin Noticeboard</a> for assistance on the issue. They said to give him another shot. I saw he made a request to be unblocked on his talk page, and I processed it and unblocked him. He believed that I had some sort of "political agenda" and he believed that both sides of opinion should be presented in the article (he was basically saying it was biased against Russians). Anyway, he's unblocked now and he'll probably come back and edit this article, so I just wanted to let you guys know. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 18:00, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:72.183.125.111 has been trying to "prove" that the polonium must have been smuggled into the country and is using the article to push this unproven POV.

Most of this is distributed by commercial distributors in the US.

<dd>The section "Thallium-initial hypothesis" is both well-sourced and fairly written. It talks directly about Litvinenko and doesn't go into much detail in regards to the chemistry. The "Polonium-210" section is also pretty good. The problems start to arise right after that point. "Po-210 production" has no relevance to Litvinenko, "Sources of polonium" can just be merged with "Polonium-210" and "Commercial products" can be greatly shortened.

<dd>The amount of polonium involved was not trivial - according to the UnitedNuclear site, it was enough to make 15,000 standard laboratory radiation sources and would be worth something like a million dollars on the open market. If some random person phones them up and orders that much of such a rare substance - I think they are going to remember. And (as I've pointed out already) Polonium doesn't keep - it decays to lead in a matter of months. So this was a recent sale of a huge quantity - and presumably not to their usual customers. Whoever sold it to them knows exactly who and for what purpose. Whoever did this wanted the right people to know that they did it. If you wanted to murder someone quietly and without fuss you'd whack them with a car or pay a hitman to blow their brains out in a faked mugging or something. Even if you wanted to poison them with radioactivity for some bizarre reason - as the UnitedNuclear site again points out - the amount of more lethal Americium in one smoke detector is ten times more than enough. Why use a million dollars worth of exotic Polonium-210&#160;?

Not being a nuclear physicist or a chemist I'm not in a good position to work that one out, but I find the existing explanation lacking. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 00:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess the point is that if the Polonium 210 were mixed with Bismuth, the radioactivity becomes much more potent because the short-range-easily-blocked radiation from the Po can cause secondary radiation from the Bismuth that would be much, much more dangerous. However, all of the reports are that the Polonium isn't dangerous in the form it's been found. Also, if you had to sneak this through radiation detectors at airports and such - you wouldn't want it mixed with Bismuth. The significance of the half-life thing is that Polonium 210 (as opposed to the other isotopes of Polonium) decays directly to a completely non-radioactive, stable isotope of lead - which is commonly found in nature. So 'old' polonium 210 gradually turns itself into a chunk of lead containing trace amounts of polonium. With a half life of four months - this process reduces a pure sample of Polonium 210 into a chunk of boring old lead within just a few years. The significance of which is that this is unlikely to be Polonium that was manufactured a long time ago - so the idea that this stuff was made in a Soviet-era reactor and sat on someone's shelf for 10 years is a non-starter. If we are to believe the information that the 'signature' of the Polonium used here shows that it comes from a Russian reactor - then that is strong indication of RECENT involvement by the Russians rather than of old Polonium that they sold to someone years ago which has been used to implicate them in some way. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 05:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It occurs to me that given Po-210's short half-life (138 days), it would be really easy for someone with a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a> and a tiny sample of the material to determine very accurately the exact date on which the Polonium involved in this case was manufactured. The ratio of Polonium to Lead in the sample would give you that date with great precision (certainly enough to pin it down to a particular day). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 12:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From where would you get a clean sample? By swiping airplane seats? The amount of lead is so small, that it could not be measured, if even detected. -- <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetri_Krohn_f1f9.html" title="User:Petri Krohn">Petri Krohn</a> 05:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The main problem with this idea is that the amount of naturally occuring lead is so large, compared to the extremely small amount of artificial polonium or with the lead-206 which arises from polonium decay. You would not be able to get a meaningful ratio. However, measurement of isotope ratios is <i>presumably</i> how the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_Weapons_Establishment_ebf5.html" title="Atomic Weapons Establishment">Atomic Weapons Establishment</a> thinks it can track the source: they don't let on exactly which ones they measure, but I can get the general idea. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 09:08, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, in detail - naturally occurring lead is a mixture of roughly 54% Lead-208, 22% Lead-207 and 24% Lead-206 with trace amounts of other isotopes. Since Polonium-210 decays <i><b>only</b></i> into Lead-206 and produces none of the other Lead isotopes, you could measure the amounts of Lead-208, 207 and 206 and the amount of Polonium-210 in the not-so-clean sample. Then you'd know that the total amount of naturally occurring lead must be the amount of the common Lead-208 isotope multiplied by 100/54. You could check that figure by looking at the amount of Lead-207. From that figure you'd know how much of the Lead-206 present in the sample was from nature (24/54 times the amount of the 208 isotope) and however much there is over that amount would have to have come from Polonium-210 decay. It's not difficult. Mass spectrometers are exceedingly sensitive - and they work with tiny samples. Remember - we use this exact technique all the time to do radiocarbon dating using the decay rates of Carbon-14. C14 decays much more slowly - which makes the test much harder than with Polonium-210. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 13:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that the amount of Polonium was very low. The lethal dose is 0.1 mkg. Even if they fed him 100 LD it is still 10 mkg on 70 kg of the body mass. The natural amount of Lead in a human is proably 10...100 times higher. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 14:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>A tiny sample wuld have been found in his body or excretions obviously. Since all of it is pretty much a:" do we want to believe this?"(eg. the possibility to make some in cyclotrons quitte effectively, and the signature) the fact it isn't traced how old the stuff was points toward a more recent then expected production, wich would be the more effective poison anyhow. Also the article should mention that litvinenko absurdedly had been connecting putin to ridiculous events, like the london bombing, and that he was allieing forces that basically aimed at capturing governmental power in russia by discrediting the democratic situation. Also i interprete the facts as putin expressing no regrets to someone he perceived a nucleair threat. but perhaps that is just me.80.56.39.154 11:07, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That can't be right - there were reports of Polonium-210/Radiation poisoning BEFORE Litvinenko died.

<dd>Actually as far as I remember polonium-210 only surfaced after he died, from the initial tests I believe. When he died, AFAIK no one really knew what was up.

<dd>You are clutching at straws. Have a good look at the last paragraph but one: "His stories were full of extravagant conspiracies, hardly surprising when he had lived in the middle of so many himself. He was still very interested in the world of Russian espionage and was hoping to earn a living as an intelligence analyst, hinting that he was privy to the secrets behind many big scandals, some of them from as long ago as the Cold War." Note (it is on James Heartfield's blog) that they both went on TV after these articles. I see that my link to the Telegraph has been removed, while the Aftenposten claims Svetlichnaja is the only one behind this story and at least suggests she is not even a student. --193.190.172.95 16:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC) That was me, not logged in. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 17:54, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Earn a living as an intelligence analyst" doesn't equate to extortion. What was the deleted Telegraph article link? I see there were 2 articles posted 3 December, one prefacing the Svetlichnaya's story. They are both mentioned in the blackmailing plot section. I rephrased the last sentence, reverting its claim that the co-authored article supports the theory. As for your last comment, I don't understand if it was said in support or criticism of the theory. <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlgiz_5b54.html" title="User:Ilgiz">ilgiz</a> 18:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for the deletion, I suppose I looked between edits? The way it is phrased now, does not sound right to me. The Telegraph article negates the whole argument coming from Aftenposten: she was not alone in interviewing Litvinenko, and the interviews took place long before the poisoning - but it is used as an argument against the story. I haven't heard of Heartfield denying the story, and his blog does not look like he is about to do that. As for the trotskyite bit - the editors probably know Heartfield's past. Did they tell Heartfield to use restraint on the Cold War extorsion bit (the point being that any trotskyite still alive might get wet dreams reading about Litvinenko blackmailing that old Nomenklatura)? --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 21:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

My point was that the blackmailing/extortion plans were only mentioned by Svetlichnaya, not by Hearfield. Can you show Heartfield's or Heartfield's and Svetlichnaya's collective words confirming the theory?

<dd>The Chechnya forum on yahoo and Wikipedia are basically the only ones quoting this Aftenposten article. I do not care for the blackmail assertion very much - everything there depends on Yuri Shvets, and we are not going to hear much from him in the near future. However, we have here a whole paragraph about a claim that Svetlichnaya is a front for the Kremlin creating white noise, perhaps not even a real student. Note that her page at Westminster University has her studying in Britain since 2005 - you can actually download one of the papers she wrote in that year (I have read part of it, and yes, it looks like Englsih written by a Russian). No, Svetlichnaya is not a journalist - but Heartfield is. So what else is left of this grand accusation: some anonymous professor and the fact that they found her name on a funny website. Svetlichnaya earns or earned some money doing press releases for an investor firm - well, studying at a British university is very expensive, particularly for foreigners. As for the name being taken out, perhaps these guys did not want to get involved in a controversy like that? As Svitlachnaya came to Britain in October 2005 (perhaps from Germany or Holland) and the interviews are from April and May 2006, the "front" argument is also suggesting the Kremlin planned this murder VERY long ago.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 12:46, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Julia in English does not sound like Russian Yulia at all, but German Julia is the same. The "j" transcription of the "y" (like in English "yet") in Russian Cyrillic names is dominant in Germany, Holland and the Dutch speaking part of Belgium - though it is also found in Scandinavia and Middle European countries (like Czechia) as a result of German influence. French speakers prefer to write "i" (Svetlichnaia). Of course, Svetlichnaya could have taken this gmail e-mail account long ago, but why does she use the same transliteration at Russain investors - I would be very surprised if her international passport from the RF says something else than "Svetlichnaya" - they use English transliteration now. As for the blackmail-make money statement, note that James Heartfield's version is very close to what Gordiyevski said about the Prodi affair and the Repubblica article quoted in the Litvinenko article:<a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20061207/56613662.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.rian.ru/world/20061207/56613662.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. I quote "Gordievsky said Litvinenko had merely said what Scaramella wanted to hear, because he was in desperate financial straits and hoped to benefit from such cooperation." --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 17:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, Heartfild never stated that Litvinenko planned blackmailing. The only source of the "Gordievsky's statement" of Litvinenko's blackmailing plans seems to be RIAN. RIAN, the Russian Information Agency "Novosti" (News), was long known to be staffed with foreign intelligence officers. To the contrary, Litvinenko stated that the Moscow region FSB head Anatoly Trofimov said Prodi was the KGB's man in Italy. <a href="http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&amp;id=2055" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&amp;id=2055" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> La Repubblica's article quotes Litvinenko saying he did not hear about Prodi and did not have any proofs against Prodi. I don't see much contradiction here with his knowledge of Trofimov's statement, taking into account the time of Litvinenko's conversation with Trofimov (Fall 2000), the date of the La Repubblica's article (3 March 2005), the date of Trofimov's assassination (10 April 2005) and the date of the Litvinenko-Batten statement (3 April 2006). <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlgiz_5b54.html" title="User:Ilgiz">ilgiz</a> 19:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>At a press-conference in London Svetlichnaya said there were not any witnesses when, according to her, Litvinenko confided in his blackmailing plans. The emails she received from him were part of his mailing list delivery. <a href="http://www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/12/09/20061209124835107.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/12/09/20061209124835107.html" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> <a href="http://www.online-translator.com/url/tran_url.asp?direction=re&amp;autotranslate=on&amp;url=www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/12/09/20061209124835107.html" class="external text" title="http://www.online-translator.com/url/tran_url.asp?direction=re&amp;autotranslate=on&amp;url=www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/12/09/20061209124835107.html" rel="nofollow">computer translation</a> <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlgiz_5b54.html" title="User:Ilgiz">ilgiz</a> 22:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, she gave a news conference to make it clear she really existed. RIA Novosti was in fact alluding to a recent re- publication of this 2005 interview with Litvinenko (26 November 2006 <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/esteri/putin-spia-avvelenata/colloquio-repubblica/colloquio-repubblica.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/esteri/putin-spia-avvelenata/colloquio-repubblica/colloquio-repubblica.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>). It may be a bit more extensive than the earlier published version, because, even though my Italian is not so good, I see it mentions a few things that were never quoted here: Litvinenko went along with Scaramella because the visum extension of his brother (who lived in Italy) was being questioned and Litvinenko was sure that Berlusconi told Putin what he had revealed (which means by the way, that whatever he may have thought about the Italian guy, HE was convinced Scaramella worked for the Italian government). There is also a paragraph where he says he felt humiliated as Mario gives him 600-800 in cash, both because he felt hit an normal thing to do to denounce the history of the KGB, and therefore wanted to be paid transparently, as a sort of consultant, but also because he was afraid that the FSB would one day find out he got paid large sums of money on the side. Gordievsky and Scaramella seem to have met later in Cambridge, without Litvinenko knowing what it was about. Perhaps even this story of using intelligence to gather money is a Scaramella invention? As for the link between Yukos and Russian Investors, I think it would be rather difficult to find any financier or manager who has never been employed by one of these oligarchs. I see you want to keep this blackmail story just in order to keep the "government front" accusation in. It's silly - this is a story by one person, however trustworthy she may be and it probably doubles up with Yuri Shvets. Well, I suppose someone will come along when it is no longer current and vital and shorten the thing.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 01:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It gives full details. Among other things, Kovtun left radiation on a file card in German immigration possession! And in a cab. All this well before the London poisoning. The article says that Aeroflot "is not available" for inspection, for some obscure reason, but indications are that Kovten came to Hamburg from Moscow, then went to London. There is no eveidence that he passed thru Hamburg on the way back, so the radiation probably didn't come from England and probably didn't come from Germany. Which leaves ... Russia.</p>

<dd>This is something most people fail to grasp. Alpha radiation is fast moving, electrically charged helium gas - it won't go through a sheet of paper - the layer of desd skin cells covering your body will absorb it without harm - and certainly alpha particles won't go through the side of a suitcase. You could keep a slug of polonium-210 in your pocket and not get irradiated by it - it's absolutely NOT dangerous unless you eat the stuff or breathe it in. Just a few inches of air is enough to block its radiation. To detect it, you've got to either get in very close to the polonium - or you've got to hope that one of those alpha particles hits some other substance and knocks off a more energetic particle - that can happen if you deliberately mixed polonium with other exotic substances such as beryllium. However, that's a long shot - there is no way an airport detector will pick up Polonium on a routine scan. As far as radiological threats - Polonium won't explode as a nuclear bomb like Plutonium or Uranium - and it's insanely expensive. You can't even make a believable 'dirty bomb' out of the stuff because shielding against alpha radiation is childishly easy and a simple face-mask (so you don't breath the stuff in) is ample protection. The only reason a terrorist might be interested in Polonium is as a <i><b>trigger</b></i> for a nuclear weapon...but I think you need very little of the stuff for that - maybe the amount you find in one of those photographer's anti-static brush would be enough. The radiological threat that the airports are set up to detect are the mass-destruction stuff...Uranium and Plutonium in significant quantities. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having said all this, though, Kovtun was littering his path with polonium. It wasn't safely sealed. This surely gave opportunities for detection, had the matter been considered beforehand. For example, you could have airport staff regularly place their hands into alpha-particle detectors, to see if they had material on their skin. Toby Douglass 00:25, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Toby: Why on earth would airport security even care about Polonium-210 going though their detectors? It's not a weapon of mass destruction - you can't bring down a plane using it - terrorists can't use it for much because it's too expensive and childishly easy to trace - it's an utterly stupid choice as a poison (unless you are trying to make a point...as in this case). If you wanted to simply poison someone, give them a $12, 20gram overdose of an over-the-counter Acetometaphin like Tylanol. It's simply not sensible to have the airports scan for poisons...which is what Polonium-210 is. If you started to put detectors into airports for every concievable threat, you'd spend an eternity getting onto the plane and the cost of screening would go through the roof. Furthermore, having security staff check their hands for alpha radiation would cause an awful lot of false-positives. Alpha radiation sources are everywhere. Luminous watch dials, Smoke detectors, Radon gas - which routinely leaks into peoples homes when they are built on granite-rich rocks. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We have a new section: "Vladislav" - with no references that says: "Although Scotland Yard police have declined to comment a popular theory now is that Litvinenko received the fatal polonium dose in a cup of tea. This tea he drank with his Russian contacts in a room at the Millennium before going to the bar. The man that made this tea was introduced to Litvinenko as Vladislav. He arrived in London from Hamburg on Nov. 1 on the same flight as Dmitry Kovtun, and his image is recorded by security cameras at Heathrow airport on arrival. After the poisoning almost immediately, he then left Britain on another passport."</p>
<p>Then we also have (in the "Chronology of events" section): 1 November 2006: Litvinenko meets with the former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoi, Dmitry Kovtun and Vyacheslav Sokolenko in the Millenium Hotel in London.</p>
<p>Is it possible that we've made a boo-boo here and that Vladislav is actually Vyacheslav? Similar sounding names - we're saying that both are known to Kovtun and were both in the Millenium Hotel at the same time. We don't have a surname for "Vladislav" and we don't have any references for that section - and Vyacheslav Sokolenko is a redlink.</p>
<p>This sounds odd. We <b>really</b> need a reference and a surname for the Vladislav section.</p>

<p>The article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Litvinenko.html" title="Litvinenko">Litvinenko</a> remembered Vladislav making a cup of tea. He thought that the water from the kettle was only lukewarm and that the polonium-210 was added, which heated the drink through radiation so he had a hot cup of tea. The poison would have showed up in a cold drink."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Whilst I'm sure that's an accurate statement (ie Litvinenko presumably really did say that) - it needs to be clarified that what he said can't possibly be true. The microscopic amounts of Po-210 used couldn't possibly have put out enough energy to heat the tea to any measurable degree. That's just ridiculous. If it was that radioactive, it would have continued to heat his stomach contents until they boiled and he'd have died a very swift and exceedingly nasty death! So this statement was just ill-informed supposition on Litvinenko's part. Think about it - even if this were true - he can't have noticed that the tea was initially only lukewarm and was mysteriously heated up in front of his very eyes - would you drink tea that you noticed was mysteriously heating up right in front of you?!? So how come he is telling us that's what happened? He must have been guessing - or trying to provide details where there were no details. In truth the Polonium would have been no more noticable in a cold drink than a hot one - that's just nonsense.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how we should express this in the article. He made a very misleading statement - but he really did say that (we presume). I doubt we can find a reference to the fact that he was mistaken about the tea being heated by the Polonium - and I could probably calculate the heat put out by that amount of Po-210 and prove that it wouldn't have heated the tea...but then I'd be guilty of Original Research.</p>
<p>Also, in our text, there is a closing quotation mark at the end of the paragraph but no matching start-of-quotation mark. Just how much (if any) of that paragraph was actually uttered by Litvinenko?</p>

<p>...Actually, strike even that. I don't believe Litvinenko said any of that. At the time of his death - it was believed that Thallium was the cause - how could he have mentioned Polonium - or radioactivity of any kind? Furthermore - if he'd told people that the Polonium was in the tea then why was it such an amazing revelation - weeks later - that the Police had tracked the poison down to a tea cup? No - I think that entire statement is 100% bogus. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 04:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The statement is probably what Litvinenko though remember he did know before he died that it was some radioactive material that killed him but it is scientifically wrong. Still it worries me that its only come out now.</p>
<p>Say the amount of Po-210 he drunk was about 1 millionth of a gram. Po-210 emits about 140 watts per gram, its half life is 138 days and say it was in the cup for 5 minutes. I work out then. 10^-6 amount of po-210 consumed x 140 watts per gram x .5 halflife x 5 minutes /(138 days x 24 hours a day x 60 minutes an hour) = .003e-6 watts. It would not heat up anything. If the Vladislav theory is correct maybe Vladislav was concerned about getting Po-210 in the steam where he would breath it. BernardZ 05:55, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks! That's pretty much the calculation I did (my numbers were a little different - but I got the same order of magnitude in the result) - it's clearly bogus. 140 watts represents the amount of heat you'd get from a couple of lightbulbs - but it's 140 watts PER GRAM - and we believe that microgram amounts were used - so we're talking about something like a <b>millionth</b> of the amount of heat you'd get from a light bulb. I like your theory that Vladislav didn't want the steam carrying it around the room - Polonium is very prone to being spread around in the air and breathing it in is really dangerous - so that makes an enormous amount of sense. It also carries with it the implication that Vladislav would have to be quite familiar with the properties of the stuff he was using. It would suggest that he had not simply been told "Here - just slip some of this stuff into Litvinenko's tea." - it would imply that he knew that this stuff is easily dispersed and that inhaling it is just as dangerous as drinking it. Interesting - but sadly, it's still nothing we can put into the encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If we can't find a source to back up the fact that Litvinenko either didn't say that - or at least was mistaken in saying it - then perhaps it would be better simply not to report that he said it. I hate to think of our readership believing that the Polonium was so 'hot' that it could boil water. That gives a totally false impression of what's going on here. I'm going to delete that paragraph from the article until we can find a way to make that work. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 15:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the Vladislav theory is correct, then he is certainly a pro. What I want to know is who introduced him to the group possibly it was either Dmitry Kovtun or Andrei Lugovoi.</dd>

<p>In the section "Yegor Gaidar", we have:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, other observers noted he was probably poisoned after drinking a strange-tasting cup of tea. Gaidar was taken to hospital; doctors said his condition is not life-threatening and that he will recover.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We know that Litvinenko died having ingested millionths of a gram of Po-210. If Gaidar survived, we must assume that his dose could not have been significantly bigger - and in all likelyhood was much less.</p>
<p>So how the heck would the Polonium have made the tea taste strangely? There is no way you could taste microgram amounts of anything.</p>

<ul>
<li>According to Marina Litvinenko in an interview (I'll find it for you) her husband told her the tea tasted terrible because it was cold. It is possible the tea was spiked - perhaps his killer went under the false assumption that the radiation would heat up the tea, which it didn't. ~<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Lilac_Pilgrim_ac78.html" title="User:The Lilac Pilgrim">The Lilac Pilgrim</a> who isn't signed in</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That's an interesting idea - and it's somewhat backed up by other ideas that have been presented here. There has been a suggestion that someone who understood the issues with polonium ought to be familiar with the way this stuff spreads about the place - I mean, a microscopic amount of it was brought from Russia and it's been found in bunches of airline seats, all over apartments, rental cars and has contaminated a bunch of different people. Clearly nobody was spreading it around deliberately - so we must assume that it spreads around remarkably easily. It is suspected that heat/steam from hot tea might cause the ultra-fine polonium particles to drift up into the air - which would obviously be really dangerous to the person doing the poisoning as well as his victim. If the murderer knew this - he might well opt to risk alerting his victim by serving cool tea rather than risking his own life inhaling radioactive steam. But this is all speculation - we have no evidence to back that up. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 01:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that an anon user has added some significant and useful data to the timeline for Nov 1st (the day of the poisoning). This adds considerably to our understanding of events - but it is utterly unsourced. Worse still, the previous version said that opinions vary as to the exact order of those meetings...which means getting this properly sourced is very important.</p>

<p>I'd like to take a shot at getting this article up to 'Good Article' status now that events have stabilised. You'll see in the edit history that I've had a couple of marathon 'cleanup' sessions - resulting in some major reorgs of the copious amounts of data we have here.</p>
<p>More needs to be done - many of the online references lack stuff like author names, dates and such. Some of the text could use massaging to get rid of redundancy and improve grammar - and despite all of the amazing work done on referencing the article - there are still some justifiable 'missing cite' complaints in there.</p>
<p>So I plan to do more cleanup over the next week - then maybe ask for peer review - then go for <a href="../../../g/a/c/WP%7EGAC_00ed.html" title="WP:GAC">WP:GAC</a> - maybe <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> eventually. I've done this a couple of times before - so I'm pretty confident that we could get it there with a little more work and a measure of patience. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:86.155.208.55 has twice attempted to change the information that "British novelist <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Allason_d134.html" title="Rupert Allason">Rupert Allason</a> said he would be most surprised if the FSB had tried to kill Mr Litvinenko because it would fly in the face of 65 years of Soviet or Russian practice, as "[n]either the FSB nor the KGB has ever killed a defector on foreign soil and their predecessors, even under <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a>, did so only once in the case of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Krivitsky_b18e.html" title="Walter Krivitsky">Walter Krivitsky</a> in Washington in 1941." - to include Leon Trotski's assassination in Mexico. There are two reasons why this information should not be added here:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is in fact what Rupert Allason said - he might be wrong - but you can't add in Trotski's assasination there because it is not true to say that Allason said that.</li>
<li>Allason was right. Trotski was killed by <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram%C3%B3n_Mercader_21a7.html" title="Ramón Mercader">Ramón Mercader</a> who was a member of the NKVD - not the KGB and not the FSB. He's also about "in the face of 65 years of Soviet or Russioan practice". Trotski was killed in 1940 - which was 67 years ago - not within 65 years. We may assume that Allason deliberately chose 65 years in order to exclude Trotski's assassination from his explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently, I would request that User:86.155.208.55 not keep adding this information back into this article. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:13, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
