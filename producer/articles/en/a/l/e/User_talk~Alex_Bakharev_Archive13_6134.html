<p>Seeing that Ahwaz has been BLOCKED for 1 MONTH, you should immediately unlock the article as we should NOT have to wait that damn long to make edits and remove his <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and non <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources. <b>I am getting sick of this anti-iranian double standards - see <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a> and the campaign to deny racism and bigotry against Iranians!</b> And no offense, but you should not have protected the article since you are involved in the dispute. What is amazing to me is that you and Khoikhoi (who also claims to be in the dispute) do not acknowledge this and instead take this unilateral actions. What, you want to give a room for this type of propaganda??

<p>It is extremly unfair. They have protected version of Biophys. And it is discrimination of me. Biophys deleted and reverted all texts done not only by me, but by administrators Mikkalai, Alex Bakharev. So it is just simply protection of Biophys version.

<li>oh, and while at it... I happened to stray into the article about <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Solomon_Moisseiff_b7b6.html" title="Leon Solomon Moisseiff">Leon Solomon Moisseiff</a>, one of the <i>real</i> engineers of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_bridge_191a.html" title="Golden Gate bridge">The Bridge</a> (and who's been unfairly undercredited until very recently). The man is from Riga, born 1872, so does this qualify as Russia-related? The article is not new, and I'm not sure if I can I still post it to our "new articles" page, but it'd be great to get some attention and help from the engineers like yourself&#160;:) to check on the terminology, expand and otherwise edit the story. What say you? - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161">~</font></a> 05:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As a matter of fact I hope somebody would help me with this. If the bot would eventually work for 20+ "new article" feeds I certainly would like somebody on each portal/project to help me with this. Even only for the Russian pages it seems to be quite a chore. I think this Moisseiff guy deserves attention of Russian folks. I have announced him on <a href="../../../r/u/s/Portal%7ERussia_Hidden_Gems_df67.html" title="Portal:Russia/Hidden Gems">Portal:Russia/Hidden Gems</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 06:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Alex, thanks for your help with promotion&#160;:) - the story of the other <i>real</i> engineer of The Bridge, Charles Ellis, seems even more amazing than that of Moisseiff: he (together with Moisseiff) carried out the most complex and most important calculations for the suspension construction of the marvel, yet his name wasn't up on the bridge until after more than a decade. They two saved the world from the <small>(ugliest ever)</small> original bridge design (by Strauss). But I'm afraid there's no way an article on Ellis (an American) could qualify as Russia-related.</dd>
<dd>As to the bot list sorting, certainly I'll be glad to help, can't promise a whole lot but will be trying as much as I can - we just need to coordinate so not to step on each other toes with you or with whomever else will be helping on this. Let's check again tomorrow or in a day?

<p>Hi, I am not sure why you deleted the article i started called <i>Alexey Kondrashov</i>. If it is for lack of references, I agree there is work to be done. If it it because you judge this person to be unimportant, then I disagree. He is a key evolutionary biologist of the 20th century, and has written many important papers in science. Anyhow, do you still have a copy of it, as I don't. could you please post it here or on my discussion page so I can work on it.

<li>Hi. I am a new Wiki user, therefore am having some difficulties. Regarding Vagif Mustafazade copyvio, yes, the article was copied from azer.com, but I know the editor personally and can get written permission for Wiki. Please let me know how to handle this. Also, I am planning to copy articles from that site about other musicians, writers and artists. Again, I have permission from the editor for all of them. So please let me know how to avoid copyvio message in the future and what changes I should make to the articles I am planning to create. Thanks. Zondi 07:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alex could you have a look at discussion of Stomakhin article. It is evident that Biophys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#A_compromise" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#A_compromise" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#A_compromise</a> just uses the fact that his version was protected to his advantage. The article now does not correspond to any actual situation. Extremist Stomakhin is painted like a victim of Putin regime as it was originally. You could see that not only ellol, Grafikn agrees with me, but you also was sharing at least some portion of the text. Could you do something to the article? Biophys evidently doesn't want to change anything, he advances his conspiracy theories as it always was. I am really disappointed by the Wikipedia, where one troll could write everything he wants and no one could do anything with it.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>we discussed the correct title for this article last October, and concluded that it should be <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolay_Shilder_2b5a.html" title="Nikolay Shilder">Nikolay Shilder</a>. Unfortunately, user <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetri_Krohn_f1f9.html" title="User:Petri Krohn">Petri Krohn</a> disagreed and moved the page to <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolay_Schilder_7b4c.html" title="Nikolay Schilder">Nikolay Schilder</a> first, then to <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Schilder_99f9.html" title="Nikolai Schilder">Nikolai Schilder</a>.

<p>This user is blanking pages. I suspect from my interactions with him he has a political agenda. Since he is an editor, I am not sure how to handle the situation. I am not active in Wikipedia precisely because my contributions have been vandalized under the pretext of editing. Regards.</p>
<p>72.181.191.166</p>
<p>P.S. any ideas on how to stop him?</p>

<p>Hi Would you be able to modify your bot to not include articles which have been created but subsequently deleted? I haven't looked at logs to confirm that it is reporting articles which don't exist when it was run, but I'm pretty sure that it does. A list of new articles, which includes red-links, seems silly.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 04:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! You probably know WP policies better, so I am going to ask your advice. The problem is that <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">User:Vlad_fedorov</a> does nothing else but follows every edit by <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a> and me, mostly to revert it (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vlad_fedorov_ddb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vlad fedorov">Special:Contributions/Vlad_fedorov</a>). He also cites unreliable sources such as writings by Yelena Kalashinkova who is most probably an alias of some other person (<a href="../../../y/e/v/Talk%7EYevgenia_Albats_af3f.html" title="Talk:Yevgenia Albats">Talk:Yevgenia_Albats</a>) and adds nonsense to Wikipedia (e.g. at least he claimed that Sergei Stepashin had never worked for FSB <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Galina_Starovoitova&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Galina_Starovoitova&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and that Vladimir Potanin was married to a daughter of Yeltsin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Izvestia&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Izvestia&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).

<dd>А что здесь всегда в Википедии "ненадежный источник" дежурная отмазка? Как это мило называть все что тебе не нравится "ненадежный источник", и не надо ничего доказывать. Ведь есть на свете только три надежных источника - Архивы Митрохина, Архивы Анны Политковской и блоги Альбац, все остальное - просто мусор. Я вообще-то полностью описал скандал с Альбац, а ты с Биофисом на пару только и делали что стирали из статьи все о скандале и о том, что папа Альбац - шпион ГРУ, по Старовойтовой вы возвели домыслы одной газеты на решением суда и всеми остальными источниками. Кстати сказать, следствие определило что между выстрелом в Старавойтову и выстрелом в ее помощника прошло 9 минут, и в эти девять минут по показаниям соседей они слышали разговоры на лестнице. В интернете куча информации об этом. А почему вы в статье это не отразили? Невыгодно! Потому что надо набрехать что именно Путин убил, а не помощник из-за денег. У вас что один фирменный прием - берете один источник и всю статью бреете под него? Например в статье по государственный терроризм про СССР только один источник - Ион Пасепа, у Бориса Стомахина - CPJ. Если доказать, что наоборот ваши источники ненадежны, то от Ваших статей ничего поди и не останется. Правильно Биофису на talk page Путина американец сказал, ты бы еще его в убийстве Цезаря и Кеннеди обвинил. Так это американец сказал, не русский. Кроме того это пустое доносительство уже надоедает. И все потому что за ложное обвинение тут в Википедии по-видимому не наказывают, особенно руссофобов. 1) It is not me, but you who 'looks after me', Mediation Boris Stomakhin Case page for example. 2)Disruptive? You claimed that Elena Kalashnikova chief political observer to Dni.ru and contributor to Русский журнал is an alias? You just can't live because there are people with another POV correcting your POV to NPOV. You delete all information which may compromise your POV in Albats and Starovoitova articles. 3)You are lying that I have intentionally made two mistakes. I had written them one time and wasn't reverting to them, unlike you who delete valid and sourced statements. By the way these guys -- Biophys and Colchicum are 'threatening me' with plans to publish articles on Litvinenko science fiction. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yevgenia_Albats#Further_work" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yevgenia_Albats#Further_work" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yevgenia_Albats#Further_work</a> <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 20:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Да точно таким же путем, которым ты попал на страницу медиации по Борису Стомахину, тем же путем которым ты сегодня правил мои поправки Альбац, Законодательной деятельности Путина и статьи о Старовойтовой.

<dd>Vlad, I have never referred to Mitrokhin's or Politkovskaya's archives and never used Albats' blog as a source. The fact that Albats' father served for the military intelligence during WWII can certainly be mentioned if substantiated well, but it is not worth placing in the first place. That was an article about Albats rather than her father. Besides, it is hardly exceptional for anybody to serve for such an organization during war time, which raises some issues about notability.</dd>

<dd>Минуточку, в статье пишется о том, что Альбац была назначена в парламентсткую коммиссию по расследованию КГБ, почему жу мы не можем отразить в ее биографии, тот факт что ее родители - работники спецслужб? Мне все равно каким будет это предложение в абзаце, первым, вторым, третьим. Проблема в том, что вы с Биофисом не перемещаете это предложение, а просто стираете его, потому что оно делает надежность расследований Альбац неимоверно ненадежным.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:38, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I haven't followed the page history, so I don't know what Biophys wrote there. I myself have never accused Putin of this murder. As to Linkov, he has never been found guilty by a court and I have never heard about such a hypothesis considered seriously, so I don't understand what you are talking about.</dd>

<dd>If other people correct my alleged POV in Wikipedia, this doesn't mean that they express NPOV. As a text without any POV just cannot exist, NPOV guidelines reasonably require citing different POVs if they are notable enough and well founded. Again, I have made only a minor change to the Starovoitova article, and I can hardly understand how you managed to detect my POV there. But whatever.</dd>

<p>Guys, we have <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> policy. It is certainly a blockable offence to follow somebody's contributions just to annoy and harass an editor. It is certainly a right thing to do to follow and revert contributions of a <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandal</a>. Following contributions of somebody you whose POV you do not agree with is somehow a grey area, it is difficult to prove and may continue for some time. On the other hand blocks for stalking then it is become obvious are usually longer. Better avoid even appearance of such intentions: there are hundreds of admins and there standards on the matter might be different. I will look into the articles in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>At any case there are literally thousands of Russia-related articles in desperate need of editing or even redlinks yet, there is no need to crowd <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 21:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>А у них просто проблема есть, как бы их источники сделать авторитетными. Вот они и создают сначала странички где утверждают, что источник А - самый авторитетный в мире, как например с архивом Митрохина (автор - Биофис). А потом на их основании они начианют сорить в статьи о правах человека, терроризме. Один американец вставил цитату из американского университетского журнала(!!!) о ненадежности Архива Митрохина. Теперь вопрос - что же сделал Биофис когда увидел такое чудо на своем святом источнике? Ну конечно стер, и написал цитирую "(propaganda segment inserted by anonymous user removed - see discussion)" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitrokhin_Archive&amp;diff=107296555&amp;oldid=107010834" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitrokhin_Archive&amp;diff=107296555&amp;oldid=107010834" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitrokhin_Archive&amp;diff=107296555&amp;oldid=107010834</a>. Стоит ли говорить что дискуссии на talk page никакой не было и в помине? Вот сижу и я думаю, когда это в американских университетских журналах стали пропаганду печатать? Ни много, ни мало журнал называется American Historical Review и издается Калифорнийским университетом Лос Анджелеса, а историк написавший ее - J. Arch Getty. Ну конечно же это ненадежный источник.</dd>

<dd>Hi, Alex. Obviously, Vlad is stalking me, and it is obvious why. Obviously, I am very frustrated. I would like to ask Vlad at least not to stalk Colchicum. Unlike me, he seems to be a professional historian, and he is doing a really good work here. I tried to help him a little with technical things. One side note. Please take a look at talk page of <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitrokhin_Archive_71ef.html" title="Mitrokhin Archive">Mitrokhin Archive</a>. I was right deleting this text as follows from discussion of two other users (now it is deleted by others). That was "bad faith" citation out of context that distorted ideas of its author. Also take a look at Vlad's log. It is at least a thousand of edits. Almost all the time he attacks my articles and edits. I can deal with this problem only by making it bigger <a href="../../../y/e/v/Talk%7EYevgenia_Albats_af3f.html#Further_work" title="Talk:Yevgenia Albats">Talk:Yevgenia_Albats#Further_work</a>, as time allows. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 23:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also removed the unsourced statement by the anon saying that <i>most Russians emigrated from Georgia since it declared its independence</i>. This is <b>not</b> true, because there are as many Russians living friendly with Georgians in the spirit of brotherhood as before, but most of them are naturalized Georgians citizens rather than holding the Russian passports, so the statistics don't usually portray the reality. <a href="../../../s/o/s/User%7ESosomk_cf5f.html" title="User:Sosomk">SosoMK</a> 04:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am really tired now of these false accusations. I have never pursued Colchicum and don't understand why he hates me so much. All that I have done is just introduction of other POV in the respective articles.</p>
<p>For example, you haven't noticed that I actually covered the scandal with Albats prior to your edits, but users Ilgiz, Biophys and Colchicum deleted my coverage, claiming that my sources violate BLP policy.</p>

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>You have recently deleted a page I started called "Public Transportation Safeguard". As I am relatively new to Wikipedia this is one of the very first articles I tried to start. But the next day it got deleted. I am stuck here on what to do.</p>
<p>I am a high school student leader and PTS is a community service activity I started at Overseas Family School, Singapore. It has been planned since last December and introduced a month ago. It has became really popular and one of the best ideas and initiatives in community service. Now is it spreading amongst schools like Singapore American School and United World College of South East Asia. Many of my friends and the community service coordinator at our school encouraged me to start this page. and I did. But after I told them the news and they all went online looking forward to contribute, the page has been deleted. So please can you explain why it has been deleted and how can I possibly start it again. It will help me in building up my limited knowledge and skills in Wikipedia. If you can, would you please leave an answer on my talk page, thanks! --<a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJingshen_b1ac.html" title="User:Jingshen">Jingshen</a> 13:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alex you have protected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost_Defence_Foundation" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost_Defence_Foundation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost_Defence_Foundation</a> Biophys version with completely deleted information about sources of financing of that organization which was taken from the website of that organization. It is evident that Biophys deletes any POV he personally dislikes. Any POV he personally dislikes is violating Wikipedia policy according to him. You understand pretty well that his aim is disinformation. He would never agree to introduce any POV or material he personally dislikes. I agree on the respective version of this article made by Mikkalai - see the history page. Why you help Biophys in his intention to delete POV he dislikes? He could present any other POV supported with statements just like me, but he chose to delete my materials instead which is weird.</p>
<p>Biophys again has reintroduced Phallus of Putin in Wikipedia, this time he has made it there <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_political_bloggers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_political_bloggers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_political_bloggers</a>.</p>

It is unfair that Biophys does whatever he wants in Wikipedia, advances only his POV. Is this a Biophysopedia?</p>
<p>I urge you to take some measures for Biophys. How can it be that all allegations introduced by Biophys against Russia do always comply with Wikipedia policies and materials/opinions of journalists, newspapers and officials introduced by me always violate Wikipedia policies accroding to Biophys? Please see the respective talk page for Boris Stomakhin where Biophys refused to negotiate.

<p>Hi Alex, I explained my position here: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_Vlad_fedorov_fc8a.html#New_episodes_of_wikistalking_by_Vlad" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Vlad fedorov">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov#New_episodes_of_wikistalking_by_Vlad</a> Do you disagree? Vlad continue reverting all my changes. Could you please suggest any way out without arbitration? If you have any good suggestion, I am ready to think about it. Thank you. Sincerely, <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 05:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Vlad and me should follow suggestion of User physiq: stay away from each other's edits. It means: I do not do any edits in articles where Vlad did any edits before me (whatever these edits are); and he does the same with regard to me. Smae thing about colhicum. What that be fair? Do you agree? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 13:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC) So, I posted it here: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Vlad_fedorov_7dac.html#Desired_outcome" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Vlad fedorov">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov#Desired_outcome</a><a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to let you know. If Vlad does not stop his wikistalking, I probably have no other choice but to try mediation and arbitration. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 05:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">User:Artaxiad</a> tries to delete images on Azerbaijan, many of which were taken in Soviet times and should be PD.

<dd>The other thing that I noticed that Artaxiad only tagged Azeri-related photos. Wikipedia started with much looser copyright policy then it is now. Tightening it is a painful process by itself. Please always do it in a good faith, doubts in the intentions of the tagger make it even more painful. In short do not use copyright issues as a weapon <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 23:39, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I hope you are not buying what Grandmaster said I found one of Baku's images than I checked his logs I found all his images on Government, Travel etc websites, so that is why I am tagging it he has no info on who owns the images it simply says there the owners of the website. Now grandmaster is going to use this against me in Attribution which is pointless because most of what his images are copy vios or non-sourced. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 07:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The user who uploaded the images explained so many times already that he has a permission to use them. Looks like the hunt on Azerbaijani images continues at commons. If you check this <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baku_Metro_b6ea.html" title="Baku Metro">Baku Metro</a> article, you'll see that all the images are tagged for deletion by some TigranMets, who is apparently Artaxiad. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/TigranMets" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/TigranMets" rel="nofollow">[14]</a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 07:45, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would understand that you were concerned with copyright problems if you were so critical with regard to images uploaded by people of ethnic background other than Azerbaijani as well.

<dd>No the only reason you are saying this is because of Armenian-Azeri conflicts which I really can care less unless people shove it down peoples throats like you are doing now, if it was a Asian or something you wouldn't say anything, if i find a violation I can check there logs and it seemed he had alot so I went and tagged the rest no bad faith but it seems you are assuming bad faith. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 08:00, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, guys, because of an edit conflict out of three paragraphs only one (the last one) survived that changed the meaning of the reply. The lost paragraphs were about the importance of the sources of the images. I cannot restore the full reply but please if you have sources always insert them: it is a general courtesy to the source, it often needed for the checking of the copyright status, it is needed for the verification of the image. In the case that there are no doubts that image is PD (note that {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-Russia_dde2.html" title="Template:PD-Russia">PD-Russia</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-Ukraine_0fdc.html" title="Template:PD-Ukraine">PD-Ukraine</a>}} requires much more than only the origin from the Soviet time!) and no doubts about the explanation of an image, then it is possible to put something generic like <i>Pre-1954 Soviet photograph made by an anonymous photographer, the copyright belonged to the Soviet state and expired according to the law</i>. Please handle all the requests to sources seriously.</p>
<p>I am happy that I have misunderstood Artaxiad and he acted in good faith. Please in future avoid the appearance of mixing the content disputes with the copyright issues, they should be separate.

<dd>Thanks Alex, I always assume good faith unless I see that somenone targets the images only because they are Azerbaijan related.

<p>Hi again Alex. Do you know if there is a way to keep <b><a href="../../../m/a/g/Image%7EMagomayev.jpg_2ddc.html" title="Image:Magomayev.jpg">Image:Magomayev.jpg</a></b> on wiki? It was taken in late 1960s and was ok to use here under the previous Soviet PD license, which apparently has changed now. It is no good to see the article about a prominent singer without any illustration just because of the reasons we discussed above.

<p>I strongly disagree with reason for blocking my bot. It's normal, that bot adds <b>all</b> languages. And ru-sib is still live wiki = not closed yet. And if it is because of <a href="../../../a/b/k/Abkhaz_language.html" title="Abkhaz language">Abkhaz language</a>, i recommend you to see the ru-sib article. <b>It is not robotical stub</b>. As I sait do User:Khoikhoi, the only way for not adding ru-sib is to remove it from <b>all languages</b>. And en is the only one, who complains.</p>
<p>And if you look to mo: language, it is dead wiki, but still existing. I think, it's better to leave this language as it is, and remove it after ru-sib is officially closed.</p>
<p>Please, unblock bot, because block in one langage can destroy solving of problematic interwiki: in another 249 languages it will be OK, but in en will bew mistakes. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJAn_Dud%C3%ADk_be38.html" title="User:JAn Dudík">JAn Dudík</a> 07:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Alex. I am perfectly aware about the huge difficulties of having to estimate extremely complex situations and having to pronounce decisions about fellow users. Judging others is a very ingrate position and I respect those who, in spite of difficulties, take this responsibility. I think that in order to manage such a complicated task, one should however observe a couple of basic principles: <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presumption_of_innocence.html" title="Presumption of innocence">presumption of innocence</a> and hearing both sides. I would like to call upon these principles in my case.</p>
<p>Allow me first showing that not all the edits which you claimed of having undone edits of <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a> did it so. Thus, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ioan_P._Culianu&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ioan_P._Culianu&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this edit has nothing to do</a> with any edit of Dahn, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Goma&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Goma&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this edit either</a> has no relation to Dahn’s edits, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> was a compromise proposal aimed at stopping a war edit of Dahn against other editors, while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> was an add-on of sourced information, having nothing to do with Dahn.</p>
<p>There remain nevertheless three edits where I got involved into direct contact with Dahn.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit sequence</a> related to <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_Creang%C4%83_734d.html" title="Ion Creangă">Ion Creangă</a>, I had first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;diff=110431091&amp;oldid=108578780" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;diff=110431091&amp;oldid=108578780" rel="nofollow">expanded the information</a> in the article’s lead, my edits being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;diff=110441211&amp;oldid=110431091" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;diff=110441211&amp;oldid=110431091" rel="nofollow">reverted by Dahn</a>, I reinserted my edits, which have been again reverted. At this moment I abandoned, not wishing to continue what could have degenerated into an edit war.</li>
<li>Through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Nechita&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Nechita&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> I restored an external link deleted by Dahn as “spamlink” – a dismissive and unjust labelling of what I considered a legitimate link. That’s why I allowed myself to characterize the revert as “vandalism”. Dahn reverted back invoking that the link was “commercial”. I was not prepared to continue on this and I abandoned.</li>
<li>My third <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit</a> restored a perfect decent and relevant external link, in accordance with the arguments presented on the talk page by user Turgidson and myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, dear Alex, in all three cases my edits were content-related and perfectly sustainable, not just abusive and arbitrary interventions aimed at harassing Dahn. Besides, you can check the general pattern of my edits and you’ll encounter a respectable editor and author of appreciated articles. Please try to put yourself into my position: what am I supposed to do now, as you are accusing me of stalking Dahn&#160;? My only choice is to avoid any article where Dahn is editing out of fear of not being accused again of “stalking”. Since much of the topics where Dahn is editing cover my interest area as well, the logical consequence is to leave Wikipedia. Is this what you are aiming to, when you are warning me “Please stop following Dahn”&#160;?! I am by no means persecuting Dahn. Try to imagine how Wikipedia would look like, if every user whose edits were challenged, complains about being harassed. What about reporting Dahn harassing me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimir_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109553691" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimir_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109553691" rel="nofollow">this revert</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109786442" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109786442" rel="nofollow">this revert</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Commission_for_the_Study_of_the_Communist_Dictatorship_in_Romania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109882348" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Commission_for_the_Study_of_the_Communist_Dictatorship_in_Romania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109882348" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Commission_for_the_Study_of_the_Communist_Dictatorship_in_Romania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110440795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Commission_for_the_Study_of_the_Communist_Dictatorship_in_Romania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110440795" rel="nofollow">again this revert</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110441211" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Creang%C4%83&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110441211" rel="nofollow">this revert</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Nechita&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110662268" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Nechita&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110662268" rel="nofollow">this revert</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111139862" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111139862" rel="nofollow">this revert</a> and finally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111147604" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111147604" rel="nofollow">this one</a>&#160;? Should we suppose that Dahn’s eight reverts were pertinent and legitimate, while my three reverts were arbitrary and made in bad faith&#160;? Sincerely, I didn’t think before about this possibility, but now, after having counted eight reverts against me within a week, I seriously consider to report Dahn for <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> What do you think, Alex&#160;?</p>
<p>This case between Dahn and me is a good example of a very intricate situation, with mutual recriminations and a never-ending conflict. The story behind all this, dear Alex, is that in the last 10 days I began to be more explicit in my criticism of Dahn’s editing behaviour. Examples of my stances are this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=108882456&amp;oldid=108693370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=108882456&amp;oldid=108693370" rel="nofollow">warning</a>, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109548285" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109548285" rel="nofollow">post</a>, as well as these most recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111137953" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111137953" rel="nofollow">post 1</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111144936" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:G%C3%A2ndirea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111144936" rel="nofollow">post2</a>, where I was admittedly vehement in criticising what I consider an abusive and detrimental behaviour. As you see, Alex, this story has much deeper and larger roots as probably presumed at first sight. As you probably realise by now, I am far from being some trolling kid, running tasteless jokes against established users. I am very seriously concerned about the possibility that Dahn’s <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> behavior grows into a problem for the community. Besides, libelling summaries like: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109303043" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109303043" rel="nofollow">rv vandalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109307006" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109307006" rel="nofollow">rv vandalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Goma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109313458" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Goma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109313458" rel="nofollow">rv blatant pov</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romanian_alphabet&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109416907" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romanian_alphabet&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109416907" rel="nofollow">rv spam</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109544306" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109544306" rel="nofollow">rv POV-pushing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109544859" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dahn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109544859" rel="nofollow">shoo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Goma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109778616" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Goma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109778616" rel="nofollow">rv pov</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110031326" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110031326" rel="nofollow">rv POV-pushing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110042802" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leonte_Tism%C4%83neanu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110042802" rel="nofollow">rv to last by me</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%9Etefan_Luchian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110330186" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%9Etefan_Luchian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110330186" rel="nofollow">rv v</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110918418" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110918418" rel="nofollow">rv POV-pushing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Commission_for_the_Study_of_the_Communist_Dictatorship_in_Romania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111170704" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Commission_for_the_Study_of_the_Communist_Dictatorship_in_Romania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111170704" rel="nofollow">rv vandalism</a> don’t make things better: accusing co-editors 4 times of vandalism and 4 times of POV-pushing (not to mention deeply dismissive comments like “shoo” or “rv spam”), all within the last week.

<p>You left yesterday a note to <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintila_Barbu_9193.html" title="User:Vintila Barbu">User:Vintila Barbu</a> claiming he is stalking <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a>. The relation is somehow the other way around. If you want proof, take a look at <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valter_Roman_de20.html" title="Valter Roman">Valter Roman</a>. I created the article today and Vintila helped me. Guess who came right after us? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">User:Dahn</a>. I expect you to leave him a message on the subject. Cheers, <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">Dpotop</a> 20:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but you got it wrong. <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valter_Roman_de20.html" title="Valter Roman">Valter Roman</a> was proposed for creation on the noticeboard several days ago. I happened to pick it, marking my name next. If Dahn was so eager to edit on the subject, he could have easily created the article himself. Instead, he waited for someone else to create it, fill in half the info, and then took over. This I call stalking. BTW, there are 3 proposed articles left uncreated. Why didn't Dahn choose them instead? <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">Dpotop</a> 12:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So, your accusation of stalking on Vintila is more appropriated on Dahn, which seems to make a fixation on everything related to a certain period of Romanian history.

<dd>It is truly abhorrent that I stand accused of improving articles. First of all, the article was announced <a href="../../../r/o/m/Wikipedia%7ERomanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_18e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Romanian Wikipedians' notice board">here</a> by the user who initiated the whole drive. I simply noticed the link turn blue, clicked it, and happened to notice that the article was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valter_Roman&amp;oldid=111592884" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valter_Roman&amp;oldid=111592884" rel="nofollow">nowhere near wikipedia standards</a> (it was ungrammatical, colloquial, unwikified, vague, and occasionally just plain wrong - such as when implying that <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliningrad.html" title="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a> was a city in the Soviet Union during the 1930s), and that I had access to sources Dpotop did not. I did so at a time when the article was not being "used".</dd>
<dd>If you have the time, Alex, please read the dialog on the notice board in regard to the said article. I have chosen to stay away from it, since I had nothing to reply to Dptop's claims, but you will notice that two users argue there that Dpotop stepped over the line with his comments on the matter.</dd>
<dd>You will also note that this was started bu <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">User:Biruitorul</a> as a contest of some sort, and that, as other users have pointed out, Dpotop decided to create the article <i>out of contest</i> (in case he wants back in with credit for it, he can take it for all I care).</dd>
<dd>I don't think there is anything in this situation that refers to either WP:OWN or WP:STALK - as opposed to Vintila Barbu's overt appeals to stalking (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIcar&amp;diff=109564162&amp;oldid=98582417" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIcar&amp;diff=109564162&amp;oldid=98582417" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAdrianTM&amp;diff=109627082&amp;oldid=109570614" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAdrianTM&amp;diff=109627082&amp;oldid=109570614" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>) and his subsequent move to follow my recent contributions and revert them on sight.</dd>
<dd>I would also like to point out that some Romanian contributors live with the assumption that I am to either form a team with them or go away, and interpret this as a wikipedia policy. I have not been able to find that policy, only ones referring to <i>interaction</i> with other users - I have not broken that rule, whereas Vintila Barbu has stepped over it limitlessly (not merely by stalking, but by calling me all sorts of things as a means to discredit me and my contributions). Furthermore, as countless editors will attest, I am perfectly able to cooperate with those contributors who advocate neutrality and informative quality, based on reliable sources (all my past conflicts with these two users involve the persistence of their POV-pushing and reliance on things such as rumors, personal experience, and ability to mudsling). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:22, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I was informed of this bot through the Swedish Wikipedians' Notice Board (SWNB). It seems really interesting and useful. Maybe at some time it could be made to edit the New Articles page on the SWNB directly. I'm wondering though, if the bot could also pick out the date the article was created and who created it? The date is nice for keeping track, while information about the creator is nice for (a) being able to help prolific editors out and (b) take intervention against hoaxes, bogus and non notable articles.</p>
<p>I also don't understand the rules, and would really appreciate an instruction page.</p>

Then the content is of the search result is shown on the board. Also because the bot search result starts with the new section there will be the <i>edit</i> button to edit the bot results. I would recommend to do it after we at least onece run the bot with more than 50% of correct finding. It is no use to frighten board users with hundreds false positive.</p>
<p>The rules are <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expression_c3e6.html" title="Perl Compatible Regular Expression">Perl Compatible Regular Expressions</a>. \W there means any non-word chracter (any character outside a-zA-Z range). I use it as a word boundary. Thus, /\Wassyria/ would much Assyria, Assyrian, Assyrians, etc. If I limit it from both ends /\Wassyria\W/ it will match only Assyria but not Assyrian nor Assyrians. If we have a short word that looks like a possible fragment of a longer English word or name I would prefer to limit it from the both ends, to prevent false positives. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 06:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for you reply on my talk page. I made a comment on the relevant page. Can probably do that Friday night if anything happens. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 06:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>I've noticed your bot adds new articles to a lot of new article announcement pages. I was wondering if you could modify it just a bit to help me with a task. I've been using the bot's lists occasionally to find entries for the DYK section of the main page. It is, however, pretty frustrating to pick through all those stubs to find articles that meet DYK criteria. It would be cool if you could have your bot create a list just for finding new articles for DYK. It would have to select articles based on the DYK criteria. If you'd be willing to do this, I can write you exactly how I think that could work. Greetings,-- <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 17:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That it a challenge! Make bot to find good articles. I could compile the list of new articles longer than 2K, having more than one paragraphs, at least one link and at least one category. Still it will be quite a long list. Not sure if it will be useful. Still I will try <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 20:41, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Some more criteria that could be useful would be whether an article has a references section or something similar (DYK articles have to be referenced). It would also be great, if templates, especially infoboxes, weren't counted as far article size goes and if articles with cleanup or similar tags were disregarded. Thanks for your help, -- <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 22:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Alex, just noticed that the bot readded some articles I trimmed off it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AlexNewArtBot/NZSearchResult&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=113289218" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AlexNewArtBot/NZSearchResult&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=113289218" rel="nofollow">This edit</a> added back some articles like <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_International_Lawn_Tennis_Challenge_ed4e.html" title="1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge">1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge</a> which I had removed on the edit directly before that.

<ul>
<li>Yes. I know it. The bot searches over the consecutive days are overlap. The bot would not add an article already in its search result or in the main board but would happily re-add deleted articles. I have probably made the bot to find the last edit by it and check against this last edit <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 20:50, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AKirponos.jpg&amp;diff=113444192&amp;oldid=113440996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AKirponos.jpg&amp;diff=113444192&amp;oldid=113440996" rel="nofollow">translation</a>. But, do you have any information about that image or just translated the Russian text? I ask that because I believe that source information is still incomplete.</p>
<p>If I understood correctly (do hesitate on correcting me!), the given source is a newspaper issue from 2001 that happen to include that image. As the copyright tag used on that image says it's public domain because "<i>...it was published before January 1st, 1954, and the creator (if known) died before that date...</i>", I believe would we need more information on that image to feel comfortable about it claimed copyright status.</p>
<p>Do you know about any reliable source that could give us information on this image's creator (specially, the date of his death?)</p>
<p>Or maybe, some reliable source explaining this image was published by the Soviet government (what would make it almost undoubtelly PD)?</p>
<p>Sorry for storming you with this task. It's like I'm punishing you for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AKirponos.jpg&amp;diff=113444192&amp;oldid=113440996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AKirponos.jpg&amp;diff=113444192&amp;oldid=113440996" rel="nofollow">being nice</a>&#160;:) .</p>

<ul>
<li>Abu, I just translated the Russian text. Yes it is a Ukrainian newspaper of 2001. Kirponos died in 1941. Since a copyright of a photograph is usually started from the date the photo was first made and the copyright of Soviet photos was almost always given to the Staet, thus I think the copyright status is pretty safe, but you can investigate further , if you wish. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 00:58, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alex, will you please help with the "Turkic alphabets" article. User Dbachmann effectively immediately killed it as a stand-alone article, pretending to merge it with Orkhon alphabet, without resorting to use to Talk page, or allowing the other users to comment. The action is visibly done in a bad faith. User Dbachmann belittled the author, removerd references contained in the original article, wiped out most of the contents, and then added <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="These claims needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">citations needed</span></i></a>]</sup> in the merged left-overs. Please reverse this covert and unannounced speedy deletion. I even can't give a link to the wiped out article, because he re-linked Turkic alphabets title to Orkhon alphabet, like it never existed. Can you suggest what else can I do to restore the article? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 21:27, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you could spare a moment, I have a question and a request for possible action. <a href="../../../r/9/t/User%7ER9tgokunks_6dd1.html" title="User:R9tgokunks">User:R9tgokunks</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELUCPOL_6fdd.html" title="User:LUCPOL">User:LUCPOL</a> are engaged in frequent content disputes, and don't seem to get along. As far as I can tell, neither of them is a model Wikipedian, to say the least. Today, however, User:R9tgokunks made a number of significant edits in User:LUCPOL's userspace, seemingly without his permission. (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R9tgokunks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R9tgokunks" rel="nofollow">history</a> of contributions, which occured around 22:00 EDT on March 9). The result of this series of rather messy edits is that a potentially controversial template User:LUCPOL/Userboxes/User schlonzk was created in LUCPOL's userspace. (Previously LUCPOL had a box with this text on his page, but only for himself, and not as a userbox which could be transcluded elsewhere). Note that User:LUCPOL's command of English is not great, so I don't think he would be able to act adequately in this matter, which is why I am mentioning this to you myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, what is Wikipedia's general policy on this kind of action? What steps should be taken, if any, in this matter? My general opinion (and it is only that) is that User:R9tgokunks is actively seeking a fight and continually escalates the disruptiveness of his edits. A number of people have complained about his edits on his talk page. I have reverted him a few times myself, so I may be biased here.

<dd>LUCPOL...That IS YOUR USERBOX, YOU CREATED IT, IT GOES UNDER YOUR NAME! I can assure you , even thought everyone says I am FORCEFULLY trying to harass LUCPOL, it doesnt have ONE BIT ,ONE CRUMB of truth to it AT ALL. Why has everyone accused me of harassing LUCPOL after creating a template he thought up? Friendly gestures are met with so much PARANOIA these days, and im VERY disappointed and a little depressed about that. Second, LUCPOL keeps adding unsigned Warnings to my page telling me i am "vandalizing" <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Silesian_Coal_Basin_5dd2.html" title="Upper Silesian Coal Basin">Upper Silesian Coal Basin</a> and <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Silesian_Metropolitan_Union_5efd.html" title="Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union">Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union</a>, when in fact he is the one doing it because he wants to advertise Silesia, By the way those two pages were almost EXACTLY the same as the <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katowice.html" title="Katowice">Katowice</a> article until i attempted cleaning them up...OH WAIT Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union STILL IS, BECAUSE LUCPOL KEEPS REVERTING IT! -- <a href="../../../r/9/t/User%7ER9tgokunks_6dd1.html" title="User:R9tgokunks">Hrödberäht</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/9/t/User_talk%7ER9tgokunks_17b3.html" title="User talk:R9tgokunks">gespräch</a>)</small> 17:31, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's quite a tough one because there is no strict guideline where you could point and say: here it is! (BTW, I am not keeping up with latest developments on fair use policies) My take at this: If someone wrote an article Logos of Spike TV or a decent section about them then it would be ok to show all those logos (of course, the article might be subject to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and notability guidelines). As of right now, it is a violation of the policy because there are too many of them (FUC#3), they do not identify the subject of the article (the first logo used in the infobox does, FUC#8), they do not illustrate text (in fact the section has no text, FUC#8). Also practical look: such galleries do not belong to articles in any case, even if the images are free (Wikipedia is not an image gallery). That's my take on this. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 03:16, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you should revisit that block you gave to Arcayne. Look at the diffs, they are not reverts, he was cleaning up the article and removing unsources original research. Since when has the removal of original research become a violation of the 3RR? If you go to the diffs, and then back track to the previous edits you'll see that they were there already, and several editors have agreed that those contributions were unsourced original research that should be purged from the article. There was no true violation of the 3RR going on here. Just one editor that didn't like the clean up job. It would be like saying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114451591" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114451591" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> is not a constructive edit to clean up the article, but really a revert of someone else's edit and should be delt with the same. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 04:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also posted at the AN/3RR: I bring htis to your attention for the very reasons you note above about the popularity of the article, and the edit warring going on: <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Arcayne_reported_by_User:Mardavich_.28Result:Warning.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">This editor</a> is using the 3RR as an intimidation tactic. Despite having made only a couple edits to the page in three days, he came at me with it. He's using it to push a pro-iranian/persian agenda. he is upset by any removal of content which disparages the movies portrayal of the Persian amries of Xerxes. Further, it's my understanding that 3RR applies to a SINGLE content dispute, NOT to an article as a whole. If it applied to articles as a whole, any three edits which correct information, reword for neutrality, and so on could be counted to the 3RR. It specifically applies to arguments about whether sentence X or Paragraph Y should be in, complete with deletions anreinsertions over and over. TO argue a set of content in one section, resolve it and move on isn't covered by 3RR. Mardavich needs to be made aware of the problems with his interpretation of 3RR, and the fact that he tells editors that any edit they make puts them in danger of violating 3RR can and has been seen as intimidation. I tried to explain it to him, but he weaselled around it using AGF, which is tough to do when confronted with 'you're gonna break 3RR and i'm gonna get you when you do', especially since it's accord to his overly restrictive interpretation of 3RR.

<dd>User:Arcayne is making further personal attacks labeling me all sorts of things like "devious", "POV-pusher", etc, and seeking meat-puppets for his edit-wars on other "freindly" users' talk pages. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Erikster&amp;diff=114537728&amp;oldid=114454328" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Erikster&amp;diff=114537728&amp;oldid=114454328" rel="nofollow">[32]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Behnam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114526003" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Behnam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114526003" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bignole&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114526651" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bignole&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114526651" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> Alex, I am really getting tired of these personal attacks and accusations.

<p>Admin Alex, I'm sorry you have to be apart of all this. I hope that it's clear that User Mardavich is trolling. He seems more concerned with trying to get Arcayne blocked, for any reason he can concoct, than he is with actually editing Wikipedia, and if you check his talk you'll see there is no personal attack on there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 00:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about all his accusations, Alex. To clarify, after he went after me, it seemed prudent to warn the other editors he harrassed that they might be next (he must be watching my contribs to see who i contact). I won't respond and clutter up your page anymore by responding to this fine gentleman's posts any more. I believe you know my and others' position on the fellow. Again, sorry to be cluttering up your page with this nonsense.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 00:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, can you concentrate on the article edits rather than on the fruitless personal accusations and contra-accusations? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">User:Mardavich</a> had valid reasons to believe that there was a 3RR violation by Arcayne. In fact I been reasonably neutral in the matter and more experienced in Wiki policies fell into the same line of reasoning. Please stop accusing Mordavich in the bad faith nomination. "Attacks" by User:Arcayne are very mild, we usually not block for that, still they are clearly irate users, so please resort to more polite communication. I would urge all involved parties to concentrate on the discussion about the article rather than each others. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 01:09, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alex, I'm sorry to bother you, but your buddy is out trolling again. He's reported me for 3RR (without warning btw) and none of these are violation. These are his diffs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114579477" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114579477" rel="nofollow">Here I removed pictures that had nothing to do with the film</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114594280" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114594280" rel="nofollow">here I removed a duplication of another section</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114673642" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114673642" rel="nofollow">this was just some Anon inserting a sentence above some tags in the plot section</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114559757" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114559757" rel="nofollow">and last is just some extraneous details that are not much use on to the article</a>. This is getting kind of annoying. Maradavich is just going through the history and picking out anyone that removes anything, regardless of what the reason, and I point to this as misconduct because he hasn't done this to anyone else except those that he sees as "opposing" him.

<dd>I guess I should voice my opinion as well. He came at me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThuranX&amp;diff=114254654&amp;oldid=113853309" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThuranX&amp;diff=114254654&amp;oldid=113853309" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> at 2:20 on 11 Mar, after TWO edits, at 1:29 i removed a section sourced to a person's personal film review blog <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114247561" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114247561" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, and then at 1:47 same day, I removed a see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114250319" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114250319" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, and took it to talk. For those two solid edits, he hit me with a 3RR 'friendly warning'. It was cleraly intimidation, same as he's doing to other editors opposing his views. As BigNole and I, along with <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erikster</a> and a few others were adding to that and similar films (comics interpretations) it was clear from our edit histories that we pay attention to the page and have an interested preceding any 'bias editing, but he's instead choosing to see us as the 'opposition'. His behavior and conduct is to me definitely incivil, YMMV. He needs a significant cautioning.

<p>We have been thinking that creating a temp page for the controversy stuff might allow that discussion to take place for those interested in that, while the main article (Production, Plot,Themes etc.) gets some much needed attention. After its nice and tight, we reintegrate a hopefully more stable controversies section. We were thinking that an admin should sign off on this idea, as the article is - as you said before - highly visible. As well, because of the argumentative edits, we want to make sure that no one feels slighted. In addition to the temp page, and the moving of the controversies section to it, we would make sure that all new contributors knew exactly where to go to if they wanted to address the controversies surrounding the film. To be clear, this suggested move isn't intended to lessen the contributions of those wanting to point out controversies, and/or their effect. This allows those editors in workin that particular section a specific area to hash them all out, while at the same time, those editors interested in putting the rest of the article together can do so without relative distraction. After both are relatively stable, they can then be integrated. Your thoughts?<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 01:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the fact that you are not involved in it is precisely why you are a good choice for this. While you are aware of the vehemence of the edits going on, you are distanced from it, which allows you to look at the setting-up dispassionately, and catch potential trouble spots before they occur. You can be as involved or uninvolved as you wish, but your initial input on how to how to avoid trouble would be really both helpful and appreciated.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 02:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
