<p>Dear Administrator: I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are. The world owes you. I owe You.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>While historians continue to disagree whether the policies that led to Holodomor fall under the legal definition of Genocide, numerous governments have officially recognized the Holodomor as such. Also see the comment on discussion page: <i>because the notion of the Holodomor, or Ukrainian Genocide, has long left the exclusive domain of historical journals and moved long time ago into the "mainstream" public domain, i.e. politics, media, history textbooks, Internet</i> These are good arguments. Since Holodomor has been reckognised by several government as genocide and it certainly is debated as genocide by many it deserves this category. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 10:51, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex. I don’t think unprotection was a good idea right now. The page is being regularly vandalized by famous vandal <a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">Rovoam</a>, who was permanently banned from editing Wikpedia. Last time he attacked the page just two days ago. The article was semiprotected, which allowed the established users edit it, so in my opinion semiprotection should be kept for the time being. Regards, <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 04:22, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The article was semiprotected for more than a month. Lets see what will happen. In the event of the IP-vandalism please let me know immediately and I will semiprotect it again. The unprotection was requested by Khoikhoi, lets see if his judgement was right. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 04:28, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Friend, I would like to point out that there is <i>absolutely no original research</i> in the article. The material is copied in blockquotes from research papers. Kindly go through the page.</p>
<p>It is a daughter page of the current wikipedia article on Falun Gong and contains material moved from the page on Falun Gong.</p>
<p>The sources include: <a href="http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm</a> <a href="http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2397.html" class="external free" title="http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2397.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2397.html</a></p>
<p>Considering the fact that there is absolutely no original research in the article, it is requested that I may please be given permission to remove the "to be deleted" tag. Thankyou.</p>

No friend, the article was a product of a long series of discussions and happens to be a daughter article. The information turns out to be very relevant to the edit process in the Falun Gong article which is currently being splitted into daughter articles. Thankyou.

<b>Thanks for voting in my request for administrator rights, even though it failed (13/30/4).</b> Sadly, work has forced me to respond to you all using a substituted message rather than a personalized response. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that administrators, to me, should be chosen and approved by the community, and I will continue working to become a better editor and Wikipedian. No matter what the alignment of your vote was, I will take your comments seriously and use them to improve myself. If you wish to discuss your comments personally with me, I would be more than glad to talk about things since the RfA is now over; just leave your concern on my talk page and we will sort things out.

<p>I kindly ask you to stop your revert war at Maladechna. Apparently there are two conflicting POVs there and I really don't see why the unsourced POV should replace the sourced one. Such revert warring without even a slightest mention at the talk page is disruptive and does not help Wikipedia.

<p>Hello Alex, I still think the wording is unencyclopedic and it's better not to mention it at all if it is unsourced. Basically if it isn't verified 100% percent leave it out. Yeah Manuk is an Armenian name but that doesn't mean anyone with the name is Armenian?

<p>I've reconsidered. I'm too much of a lover of this site to leave. I removed my comments from AN because it was the kind of incivility I've been fighting since I got here. I had no right to dump anything on you. The Deng saga has just frustrated me. I'm going to leave you to it because I think I've spent all of the energy I'm willing to spend on him. I just want to say that you should read every post he's made if need be. As I've said, Kurt is not a saint. And as you can see, I've blocked him twice now myself. But Deng's behavior isn't alot better. We gotta find a way to get these 2 to actually communicate with each other. If you read their talk page comments, they've never really tried to work this out...neither of them. It's all been attack attack attack. Who knows. Maybe he will listen to others. I don't know. He's made some good contribs, but you know, so has Kurt. I think Kurt needs mentorship as much as Deng does, if not more. Anyway, I don't want to directly give evidence, but if you need guidance in terms of Deng's behavior, I can do that. And please please please put his talk page on your WL. When he gets blocked, Deng has a tendency to be incivil. I think that any mentorship is doomed to failure with him. But you know, if you can get him to listen (and that's the main problem I've had with him), I think he's coachable. And as I said, for any arbcom case you want to develop against Deng, go back to the very beginning, which was December. His main focus for quite awhile was <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_II%29_e4c6.html" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front (World War II)</a>. The saga with Kurt started in late March. Good luck.

<dd>Oh and I forgot to mention that the other issue I and others have had with Deng is that he seems to think that if a fact is sourced, that there is some requirement that it be used. It's a common misperception and I've never been able to get him to realize that. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 05:00, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mr. Bakharev, I promised never to bother you, except of cases when we're in editing conflict. This is just the case. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Threat_of_the_Dnieper_reservoirs&amp;diff=57150436&amp;oldid=57149546" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Threat_of_the_Dnieper_reservoirs&amp;diff=57150436&amp;oldid=57149546" rel="nofollow">This</a> your change, namely about <i>young researcher</i>, was unsourced and unexcusable. The danger from the Kiev Sea silt was of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_knowledge.html" title="Common knowledge">common knowledge</a> even before you learned how to use Internet and Wikipedia. You surely are an intellectual, living not so far from Ukraine. So you just couldn't be completely unaware of above-mentioned threat. Even your friend (or your minder?) Irpen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACactus.man&amp;diff=57009329&amp;oldid=56991395" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACactus.man&amp;diff=57009329&amp;oldid=56991395" rel="nofollow">appreciated the article as DYK-worthy</a>. In the other hand,no place of the article says that the "young researcher" is the only source of the info, or of the whole info. Given this, I'm stating that <b>you added evident deliberate lie</b>.</p>
<p>The described manner of editing is not uncommon for the Russian Group which you participate in. But the most unworthy part of your action was the fact that the article is written by <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a>. Soon after contributing it, he made a ridiculously <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">demonstrative</a>, but резонансную effort to edit <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Later he was also blocked for hooliganistic uncivility, - the fact which your friends are going to popularize for years. In this way, he is unable to protect his vision of the reservoirs problem. I'm trying to say that <b>you were trollishly revenging AlexPU when editing his article</b>. You, the admin.</p>
<p>What makes me think so? The following coinciding facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the above mentioned evidence of your deliberate damage to the article</li>
<li>your possible hostile attitude towards Alex PU as anti-Russian hooligan</li>
<li>the fact that his article was suggested for DYK, and your changes discredit this suggestion</li>
<li>the fact that <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACactus.man&amp;diff=57009329&amp;oldid=56991395" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACactus.man&amp;diff=57009329&amp;oldid=56991395" rel="nofollow">told me</a> yesterday that I'm "seeking a revenge for Alex PU", - a possible explanation of your "counter-revenge" act (is there any other acts that Ukrainian users should expect)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Bakharev, it was very unworthy, and I'm not going to allow this more. I'm not sure if I can prove this case of trollism (you are a serious dangerous enemy in such a game). But <b>I will fight any efforts to damage articles only for sake of trolling editors</b>. Absent editors, may I remind (упавшего пинаете, господин хороший?) If my counter-efforts lead me to stripping you off your admiship, that would be only for better. Whatever good, bad or AfD-worthy damaged articles are.

<p>P.S. Until I <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">stop you permanently</a>, please take revenges on me instead of blocked users. AlexPU has had enough punishments, deserved or not.

<dd>Once again I ask you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and do not seek conspirological explanations when we simply have a crappy sensationalists article based almost entirely on the so called "common knowledge" also known as "odna baba skazala". I do not see any punishment of my "enemies" by disruptive editing and as a matter of fact trying my best to improve my "enemies"'s articles (see e.g. <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasyl_Stus_5824.html" title="Vasyl Stus">Vasyl Stus</a> by <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">User:AndriyK</a>). The article you are referred to are in a sorry state and if it will be linked to the main page it would be a shame for Wikipedia. That's all. I have not criticized the article on <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a> as I would have certainly done if it came a neutral party and instead put a few tags that would help you to save the article. If you worry about the article - please find the references and remove the obvious nonsense from the article. If your friend AlexPU wants to improve it he could post his suggestions on his talk page or E-mail them to any user he trusts. I am not responsible for his misfortune (frankly, I would give him much shorter block). And his misfortune is not a reason to link sensationalist crap to the main page. I will answer the specific questions about the article on its talk page. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 12:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes this is a page about the stereotypes. But I never heard a such stereotype(eat lizards.) in my entire life about Turks. Because Turks are muslims they don't eat lizards.

<dd>I can see the reasoning behind your action, but I disagree with it. The result of that old AfD was indeed "delete", but it was more than a year ago. Many things can change in the meantime. I have seen a lot of AfDs against constructed languages, and an opinion I encounter mostly is this: at present, the language is not notable enough for inclusion, but once the language has a considerable community of speakers, serious press coverage, or something similar, then by all means let's have a new article about it! Well, I have a feeling that this míght be the case here. I don't know enough about Siberian to be the judge of that, but I think the article at least deserves some proper discussion, or reevaluation if you like. The version you deleted was completely different from the version that was deleted a year ago, and written by a different person.</dd>
<dd>Be honest: once an article has survived an AfD, there is no law that forbids people to nominate it for deletion again and again and again. But once an article has been deleted, it is almost impossible to get it back, even though the arguments used in the discussion may have expired. That is an unfair situation. I have nominated the article for undeletion <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Siberian_language" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">here</a>, but what we're getting now is a discussion about the merits of the language instead of one about the procedure. Such a discussion belongs in an AfD discussion! I don't even know what I would vote myself, but before making up my mind I'd like to hear the pros and cons at least. Your opinion on the matter will be most welcome!

<p>Thanks for your responses. Frankly, I'm so tired of the vandalism, I really don't care if I'm blocked. As I told Nihonjoe, if only registered users who want to contribute are blocked, while anonymous vandals who can change IP addresses at will (look back the last couple of hours) have their way, Wikipedia will simply lose credible contributors and encourage immature tit-for-tat. Really, unless the various vandals are stopped, what's the point? Thanks anyway though. <a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDollarfifty_8fe1.html" title="User:Dollarfifty">Dollarfifty</a> 04:39, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please also protect An Jung-geun and various other articles the anonymous user has been messing with. Please also note the other anonymous and newly registered users (Forestfarmer, Fxxapple, etc.), and try to do what you can. Thank you again.</p>

<p>Ukrained, your "campaigning" on Alex's RfA was nothing but trolling which I commented on at that very time. It was so obvious that it didn't affect the outcome at all. If there is anyone to praise for that article's appearance on the mainpage, it is AlexPU himself along with Bakharev and myself. When and if you get blocked, your "uprising" would make a joke of the day. More at your talk.

<dd>Don't know why he could edit. As for Deng, I don't see this as a "battle". In other words, I don't compare the 2. The main thing is that the ends do not justify the means. What Kurt has done doesn't justify Deng's actions nor vice versa. Neither has made any real attempt to calmly communicate with the other. Both have violated a good chunk of our policies. And as I pointed out before, Deng's bad behavior predates his problems with Kurt by several months. So I treat them separately and I think they should be treated separately. As long as they continue to violate policies, they will be blocked. If you feel like you can't be neutral in this matter, that's fine. Just so you know though, Deng has had problems with disruptiveness and incivility since his first edit late last year. His inability to compromise led to a 2 month standoff on <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_II%29_e4c6.html" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front (World War II)</a> earlier this year. In fact, that article is how I got involved with him in the first place (I protected the article in response to a request on RfPP). So this didn't just "crop up" with him...or with Kurt for that matter, who has been warned about removing material from articles well before he ran into Deng. These are 2 bad actors who unfortunately ran into each other. Even if Kurt was blocked indefinitely and Deng unblocked, I guarantee that Deng would find somewhere else to break rules. It's just how he's acted since he started here. Have to treat them separately. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 13:16, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Btw, I suspect that what happened is that your unblocking of Kurt and blocking of Kurt were so close apart that maybe the reblock didn't register. That's all I can think of.

<li>Let's see the results. I looked into their contributions and the RabbitHead looks like a Russian guy (with former connections to either Defence industry or Military) to me while Deng is a Swede. The second piece of info, I do not understand why he E-mailed people begging them to revert some changes to his favorite articles, while he in fact could do it himself via sock. Lets see the checkuser results. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 04:17, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No reason to be sorry. As we say in America, don't sweat it.&#160;:) I know it's difficult with Deng because he's been doing this for so long that even if you look at the contribs, you don't really see the ebb and flow as to how he operates. So not a biggie. I just wish that he and Kurt would take their blocks and just sit tight for awhile. And I wish that they would both understand CheckUser a bit better so they would stop doing this. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 15:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why section on influence of the Battle of Praga on history and literature in Poland and Russia is irrelevent in the article on Battle of Praga&#160;? Seems strange.

<p>I already did and no arguments for removal were presented that are reasnoble.

<p>The section is well sourced, you only repeat "its nonsense!" as an argument.

<li>The only piece of info relevant to the Battle of Praga is <i>Alexander Pushkin compared the Praga massacre with the events of events of 1612: "Once, you celebrated the shame of Kreml, tsar's enslavement. But so did we crushed infants on Praga's ruins"</i>. The other authors mentioned, did not say anything about this particular battle, although they may partrait somehow biased picture of Poles. As it was shown on talk, the interpretation of the Pushkin verse is probably incorrect. The other info may be well sourced but is absolutely irrelevant <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 01:01, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Irrevent because&#160;? They speak directly about the role in Polish-Russian relations that the mass murder of Polish citizens by Russian soldiers plays to this day. If this sources speak about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Battle</li>
<li>the role it played in relations</li>
</ul>
<p>Then they are relevant and will be restored. As to Puszkin, I never new he hated Poles with such passion, and I will certainly use presented information to expand his article in regards to this example of extreme Polonophobia. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 01:14, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Molobo, neither of these gentelmen (except Pushkin) mentioned Battle of Praga. You are welcome to put your valuable sources into Polonophobia. Pushkin did not hated Poles, his verses are misrepresented. We are going in circles, please read that you were told. I will not answer if you will just repeat the same arguments without listening to what you have been told<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 01:25, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sources speak about Battle of Praga. As to Puszkin (this being OT) stataments such as "But it is necessary to nevertheless suffocate them'<b>For us the mutiny of Poland is the matter family, ancient, hereditary strifes", are not only highly agressive but also insulting(Poles being hardly "family" of Russians in the first place in terms of culture and history, and the idea being used to justify occupation of Poland and denial of Polish national identity). If this was Puszkins idea of love, I scared to ask what his idea of hate was.</b> But back to topic, as I said the sources speak about the battle, mass murder of thousands of Polish citizens by Russian invaders and its influence on history and culture of both countries. I really don't know under what criteria this can be claimed to be irrelevant. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 01:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
