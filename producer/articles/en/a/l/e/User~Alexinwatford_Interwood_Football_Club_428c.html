<p>Interwood FC are a <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_league_football.html" title="Sunday league football">Sunday league football</a> team who's home ground is <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple_Cross_0b86.html" title="Maple Cross">Maple Cross</a> in Hertfordshire, England. Interwood play in the Olympian League Sunday<a href="http://www.olympianleague.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.olympianleague.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, Division 2. The team was born from the joining of two 5-a-side squads playing in the Pitch Invasion Watford league [www.pitch-invasion.com/] where Interwood and AFC Interwood merged to form the larger squad of Interwood FC. Now in their 3rd season of Sunday League Football Interwood have finally risen above the relegation spots to make the top 4 their home.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of club secretary Joseph Reeves and 'hands off' manager Ben "rant" Wynes, the captain Graham Clarke has led Interwood into contention for the Division two championship in 2006/7. On the pitch top scorer Richard "that goal was" Nice has been commanding from the top of the pitch displaying both goal scoring and goal creating potential with 14 assists to date. Interwood have pioneered a new technique in training whereby the squad are not picked until the Wednesday before the game, shunning traditional training methods and practice sessions in favour of Saturday sessions in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watford.html" title="Watford">Watford</a> town centre. Interwood have learnt their football on the park, playing from the heart and at times have suffered.</p>

<p>After a heated a tense start to the 2006/7 season, Gareth Mannall sensationally quit having been left on the bench in a tense game against AFC Seniors. being made to run the line throughout the game whilst young manager Ben Wynes brought on a new squad member Mac McHugh, Mannall was heard to say "...you're taking the p**s". The afternoon passed and result sunk in, but the following morning a series of emails between Gareth and his team mates was to lead to the retirement of journeyman Mannall. What follows is an abridged transcript of the email exchange that would lead to Gareth's last major involvement with Interwood FC.</p>
<p>19/09/2006 <b>Sent by Gareth:</b> I've quit.</p>
<p>Gareth <i><br /></i> <b>Sent by Mike Gilder:</b><br />
<i>Why Quit?</i><br />
<b>Sent by Gareth:</b> <i>I did not a game last week. I was not brought on to the pitch when the person who was playing my position (left midfield) was taken off with an injury, rather a new (untested) player, was brought on. To make matters worse I was not brought on when a member of the squad was struggling and communicated this. In my mind it doesn't seem worthwhile committing to something where my commitment to the cause (i.e turning up every week) is not rewarded and where any new players coming in to the team get priority over me. I appreciate I may not be the best player in the team, but unlike other members I will always be there; one person can make a lot of difference once team number dwindle. I am going to miss playing, but I will not miss the frustration that has been associated with it.</i></p>
<p>All the best for the season, Gareth<i><br /></i></p>
<p><b>Sent by Joe Reeves:</b><br />
<i>With Ben Wynes management skills under mounting pressure with it being rumoured after last weeks collapse that he only two games to save his job, and the wood 3-1 up he didn't bring on utility man Gareth Mannall and instead brought on new signing Mac to bolster the defence in the last 15 minutes.</i></p>
<p>With Inter picking up 3 points Ben's hard nose decision appears to vindicated but with Gareth quitting will in come back to haunt them later in the season?</p>
<p>Interwood's management board is fully supporting the managers decision but is also lining up Mark Ward to try and talk Gareth round, maybe over a nice quiet drink.<i><br /></i></p>
<p><b>Sent by Mark Ward:</b><br />
<i>After years of wild rumours that Mannall and Ward have a special thing together Ward comes out and states 'there is nothing going on between us and never has been, he is an annoying little $hit who I will be happy to see the back of, he doesn't have a footballing mind and I cant understand why the club want to hold talks with him to get him back on side. I for one will be happy if he makes shock transfer to Interwoods arch rivals Jarman Park at least then I can Kick the cr@p out of him and have a good reason to have done so, other than the fact his middle name is Thrush</i><br /></p>
<p><b>Sent by Ben Wynes:</b><br />
<i>I have told the players and now I'll tell the press I make the decisions I feel are right at the time - The first game of the season saw Me bring on both Gareth Mammall and Simon Loader ...... Simon passed a late fitness test this week having been down with a cold the previous week and saw him in the starting line up this week.</i></p>
<p>I think my decision to bring on Mac was the correct decision and his strength and determination in at the back helped to solidify the defence at a time when I wanted to secure the victory.... I have no regrets at Gareth deciding to end his career at Interwood - if he is not a squad player then I don't want him.</p>
<p>With new players joining us I will take the decision to try out the new players when I can!<i><br /></i> Sent by Rob Cassidy:<b><br /></b> <i>"Don't give up Gareth. It's hard to take when you know you can add something and you have the passion but don't shut the door. Give it a couple of days and you will no doubt rediscover the desire.</i></p>
<p>I have been to the fringe and back again and I am convinced that your efforts are appreciated. If the numbers are low this weekend then I may come back early and play when I'm not 100%. It would be nice to play with some fully fit players like yourself."<i><br /></i></p>
<p><b>Sent by Ben Wynes:</b><br />
<i>Gareth -</i></p>
<p>I do not feel I have to explain my decisions during the match on sunday BUT I will for clarity</p>
<p>Sunday was a very close game - In fact I was not going to make ANY changes at all due to the tightness of the match! When my brother came of 'injured'(lack of fitness more like, LOSER!) I decided that it was time to sure things up at the back!</p>
<p>I know Mac from the days he used to play football with my brother as kids - I also know that he had trials with Watford and played for the county a few times - so even thoughhe is a big lad and doesn't appear tobe too mobile - he has a great understanding of the game and will put the tackles in at the back - which when you are winnning and don't want to conceed is what you want.</p>
<p>I also know that simon said he was struggling with 20 minutes to go - you also refer to that in your emaill, I was NOT repeat NOT going to make any changes at that stage - the team had set into a good rythym and we knew where we were going to be!</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that this is a squad game and if you are not happy being a squad player then you are right you should not play for us, though bear in mind that there will be games when we actually need you to play - either becuase of your strong aerial ability or because I want to bring you on. Need less to say I think you will agree that my decision worked as we won the game on Sunday!</p>
<p>This week we have 3 players out possibley 4 and so this is the time for you to turn up put in the game of your life and show everyone that you SHOULD be included in the starting line up!!!!</p>
<p>Unless you are not a TEAM player.</p>
<p>thank you for your support over the last few seasons it has been greatly appreciated and I think you have grown better as a player, but if this is the parting of ways so be it .</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>In the early hours of 23/10/2006, Mike "chopper" Gilder, Interwood legend and midfield general became a father. The next day the team put aside any shame and welcomed a new squad member.</p>
<p><b>Sent by Mike Gilder:</b><br />
<i>Hi All,</i></p>
<p>I have great pleasure in letting you all know that Joshua Stewart Gilder was born at 05:03 yesterday morning, He weighed 7lbs and is 35 cm long. He has lots of dark brown hair and is a handsome little devil (If I do say so myself!). Both Mum and baby are doing really well, although he is having some trouble feeding (im told this is common to start&#160;!)</p>
<p>He took us by complete surprise as he was breach and we were convinced he would be late. here is rundown of events, it was VERY quick. But please don't panic when reading this as it was still controlled and everyone was brilliant&#160;:</p>
<p>12:30am - Alex finally work me up from a deep sleep to let me know her waters had broken. 12:40am - My brain finally turned on and I said "****" and called the Hospital. As he was thought to be breach we were told to go in straight away. 1:10am - The midwives inspected Alex's belly and had trouble deciding if the baby was still breach. They then did a scan and couldn't find the head&#160;!!!, They then realised the head was 'engaged' and pretty far down. We were then advised to go home and come back when the contractions started and were a few mins apart. 2:30am got home, went to bed 2:45am - Alex started to have 'BIG' contractions&#160;! 3:00am - Contractions 'BIG' and two mins apart&#160;!!!!, I called the delivery suite to say we were coming back&#160;! 3:04am - Alex had the urge to push&#160;!!, I went '****' and called an ambulance. 03:25am - Ambulance arrived, and gave alex gas and air 03:45 - Ambulance men decided to take alex to hospital as we could not wait for the midwife to turn up 04:00 - Got taken to delivery suite in the hospital, Alex was inspected and the midwife (Jane Speed, who was Brilliant) found that she was 10cm dilated and told her to 'PUSH AWAY' (with the contractions) 05:03 - Joshua shot out&#160;!!</p>
<p>Im rushing back to the hospital now, so will send pics later. Please pass this on to anyone I may have missed.</p>
<p>Take care and see all soon.</p>
<p>Mike, Alex and Joshua xx</p>
