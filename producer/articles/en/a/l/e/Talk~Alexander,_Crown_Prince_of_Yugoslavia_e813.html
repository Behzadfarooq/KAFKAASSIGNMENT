<p>Please I live in Serbia so I can tell you that he is recognized here. Of course he is not recognised in other countries. If you wanna talk like that than Yugoslavia doesnot recognise him either, because he visited Yugoslavia maybe once or twice before it changed it`s name and he never visited Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now he lives in Serbia. He is not recognized as king but only as Crown Prince. <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_c557.html" title="User:Avala">Avala</a> 13:55, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not so much a question of who "recognizes" him, as it is a question of how titles <i>work</i> - or perhaps better put, it's athe fact that he <i>once</i> was recognized as Crown Prince of Yugoslavia but has <i>never</i> been recognized as anything of Serbia. His father was king of Yugoslavia, and he was crown prince of Yugoslavia. Then his father was deposed. Deposed kings and their children in general retain their titles - even after the state they once ruled changes its form of government or even ceases to exist. What they don't get to do is change those titles if the nation's name changes. Aspirants to the titles of deposed rulers don't change the title: no one ever claimed they were Emperor of the U.S.S.R: they were claimants to the throne of Russia. The members of the Hanover dynasty that purport to carry the title of "Prince of Great Britain and Ireland" did not get to change their titles when that nation became the "Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland". Crown Prince Alexander is trying a sort of "sleight of hand" in which he retains the title "Crown Prince Alexander" but changes the "of Yugoslavia" to "of Serbia": but that then becomes a "title of pretense" rather than one he actually holds. According to his website, his claim is that he is King of Serbia, but he uses a more "modest" title. But in the real world, he gets to change the title if he <i>becomes</i> king, because then he will be an actual <i>fount of honour</i>, or when he gets an new title from the government. the choice is pretty much use his name or use his (unchanged) title. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 16:13, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason seems to be that a "lone rider" (person either ignorant of naming standards or wanting to establish own standard) opened this article, and no one has changed it. Of course, in current naming standard, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander%2C_Crown_Prince_of_Yugoslavia_1fa4.html" title="Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia">Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia</a> is more correct. (However it differs so little from what is now in use here that apparently no one has bothered to make the change). There evidently have been "bigger" attempts to change this article's heading, to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Prince_Alexander_of_Serbia_cdfa.html" title="Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia">Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia</a> which of course is very untenable - perhaps the good editors here are drained of energy because of battling such attempts. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 7 July 2005 12:45 (UTC)</p>

<p>From Alexander's website it seems that he is proud of his ancestry from medieval Balkan kings. Through his own family Karageorgevich, he apparently has no such royal descent, but he has that through the royal houses of Europe, which his mother and paternal grandmother belonged to. This means that almost all royals of Europe have similar Serbian ancestry...</p>

<p>Aleksandar Karađorđević is a private citizen, and has been almost since the day he was born. His entire public life occured when he was a private citizen, as no country that he could be a prince or king of has had royalty for 60 years. What's more, the country that he was a prince of explicitly abolished all nobility titles those same 60 years ago. Of all successor countries, only in Serbia does he have any support for his claims to the title, and even there his use of the title remains controversial and many if not most writers refuse to use it. It's certainly not used by anyone in Slovenia, Croatia or Macedonia, nor among Bosniaks, Montenegrins or Kosovo Albanians. He is often called "the heir to the throne of Yugoslavia" there, but not a prince.</p>
<p>I know that people will say that he still <i>is</i> the Crown Prince of Yugoslavia, according to nobility and genealogy conventions. But Wikipedia's naming convention is driven by common usage and NPOV, not by "correctness". The most common name used to refer to Aleksandar Karađorđević is "Aleksandar Karađorđević", and calling him crown prince of anything, especially of Yugoslavia (which by any definition includes terriories where governments and populations are entirely hostile to his use of the title) is hardly NPOV. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 03:45, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I went and moved pages according to the naming conventions, which means that Prince Alexander from the 19th century is at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Kara%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87%2C_Prince_of_Serbia_7e05.html" title="Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia">Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia</a>, and Aleksandar Karađorđević is at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandar_Kara%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87_7432.html" title="Aleksandar Karađorđević">Aleksandar Karađorđević</a>. I also fixed the links and caught some bad ones, if anybody finds any more, please correct.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The next question is what should be done about his wife and children? What's the justification for calling them princes and princesses of Yugoslavia? Are they notable in any way? They certainly are not in any line of succesion to the trone of Yugoslavia, as neither such country, such throne, or such line of succession exists. Should any useful info be merged here? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 04:36, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Articles about his immediate family should be merged here. They really have no notability outside of the scope of being related to a pretender, so it would be fine to just merge their names and basic background to this article. E.g. a child of a famous writer or a politician does not "inherit" notability. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 04:40, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've moved the article back... he's not a Crown Prince, so why call him one? The country he's allegedly a crown prince of, doesn't have a monarchy anymore.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Firstly, the move was done without following proper procedure. Secondly it is standard for someone who was the legal heir to the throne at the moment of birth to be referred to as such in articles and article titles. Deposed monarchs are also named as monarch for their lifetime. It is a standard biographical approach. Their title is however a courtesy title not a constitutional one and titles like 'king', 'queen', 'crown prince' etc disappear at the death of the last office holder. If Alexander had been born after the abolition of the monarchy then he would be referred to either by personal name or as prince, depending on common usage, not <i>crown prince</i> as he had never been such when such a post existed. But as he was born crown prince it is normal biographical standard to refer to him as such. In addition he is not referred to as <i>Aleksandar</i> in English usage. The proposed move runs against naming conventions precedent, common name usage, standard biographical references, etc and is opposed on that basis. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Legally it did. It is not WP's job to go by POV judgments on what <i>really</i> existed or not, just to go by constitutional law and constitutionally the monarchy was not abolished until later that year.

<dd>Whatever gave you that idea? Pages are moved when needed by whoever sees fit to do so, and any kind of process is involved only when a move is disputed.

<p>Zocky's right, the principle method of decisionmaking should be discussion, and voting used only as a last resort. Since the discussion is ongoing, I don't see a need to resort to a vote. As for the name issue--princehood is not a mere fact of genealogy; that's why countries with monarchies have specialized scholars who determine succession, and successors <i>aren't</i> successors until identified as such. This person's descent is a no doubt interesting thing to mention in their article, but there is no throne to which they succeed, no King of Serbia whose reign he can follow, and no authority under which is claim is verified. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 16:47, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should note that generally people should try to discuss this before moving and/or putting on WP:RM, otherwise it makes WP:RM rather unmaintainable, and usually results in voting which may not achieve what you want.

<p>After thoroughly rereading this article, I've found out that there are about 4 or 5 encyclopedic sentences about him in the article. The rest is repetitive enumeration of irrelevant factoids. While these could be OK in the "Trivia" section, we need much more information about mr. Karađorđević if we want to have a useful article about him. The info merged from the articles on his family may help somewhat, but it will again mostly boost the "Trivia" section. We could check if there is any info about him in other related articles (Yugoslavia, Serbia, his predecessors, etc.) that should really be moved here. Some info about anything interesting happening to him would also be very useful. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 17:04, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jtdirl called my edit POV, so I just wanted to figure out why. Here is what I changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>He is the son of Peter II, the last king of Yugoslavia, who was from the Karadjordjevic dynasty.</i> to</li>
<li><i>He is the son of Peter II, the last king of Yugoslavia of Karađorđević dynasty.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>because it reads better (imho).</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Alexander is styled Crown Prince of Serbia by royalists and some media because when he was born his father was still legally on the throne, albeit in exile, but it is a courtesy title, not a constitutional office, given Serbia is today a republic.</i> etc. to</li>
<li><i>Karađorđević is styled Crown Prince of Serbia by Serbian royalists. Since Yugoslavia became a republic on November 29, 1945, he has no constitutional status. At the time of his birth, the royal government had been in exile for several years, and had no de facto power in Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, which was proclaimed in August of 1945.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>because I doubt any e.g. Croatian royalists would call him Crown Prince. Also, if media calls him that, they are probably sympathetic of ex Yugoslav Monarchy. Furthermore, I tried to explain why not everybody calls him that - he never really held the throne and never had an opportunity to do so. I also tried to rewrite it so there are no redundant sentences. How many ways are there to say that he in fact isn't a monarch and that he has no throne? "My version" explains the historical circumstances on why he never became a king.</p>

<p>There seems to be a deep misconception that the former king Petar Karađorđević and his descendants "kept their titles". The throne of Yugoslavia was given to the Karađorđević dinasty by the Belgrade agreement in December 1918. In November 1945, Yugoslavia became a republic, officially deposed the Karađorđević dinasty and abolished nobility titles of all kinds. At that moment, Karađorđevićes stopped being kings, queens, princes, princesses of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was full legal heir of pre-WWI kingdom of Serbia, so these titles could not have somehow existed in paralel as a continued government in exile of an occupied country. To recap, they were granted some titles, which were later legally revoked.</p>
<p>But let's step back for a moment and ask why would we mention a person's title in the name of the article at all. The only valid reasons I see are identification and disambiguation. In both cases, great care should be taken to keep the title NPOV. POV disambiguation is no better than POV content.</p>
<p>In the world outside the narrow field of pretentious social occasions, tabloid press and aristocracy fandom, hereditary titles of people who hold no public office associated with that title are usually completely irrelevant, pure trivia. OTOH, when the use of these titles is politically controversial, they become real encyclopedic material which needs to be described properly.</p>
<p>As I see it, we are faced with a proposition that biographies of all persons in the world whose ancestors include nobles or royals should conform to a naming convention constructed to suit the British peerage system and royal houses of northern Europe, regardless of the legal status of the person considered, local customs and conventions, common usage, or political implications. That sounds ludicrous to me. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 04:40, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From what I have read, on this page and elsewhere, both what title exactly he was born under and what title he uses now are somewhat unclear. We have debate above on what exact title he was qualified to at birth, based on the legal status of the monarchy at the time. I don't pretend to be any kind of expert or even to fully understand the arguments, and so I don't take a position on it. Nor should Wikipedia, I think. As for the title he uses now, isn't it "of Serbia" that he claims to be a prince? Again, I take no position on whether he is right in using that description, nor should Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 20:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deb, I'm sorry, I really don't follow that argument. As repeatedly pointed out, the title that was granted to him by a country when he was born, was abolished by the same country that granted it after a few months of his life. There are no princes of Yugoslavia or Serbia, so he can not possibly be one. He does not have a title, he just claims that he does. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 14:35, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In all countries. The man who would be King of Italy if Italy ever re-established the monarchy, for example, is generally called the Prince of Naples, the title he held at the point of the abolition of the monarchy. Naming tradition indeed allows descendants of monarchs to maintain usage of titles even if the monarchy and titles were abolished. France abolished royal titles over a century ago, yet everyone, including successive Presidents of the Republic, call the head of the French Royal House the Comte de Paris. The claimant to the Portuguese throne, <a href="../../../d/u/a/Duarte_Pio%2C_Duke_of_Braganza_7b1c.html" title="Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza">Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza</a> is not merely widely accepted by that title. His wedding as head of the Portuguese Royal House was attended by the Portuguese President of the Republic and the Prime Minister. The idea that a state's abolition of titles means that members of exiled royal families can't use them and are not referred to using them is demonstrably wrong. Even the leaders of republics regularly use such titles when referring to members of their former royal families.</p>
<p>Only in a small minority of cases do republics make formal issue of such titles and even there their opposition is universally ignored by other states (both monarchies and republics) who view such attitudes as unacceptable behaviour. Alexander is not referred to in US government dispatches by surname, for example, but by title. When some years ago the Greek Government complained that the government of the Republic of Ireland referred to the exiled Greek monarch "King Constantine II" the Irish Government told the Greeks in no uncertain terms to bog off. They said that it was standard international procedure to refer to deposed monarchs who had not abdicated by means of monarchical title and that they would continue to follow to do so whether the Greek government liked it or not. (The basic message to the Greeks was "grow up and stop acting the ass".) The US Government did likewise. When the last Austrian Empress, <a href="../../../z/i/t/Zita_of_Bourbon-Parma_65cc.html" title="Zita of Bourbon-Parma">Zita of Bourbon-Parma</a> died in 1989, the Vatican and offered its sympathy to her son and head of the Austrian Royal House, "Your Imperial and Royal Highness, Prince Otto". The Austrian and Hungarian republics had no problem with it. Indeed they were represented at the funeral of their late empress and queen respectively. And Chancellor Helmut Kohl addressed the head of the German Royal House as "Your Royal Highness" and used his title when they met in the 1980s.</p>
<p>International rules on the titles used by exiled royalty are quite clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>deposed monarchs, their spouses, heirs and others, unless they abdicated, are referred to by the title they held during their monarchy's existence;</li>
<li>while titles like 'king', 'queen' and 'crown prince' are not inherited after a monarchy's abolition and die with them;</li>
<li>titles like 'prince' and 'princess' continue to be inherited as courtesy titles;</li>
<li>styles are often used as a matter of politeness;</li>
<li>no state has the right to set a mandatory demand that titles and styles cannot be used. States that try are universally told by other states "We are not getting involved in your squabble with your ex-royal family. We will continue to follow precedent and use the traditional titles and styles." <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:25, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>We seem to have a misunderstanding here. The page was moved based on the premise that this article <i>should not</i> conform to the naming convention for royals, since Aleksandar Karđorđević is not a royal. As I see it, the arguments for the page remaining at the princely name are based on explaining what the naming convention says, not on whether it should apply in this case.</p>

<p>Serbia isn't a monarchy and hasn't been in its current post Yugoslavia form. We cannot <i>give</i> Alexander a title of crown prince to a non-existent monarchy. All we can do is use the title he was born with, which is the standard naming protocol method of naming pretenders to thrones. It was a crown prince of Yugoslavia that Alexander was born, and so that is all we can call him. He would only get a different title if he held a new constitutional office.<a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So the abolishment of aristocratic titles, which many republics have done, is null and void and the fact that some countries continue to use them is enough to claim that they can never be abolished. Curious reasoning.</dd>
<dd>I would also point out the case of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_von_Habsburg_a3eb.html" title="Otto von Habsburg">Otto von Habsburg</a>, where we specifically state that his name in Austria (where "von" in surnames was abolished, along with aristocracy) is <i>not</i> von Habsburg, and we certainly don't keep the article at Otto, Archduke of Austria. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 15:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh please. Stop misrespresenting facts. The reason we don't have Otto at his old title is because he renounced it and served as an MEP. Try researching the topic of how royal titles are constructed and used internationally. It is getting tedious having constantly to correct elementary misunderstandings. The whole issue of title usage is written about extensively in thousands of books and had been debated in depth on Wikipedia and a policy agreed.

<p>In Wikipedia, of living persons we use name with which that person is best known as, and/or from which the person's prominence (so that there is an encyclopedia article) comes from. That's reason why some people are here, for example, under their <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen_name.html" title="Pen name">pen names</a>, not their legal names. Sometimes somebody is prominent with two names, or in some other way there is a conflict of two names. We also must maintain NPOV. Otto von Habsburg has himself, although not perhaps fully renounced, at least taken the name <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_von_Habsburg_a3eb.html" title="Otto von Habsburg">Otto von Habsburg</a>, under which he is a prominent person: a former MEP and other things. It is fully NPOV to use that name of him, and people here have long ago got research results that he is much less known as archduke. That's that. Same, for now, with a certain <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simeon_Sakskoburggotski_6a56.html" title="Simeon Sakskoburggotski">Simeon Sakskoburggotski</a>, as he has himself taken such name into his use. But Alexander is actually prominent as (1) a current claimant to some throne; and (2) a former crown prince of Yugoslavia, a constitutional title he held when that monarchy was abolished. Both reasons lead us to use pretender naming. And it is easily a source of POV to use something for or against his monarchical pretension, therefore we have convention that pretenders are under the name of their title at the moment the monarchy was abolished. As that method has been used for two centuries by diplomats, works of reference, etc, we have decided we bielieve it to be the least POV of all the bad alternatives. Alexander also is mostly known as crown prince and wants himself to be known with that title (although I would not want to say of which precise territory as it would again possibly lead us to POV problems). Also those considerations lead us to use that "title at the moment of abilition" naming. We will certainly not change him to crown prince of Serbia, because he has never held that constitutional office. Remember that Alexander himself has not taken any other name than "crown princely title", and in that respect he differs decisively from Otto and Simeon. Just be satisfied that the result of our convention is not worse one in view of your own POV to the matter. If we deviate from the said convention, to either of the directions, always there will be yet unhappier people. <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObRoy_0a03.html" title="User:ObRoy">ObRoy</a> 07:54, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can understand. For someone who probably spoke a lot of English or French, learning a language like Serbian (or Russian, Greek, Japanese, or any type of language with distinctly non-English words) would be difficult. I speak English, and I'm currently learning French. Any French person would know immediatly that I was an American just by my accent alone. I think over time he will learn the language, especially if the county is having monarchial leanings, and I believe all three of his sons are currently studying Serbian. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorhange_6c2c.html" title="User:Morhange">Morhange</a> 15:10, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Since the end of Yugoslavia, he has desired the throne of Serbia, and it seems thus that he currently is Claimant of Serbia, see also his website. That is a fact, and therefire it can and should be explained in the text of the article. He should not be given any title here on basis of that claim, but the claim should be explained. So, it seems to be wrong to state that he yet is "pretender of Yugoslavia" of "claimant to thr Yugoslavian throne".

<dd>I agree, the article should be moved to 'Prince Alexander of Serbia' or 'Alexander, Crown Prince of Serbia'.
