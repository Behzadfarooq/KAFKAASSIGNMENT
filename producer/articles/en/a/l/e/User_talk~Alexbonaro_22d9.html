<p>Mr. Bonaro,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I recently rewrote the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Mafia_850f.html" title="Los Angeles Mafia">Los Angeles Mafia</a> and I was curious what your opinion was on the subject. Unfortunatly, I don't have as many up to date resources as I'd like although I was able to reformat the page a bit. I'd certainly appreciate any help you could offer. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 10:12, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know very little about the Los Angeles Mafia. I have charts on the current hierarchy/constituancy of the LA family (see: <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbonaro_LA_Chart_and_info_9baa.html" title="User:Alexbonaro/LA Chart and info">LA Chart and Information</a>) and I have a small chart of the LA family hierarchy during 1984 (see: <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbonaro_1984_L.A._crime_family_hierarchy_d518.html" title="User:Alexbonaro/1984 L.A. crime family hierarchy">1984 LA crime family hierarchy</a>). I keep these charts, which people submit to online mafia forums, for cross referencing and future use. Despite their flaws of layout, biased opinions and that they are hard to understand, the core information in them is pretty solid. Give me one week and i shall have you information to work with (hopefully including: timeline, current day situation, indictments/convictions, members, etc. etc.) Hopefully we'll be able to make this article fuller than it is now.</dd>
<dd>Correspond with you soon,</dd>

<p>Alex, I don't know how you do it, but your rundown of organized crime in St. Louis is absolutely unbelievable. Many thanks.</p>
<p>Do you have any info on what's left of the Syrian-Lebanese faction in St. Louis? Sincerely, Jim Palmer PalmBey@sbcglobal.net</p>

<dd>Mr. Palmer,
<dl>
<dd>you shouldn't be thanking me. Any and all of the charts on my user page were created by others. I merely use them for cross referencing my work. I'm guessing you read the following charts:</dd>

<p>As you can see on my User Page I attributed the last two to Salviardi, a poster on the RealDeal forum, the first one is unatributed only because I forgot to do so at the time and can't remember who posted it. As for the Syrian-Lebanese faction, i can surely find out for you or you can join the forum where I get my information. It is called RealDeal and it is entirely about discussion on Organized Crime, specifically the American Mafia. It is far far more active than the AmericanMafia.com forum and also the hollywoodmafia.com forum.

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>what's your point. Are you wondering why Ferrante isn't on the chart? The only article in which they were both mentioned, which is what i assume you were referring to, was from 2003.

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>Let me start off by saying that I've obtained alot of information from your Family charts such as Rochester, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, keep up the good work. Oh ya, it was great to finally find some one who knew that when it came to the Rochester Family, Rene Piccarreto was Frank Valenti's Underboss and Sam Russotti was his Consigliere. You know as well as I do that when it comes to the Chicago Outfit Area Bosses, Street Bosses, Capos, Lt.'s, soldiers or what ever, it's always easy to get mixed up, well I have anyways. I've never really concentrated on Chicago, I'm more of an East coast follower, but I haven't neglected the Outfit, so I need some help with some info.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna hit on a few points, then you can respond if you want to. Lets start with Anthony Zizzo, first off my research now has law enforcement mislabeling him as Underboss, since the "Family Secrets Case" revealed DiFronzo as Boss, Marcello as Underboss and Lombardo as Consigliere, which in Chicago might mean Boss, who knows? Zizzo was a Lt. under Sam Carlisi on the Southside, Chinatown/26th St. Crew, but I also find information that he's part of the Westside, Cicero/Melrose Park Crew, which one is it? Now I know for a fact the first Boss of the Chinatown crew was Bruno Roti until his death in 1957, then Frank "Skids" Caruso Sr. tookover.</p>
<p>Also you call James "Jimmy the Bomber" Catuara, Cantura, but I fixed that for you. Now I find Vincent Solano as Boss of the Rush St. Crew/Northside crew as well until he died in 1992, but you have Joe "The Builder" Andriacchi as his successor. I know Andriacchi became Northside Area Boss in 1992, but he was Street Boss of Jackie Cerone's Elmwood Park Crew with John DiFronzo when Cerone went to jail in 1986, so was Andriacchi under Solano or Cerone and DiFronzo before 1992. On that dam IPSN, labor shit website they have an article on John "Johnny Apes" Monteleone that states Mark D'Amico was the Rush St. Crew Boss until 1994 when he was jailed, I think you've got him under the Cicero Crew, I can't remember, but what do you say? Check out the article - <a href="http://www.ipsn.org/apes.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ipsn.org/apes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipsn.org/apes.html</a></p>
<p>I recently read that the Chicago heights crew was made part of the Chinatown/26th St. Crew to form the Southside Crew in 1990 when Albert "Caesar" Tocco was jailed, not in 1994, which is it, do you know? By the way I don't think you mention the Rush St. or 26th St. Crews, but anyway if you really wanna get mixed up check out these blogs and get back to me, you'll see alot to debate about!</p>
<p>Make sure you scroll down the whole page because there's info on the Chicago crews on the one and it's kinda long, but the other one lists the successions like you, check them out and see what you think!</p>

<hr />
<p>Little Joe, I did not create the chart and honestly I know very little about anything in it. It was posted here so that other researchers on Wikipedia can use it as a reference. However, your questions were important and so ofcourse I had them answered by the creator and also by the author of the webpages you linked to, respectively known to me as Pogo the Clown and Little Al.</p>
<p><b>Here is the answers:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pogo the Clown said:</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Joe "The Builder" Andriacchi took over for Solanos North Side Crew. The Elmwood Park Area/Crew was really under the North Side Crew according to those Fed Charts of the 80s. So anybody who was in the Elmwood Park Crew would be considered part in the overall North Side Crew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have never seen Tony Zizzo listed as part of the West Side Crew. Everything I have on him has him as being part of the South Side.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the Chicago Hieghts Crew goes, it was not merged with the Chinaton Crew until about 1993/94, not 1990 as stated. Remember Jimmy LaPietra remained his own Crew Boss of the Chinatown Crew until his death in 1993. So it woul have had to have been merged after his death. It was around that time this the Crews were merged and Johnny "Apes" Monteleone became the Crew Boss for the South Side.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I did not list Marco D'Amico as part of the Cicero Crew. He was part of the North Side Crew running the Elmwood Park Area/Crew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure Little Al can probably clear this up more than I can as he is much more knowledgable when it comes to the Outfit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pogo"</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Little Al said:</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Well, the guy is referencing some of my links so let me see here. I'll tell you this, these paragraphs run on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anthony Zizzo. I may take some flak here , I have never come across anything besides some television news program transcripts that says he was really the underboss. I think he was a major player in the Cicero crew with the Marcello brothers, which Jimmy being the overall boss of the crew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, I'll say this, the term "underboss" has traditionally been thrown around like it's nothing when it comes to the Chicago mob since the late 1980s. I mean, I've seen street boss Sal DeLaurentis labeled as Cicero crew boss Rocky Infelise's underboss when Sam Carlisi was the boss and DiFronzo was the real underboss, and I've seen Dominic "Toots" Palermo ID'd at the same time as the underboss to Al Tocco. Reporters in Chicago seem to call the second-in-command of any of the crews an underboss for some reason like they're all separate Families. It's weird. That's where I think the Zizzo underboss thing comes from. Saying he's the second-in-command of the Cicero crew or something. I don't know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, after Skids Caruso retired, Angelo "the Hook" LaPietra took over the 26th Street crew as the South Side boss.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Marco D'Amico was the street boss of the Elmwood Park crew for John DiFronzo until his bust in 1994.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When LaPietra went down in 1986, his brother Jimmy took over the 26th Street crew. When he died in 1993, Michael Talarico took over briefly and then Johnny Apes Monteleone took over until his death in 2001 with various street bosses like Joseph "Shorty" LaMantia and Frank "the Breeze" Calabrese doing the day-to-day management. After they went down, I think Monteleone had to get more hands on--not that his hands were ever that far away.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Chicago Heights crew took some major hits around the time Tocco went down, and then Dominic "Toots" Palermo took it over, but it was basically (I think) a little too f*cked up to continue on--from what I've read--un to 1994, but some reports say it did so who knows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All those crews still operate its just they're under a regional boss or whatever you want to call it. There are territories--Chicago is chopped up into three territories--and then the crews that comprise each territory, and then each crew has splinter crews or sub-crews (mostly the splinter crews specialize in certain things like gambing and stuff).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just my opinions on it.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I don't think there's that much to debate about--certainly not "a lot"--between mine and Pogo's two charts. He obviously went back in time a hell of a lot farther than I did. Other than that, there may be a few differences here and there but nothing major between his and mine. I was strictly going off memory when I did mine anyway so I have no years and stuff.</dd>

<dd>This was a good quote. The guy's right, it's easy to get them mixed up and we all do. There are some made guys/associates who are "floaters" and associate with several crews on a regular basis because I have seen some guys labeled as part of this crew or that crew depending on what way a report, article, indictment, appeal, etc., is pointing towards. So that makes it confusing sometimes and some guys I think are just everywhere."</dd>

That was great guys, I really appreciate that , like I said, being from the East coast it's easy to follow the New York Families, but Chicago will always be one of the major powers, so if I want to follow the mob, I have to follow the Outfit, and it's justly named because I've never considered it a traditional Family and that's one of the reasons they're still strong. Little Al makes complete sense and I think he's right on the money with the whole "underboss" label, but I think it's safe to say the general consensus with every one is that DiFronzo, Lombardo, Andriacchi and Marcello are the top guys in the Outfit and most likely before Lombardo and Marcello's arrests were consulting and defering to eachother on the major decisions. Thanks guys, keep up the good work because with guys like you, questions don't get answered and you can only learn from other people . Little Joe Shots 01:30, November 25, 2006.</p>

<p>I've thaught about joining one of the mafia forums, but wasn't sure which one was worth joining. If the forum you mentioned carries that kind of info, it will be worth it, so I'm leaning towards doing that, thanks. I think it wil be worth it since I'm gonna write a book on the East coast Families as soon as I'm done with the screenplay I'm working on. I have a private library of over 200 books on the mob and it's constantly growing. I just ordered the books, Crime Boss Killings:The Castellammarese War, Motor City Mafia, Gangster City:The N.Y. Underworld 1900-35 and When the Mob ran Las Vegas, but it's always good to have other people who know their stuff as resources and are willing to share it.</p>

<p>You've definately sold me on the forum, thank you. I'm going away to the States on business tonight, but when I return I'll join. I'm very interested in hearing from the members who allege mob ties, that should be interesting since I have my own history with Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal Family members, as well as the Outlaws in Ontario. Most of my direct dealings with the Buffalo Family were through business dealings with a Lt. and associates of the Family's Niagara Falls, Ontario, representative, Carmen Barillaro until he was murdered by the Calabrian Musitano Clan in 1997.</p>

<p>I'd rather just communicate via wikipedia. So what is up? I don't think I can be much help to you regarding internet scams because I just created the template. I don't really know anything about them. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemember_d145.html" title="User:Remember">Remember</a> 14:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
