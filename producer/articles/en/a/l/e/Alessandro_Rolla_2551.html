Alessandro Rolla, Milan, circa 1820.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Alessandro Rolla</b> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a> - <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>) is one of those examples of a today neglected musician who nevertheless was widely acknowledged in his time as a <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a> and, especially, <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola.html" title="Viola">viola</a> <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuoso.html" title="Virtuoso">virtuoso</a>, composer and teacher and whose contribution to technique, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repertoire.html" title="Repertoire">repertoire</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_music.html" title="History of music">history of music</a> is greatly underestimated.</p>
<p>Still unknown to the majority of musicians and concert-goers, if remembered, it’s always due to his fame as “teacher of the great <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganini.html" title="Paganini">Paganini</a>”, yet his role was very important in the development of violin and viola technique. Some of the technical innovations that Paganini later used largely, such as left-hand pizzicato, chromatic ascending and descending scales, the use of very high positions on violin and viola, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octave.html" title="Octave">octave</a> passages, were first introduced by Rolla.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alessandro_Rolla_2551.html" title="Edit section: Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>
<p>Rolla was born in <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavia.html" title="Pavia">Pavia</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a> and after his initial studies he moved to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a> where, from <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770.html" title="1770">1770</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/7/1778.html" title="1778">1778</a>, he studied with Gian Andrea Fioroni, Maestro di Cappella at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Cathedral_e2e9.html" title="Milan Cathedral">Milan Cathedral</a>, who was the most important musician in Milan after <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Battista_Sammartini_e818.html" title="Giovanni Battista Sammartini">G. B. Sammartini</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Burney_14c8.html" title="Charles Burney">Charles Burney</a>, in his musical tour in Italy, refers to Fioroni to acquire information about the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrosian_Chant_e24e.html" title="Ambrosian Chant">Ambrosian Chant</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a>, at 15, he made his first public appearance as a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soloist.html" title="Soloist">soloist</a> and composer performing “the first <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola_concerto.html" title="Viola concerto">viola concerto</a> ever heard”, as reported by a contemporary writer.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/8/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a> he was appointed principal viola and the leader of the Ducale <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">Orchestra</a> in Parma, playing violin and viola until <a href="../../../1/8/0/1802.html" title="1802">1802</a>. This was the most profitable period of Rolla’s life, his most serene and creative years, in a very stimulating cultural and intellectual atmosphere; he was allowed to travel to conduct and perform as a soloist, became known also abroad and his works were published in Paris and Vienna.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a> he received a visit by the young <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganini.html" title="Paganini">Paganini</a> wishing to study with him and from Paganini’s later letters there is evidence that they remained in contact and even played quartet together. This relationship must have had an influence on Paganini, as far as his love for the viola is concerned, which in his maturity led him to compose works of great interest for the instrument, such as the concert piece <i>Sonata per la Grand Viola e Orchestra</i>, the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serenata.html" title="Serenata">Serenata</a> and Terzetto <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concertante.html" title="Concertante">concertante</a>, besides the <i>Quartet n.15</i> for <i>Viola Concertante</i>, violin, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello.html" title="Cello">cello</a>.</p>
<p>After the death of the Duke of Parma, in 1802 Rolla was offered a position as leader and orchestra director of the <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Scala_7531.html" title="La Scala">La Scala</a> Orchestra in Milan. Here the new governors, the French and later the Austrians, wanted to create the most important orchestra of Italy and therefore hired the best virtuosos of the time. Among his students during this period were <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesare_Pugni_699c.html" title="Cesare Pugni">Cesare Pugni</a>, the prolific composer of ballet music, whom he taught the violin. Rolla would conduct many of Pugni's operas for La Scala, among them <i>Il Disertore Svizzero</i> (1831) and <i>La Vendetta</i> (1832).</p>
<p>At La Scala Rolla remained until <a href="../../../1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>. There he conducted the first Milanese performances of <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart.html" title="Mozart">Mozart</a>’s <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Giovanni_6847.html" title="Don Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/o/s/Cos%C3%AC_fan_tutte.html" title="Così fan tutte">Così fan tutte</a></i>, <i>Clemenza di Tito</i> and <i><a href="../../../n/o/z/Nozze_di_Figaro_54ec.html" title="Nozze di Figaro">Nozze di Figaro</a></i> and <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>’s first Symphonies. During this period he also conducted about eighteen operas of the then most loved opera composer, <a href="../../../g/i/o/Gioacchino_Rossini_3bf9.html" title="Gioacchino Rossini">Gioacchino Rossini</a>, as well as operas by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donizetti.html" title="Donizetti">Donizetti</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellini.html" title="Bellini">Bellini</a>, whom he got to know personally.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a> he was also director of a Cultural Society where musicians used to perform chamber music works by <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haydn.html" title="Haydn">Haydn</a>, Mozart and Beethoven, among others. In <a href="../../../1/8/1/1813.html" title="1813">1813</a> at this Cultural Society he gave private performances of Beethoven’s Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. He also used to be in the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> drawing rooms, meeting artists and poets, playing for them and dedicating them several compositions.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/0/1808.html" title="1808">1808</a> the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatoire.html" title="Conservatoire">Conservatoire</a> of Music in Milan was inaugurated and Rolla was appointed professor of violin and viola. In this capacity he composed many didactical works for his own pupils, graded in difficulty, many of which were published by the newly established publishing house Ricordi. Several of these <i>esercizi</i> are composed with progressive technical difficulties and in all <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_%28music%29.html" title="Key (music)">keys</a>.</p>
<p>It is also curious to note that Rolla was a member of the adjudicating commission that rejected another famous Parmesan, <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Verdi_b105.html" title="Giuseppe Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, at the entry examination in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatoire.html" title="Conservatoire">Conservatoire</a> of the city, although he was the only one who expressed a favourable judgement about the young student.</p>
<p>Although involved in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conducting.html" title="Conducting">conducting</a> in a period when in Italy opera was dominating over <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrumental_music.html" title="Instrumental music">instrumental music</a>, Rolla continued to compose, maintaining the Italian instrumental tradition high. He wrote about 500 works, from didactical compositions to <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonatas.html" title="Sonatas">sonatas</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartets.html" title="Quartets">quartets</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonies.html" title="Symphonies">symphonies</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concertos.html" title="Concertos">concertos</a> for violin, not less than 13 concertos and other works for viola and orchestra. Significant was his contribution to the diffusion of Beethoven’s works in Italy and his familiarity with Beethoven and other <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viennese.html" title="Viennese">Viennese</a> composers is shown in his compositions. He continued to compose and play <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_music.html" title="Chamber music">chamber music</a> until few months before his death at 84.</p>
<p>His works and performances as a violin and viola player and conductor at La Scala were often reviewed and appreciated in the Leipziger Zeitung.</p>
<p>As an example of his fame in Italy and abroad, it’s worth noting that during his lifetime his compositions were published by publishers such as Le Duc and Imbault in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, Artaria in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breitkopf_%26_Hartel_74d9.html" title="Breitkopf &amp; Hartel">Breitkopf &amp; Hartel</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Monzani &amp; Hill in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9.html" title="André">André</a> in <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offenbach.html" title="Offenbach">Offenbach</a>, Ricordi in Milan from <a href="../../../1/8/0/1809.html" title="1809">1809</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>All this information about Rolla’s life and multifarious musical activity is very helpful to us to interpret his work. We can see he was a musician of European vision, an innovator in his own field who was also able to learn from the best of his contemporaries. Also being so deeply immersed in opera environment undoubtedly had an influence on his style as a composer. He often used <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28music%29.html" title="Theme (music)">themes</a> from operas for his <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variations.html" title="Variations">variations</a>.</p>
<p>Because of technical innovations introduced, his output is particularly important for the development of violin and, especially, viola technique.</p>
<p>His style varies from the very melodic phrases, typically operatic in character, rich in fiorituras, to the extremely virtuoso writing, the style we are used to identify with Paganini. Ingredients of this technique are an ample use of <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_stops.html" title="Double stops">double stops</a>, fast passages in <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirds.html" title="Thirds">thirds</a> and sixths, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octaves.html" title="Octaves">octaves</a> from the first to the eighth position, very fast ascending and descending diatonic and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chromatic_scale.html" title="Chromatic scale">chromatic scales</a>, flying staccato, left-hand <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizzicato.html" title="Pizzicato">pizzicato</a>. And all this was on the viola, something unheard of! Bertini, a historian of his time, in a dictionary of musicians reported that Rolla was prohibited to play in public because women could not hear him without fainting of being struck by attacks of nerves.</p>
<p>Rolla should deserve a much more important position in violists’ repertoire. His didactical works being conceived especially for the viola are of special interest for students and teachers. They are often conceived in form of <a href="../../../d/u/o/Duo.html" title="Duo">duo</a>, lending themselves to be used also for chamber music education purposes as well.</p>
<p>Many of his works have been published in modern times and are therefore available.</p>
