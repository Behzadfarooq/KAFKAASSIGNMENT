<p><i>Please, stop editing the Arlington, Washington page. It is my hometown and I want to share the information I have learned to other people. It is the only Wikipedia page that I have sitting on my wathclist. I am just trying to have a fun and cool mini "website", but you keep destroying my page. It is very frustrating to see all of those banner things sitting on my page. It is very distracting and irritating. I am only 13 years old and I want to impress my 7th grade teacher with a page about history (he loves history!). So please, I would be so happy if you just stopped constantly edting my Arlington, Washington page and just keep looking forward for the new and exciting improvements and updates I will be making to the page in the future. Thank you so much!&#160;:)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, this clears things up a little bit. But you must understand that no part of Wikipedia is somebody's "own" page, and Wikipedia is not meant to be a personal website. Now, I will agree to leave the copyedit tag off the page, even though I still think your article needs copyediting. But what concerns me more is that it looks like the text might have been taken directly from the book you cite. Is that true?</dd>
<dd>Thanks for being civil, and for the smiley&#160;:)</dd>

<p><i>THANK YOU SO MUCH! However, I have a little confession. I have borrowed the book from my library and that is how I got my facts. But, since my parents are really good at English speaking (I mean REALLY good!), they sort of helped me type 'word' everything out. (I hate it everytime they correct my English! But at least I'll become good at it!)&#160;:)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's fine if you got your facts from the book, but did you copy directly from the book? You're allowed to use a book as reference, but you must word things differently, otherwise it's <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> and a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">copyright violation</a>. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> 00:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>No, I did not use copyrighted text for the statements used in Arlington, Washington.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Really? Forgive me for saying so, but phrases like "Despite superficial changes, Arlington's old buildings, much like the human soul, have preserved the character and dignity of what once was, and still is 'Our Town'" don't really sound like they were written by a 13-year-old. They really sound like community boosterism from the Chamber of Commerce. And "McLeod named his town after Lord Henry Arlington, a member of the notorious 'Cabal' cabinet of Charles II of England" sounds like it came straight out of a history book. If you didn't use copyrighted text, where did this all come from? --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> 05:00, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Earlyarlington.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alexvincent2_08f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alexvincent2">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<ol>
<li>I removed a picture you uploaded, but only because you didn't put any source or copyright information on it. <i>We are not allowed to have such material in Wikipedia.</i> If I hadn't removed it, someone else would have.</li>
<li>I added a map to the article that used to be in there before you began editing it. I am not sure why you removed it. I think it is useful, so I re-added it.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Doesn't seem disastrous to me&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Also, you never did answer my question about the writing in this article. Where did it come from?</dd>

<dd>Also, why did you get rid of the categories at the very bottom of the page? <i>That</i> is what caused the other editor to add {{uncat}} to this page.

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Rancherslg.jpg. Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Rancherslg.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alexvincent2_08f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alexvincent2">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. If you have any questions please ask them at the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Media copyright questions page</a>.

<p>Hi. I wanted to let you know why I removed some of the material you added to <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mounds_%28candy%29.html" title="Mounds (candy)">Mounds (candy)</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/l/Jolly_Rancher_592e.html" title="Jolly Rancher">Jolly Rancher</a>. The timeline in "jolly rancher" and the history information from the "mounds" article were both copied straight from the Hershey's website. That site is copyrighted, which means that they have to give explicit permission to use the stuff from their site in that way. It's against Wikipedia rules to do that because copyright violations can result in legal problems that we'd like to avoid. You might want to read <a href="../../../c/v/_/WP%7ECV_27f7.html" title="WP:CV">this page</a> to get an idea of how to avoid running up against copyright violations. If you have any questions, let me know. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 00:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>What happened? Why did you change the Arlington page? Nothing was copyrighted material. I am always trying to update it and make it look long and proffesional but you always delete everything.

<dl>
<dd>I changed it because the content was obviously based on copyrighted material, as you've admitted above. It <i>doesn't look professional</i> that way. I am not deleting it because <i>you</i> uploaded it.

<dd><i>First of all, the re-edited paragraph WAS in my own words. I changed some of the wording around and took out some sentences. Plus, I am not violating copyright law because I credited the Arlington Centinial Book at the bottom as a reference. It's not like I am saying it is my own work. I used a reference! And I said so on the bottom of the Alrington page! And, if you are going to delete everysingle thing I put on this stupid Wikipedia page, then can you at least help me?! Put down a long, convincing, detailed history of Arlington instead of just a couple of sentences. That is what I am trying to do by contributing to this website! I am trying to teach people about the city of Arlington, which I live in!!! If you are going to delete everything I put in, then please, please, PLEASE, make the page look long and professional!!! PLEASE! HELP ME!!!!</i>
<dl>
<dd>As I've explained before, merely changing some of the wording around and removing some sentences doesn't make it "your own words"--it's still plagiarism and copyright violation. And it doesn't matter if you credit the copyrighted work--you still can't include such content in Wikipedia. Now, as to why I don't "put down a long, convincing, detailed history of Arlington" myself? Because I don't know enough about the city's history and I don't have the time anyway. <i>You</i> appear to have the time--add as much content as you want, but <i>write it yourself</i> please!
