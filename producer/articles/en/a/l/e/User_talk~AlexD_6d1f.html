<p>Thanks for the cites on the article. I've been plodding along sporadically getting citations for verifiying things in the article, ultimately I'd like to get the whole thing verified. It's nice that when I put a <i>citation needed</i> tag on something it's taken seriously by another user, usually I just get an argument. There seems to be some misconception out there that adding this tag to an edit means that it is disputed somehow, but this not the case, we should really verify everything.

<p>I've just marked Image:Graduationdurham.jpg for deletion because it's licensed under the CC-BY-NC-SA license; unfortunately, this doesn't comply with our <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">image use policy</a> as it's a non-commercial-only license and we can't accept those. You might want to watch out for this in future, to save yourself the hassle of uploading an image only to get it deleted.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 22:33, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately so; any Creative Commons license with the -nc or -nd (non-commercial or no-derivatives) suffixes isn't considered fully free by our image policy. Non-commercial may seem fine, as Wikipedia isn't a commercial project, but we aim to be freely reusable - and prohibiting commercial use can potentially make it legally difficult to produce print editions, or sell CD copies (as happened very successfully with the German edition). Non-derivative works is a little less clearcut, but the rule seems to be that we don't want them - not being able to alter them if need be is just too much of an inconvenience for the limited benefit we'd get from including those images.</dd>
<dd>For future reference, the CC-BY (attribution) and CC-BY-SA (attribution and share-alike) licenses are "free by Wikipedia standards", but not the other CC licenses. It's quite irritating checking for this on flickr - they really could do with displaying the different licenses using different coloured symbols, or something, rather than just a link...</dd>
<dd>To get the images deleted, just remove them from whatever pages they were used in and add {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-noncom_d245.html" title="Template:Db-noncom">db-noncom</a>}} to the image description page. Thanks, and again, apologies for the inconvenience. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 22:49, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Alex. Thanks for your note. I am interested and have the page on my watchlist, but I won't be able to help much for a while.</p>
<p>I am trying to cutback on WP to catch up on some things I've been neglecting in real life. Also, I put most of my WP time working toward a release version, or better version.</p>
<p>But <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Geography_f27a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Geography">Wikipedia:WikiProject Geography</a> has some overlap with that goal, so I'll try to follow up in that area. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 17:21, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>First, thanks for all your work on the Durham University and College pages.</p>
<p>I notice that you've edited several of the Durham college articles replacing the versions of the college arms that were there with versions from the college web pages. My understanding of copyright on arms is that, while the basic design is obviously unchanging, the style of drawing of a particular version is subject to its own copyright (see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_on_emblems_204d.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright on emblems">Wikipedia:Copyright on emblems</a>). Unless you have reasons to think otherwise, my understanding is that these new images are copyright, and not really subject to fair use, because free versions (except for Josephine Butler) exist (though it would be nice if the GFDL versions included helms, mantling, mottos etc. - I may work on adding these).</p>
<p>Let me know what you think,</p>

<dd>I hope you do not think I was implying you thought he was admirable. I'm sure you have a NPOV on such inclusions. I just took the opportunity to whinge about another example of Australia's hidden history. The bogey man reference is to aboriginal mothers who scared their children with 'Frank Jardine will come and get you'. The Australian Dictionary of Biography fails to mention bloody hands. They do mention he was appointed as a Magistrate. May see you round again.

<p>There is no universal Categorification and a comprehensive list of geographers in wikipedia. Initally, newly established geographer articles were putting into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_geographers.html" title="List of geographers">List of geographers</a>, however, geographer articles were gradually categorized by nationality or merely given stubs label. Therefore, it is hard to track down all the geographer listings in wiki. The list of geographers is not working efficent enough as it failed to leave a mark in the category section. I am less familiar with the operation in categorification, but I think there is a method to get a comprehensive list of geographers (those now listed in different geographers-related categories) without input each of them manuely. If not, maybe we twos and other concerned indiviuals can figure out a way to solve the current problem. <a href="#Category:Geographers" title="">#Category:Geographers</a> is a vacant space currently and is not used for categorification purpose. On the other hand, <a href="#Category:Economists" title="">#Category:Economists</a> has significant entries of economists and other types of category. We follow try to do the same to put existing geogrpaher articles into <a href="#Category:Geographers" title="">#Category:Geographers</a> though this is quite painful as well. Please share your thought.</p>
<p>PS: What do you think about the article on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Hall_%28urbanist%29_8ecf.html" title="Peter Hall (urbanist)">Peter Hall (urbanist)</a> without any reference on his geographical background? Maybe we should modify a bit?</p>
<p>I am you have tried to write about the Berkeley School of Geography. Keep it up it is very good attempt.</p>
<p>There are some geographers that I always want to start an article: Peter Haggett, Peter Gould, Richard Chorley, Ron Johnson, Richard Symanski,Richard Peet, Anthony Orme etc... Who do you have on your list?</p>
<p>Lastly, do you know the current number of members for RGS? AAG has about 9000 now.</p>

<p>I've been attempting to overview and tidy up the geography cats which involve the places where people live. From the top level down to local neighbourhoods. There has been some overlapping and various mis-routings. It's been interesting looking at it all. However, there appear to be two useful ways of doing it - by region, and by size. And these can operate side by side quite usefully. The by region isn't a problem. But the by size has become difficult because <a href="../../../h/m/a/User%7EHmains_e270.html" title="User:Hmains">User:Hmains</a> wishes to use the term settlements to cover all sizes of communities, and has altered dictionary definitions <a href="http://www.answers.com/settlement&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/settlement&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to fit his own understanding of the term - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Settlement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110496009" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Settlement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110496009" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Community appears to be the term used most often to describe the places where people live, regardless of size. This is the definition of community - <a href="http://www.answers.com/community&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/community&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I did some sorting, placing the cat Human communities under Human geography. Human communities splitting into Urban geography and Rural geography. And those splitting into appropriate sized communities - cities, districts, neighbourhoods, villages, settlements, etc. Hmains has reverted much of my work, and insists on settlements being the term we should use - basing it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_18#Category:Settlements_by_region|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_18#Category:Settlements_by_region|" rel="nofollow">this decision</a>, which was a declined proposal to rename Settlements by region to Populated places by region. What do you think? Is settlement an acceptable term for covering human communities ranging from well established cities down to refuge camps. Is Human community a viable alternative? Are there other choices (apart from populated places of course!)? I have started a discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Geography#Advice_requested" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Geography#Advice_requested" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Categories#Advice_requested" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Categories#Advice_requested" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, with the above wording, but no response as yet.

<p>Hi, I've been doing some tidying up (ongoing) on this category. I see from edit histories that you added a lot of people to this category: great work. But ... when you put the cat tag at the end of the article, could you add their names as well, please? If you don't, they get alphabetised oddly: Martha Black was under M, Christina Lamb was under C etc. You can look at any of the entries to see the correct manner of doing it (I can't cut and paste an example here else it just ends up at the bottom of your talk page as a category!)

<dd>The purpose is incorrect. It should be something along the lines of: "The image is the front cover of the magazine, which is the main subject of the article." Also, given the size of that image and the original size of the actual cover, yes, the resolution has been reduced. Since the image is of a magazine cover, it is not replaceable (it cannot be replaced by a more free image). I hope that helps.↔<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmajdan_9130.html" title="User:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:11px; font-weight:bold; font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">NMajdan</font></a>•<a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmajdan_5041.html" title="User talk:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:9px; font-family:verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000;">talk</font></a> 15:09, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
