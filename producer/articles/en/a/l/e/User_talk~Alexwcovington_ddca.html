<p>Thanks for your kind reply. I well appreciate the need for objectivity and dispassionate coverage--and addressing academic information. By way of pointing again to the contrasts I mention below, however, the entries for NDSU and for UND speak also of flowerbeds, the beauty of their campi, the history of the architecture on each campus, etc., none of which is properly academic information. What inspired my original note, below, in part involved the noted disparities in types of coverage--both in content and in style. While obvious, it would seem to bear repeating that whether the writing maintains a "neutral tone to the article, without being needlessly praiseful" is in part a matter of perspective. I guess I'm just asking for consistent treatment across coverage--thanks again! Best, jbessie.--<a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbessie_06aa.html" title="User:Jbessie">jbessie</a> 03:43, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wrote to MatthewUND regarding edits to the Valley City State University page (actually, to the whole whole set of NDUS pages)and was directed to you as the person I should contact. The next two paragraphs are what I wrote:</p>
<p>I had done a bit of editing of the Valley City State University website a while back (fall 06, I think). Yesterday it was brought to my attention that the article has had the bulk of its content edited out. Perusing the pages for the NDUS system schools, it appears that UND has the most robustly devloped page, next NDSU, then coverage really tumbles downhill from there--even for the system's "third-largest public university" (viz., Minot State). Dickinson state, that has really taken the lead on international programs(e.g. in Russia, a campus being created in China) receives no mention of such unique features, etc.</p>
<p>I note that this page is part of a Project (or a couple of Projects) in Wikipedia--what's the game plan here? I'd like to contribute--especially where I can meaningfully do so within the bounds of truth for Valley City State--but worry about the thing being minimized again. For the To-Do list for the WikiProjecdt North Dakota, Valley City is indicated for "clean up," which is striking given its already tiny content.</p>
<p>Please advise--thanks.</p>

<p>Really puzzling why someone would all of a sudden decide that Hawktree wasn't good enough to have its own article. There are plenty of other articles out there that need to be eliminated. Anyways, I will try to find some notable information on the club and add it to the page - I know one of the golf courses here in Bismarck was recently featured on a brief CNN clip after implementing new technology - I am almost positive it was Hawktree but I can't seem to find any information on it.

<p>Okay, I will take another look. You are right, I am very much on the edge here. No label, but in some indie scenes that might not mean much (e.g. Splashdown never quite got a solid deal with a label, and yet... yeah, Splashdown. Wow. Effing Splashdown.)

<dd>Heh, some slightly bad news... I listened to the "Up Here" video on YouTube (well, okay, I only listened to half of it) and I was really unimpressed. (You said you'd never heard of Terra Naomi, so I feel like I can say that and not be a jerk, heh) I know that theoretically shouldn't influence my vote, but, well, it does. Heh...

I welcome your contributions to Senator O'Connell's page, but I do feel that a source is needed for the Irish American categorization; once you get into 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants there's an identity factor.

<dd>I think we can just about kiss our golf course articles goodbye. I'm still baffled by the notion that some people have that something like a golf course shouldn't have an article on Wikipedia just because it isn't "notable" enough or the article isn't long enough. Who ever said these articles were anything more than stubs? We have intended to expand them in the future, right? There are thousands of stubs on Wikipedia, why are these stubs so different? As far as being "notable", that seems like a very subjective and tricky thing to gauge, but some people seem to think they are <i>the</i> judge of whether or not something is or isn't notable. This all just really irriates me. One a side note, an article that I recently made the other night about the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Cities_Mall_83c2.html" title="Grand Cities Mall">Grand Cities Mall</a> is up for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Grand_Cities_Mall_4f02.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Grand Cities Mall">deletion</a>.

<dd>I have not removed any articles. What I have done is merged the content of single sentence articles into their locality articles where they sit much better. This is recommended by <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> which says:
<ul>
<li>Initially, information on places of local importance should be added to an article on the community where that place is located.</li>
<li>This information should generally be written in sentence form, but where only basic information is available about a group of places in the same community, you might consider presenting this information in list or table format.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The guidelines go on to say:
<ul>
<li>As more verifiable information on local places is added to the community article, the article or individual sections will start to get overly large. Since large articles should be written in summary style, the longer sections should be broken out into articles such as "Education in community" "Transportation in community", etc. when this occurs.</li>
<li>As these articles get overly large as more verifiable information is added to each of these articles, information on individual places should be broken out into individual articles, beginning with places with the most verifiable information on them.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is the normal way in which articles are developed.</dd>
<dd>The AfD, that will certainly result in a 'Keep', simply addresses whether the content of the article should be in WP; it does not go to where the content should be located. That is for future editorial consideration. I would urge you to consider accepting that the locality article is the best place. Not only does this meet the Guidelines but it means that the attractions can be read in context. The alternative is a large number of small articles, relating to a locality, which is much more awkward for the reader to navigate. Finally, I should like to compliment you on the ND Project, which is helping to improve WP. I simply ask that you reconsider moving to an organic growth approach, rather than one that creates many stubs that, in truth, are likely to remain so. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 15:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not agree that North Dakota's golf courses are purely of local interest; indeed, articles on them are probably of more interest to tourists than to their local users. It is true that they could be longer, but at this time WPND is in a stub-making mode rather than an intensive article-development mode, and I would ask for your understanding.</dd>

<dd>I accept that, which is why I am in favour of redirects being set up for each one so that they can readilly be found by tourists or anyone else. BTW I can assure you that I am not going to go round chasing down your stubs&#160;:-) What I am asking is that you discuss your approach within the Project.

<p>So how do you propose we take care of this problem, Alex? I'm thinking we should make a list of golf courses in the state and then, like you said, we can use that list to expand info on particular courses in the future. I'm not opposed to merging some ND golf course articles with their respective local pages. I think this would probably be rather reasonable for golf courses that really <i>aren't</i> that notable and are located in small towns. Still, I think we should try to keep individual articles for some of the <i>major</i> 18-hole courses. We would just have to decide what qualifies as "major". --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matth</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">w<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 17:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now that Hawktree has survived its AfD, where should we go from here? I think we should start merging some of the smaller articles in with their city articles and expanding those articles which have room for expansion. I don't think this is anything we need to hurry with, but I suppose we can start merging a few articles from time to time.

<p>I undersand that wikipedians are a different lot, but could someone explain why all the towns listed under North Dakota were reduced to three? Honestly, there wasn't even a listing for ND until I added it, then looked up the towns, many of them I'd been to, in order to generate a list. (the three you left are kind of lame choices, incidentally, and not representitive of the ghost towns in ND.) Are you folks only including TRUE ghost towns, like Bodie, CA, or, as the wiki page on GTs says "The word is sometimes used in a deprecative sense to include areas where the current population is significantly less than it once was." The list I generated was of this type. I would really like an answer as my changes were appropriate under this guideline. 72.24.182.238 16:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)menk</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because the cities other than the three I left aren't deserted and thus aren't ghost towns. Amidon may seem tiny, and it is, but the people who live there aren't ghosts and I won't stand for you to insult them. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 20:09, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Alex. Just because a town is small in population or even has a much smaller population than it once did, I don't think that makes it a "ghost town." That term makes most people (including me) think of a totally empty town with only derelict buildings and with no residents. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matth</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">w<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 06:35, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that Amidon is small, and inhabited, however, what about a case like Havana, ND. There are numerous (more than fifty) abandoned buildings and structures. Should this be considered something less since it isn't completely ghost? There aren't more than 20 people living there. I'm sorry, I disagree heartily with the assertion that a town must be completely uninhabited. This image that people have of Hollywood-style Brady Bunch ghost towns is ridiculous and far off the mark. As I quoted above, a town may be reffered as a ghost town if the population has seriously declined. I included towns that were not only decimated versions of their former selves, but in several cases were <b>nearly</b> uninhabited. If Fargo went from a population of 150,000 to 15,000, the twon would be <b>nearly</b> a ghost town, which is why I made reference to those specific towns. Your criteria would leave only uninhabited places. Not really a workable definition. 72.24.182.238 19:28, 6 November 2006 (UTC)menk</dd>

I have been to Cripple Creek numerous times (gambling at the Brass Ass was a good time) and I can assure you the people there are also, as was so helpfully pointed out, not ghosts. Does this insult the more than 1,000 residents to include them in this compilation? And if it is not an insult, maybe you can explain why they are included if your definition only includes completely abandoned towns. 72.24.182.238 06:11, 7 November 2006 (UTC)Menk</dd>

<p>It appears that the ban of the IP range that continually vandalized ND Democrat articles was lifted sometime last week. Today, the vandal returned under the IP he/she had used before - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=165.234.100.1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=165.234.100.1" rel="nofollow">165.234.100.1</a>, vandalising the same articles that were done before (ND Dem-NPL page, Joe Satrom, Heidi Heitkamp, Byron Dorgan, Earl Pomeroy, Quentin Burdick, Roger Johnson, as well as one of your userboxes). On Satrom's page, the vandal continually reverts to some garbage he wrote several weeks ago about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Satrom&amp;diff=90478586&amp;oldid=88281223" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Satrom&amp;diff=90478586&amp;oldid=88281223" rel="nofollow">Elves</a> - which this time went un-noticed for over 3 hours. On the other pages the vandal just reverted back to the vandalised version that he created last time around. Is a permanent block too much to ask for on an entire range? How far does the range span? - it would be unfortunate to have to block editing from all public computers in the state. <a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeatherman90_814a.html" title="User:Weatherman90">Weatherman90</a> 00:23, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what its worth, the same IP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=165.234.100.1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=165.234.100.1" rel="nofollow">165.234.100.1</a>, was back today and vandalized the same articles about 25x or so before an admin issued a 72 hr block. Here's something interesting - all the edits from that IP were from 17:27 to 18:39 which would be 11:27 to 12:39 central or 12:27 to 1:39 mountain if my math is right. I don't know what conclusion to draw from that, but I'm pretty sure a 72 hr block won't stop the problem. <a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeatherman90_814a.html" title="User:Weatherman90">Weatherman90</a> 23:28, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just self-nominated myself for <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator's</a> status on Wikipedia. As an active member of WikiProject North Dakota, I feel that having admin status would allow me the ability to be more useful to the project and to curtail vandalism and other problems. An admin is able to protect pages that are being bombarded with vandalism and to more quickly revert pages that have been vandalized. I've always hoped that we could get an admin to join the WikiProject so we would have someone to turn to in times of need. Since we still don't have an active admin within the project's membership, I decided to nominate myself.

<dd>Well, it looks like we can probably say goodbye to the chances of this RfA passing. The sad thing is that it sounds like most voters would have been supportive had I not sent messages to the WPND members letting them know about the RfA. What an unfortunate mistake on my part. I still wish we could get an admin into WPND so we can do things like stop vandalism when it first starts. Perhaps we could get admin status for you in the future.

<p>Furthermore, I agree that the article on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortana.html" title="Cortana">Cortana</a> is very good. It's worthy of reading. It provides insight into Cortana's personality. Etc, etc. But nevertheless, she is nothing but a fictional AI shown in the cutscenes of a video game - not a very encyclopedic subject, aye? The outcome of this AfD will be crucial for at least my view on Wikipedia - either it'll be an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, or an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of subjects that have enough information to write some prose on</a>. I'm happy with both, really - the problem I have is that Wikipedia describes itself as an encyclopedia and NOT an indiscriminate collection of information.</p>
<p>So what I'm doing here is <i>considering the usefulness in the context of the primary article</i> - do we really, really, really need an article on Cortana? Will not a mention in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a> do? <b>To what use is the article on Cortana?</b> You want background?

Or hey, look at one of the 240,000 google hits mentioned in the beginning of the AfD.</p>
<p>If you're wondering "but why Cortana? Why Cortana?", it's because I was on some <i>Random Page Patrol</i> and 90% of all entries turning up were either 1) articles on fictional characters, 2) biographical stubs on people from the 19th century, or 3) articles on <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_271d.html" title="TV">TV</a> episodes from various shows and <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcoms</a>.

<dd>You see my point, I see your point. Peaceful disagreement - I am happy we could avoid a more heated debate!

<p>Yeah, the Esperanza 'e'. I really should get rid of that thing. Don't ask me what happened to Esperanza...you probably know more than I do. The only reason I ever signed up was it because it seemed like "the thing to do". It always seemed a little pointless to me, really. Can you believe that I actually didn't really even know that it was inactive now? Shows just how involved I was!</p>
<p>The failed RfA actually didn't bother me very much. Sure, I was really ticked off for one afternoon or so, but I finally realized that I was the only one to blame. I made a really dumb mistake. I'll do better next time...and I really hope there will be a next time. WPND needs an admin.</p>
<p>Do you come across many fellow editors in your daily life? Sure most students at UND know what Wikipedia is, but I can't say I come across many (maybe that should read "any") editors.</p>
<p>BTW, do you understand how Flickr and Wikipedia mesh? Is it OK to take a Creative Commons image that only requires attribution and use it on Wikipedia? There are some good North Dakota and Grand Forks pics on there that I wouldn't mind using here.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, Alex. What I still am not 100% sure about is how to attribute an image to someone. From the Wikipedia image page, should we actually link to the original Flicker image page? Who do we attribute the image to if the Flickr user uses a screenname instead of a real name? Is it ok to attribute an image to a Flickr screenname? And yes, I think it would be a great idea to include any ND-relevant pics to the ND list...not sure why I never thought of that. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matthew<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 07:57, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, I just found your bridge pic. Thanks for the example! Now that I see how you set it all up, I'll dare do it the same way myself. I just didn't want to make a dumb mistake. I'm excited about trying to find pics on Flickr. Most of our ND articles are really lacking visuals. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matthew<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 08:00, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They did indeed, but don't worry - I just relocated it.
