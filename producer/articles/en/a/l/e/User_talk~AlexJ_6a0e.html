<p>Hi Alexj2002!</p>
<p>You've uploaded a new copy of the ITV plc logo and are putting it in various articles.</p>
<p>There's a couple of slight issues with this. The first issue is that the image is inaccurate - the typeface, box and corners are all distorted. This is a poor image compared to the other one previously used.</p>
<p>The second issue is that you've created the image as an SVG, which is infinitely scalable. You have then created a fair-use rationale where you say the image is "low resolution". It is not low resolution - it is a very high resolution image.</p>
<p>I'm inclined, because of Wikipedia's strong rules and guidelines on copyrights on images and designs, to switch the articles back to the original, accurate, low resolution version. I'd be interested in your thoughts. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 14:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for your comments. My understanding is that if the image in the article is low resolution, then that qualifies as fair use&gt; Additionally the image was created from a low resolution source (the previous logo) and therefore the resolution of the image is the same as the previous image. The logos on the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxtel.html" title="Foxtel">Foxtel</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Footy_Channel_b597.html" title="Fox Footy Channel">Fox Footy Channel</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> articles are both SVG (as are many other articles I've come across). If you feel the image is poor compared with the previous one, by all means please revert it but I don't believe that because the image is in SVG format it should be reverted. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexj2002_245b.html" title="User:Alexj2002">Alexj2002</a> 14:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>Thanks for your swift reply. The image <i>on the article page</i> is always in low resolution, regardless of the size of the original as the MediaWiki software scales images down automatically (in other words, you see a whole new image specially constructed for that page, not just a html resize of the image). Therefore the rules on using a low resolution image apply to the uploaded image itself, not to the generated copy on an article page.</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, that other people have uploaded copyright SVG scalable images isn't a reason for others to do it - we don't set precidents this way at Wikipedia; we negotiate rules and guidelines and ask people to follow them, rather than making rules and guidelines based on what people are already doing.

<p>Hey. I'm actually starting to doubt that myself! In FIFA 06 there's a retro video that reviews all of the games up to 06. I just found the first one in 3D and counted my way up.

<p>Hi no I have checked it out and it is now called Cardiff International airport. Its just I live only 3 miles away from the airport and all my life I have heard it called Cardiff Wales International Airport. I haven't flown from there for a few years but I have flown many times from there in the past and it was always Cardiff Wales. I'll change it back sorry for the inconvenience. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Janderson_0c19.html" title="User:James Janderson">James Janderson</a> 09:54, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I removed the incorrectly licensed image (into html comments) and hope I've added what was needed for the other 2 logos. I'm very unclear on the image copyright stuff though...

<p>Uhm...the picture is properly listed as you suggested already. I think you must have misread it. Why would it be an option if it isn't "free enough?"

<p>There were many reasons I replaced the new image (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tackle.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tackle.JPG" rel="nofollow">link</a>) back with the old, dive pass image (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Yamaha_Jubilo_halfback_dive_pass.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Yamaha_Jubilo_halfback_dive_pass.JPG" rel="nofollow">link</a>). Firstly, I don't believe it shows the differences between league and union well enough. In the new image the only indicator I could find was that the children are wearing shorts that are designed for union (eg; strong fabric). In the old image, however, there are several indicators that the image is of Rugby Union, not league:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A ruck to the left of the image</li>
<li>Defence close to the play (eg; not 10 meters back)</li>
<li>The ball in the air is a Rugby Union ball</li>
<li>The wearing of a well known <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Force_32e4.html" title="Western Force">Western Force</a> union jersey as opposed to common school-boy jerseys</li>
<li>Union style headgear that is generally only worn in union</li>
<li>The wearing of grip-gloves, something that is generally only worn in union</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although in my edit summary I said I removed the image solely because it didn't differenciate between league and union, not all of the reasons I did this regard the differences between Union and League. Some of the reasons I don't like the new image include:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>No view of the ball</b>; to the person who knows nothing of Rugby this just looks like two children tackling each other</li>
<li>It can be interpreted at a children's game, rather than the professional sport it is</li>
<li>Image is wonky, off-centre and poorly cropped</li>
<li>Isn't as visually exciting</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although the image may fit somewhere else or in another related article, I don't feel it belongs at the top or is of good enough quality to be a representive of such an important article (which I feel is getting close to GA or even FA status). <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitch119_4b83.html" title="User:Mitch119">Mitch119</a> 05:07, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex. I'm not entirely expert on how pictures work. The first thing to say is that I followed the lead of <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottanon_6f33.html" title="User:Scottanon">user:Scottanon</a>, who used some of Barry's other pics for the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surtees.html" title="Surtees">Surtees</a> article.</p>
<p>I e-mailed Barry to ask for specific permission to use that pic (and possibly a couple of others, I can't remember off the top of my head). I didn't go into the issue of which copyright notice should be used, I just asked if he was happy to go ahead on the same basis as for the Surtees ones (i.e. copyright, but usable so long as pictures are credited). He e-mailed back to say that he was content on that basis.</p>
<p>I suppose we could ask whether he was happy to release the whole lot under the GFDL. I think his general position is probably that he's happy for them to be used, but doesn't want them to go out of his control. It would be better to go softly, softly - he posts regularly at the <a href="http://forums.atlasf1.com/forumdisplay.php?s=a6a1e2b3e91e16bd16160481452496b5&amp;forumid=10|The" class="external text" title="http://forums.atlasf1.com/forumdisplay.php?s=a6a1e2b3e91e16bd16160481452496b5&amp;forumid=10|The" rel="nofollow">Nostalgia Forum</a>, where the general attitude towards Wikipedia is mixed, verging on negative, so I suppose too forward a request might generate a negative response. (By the way, it's a good place to pick up generally extremely knowledgeable comment on historic motorsport, although you shouldn't take <i>everything</i> you read there as gospel.).</p>
<p>I can e-mail him again if you like - but would appreciate a discussion on the ins and outs of Wikipedia's copyright rules, first. We don't want to ask someone for permission to use their pictures and then have to go back and tell them we got it wrong&#160;:D. Obviously you can also contact him yourself.</p>
<p>Finally - you should also have a look at Gerald Swan's site - I've used some of his pictures, for example the pic of the BT33 (with his permission, on a similar - i.e. not blanket - basis) on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brabham.html" title="Brabham">Brabham</a> article (which can always use another pair of eyes, if I haven't already asked you to have a look).</p>

<dd>Yes, I noticed he'd made a decent edit or two. I guess some of the little rules and policies Wikipedia has aren't immediately obvious, and maybe he suspected some insidiousness where there wasn't any, which is why I didn't rip into him too much for nobbling my userpage.

I have recently been doing a lot of work on <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slayer.html" title="Slayer">Slayer</a>, perhaps you could skim read it to check if it's ready for FA status?. I know there is one citation tag, which i will find later, also if any more are required. If you're busy that's fine&#160;:).

<p>You left a message on my edit user page saying the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix images were violating Wikipedia. I checked against Wikipedia's policy and they were correct not <b>incorrect</b>.

<p>Hi, thanks for telling me about copyright violation, I won't do it again.

<p>I've noticed a number of pictures from F1-Rejects on Wikipedia - could I get some if they are proved useful e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>A old F1 car</li>
<li>A person who hasn't got a picture on Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if I did get some, would I need to give three or four reason why not to delete it?? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavnel03_a2a9.html" title="User:Davnel03">Davnel03</a> 20:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
The alternate map looks fine! I notice also that some of the data-box maps (of Wales or GB) use some kind of algorithm that automatically plots a point given the grid reference. Unfortunately these are nothing like detailed enough for local mapping, and something similar for individual counties would be nice, because then any editor could plot a point just by editing the text. I have no idea how this might be done. Someone on the Wales project might know. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinguisticDemographer_342e.html" title="User:LinguisticDemographer">LinguisticDemographer</a> 22:46, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
