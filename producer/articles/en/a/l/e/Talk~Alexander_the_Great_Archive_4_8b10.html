Phrases like "Plato argued that it was common but against nature and thus un-natural, as Aristotle also agreed - "They are a deviation from the norm....some <i>diseased things</i> result from nature or habit" (<a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> - <i>De' Anima</i>). One can therefore validly claim that Alexander, known as the Philosopher-King would have adhered to his greatest passion - the love of wisdom and not un-natural relations." were deleted. It seems that those phrases aren't from De Anima but from Nicomachean Ethics, 1148b 29, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Nic.+Eth.+1148b+1" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Nic.+Eth.+1148b+1" rel="nofollow">english translation</a>, "... These practices result in some cases from natural disposition, and in others from habit, as with those who have been abused from childhood ...". The phrase "deviation from the norm" may be a different translation of "unnatural propensities", or perhaps is from another text.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">PERSIANS NAMING OF THE GREEKS &amp; THE VARIOUS GREEKS TRIBES</span></h2>
<p>There are several types of Yauna in the Achaemenid Royal Inscriptions:</p>
<p>(1) Yaunβ in general: the same as the Greeks known as "Ionians", i.e., those living in Asia Minor. They can already be found in the Behistun Inscription, when the Persian rule had not yet reached Europe. This identification is 100% certain.</p>
<p>(2) Yaunβ takabarβ, the 'Greeks with shield-shaped hats'. First mentioned in DNa ( <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html</a> ), where they are distinguished from the "normal" Yaunβ: an almost certain reference to the Macedonian sunhats.</p>
<p>(3 and 4) "The Yaunβ, near and across the sea": another division, for the first time found in DSe ( <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DSe.html" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DSe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DSe.html</a> ) and in a slightly different form in the Daiva Inscription by Xerxes (XPh: <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html</a> ). The obvious reading is "the Asian Yauna and the European Yauna", i.e., -again- Asian Greeks and Macedonians.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Persian inscriptions are fairly stereotypical, and the fact that there is a small difference between the precise wording of DSe and XPh suggests that there is a difference. Perhaps, there is a difference between the "Yauna across the sea" and the sunhat-Yaunβ. If this is correct, the Yauna across the sea must be either Cypriot Greeks (but why didn't Darius, who seems to have subdued Cyprus, mention them?) or the Thessalians, Boeotians, and Athenians - nations that Xerxes could claim to have conquered.</p>
<p>(5) There is a seal from the age of Xerxes ( <a href="http://www.livius.org/a/1/greece/yauna_seal.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/a/1/greece/yauna_seal.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/a/1/greece/yauna_seal.jpg</a> ) in which the great king defeats someone looking like a Yauna. It is unique, because a second man appears to have a hand in the killing, and this man looks like a Yauna. Is this the Macedonian king Alexander who helps killing a Thessalian/Boeotian/Athenian??</p>
<p>Such instances are extremely rare since only a handful of original Persian texts have survived.There are of references by Darius I in the Behistun Inscription to Sardis (OP Sparda), Ionia (OP Yauna) and Cappadocia (OP Katpatuka). There are also a couple of statements concerning the Greeks and their tribes in the Babylonian tablets.</p>

<p>This entire article has grown out of control and has become something of an embarassment. Anyone attempting to do research on Alexander the Great, using wikipedia as a source, is going to find this particular page confusing at best. I suggest we take a look at how other pages are constructed, then basically burn this whole thing and start anew. The <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> article is well-organized and not filled with so much bias, for example. What I say we do is figure out which sections are needed and which are not. Because wikipeida is not a scholarly publication, we don't need these minute details on his sex life or whether or not modern-day Iranians like him. The portions of this articles on his campaigns are good - nobody can disagree that he burnt Thebes, or Perseopolis, or Tyre, or Gaza. What we <i>don't</i> need is drawn-out discussion as to <i>why</i> he did it. It ought to be as simple as 'Before leaving Greece, Alexander burnt Thebes in (whatever year, can't think of it now).' Then, <i>at the end of the article</i>, we can include a <i>small</i> section on the controversies, giving a handful of basic summaries for the biggest ones, i.e., his homosexuality, his reasons for medizing, even his ethnicity if that'll please some nationalists. But honestly, the only way to fix this article is to cut major portions of it - and we should discuss which of those should go, and which should simply be restructred. --Kulindar 12:25, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But there is controversy - minor or major - at very many points in Alexander's life. We should not try to make the article conform to one view but rather discuss the differences in the ancient sources where there is a discrepancy. All things based on modern interpretations, I agree, should be confined to a specific section. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 23:38, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that Alexander was one the greatest generals ever to walk the ancient world. I think this is an accurate thing because of the expanse he conquered and the the time he did it in. Yes Alexander did fight among his men in the front line mainly leading a cavalry charge. The belief he had that he was a god gave him the courage to stand and take the risk in a battle while other generals tend to stand at the back and wait for the outcome. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Alexstorer (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alexstorer_6177.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alexstorer">contribs</a>) 21:33, January 8, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I think the word Greek (as in Greek soldiers) should be removed</span></h2>
<p>I think the word Greek (as in Greek soldiers) should be removed (or clarified further) as there did not exist a 'Greece' per se in the ancient times. There were, as we all know, only the Hellenic City-States. It is therefore innapropriate to make claims such as 'Greek and non-Greek' soldiers, when at the time there was no 'Greek' entity/country. I also believe the mention that Macedonia was a part of classical Greece is again misleading as there did not exist a Classical Greece only the Hellenic City-States. This is also an issue that is up for a lot of debate (especially between today's Greeks and Macedonians) and I believe it should be more ambiguous, rather than seem politically biased. - Analyst. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 144.132.10.17 11:56, October 25, 2005 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_144.132.10.17_11%7E56%2C_October_25%2C_2005_3dc6.html" title="Special:Contributions/144.132.10.17 11:56, October 25, 2005">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>According to Arrianos, after the battle at Granicos river, three hundered shields accompanied by an inscription were sent to Athens and presented at Parthenon. The inscription read "Alexandros Philippoy and the Greeks except for the Lacedaemonians". I would say they would know better whether Greek soldiers should be referred to as a single entity. One could also notice how Macedonians are not named separately. There are also numerous references to Greeks as a single entity already centuries before that (famously and a personal favourite, Aeschylos "Ω ΠΑΙΔΕΣ ΕΛΛΗΝΩΝ ΙΤΕ", "Oh! sons of Greece, march!"). --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECangelis_91e1.html" title="User:Cangelis">Cangelis</a> 13:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, if you take a passage from Plutarch at face value, it was rare for him to "call aloud" in Macedonian. I agree, on the basis of Plutarch if nothing else, that he most often spoke Greek, but I would like to believe that Alexander also spoke Macedonian on a semi-regular basis. The evidence is not conclusive. Given that Macedonian was still a way from being assimilated in his time, he (perhaps) often spoke Macedonian among his Macedonians. The Macedonian language/dialect was not assimilated in his time.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I've referenced Plutarch here twice, and both instances refer to the same passage, where Plutarch implies that "it was a sign of a great disturbance" for Alexander to <i>give orders</i> to his Macedonians in Macedonian. But giving orders is different from casual speech. So it wouldn't surprise me if he often (often=regularly) spoke Macedonian to his Macedonian soldiers.

<dd>One can argue that the shift began before Philip, but it certainly became a more major shift during his reign and afterwards. I don't know when historians believe the language or dialect became extinct completely (Dbachmann writes in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonian_language_41c2.html" title="Ancient Macedonian language">Ancient Macedonian language</a> that it survived into early CE), but it was still spoken by many in Alexander's time, most historians I think would agree.

<p>From what I had read in the past, my personal opinion is that Philip played the bigest roll in that language shift.

<p>I agree that the reference to the "known world" is preposterous, and should be removed. It's also a little embarrassing, as it makes us Westerners seem ignorant of the rest of the world. A solution is to specify "the world known to the Mediterranean civilizations"; that covers the combined knowledge of Macedon, Greece/Hellas, Semites, Egypt, the Persian Empire, et al.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Conquest of India?</span></h2>
<p>Let me begin by saying that I am from the part of India (east of River Beas) where Alexander supposedly stopped and his army mutinied. Now, I see that on the "Alexander" page on wiki, a bold claim of "CONQUEST of INDIA" is made. It is wrong at so many levels. Firstly, most of you guys editing this page are probably Europoean or of similar origin, so go ahead say whatever you feel like.</p>
<p>But mind you, there will "soon" be a billion people in India reading Wikipedia, and they are not going to be very impressed by this state of affair. As you all know the historical accounts which you so confidently rely on were written 300 ot more years later, thousands of miles away from where the incidents happened. We already know what kinds of fanciful tales Herodotus had to tell&#160;: "semen of people in india is black"&#160;!!</p>
<p>So, I wouldnt pay too much credence to these ancient great historians. If you want to say things like there was a battle with Porus, that is fine. But do not go outright claiming victory, as that account was told 300-400 years later sitting way back in Greece. The accounts we know of in Punjab (and in other texts) is totally different. And who knows whether that was a mutiny or Alexander actually got his lunch served.</p>
<p>As for those coins you depict, how sure are you that they are from Pakistan. Maybe they are from the Persian war, where also Elephants were employed. Also, you say the guy being attacked is Porus??? Were you there, witnessing the battle?</p>
<p>And how about this article claiming totally different accoutn based on Ethiopic Texts translated by E. A. W.

<dd>You're nuts. No, Alexander didn't conquer all of India (which wasn't unified at the time anyway). He conquered part of what is now Pakistan. That's fact. It wasn't made up centuries later. We don't have any documents from Alexander's time, but ancient historians writing centuries later (like Arrian) had shitloads of them to draw upon. Get your facts straight. By the way, that comment about there being "soon" one billion Indians...what's up with that?! Even if all them believed as you do (which I doubt), it doesn't matter how many people believe something if it's not true.

<dd>While the extant accounts of Alexander's conquests date from 300 (in the case of Diodorus) to 450 (in the case of Arrian and Plutarch) years after Alexander, it is completely unjust to pretend that they are legends. Arrian based his account closely on two primary sources of Alexander's campaigns - the histories of <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy_I_Soter_da53.html" title="Ptolemy I Soter">Ptolemy</a> and Aristobulus, both of whom were on the campaign. Arrian also cites his sources fairly closely, so that we have quite a good idea of Ptolemy's whole narrative, and also of where Aristobulus differs from it. Diodorus and Quintus Curtius's accounts are largely based on the work of Cleitarchus, who was not himself on campaign with Alexander, but who was a contemporary and clearly spoke to people who were. Cleitarchus's account, it should be added, is clearly unfavorable to Alexander. If Alexander was beaten at the Hydaspes, one would expect that Cleitarchus would have said so, and that this version would have appeared in Diodorus or Quintus Curtius. On the contrary, Cleitarchus, as depicted in Diodorus, clearly shows that Alexander was victorious, as do all the other classical sources. As far as separating the legendary Alexander from the historical Alexander, I fully agree. Which is why we ought to respect the universal judgment of the classical narratives and of professional ancient historians, rather than changing the article to suit the arguments of a completely unsourced article on a dubious website. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 05:28, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disputed Indian History</span></h2>
<p>To Aldux, who reverted my changes, the text of the email that I sent to you. Hi,</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of knowledge. That being the case, the knowledge that Alexander's Indian exploits are disputed by Indian historians based on Indian texts should be made available. If you felt that my words were nationalistic in nature, you could have edited it as such, rather than reverting it completely.</p>
<p>The fact remains that much of current Indian history revolves around the time of Alexander's invasion, which is accurately determined. What is being disputed is: who was the Indian king/emperor during Alexander's invasion. The current version is that it was Chandragupta Maurya. Some Indian historians dispute it &amp; claim that it was the time of Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, Chandragupta II. The truth of what exactly happened here determines the entire Indian history itself, since it disputes a date range of around 1500 years.</p>
<p>It is important that the version that Alexander was victorious in India &amp; the king ruling India at that time is disputed by some segments, and this knowledge ought to be made available.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Regards, Saiswa</p>
<p><b>Actual changes that were reverted</b></p>
<p>Alexander's Indian exploits are primarily documented based on Megasthenes' Indica and is disputed by some Indian historians. The date of Alexander's invasion is currently used to document Indian history, based on Megasthenes' reference to Sandrokotus &amp; Sandrokipten. The current generally accepted version is that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandragupta_Maurya_abf9.html" title="Chandragupta Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a> was the Indian emperor during Alexander's invasion. This has been disputed by Indian historians based on Indian records and discrepancies in Megathenes' accounts (including no reference to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanakya.html" title="Chanakya">Chanakya</a>, Chandragupta's powerful minister), who claim that it was probably <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samudragupta.html" title="Samudragupta">Samudragupta</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandragupta_II_c5d6.html" title="Chandragupta II">Chandragupta II</a> who were reigning during that time, bringing Chandragupta Maurya's reign to around the much earlier 1500 BC. The same Indian historians claim that Alexander was probably defeated by the powerful Indian empire at that time, during which war he incurred the grievous injury, and that the Indica chose not to document this, which would puncture Alexander's aura.</p>

<dd>this is certainly good enough. It is well established that the ethno-linguistic status of the Ancient (pre-Philipp-II) Macedonians is <i>disputed</i>.

<dd>Yeah yeah, WP:NPOV, same old story. I still don't see how your edits reflect a "no-stance". You explicitely differentiate between Greeks and Macedonians and add some remote note. That's is far from not taking a stance. The Hellenic Graeco-macedonian however is very much in the middle and widely used. And why is the fact that Alexander and Philip considered themselves Greeks also constantly ignored by wikipedia, as if it's insignificant? It could at least be stated that the Kings of Macedon viewed themselves and were viewed by others as Greeks, that's undisputable even by you. Honestly Decius, do you think really expect people to believe that you have no agenda on this issue? You constantly try to differentiate Greeks from Macedonians by any means necessary. You even supported the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a> into claiming "genetic ancestry" from ancient Macedonians (whatever that means).

<dd><b>Funny nobody is making the same distinctions between Athenians and Spartans.</b> Why not? Is it that the FYROMian propagandists have been only focusing on Macedonian propaganda? <a href="http://www.macedoniaontheweb.com/FYROM-skopje/propaganda/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.macedoniaontheweb.com/FYROM-skopje/propaganda/index.php" rel="nofollow">FYROM propaganda a small collection.</a> Spartans had a different culture, a different dialect, and different government than Athenians. Spartans were war-like, and were not democratic and philosophical like the Athenians. I guess by such Philosophy the Spartans were not Hellenic also. Same goes for the Cretans, and the rest of Greece. Oh, and there was no Hellenic Republic then or a Greece. So the rest of ancient "Greece" cannot be Greek either, due to the fact that it was at that time a collection of different city states which were quite different in their philosophy of life, culture, and governmental rule. Was there a difference between city states? No doubt there was. Was there a difference between Macedonians and Athenians? No doubt. What great "historian" is focusing on these differences and trying to conjure up the notion that Macedonians were not a Greek tribe or city state is beyond me and many others that study history. Macedonians spoke a very close dialect of Greek, worshipped Greek gods, wanted revenge for Persias attacks (yes even Alexander did), Philip wanted to unite Greece (peacefully at first and then used forceful means). Yes Athenians thought Macedonians were a bit barbaric. Who wouldn't if most of them were great thinkers, philosophers, sculpters, democratic, big wigs that thought highly of themselves, and rightly so at the time as that was a golden age of Greece.</dd>

<p>It is very strongly implied that Alexander had a sexual relationship with Hephaestion, but it is not, to my knowledge, ever actually spelled out literally.</p>
<p>As for Bucephalus, his horse, what you claim is very far from historical basis. We know that he loved his horse...as a HORSE. Bucephalus had been with him for the entirety of his campaign, had stayed true to him the entire time, and was possibly Alexander's deepest comrade in his conquests. This does not imply that he had sexual relations with his horse, he simply recognized the danger that Bucephalus went into for his sake and loved his 'pet' for the unwaivering devotion. --Galileo 03:01, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a concern that the section about Alexander's character seems to be showing him as a crazy guy obsessed with taking over the world. While that may be a consensus among the majority of historians, a minority consider Alexander to be one of the greatest rulers the world has ever seen. His rule was a significant improvement for the people of the Middle East in the areas of freedom, liberty and human rights in general and he was known for having been tolerant of the Jews. I'm going to wait to edit the text of the section until we can reach a consensus.</p>

<dd>Tell me why is a written source not acceptable. Note Arrian wrote based on Ptolemy who was not present at this battle. Plutarch similarly wrote the account more then hundred years later. Oliver Stone made the movie Alexander after much research and if you watch the film he almost shows Alexander lost to Porus. There is no funny business of "treat me like a king" from Porus. Few more things to look at, after Jhelum alexander walked down Indus, alone, and fought the malli tribe who pierced his armor and shot an arrow through his ribs and he almost died. If Porus was his vassal he would have accompanied Alexander. But Porus did not accompany him. It is also mentioned Alexander gave a whole bunch of gold to Porus, now why would a victor give his wealth to a looser? Alexander's army refused to go any further. Note the terrain to get to Jhelum is a lot tougher then ambulating in the ganges plain of India. So his army had already done the hardwork. They did not turn back because of 8 years of war or whatever. They turned back because they saw so many of there fellow soldiers die. Lastly, Greeks want to portray Porus as king of India. India at that time was ruled by Nanda dynasty and Porus was a vassal of Magadha. So one cannot say 'Alexander's conquest of India'. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 192.94.94.105 (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.94.94.105.html" title="User talk:192.94.94.105">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.94.94.105_d38e.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.94.94.105">contribs</a>) 07:40, January 29, 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Non sequitur. Though Craterus was second in command as so often, he remained on the right bank, essential in keeping Porus' attention fixed on what appeared still to be the undiminished main camp while Alexander crossed the Indus upstream; "some said Ptolemy was left behind to raise a diversion, but Ptolemy himself insisted that he sailed with the leaders and fought as hard as the rest of them."

<dd>From Ptolemy article on livius.org it is clear the duo Arrian and Ptolemy are not trustworthy: The historian Arrian of Nicomedia records Ptolemy's presence during the battle in the Persian gate, but as Arrian's account is based on Ptolemy's own History of Alexander, and other sources are silent about his actions, we must probably take Arrian's story with a grain of salt.</dd>

<dd>While we cannot assume that everything that Arrian wrote is the absolutely correct (as with any source), I find no reason to assume that Ptolemy was absent from the battle. In addition as I wrote above, Arrian had other contemporary accounts of Alexander by <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callisthenes.html" title="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/Onesicritus.html" title="Onesicritus">Onesicritus</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/a/Nearchus.html" title="Nearchus">Nearchus</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristobulus.html" title="Aristobulus">Aristobulus</a>, as well as the slightly later work of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleitarchus.html" title="Cleitarchus">Cleitarchus</a>. Thus I find Arrian's account more credible than the accounts used by Budge. Quoting <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> (see <a href="../../../p/o/r/Talk%7EPorus_957c.html#reverts_between_User:192.94.94.105_and_User:Aldux" title="Talk:Porus">Talk:Porus#reverts between User:192.94.94.105 and User:Aldux</a>), "Budge's work a century ago (1896) is really a translation of a medieval ethiopic texts that is a redaction from the Arabic version of the Alexander Romance, which in turn is a version of the first one, the Greek one by the Pseudo-Callisthenes, a fantastic story of the exploits of Alexander. Every new version brought radical changes to the Pseudo-Callisthenes (i.e. he became Christian, or a prophet of Islam)." — <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 17:37, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The use of " India " is correct, as this was the term used by the ancients for this whole land. The " defeat " of Alexander against Porus is an absurdity, based on nationalist texts who are not even considered by serious Indian historians. The nationalists used the same propaganda than the ancient indians kings, who never put on stone that they lost against a stranger... ( like any royal propaganda, of course. ) In the same way, it's the same historians who are saying that the son of Seleucos Nikator was also defeat in India, arguing that he married his daughter with an indian king ang let him in charge. Yeah, and the 500 elephants ( who are historically attested in the battles who follows in middle-East )offered by this indian kings where just a gift and absolutly note a tribute, of course&#160;? That this battle was difficult is certain, but Alexander finally prevail.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 82.225.7.247 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.225.7.247_9681.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.225.7.247">contribs</a>) 13:55, February 7, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

I am only maintaing the neutrality of whether the ancient Macedonians were a Greek people or not, a topic that is unclear and controversial among historians today. Notice that I am putting <i>His conquests ushered in centuries of Macedonian and Greek settlement and rule over foreign areas</i> by putting both ethnic groups, it concludes a neutral statement, instead of only "Greek settlement" which is implying that the ancient Macedonians were Greek.

<dd>"East and west" strikes me as an arbitrary division. What kind of cultural distinctions do we want to draw the reader's attention to here?

<p>I do not see why this article should be called "Alexander the Great". "Alexander III of Macedon" would be much more fitting in an encyclopedia. First of all, that was his official name. Secondly it is only one viewpoint that he is "great". Would the Persians under Darius have regarded him as great? I do not understand why this is one of the few articles about a king, queen, or regent, etc. which uses an adjective to describe the individual in its title. For example, Ivan the Terrible is under the article "Ivan IV of Russia," Catherine the Great is called "Catherine II of Russia," Richard the Lionheart is "Richard I of England," Henry the Fowler is "Henry I of Germany," Louis the Pious is "Louis I of France," and William the Conquerer is "William I of England."

<p>It seems someone is deliberately ommiting these important authors for the sole reason that they portay Alexander as a heterosexual. For example, Plutarch clearly states that his only true love was Roxana whom he fell in love with instantly. There is nothing that mentions Alexnader being invloved with males. Second, most scholars have agreed that Arrianus Flavius was the most reliable source about Alexander. He along with Plutarch were the only authors who wrote about Alexander using original sources.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alexander's (Greek) name meaning</span></h2>
<p>During the past few days I tried to add the meaning - in short - of the name of Alexander in Greek which is "protector of men". User Aldux deleted it commenting "alexandros is already in the first line". When I tried again pointing out that "The Greek meaning of Alexander's name should also be mentioned" it got deleted again by another excuse "I disagree - if we follow this, we should do the same with William Smith or George Bush". I am sorry but i don't understand why it should be left out. (see history) This is of course not disputed and there is a Wikipedia article about it under <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Alexander (disambiguation)">Alexander (disambiguation)</a>). There are many ancient Greeks with the name Alexandros (including Paris of Troy). The name is still used today and every average Greek language speaker knows the meanings of "Alex-" (=protector) and "-Andras" (=man , same as in the english word androgyne and other words) In the article there are many references to Alexander's names in other cultures and the meaning of those names. There are mentions of Zoroastrian and Persian metaphors about his name. Also - later in the article - even the meaning of his horse's name. I'm quoting it here: "Alexander had a legendary horse named Bucephalus (meaning "ox-headed")". Therefore it completely escapes me why we shouldn't keep the meaning of HIS actual name. Furthermore the George Bush comment is much irrelevant because in ancient times the name meanings were very much special and people actually changed their names to portray their character through them (although for Alexander it is not the case - his father chose it to reflect his purpose in life, i think). If the Greek meaning of his name should be left out so should much of the other much more irrelevant points about his sexuality, character and other things all around this article. This is a very short comment after all. Thank you for reading. (edit by 87.203.66.106)</p>

<p>According to this propaganda, Alexander the Great has nothing to do with ancient Greece and this relation is just a misleading, a Greek conspiracy.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind it is very easy to understand why the etymology of the name of Alexander is something that must be kept hidden from the public.</p>

<p>What most people don't know is that the first parallel between Hitler and Alexander III was drawn by Hitler himself in the last page of Mein Kampf. Supporting this parallel is far from making a modern, open-minded, original conclusion; it is in fact a subconcsious promotion of Hitler's views. The swastika symbol was a parallel of various different, unrelated civilisations (it exists in Mycenaean pottery) and is not confined to India. Hence I'm afraid that much of your not-so-credible theory collapses. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:44, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I thank you for enlightening me about the swastika symbol. I was not aware that the swastika symbol existed in the Mycenaean civilization. But you failed to mention about Paranmahansa Yoganada's comments and observations about Hitler. Here, we have a highly respected Hindu guru telling some of his disciples about Hitler's past lives. Surely this is not from a not-so-credible source. Secondly, this is a theory that may never be proved by the ordinary public as reincarnation is not possible to be verified by scientific means. Anyway, these kinds of information about past lives is highly unaccessible by the ordinary masses as they have no knowledge about life after death and thus view these theories as nonsense. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 16:00, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, even if we assume that Paranmahansa Yoganada had never read nor heard about Hitler's self-comparison to Alexander, I still don't think that a Hindu's psychic observations can be regarded as credible scientific material. I hope you see the reason. It's not about being part of the ordinary or non-ordinary masses, it's simply about credibility. Even if I were 100% agreed with you, we'd still be powerless to promote those views since the current scholarly consensus doesn't recognise it at all. It would fall under original reasearch. I'm not even sure that those views would fit in the Indian wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:18, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You cannot compare Adolf Hitler to Alexander the Great. Alexander treated the people he conquered as equal citizens within his empire. Adolf Hitler killed people he conquered, burned down thousands of villages, and murdered 6 million Jews. Alexander spread Hellenism, taught people how to read and write when they did not even know how to wipe their own ass, and built great cities.

<dd>Breaking out his sexuality will segregate a contentious issue from less debated ones, serving to some extent the purpose of those trying to sanitize his image. It seems to me that three articles should be created, one "Alexander the great" briefly summarizing, in a couple of paragraphs, his image and role in history; one with his personal life, "Personal life of Alexander" including birth, death, and relationships; and another, "Conquests of Alexander" with his military exploits. 63K is too much to maintain, the article is unwieldy as it is. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 18:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You must not ask yourselves if “Alexander the Great” was Greek. It is useless to play with the words, “He was not Greek he was Macedonian…” “All tribes were named Greek much later...”. What we must specify is that the people that are naming themselves “Macedonians” (and I don’t refer to the people that live in northern Greece) are NOT the “descendants of the ancient Macedonians. First of all think about the language they are talking. It is Cyrillic or Slavic. It is not the language the ancient Macedonians were talking, which was ancient Greek. That shows that this people are descendants of the Slavic tribes, the nomads that were going here and there and they settled at the place centuries after the empire of Alexander “died”. So they don’t have the right to call themselves “Macedonians”. Macedonia has nothing to do with them. When the Greeks were producing Philosophy they were still banging rocks to make Fire. Minas.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">edited the Early Life refering to Bucephalus</span></h2>
<p>i edited the part of the early life narating how Alexander got Bucephalus.</p>
<p><b>originally</b> As Alexander was walking with his father one day, they came across a few men attempting to tame and mount a wild, black horse. Alexander immediately took a liking for the horse, and begged his father if he would buy it for him. Philip laughed and told him if he could mount the horse, he would. Alexander watched the horse's behavior, and soon realized that it was merely afraid of its own shadow. He walked over to the horse and faced it towards the sun to hide its shadow, and immediately was able to mount it. His father bought the horse, and he named it Bucephalus (which means "ox-head"). Bucephalus would be his loyal steed for the next two decades until it would die in battle</p>
<p><b>my edit</b> One time a Thessalian brought a black horse to sell it to Philip, but the horse was wild and no man could mount him. The young Alexander went to the horse, and turned him towards the sun for he had noticed that the horse was just afraid of his own shadow, then he was able to mount it and run it. His father and the people seeing it, was very impressed. And when the young Alexander returned and dismounted the horse, Philip kissed him with tears of joy and said "My son, see thee out a kingdom equal to thyself; Macedonia has not room for thee." The horse was named Bucephalus (which means "ox-head"). Bucephalus would be his companion and one of his best friends for the next two decades until when the horse died, according to Plutarch due to old age for he was already 30, other sources claimed that Bucephalus died wounded in a battle in India. Alexander then named a city after him called Bucephalia or Bucephala.</p>
