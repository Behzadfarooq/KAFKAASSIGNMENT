<p>Alexander Duncan McRae was born and raised on a farm in Ekfrid County, Ontario. His father was Duncan Alexander McRae and his mother was Mary (Mahwhinney) McRae. His cousin and longtime business partner, Andrew Davidson (b. May 18, 1853) came from the same area. The two of them each went on to study at a Business school in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatham%2C_Ontario_4c7e.html" title="Chatham, Ontario">Chatham, Ontario</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Early_career" id="Early_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Duncan_McRae_c953.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>In search of opportunities, at age 18 he went to work for his cousins, the brothers Alexander and Andrew Davidson of <a href="../../../d/u/l/Duluth%2C_Minnesota_117c.html" title="Duluth, Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>. The Davidsons had started in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Falls%2C_Minnesota_07bb.html" title="Little Falls, Minnesota">Little Falls, Minnesota</a>, working for a railway company and moved into banking. Andrew had become mayor and they were involved in the business of buying, marketing and financing railway land to homesteaders. Minnesota made Andrew an Honorary Colonel. Their Banking business spread through the region. In 1892, at 18 Alexander McRae joined them in Duluth and learned under Andrew.</p>
<p>McRae's first business venture on his own account started when his father put up $1,500 and McRae became a partner with the Davidsons in a company that insured grain elevators. The Davidson-McRae company sold fire and liability insurance and surety bonds. By the 1890s they had invested in various businesses and McRae became vice president of First National Bank of Hibbing. By age 25, he had $50,000 of his own earnings accumulated. He invested in other businesses such as a granite quarry.</p>
<p>He married Blaunche Latimer Howe, of Pennsylvania who was the daughter of wealthy a forest industry father. They married in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota_b081.html" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_23.html" title="February 23">February 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>. They would eventually have three daughters, Blanche, Lucile, and Margaret ("Peggy").</p>
<p>As McRae and the Davidsons saw Minnesota land go up in price and farmers moving west for more land, they realized the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Prairies_54dd.html" title="Canadian Prairies">Canadian prairies</a> were an opportunity. They formed the Saskatchewan Valley Land Company headquartered in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>In 1899 land in what later became <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> was $1 per acre. By 1902 they had 5 million acres worth $20 per acre.</p>
<p>Land in Saskatchewan between <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina%2C_Saskatchewan_e128.html" title="Regina, Saskatchewan">Regina</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatoon%2C_Saskatchewan_cc87.html" title="Saskatoon, Saskatchewan">Saskatoon</a> had been surveyed in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>. Railway companies there had land from building the railway. They could not get the government of buy it and thought land north of Regina was worthless. McRae and the Davidsons thought otherwise. They bought land from the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway first. Their first purchases amounted to close to a million acres for $1.53 an acre. They bought a further 100,000 acres from the Saskatchewan Western Railway. They then went to <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Canada_fd65.html" title="Government of Canada">Canadian Government</a> and bought land to fill in the gaps at $1 per acre. They agreed to terms that required them to actively seek settlers for the land. By the time they were done, their syndicate and the various companies it consisted of owned about 5 million acres of land.</p>
<p>In the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>, Davidson and McRae organized two promotional train tours from Minneapolis through to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Albert%2C_Saskatchewan_5f26.html" title="Prince Albert, Saskatchewan">Prince Albert</a>. Each of these journeys saw eight Pullman cars plus dining and baggage cars traveling through hundreds of miles of unbroken and uninhabited prairie lands. The passengers were wealthy investors from the United States. The promotion was a success. Large tracts were purchased and word spread in the business communities leading to further investment. The company developed a network of land agents to sell land to settlers which advertised and maintained sales offices in many locations. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> the population of the North West Territories (which then included <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> and most of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>) was 158,940. In five years it had grown to 443,175. In the course of that expansion, McRae became a very wealthy man.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Duncan_McRae_c953.html" title="Edit section: Business career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Business career</span></h2>
<p>When McRae arrived to live in Vancouver in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, he came intending to involve himself in business ventures as an active investor. Even before arriving to live on the west coast, he had invested in Canadian North Pacific Fisheries. In its first year, it made a half million dollars. In its second year the business failed. He moved on to invest in Wallace Fisheries and became its president.</p>
<p>He knew from his business ventures in the prairies that there was a shortage of lumber there for building. Working with his partner, Davidson, and Senator Peter Jansen of Nebraska, the Swift Brothers (meat packing), William Mackenzie and Donald Mann, he took over a sawmill and a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_town.html" title="Company town">company town</a> 3 miles upstream from New Westminster at a place called Millside, at Fraser Mills and now part of Coquitlam. Once he persuaded the government to dredge the Fraser River to permit reliable passage of ocean going freighters to the mill, he reorganized it as Fraser River Mills (after 1910 known as the Canadian Western Lumber Company) with several large investors and a capitalization of $20 million. The plant and its yards covered 80 acres and took 1,030 men to run. With an investment of $500,000 in new equipment and the acquisition or formation of related companies such as The Canadian Tugboat Company and the Comox Logging and Railway to transport timber from the 75,000 acres of timber the company controlled between <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comox%2C_British_Columbia_45e5.html" title="Comox, British Columbia">Comox</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campbell_River%2C_British_Columbia_0d90.html" title="Campbell River, British Columbia">Campbell River</a> on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>, the company became the largest lumber and wood manufacturing company in the world. The normal capacity of the mill was 750 thousand feet of lumber a day. In 1912 the mill produced 175 million board feet of lumber, enough to fill 42 rail cars a day. The mill ran around the clock. In the years after McRae's involvement, it eventually, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, was acquired by Crown Zellerbach, and, with further acquisitions, it became Fletcher Challenge Canada Limited in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. By <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> he had purchased canneries on Princess Royal Island and at Rivers Inlet and Smith's Inlet. He introduced mechanized canning to the fish packing industry. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, when World War I began, McRae was also president of Anacortes Lumber and Box Company, vice-president of Columbia River Lumber Company Ltd of Golden BC which became a subsidiary of Canadian Western and vice-president of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. of Victoria BC and president of Wallace Fisheries.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, as a recruit of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Hughes_84b6.html" title="Sam Hughes">Major General Sir Sam Hughes</a>, McRae volunteered with the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_British_Columbia_Regiment_%28Duke_of_Connaught%27s_Own%29_%28RCAC%29_7c5b.html" title="The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own) (RCAC)">Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles</a> as an honorary lieutenant colonel. When <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> broke out, McRae went to Europe where his first responsibility was the purchase of horses for the army. He reorganized the Remount Commission and was responsible for the purchase of 8,000 horses. He took over a department known for corruption and dysfunction and has been credited for turning it into a business like organization. Rumours led nevertheless to charges about the conduct of these acquisitions resulting in a royal commission under Quebec Chief Justice Sir Charles Peers Davidson. The commission cleared McRae of wrongdoing and commended him for his performance.</p>
<p>He carried on as director of supplies and services and when Hughes fell into disfavour in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>, McRae continued to advance. He was promoted the rank of Major General and in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, was made a member of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Bath_2ec6.html" title="Order of the Bath">Order of the Bath</a>. Later in the war effort, he was seconded to the British Government to organize Ministry of Information assisting Britain's Minister of Information, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Aitken%2C_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook_77d8.html" title="Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a>. For his services, it has been said that the British crown offered McRae knighthood, which he declined, although McRae himself never confirmed or denied that this happened.</p>
<p>He left the army in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> two months after the end of the war. Afterwards he had little involvement in the military although, in 1934, addressing the Senate, he predicted correctly that another war would erupt in Europe after touring Europe and interviewing various prominent men in France, Germany and Austria. In <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> his involvement was limited to helping raise financial support for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Legion_4565.html" title="Canadian Legion">Canadian Legion</a> and the <a href="../../../y/m/c/YMCA_8c40.html" title="YMCA">YMCA</a>. In his later careers, he was sometimes an advocate for returned veterans and in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> he donated his mansion in Vancouver's Shaughnessy, Hycroft, to the federal government for use as a hospital for wounded veterans.</p>

<p>After McRae settled in Vancouver in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> he proceeded to build a mansion for his family, to become known as Hycroft, in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaughnessy.html" title="Shaughnessy">Shaughnessy</a>, an exclusive suburb of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. The home was built on the brow of a hill on 5 and a half acres of land. The land upon which the 30 room, 3 story mansion was built cost $10,000 and the construction, completed in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> cost $100,000. The house was designed by Vancouver Architect Thomas Hooper. After the death of his wife Blanche in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, McRae donated the property and the building to the government of Canada to be used as a hospital for wounded veterans. Once converted, it housed 130 beds. In recent years, Hycroft has become the home of the University Women's Club.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> McRae organized a group of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Conservative_Party_8f59.html" title="British Columbia Conservative Party">British Columbia Conservative Party</a> dissidents he called the Committee of 100 which became the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provincial_Party_of_British_Columbia_c8f4.html" title="Provincial Party of British Columbia">Provincial Party of British Columbia</a>. The party sought freight rate equalization, cooperation with the federal government in the development of a northern railway, the elimination of Oriental labour, abolition of patronage, hiring of veterans and the elimination of income tax which had been introduced as a temporary measure during the war.</p>
<p>The party nominated candidates in only one provincial election: the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_general_election%2C_1924_381f.html" title="British Columbia general election, 1924">1924 election</a>. In that election, McRae claimed the Conservative government of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Oliver_%28politician%29_78f1.html" title="John Oliver (politician)">John Oliver</a> and the previous administration of Liberal Premier <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_John_Bowser_7005.html" title="William John Bowser">William John Bowser</a>, then the opposition leader, were corrupt.

He claimed that there were kickbacks, patronage and various wrongdoings. His allegations were never proven. He offered to pay for an independent audit of the books of the railway. His offer was declined.</p>
<p>Although the party achieved 24% of the popular vote in the 1924 election and took 3 seats, McRae was not elected. Both Bowser and Oliver lost their seats but Oliver continued to lead his conservative party as Premier of a minority government after the election.</p>
<p>McRae reconciled with his former Conservative allies after the election and went on to federal politics. The Provincial Party disappeared.</p>

<p>In the early 1930s McRae purchased 260 acres of ocean front bluff land in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Qualicum_Beach%2C_British_Columbia_778f.html" title="Qualicum Beach, British Columbia">Qualicum Beach</a> on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> he built a country home, constructed of logs, 200 feet long and 50 feet wide. The property and its development were significant relief for the local population in the depressed economy of the 1930s. The home, which Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth and her husband stayed at for a private visit in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> during their honeymoon during subsequent ownership, burned to the ground in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. McRae also took up farming with the purchase of 2,000 acres of land near Qualicum Beach. He employed about a hundred men in its operation for the 13 or 14 years that he owned it. He bred sheep and cattle. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
