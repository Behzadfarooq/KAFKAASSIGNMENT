<p>Alexander Webb was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to a prominent family with a strong military lineage. His father was the well-known newspaper owner and diplomat (minister to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> in 1861), James Watson Webb, a former <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_Army_8fde.html" title="Regular Army">Regular Army</a> officer.

Initially, the brigade resented having the meticulously groomed and well-dressed Webb as their commanding officer, but he soon earned their respect through his attention to detail, his affability, and his discipline.</p>
<p><a name="Gettysburg" id="Gettysburg"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_S._Webb_5d56.html" title="Edit section: Gettysburg">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gettysburg</span></h3>
<p>Webb's most memorable military service was at Gettysburg. His brigade was posted on <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetery_Ridge_c28d.html" title="Cemetery Ridge">Cemetery Ridge</a> with the rest of the II Corps on the morning of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>. The brigade repulsed the assault of Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrose_R._Wright_03c0.html" title="Ambrose R. Wright">Ambrose R. Wright</a>'s brigade of Georgians as it topped the ridge late in the afternoon, chasing the Confederates back as far as the Emmitsburg Road, where they captured about 300 men and reclaimed a Union battery. Soon after, Webb sent two regiments to assist in counterattacking the assault of Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../j/u/b/Jubal_A._Early_4948.html" title="Jubal A. Early">Jubal A. Early</a>'s division on <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetery_Hill_114b.html" title="Cemetery Hill">Cemetery Hill</a>.<sup id="_ref-Tagg5051_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tagg5051" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">July 3</a>, Webb's brigade happened to be in the center of the Union line to defend against <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickett%27s_Charge_9eb6.html" title="Pickett's Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>, in front of the famous "Copse of Trees." As the Confederates launched a massive artillery barrage to prepare for their infantry assault, Webb made himself conspicuous to his men, many of whom were unfamiliar with their new commander. He stood in front of the line and leaned on his sword, puffing leisurely on a cigar while cannonballs whistled by and shells exploded all around. Although his men shouted at him to take shelter, he refused and impressed many with his personal bravery. As Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Pickett_e058.html" title="George Pickett">George Pickett</a>'s Virginia division approached to within a few yards, two companies of Webb's 71st Pennsylvania ran away, and Webb feared the personal disgrace of a breakthrough in his line. He shouted to his neighboring 72nd Pennsylvania to charge, but they refused to budge. He attempted to grab their regimental colors and go forward with them himself, but apparently the standard bearer did not recognize him, because he fought Webb for the colors before he went down, shot numerous times. Webb ultimately gave up on the 72nd and strode directly in front of the chaos as Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Armistead_6585.html" title="Lewis Armistead">Lewis Armistead</a>'s Confederate brigade breached the low stone wall, over to his 69th Pennsylvania regiment. Webb was wounded in his thigh and groin by a bullet, but kept going. With the help of two of Col. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_J._Hall_d973.html" title="Norman J. Hall">Norman J. Hall</a>'s New York regiments, and Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Harrow_1452.html" title="William Harrow">William Harrow</a>'s men, who ran over in a mass to get in their shots, Webb and his men brought the Confederate assault to a standstill, inflicting heavy casualties.<sup id="_ref-Tagg5051_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tagg5051" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Webb was promoted to brevet major general of volunteers for his service that Gettysburg, effective <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>. He was awarded the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>, for "distinguished personal gallantry in leading his men forward at a critical period in the contest" at Gettysburg on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">July 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>.</p>

<p>After Gettysburg, Webb received command of the division six weeks later and led it through the fall campaigns. When Gibbon returned to command in the spring of 1864, Webb went back to brigade command for the <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overland_Campaign_5734.html" title="Overland Campaign">Overland Campaign</a>. At the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Spotsylvania_Court_House_c11b.html" title="Battle of Spotsylvania Court House">Battle of Spotsylvania Court House</a>, in May, he was hit by a bullet that passed through the corner of his right eye and came out his ear, but did not impair his mental abilities. He returned to the army, in January 1865, as chief of staff of the Army of the Potomac. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general and brevet major general in the regular army on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>. At the end of hostilities, he became the assistant inspector general of the Military Division of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>General Webb stayed with the Army until 1870, assigned as a lieutenant colonel to the 44th U.S. Infantry, and later the 5th U.S. Infantry. During his final year, he served again as an instructor at West Point.</p>

<p>After leaving the Army, Webb was president of the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_College_of_New_York_8e2f.html" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> from 1869 to 1902. He was an articulate and graphic author who wrote extensively about the Civil War, including his book published in 1881, <i>The Peninsula: McClellan's Campaign of 1862</i>. A full-length bronze statue of him stands at <a href="../../../g/e/t/Gettysburg_Battlefield_0e29.html" title="Gettysburg Battlefield">Gettysburg Battlefield</a>, overlooking the approach of Pickett's Charge.</p>
<p>Col. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_S._Wainwright_2a95.html" title="Charles S. Wainwright">Charles S. Wainwright</a>, chief of artillery of the <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Corps_%28ACW%29_3f31.html" title="I Corps (ACW)">I Corps</a>, a friend and social peer of Webb in New York City, wrote that he was one of the "most conscientious, hard working and fearless young officers that we have." Meade's aide Theodore Lyman considered him "jolly and pleasant," although he was put off by Webb's "way of suddenly laughing in a convulsive manner, by drawing in his breath, instead of letting it out—the way which goes to my bones." But Lyman regarded Webb as a "thorough soldier, wide-awake, quick, and attentive to detail," despite this annoying quirk.</p>
<p>Webb died in <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdale%2C_The_Bronx_68f8.html" title="Riverdale, The Bronx">Riverdale, New York</a>. He is buried in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Point_National_Cemetery_80e1.html" title="West Point National Cemetery">West Point National Cemetery</a>.</p>
