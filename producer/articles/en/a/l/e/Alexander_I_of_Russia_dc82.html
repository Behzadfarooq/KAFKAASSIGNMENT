Alexander succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered, and ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. In the first half of his ruling Alexander tried to introduce liberal reforms whilst in the second half he turned to a much more arbitrary manner of conduct, which led to the abolishing of many early reforms. In foreign policy Alexander gained certain success, having won several campaigns. In particular under his rule Russia acquired Finland and part of Poland. The strange contradictions of his character make Alexander one of the most interesting Tsars. Adding to this, his death was shrouded in mystery, and location of his body remains unknown.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Russia_dc82.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Soon after his birth on December 23, 1777, Alexander was taken from his father, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_I_of_Russia_ddc6.html" title="Paul I of Russia">Paul I of Russia</a>, by his grandmother, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_II_of_Russia_52bd.html" title="Catherine II of Russia">Catherine the Great</a>, who utterly disliked Paul and did not want him to have any influence on the future emperor. Some sources allege that she created the plan to remove Paul from succession altogether. Both sides tried to use Alexander for their own purposes and he was torn emotionally between his grandmother and his father, the heir to the throne. This taught Alexander very early on how to manipulate those who loved him, and he became a natural chameleon, changing his views and personality depending on whom he was with at the time. Reared in the free-thinking atmosphere of the court of Catherine, he had imbibed the principles of <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_3039.html" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Rousseau's</a> gospel of humanity from his <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss.html" title="Swiss">Swiss</a> tutor, <a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-C%C3%A9sar_de_La_Harpe_7105.html" title="Frédéric-César de La Harpe">Frédéric-César de La Harpe</a>, and the traditions of Russian autocracy from his military governor, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolay_Saltykov_2445.html" title="Nikolay Saltykov">Nikolay Saltykov</a>. Young Alexander sympathised with <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_revolution.html" title="French revolution">French</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/%C5%9B/Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Uprising_8d8d.html" title="Kościuszko Uprising">Polish revolutionaries</a>, however, his father seemed to have taught him to combine a theoretical love of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mankind.html" title="Mankind">mankind</a> with a practical contempt for men. These contradictory tendencies remained with him through life and are observed in his dualism in <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_policy.html" title="Domestic policy">domestic</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_policy.html" title="Foreign policy">military</a> policy.</p>
<p>In 1793, when Alexander was 16 years old, he married the 14 year old <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_of_Baden_7fbb.html" title="Louise of Baden">Louise of Baden</a>. Meanwhile the death of Catherine in November, 1796 brought his father, Paul I, to the throne. Paul's attempts at reform were met with hostility and many of his closest advisors as well as Alexander were against his proposed changes. Paul I was murdered in March, 1801.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Russia_dc82.html" title="Edit section: Succession to the throne">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Succession to the throne</span></h2>
<p>Alexander I succeeded to the throne on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">23 March</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>, and was crowned in the <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin.html" title="Kremlin">Kremlin</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a> of that year. Historians still debate about Alexander’s role in this murder. The most common opinion is that he was in favor of taking the throne but insisted that his <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_I_of_Russia_ddc6.html" title="Paul I of Russia">father</a> would not be killed.</p>
<p>At first, indeed, this exercised little influence on the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_Russia_4dbc.html" title="Emperor of Russia">Emperor's</a> life. The young Tsar was determined to reform the outdated, centralised systems of government that Russia relied upon. While retaining for a time the old <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_minister.html" title="Political minister">ministers</a> who had served and overthrown the Emperor Paul, one of the first acts of his reign was to appoint the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Committee_cc38.html" title="Private Committee">Private Committee</a>, also called ironically the "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_of_Public_Safety_40cd.html" title="Committee of Public Safety">Comite du salut public</a>", comprising young and enthusiastic friends of his own - <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Palvovich_Kochubey_0f7d.html" title="Victor Palvovich Kochubey">Victor Kochubey</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolay_Nikolayevich_Novosiltsev_56d2.html" title="Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev">Nikolay Novosiltsev</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavel_Alexandrovich_Stroganov_e1c3.html" title="Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov">Pavel Stroganov</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Jerzy_Czartoryski_0811.html" title="Adam Jerzy Czartoryski">Adam Jerzy Czartoryski</a> - to draw up a scheme of internal reform, which was supposed to result in an establishing of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> in accordance with teachings of the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Also Alexander wanted to resolve another crucial issue in Russia - the future of the serfs, although this was not achieved until 1861.</p>
<p>In the very beginning of Alexander's rule several notable steps were made, including establishing freedom for <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishing_house.html" title="Publishing house">publishing houses</a>, the winding down of activities in the intelligence services and prohibition of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>. Several years later the liberal <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Speransky_43bc.html" title="Mikhail Speransky">Mikhail Speransky</a> became one of the Tsar's closest advisors, and drew up many plans for elaborate reforms. Their aims, inspired by their admiration for <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">English</a> institutions, far outstripped the possibilities of the time, and even after they had been raised to regular ministerial positions little of their programme could come to pass. <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Russia</a> was not ready for a more <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> society; and Alexander, the disciple of the progressive teacher Laharpe, was—as he himself said—but "a happy accident" on the throne of the tsars. He spoke, indeed, bitterly of "the state of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarism.html" title="Barbarism">barbarism</a> in which the country had been left by the traffic in men”.</p>

<p>The codification of the laws initiated in 1801 was never carried out during his reign; nothing was done to improve the intolerable status of the Russian peasantry; the constitution drawn up by <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Speransky_43bc.html" title="Mikhail Speransky">Mikhail Speransky</a>, and passed by the emperor, remained unsigned. Finally elaborate intrigues against Speransky initiated by his political rivals led to the loss of support of Alexander and subsequent removal in March 1812.</p>
<p>Alexander, in fact, who, without being consciously tyrannical, possessed in full measure the <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrant.html" title="Tyrant">tyrant</a>'s characteristic distrust of men of ability and independent judgment, lacked also the first requisite for a reforming sovereign: confidence in his people; and it was this want that vitiated such reforms as were actually realized. He experimented in the outlying provinces of his <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">Empire</a>; and the Russians noted with open murmurs that, not content with governing through foreign instruments, he was conferring on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_provinces.html" title="Baltic provinces">Baltic provinces</a> benefits denied to themselves.</p>

<p>In Russia, too, certain reforms were carried out, but they could not survive the suspicious interference of the autocrat and his officials.

<p>The elaborate system of education, culminating in the reconstituted, or new-founded, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">universities</a> of <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorpat.html" title="Dorpat">Dorpat</a> (Tartu), <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna.html" title="Vilna">Vilna</a> (Vilnius), <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazan.html" title="Kazan">Kazan</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkov.html" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a>, was strangled in the supposed interests of "order" and of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Orthodox_Church_4988.html" title="Russian Orthodox Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>; while the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_settlements.html" title="Military settlements">military settlements</a> which Alexander proclaimed as a blessing to both soldiers and state were forced on the unwilling peasantry and army with pitiless cruelty.

<p>Autocrat and "<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobin_%28politics%29.html" title="Jacobin (politics)">Jacobin</a>", man of the world and mystic, he appeared to his contemporaries as a riddle which each read according to his own temperament. <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_I_of_France_e789.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon I</a> thought him a "shifty <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derogatory_use_of_Byzantine_63af.html" title="Derogatory use of Byzantine">Byzantine</a>", and called him the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph_Talma_9a4a.html" title="François Joseph Talma">Talma</a> of the North, as ready to play any conspicuous part.

Alexander's grandiose imagination was, however, more strongly attracted by the great questions of European politics than by attempts at domestic reform which, on the whole, wounded his pride by proving to him the narrow limits of absolute power.</p>

<p>Upon his accession, Alexander reversed the policy of his father, Paul, denounced the League of Neutrals, and made peace with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> (April 1801). At the same time he opened negotiations with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_3c65.html" title="Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor">Francis II</a> of the Holy Roman Empire. Soon afterwards at <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klaip%C4%97da.html" title="Klaipėda">Memel</a> he entered into a close alliance with <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Prussia_1910.html" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Prussia</a>, not as he boasted from motives of policy, but in the spirit of true <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chivalry.html" title="Chivalry">chivalry</a>, out of <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendship.html" title="Friendship">friendship</a> for the young <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Kings_of_Prussia_dc0f.html" title="List of Kings of Prussia">King</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia_7406.html" title="Frederick William III of Prussia">Frederick William III</a> and his beautiful wife <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz_c32b.html" title="Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a>.</p>
<p>The development of this alliance was interrupted by the short-lived peace of October 1801; and for a while it seemed as though <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Consulate_7c45.html" title="French Consulate">France</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Russia</a> might come to an understanding. Carried away by the enthusiasm of Laharpe, who had returned to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, Alexander began openly to proclaim his admiration for French institutions and for the person of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_I_of_France_e789.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>. Soon, however, came a change. Laharpe, after a new visit to Paris, presented to the Tsar his Reflections on the True Nature of the Consul for Life, which, as Alexander said, tore the veil from his eyes, and revealed Bonaparte "as not a true <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriot</a>", but only as "the most famous tyrant the world has produced." Alexander's disillusionment was completed by the murder of the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis-Antoine-Henri_de_Bourbon-Cond%C3%A9%2C_duc_d%27Enghien_7df7.html" title="Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, duc d'Enghien">duc d'Enghien</a>. The Russian court went into mourning for the last member of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princes_of_Cond%C3%A9_fac6.html" title="Princes of Condé">House of Condé</a>, and diplomatic relations with France were broken off.</p>

<p>The events of the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> that followed belong to the general history of Europe; but Alexander's attitude throughout is personal to himself, though pregnant with issues momentous for the world. In opposing Napoleon I, "the oppressor of Europe and the disturber of the world's peace," Alexander in fact already believed himself to be fulfilling a divine mission. In his instructions to Novosiltsov, his special envoy in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, the Tsar elaborated the motives of his policy in language which appealed as little to the common sense of the prime minister, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Pitt_the_Younger_25e2.html" title="William Pitt the Younger">Pitt</a>, as did later the treaty of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Alliance_f666.html" title="Holy Alliance">Holy Alliance</a> to that of the foreign minister, Castlereagh. Yet the document is of great interest, as in it we find formulated for the first time in an official dispatch those exalted ideals of international policy which were to play so conspicuous a part in the affairs of the world at the close of the revolutionary epoch, and issued at the end of the 19th century in the Rescript of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II</a> and the conference of the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague.html" title="Hague">Hague</a>. The outcome of the war, Alexander argued, was not to be only the liberation of France, but the universal triumph of "the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred.html" title="Sacred">sacred</a> <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">rights of humanity</a>". To attain this it would be necessary "after having attached the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nations</a> to their <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> by making these incapable of acting save in the greatest interests of their subjects, to fix the relations of the states amongst each other on more precise rules, and such as it is to their interest to respect."</p>
<p>A general treaty was to become the basis of the relations of the states forming "the European Confederation"; and this, though "it was no question of realizing the dream of universal peace, would attain some of its results if, at the conclusion of the general war, it were possible to establish on clear principles the prescriptions of the rights of nations." "Why could not one submit to it", the Tsar continued, "the positive rights of nations, assure the privilege of neutrality, insert the obligation of never beginning war until all the resources which the mediation of a third party could offer have been exhausted, having by this means brought to light the respective grievances, and tried to remove them? It is on such principles as these that one could proceed to a general pacification, and give birth to a league of which the stipulations would form, so to speak, a new code of the law of nations, which, sanctioned by the greater part of the nations of Europe, would without difficulty become the immutable rule of the cabinets, while those who should try to infringe it would risk bringing upon themselves the forces of the new union."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Napoleon, a little deterred by the Russian autocrat's youthful ideology, never gave up hope of detaching him from the coalition. He had no sooner entered <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in triumph than he opened negotiations with him; he resumed them after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Austerlitz_4bfe.html" title="Battle of Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2.html" title="December 2">December 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a>). <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> and France, he urged, were "geographical allies"; there was, and could be, between them no true conflict of interests; together they might rule the world. But Alexander was still determined "to persist in the system of disinterestedness in respect of all the states of Europe which he had thus far followed", and he again allied himself with the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Prussia_1910.html" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. The campaign of <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jena.html" title="Jena">Jena</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Eylau_89b9.html" title="Battle of Eylau">battle of Eylau</a> followed; and Napoleon, though still intent on the Russian alliance, stirred up <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turks</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> to break the obstinacy of the Tsar. A party too in Russia itself, headed by the Tsar's brother <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duke_Constantine_Pavlovich_of_Russia_cc47.html" title="Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia">Constantine Pavlovich</a>, was clamorous for peace; but Alexander, after a vain attempt to form a new coalition, summoned the Russian nation to a holy war against Napoleon as the enemy of the Orthodox faith. The outcome was the rout of <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedland.html" title="Friedland">Friedland</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>/ <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">14</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>). Napoleon saw his chance and seized it. Instead of making heavy terms, he offered to the chastened autocrat his alliance, and a partnership in his glory.</p>
<p>The two Emperors met at <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilsit.html" title="Tilsit">Tilsit</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">25 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>. Alexander, dazzled by Napoleon's <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a> and overwhelmed by his apparent generosity, was completely won over. Napoleon knew well how to appeal to the exuberant imagination of his new-found friend. He would divide with Alexander the Empire of the world; as a first step he would leave him in possession of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube_River_00e7.html" title="Danube River">Danubian</a> principalities and give him a free hand to deal with <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>; and, afterwards, the Emperors of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Roman_Empire_92c8.html" title="Eastern Roman Empire">East</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Roman_Empire_0efe.html" title="Western Roman Empire">West</a>, when the time should be ripe, would drive the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Turks</a> from Europe and march across Asia to the conquest of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">India</a>. A programme so stupendous awoke in Alexander's impressionable mind an ambition to which he had hitherto been a stranger. The interests of Europe were forgotten. "What is Europe?" he exclaimed to the French ambassador. "Where is it, if it is not you and we?"</p>
<p><a name="Prussia" id="Prussia"></a></p>

<p>The brilliance of these new visions did not, however, blind Alexander to the obligations of friendship; and he refused to retain the Danubian principalities as the price for suffering a further dismemberment of Prussia. "We have made loyal war", he said, "we must make a loyal peace." It was not long before the first enthusiasm of <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilsit.html" title="Tilsit">Tilsit</a> began to wane. Napoleon I was prodigal of promises, but niggard of their fulfillment. The French remained in Prussia, the Russians on the Danube; and each accused the other of breach of faith. Meanwhile, however, the personal relations of Alexander and Napoleon were of the most cordial character; and it was hoped that a fresh meeting might adjust all differences between them. The meeting took place at <a href="../../../e/r/f/Erfurt.html" title="Erfurt">Erfurt</a> in October, 1808, and resulted in a treaty which defined the common policy of the two Emperors. But Alexander's relations with Napoleon none the less suffered a change. He realized that in Napoleon sentiment never got the better of reason, that as a matter of fact he had never intended his proposed "grand enterprise" seriously, and had only used it to preoccupy the mind of the Tsar while he consolidated his own power in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Europe_1cd5.html" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a>. From this moment the French alliance was for Alexander also not a fraternal agreement to rule the world, but an affair of pure policy. He used it, in the first instance, to remove "the geographical enemy" from the gates of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> by wresting <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> from the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedes</a> (1809); and he hoped by means of it to make the Danube the southern frontier of Russia.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Russia_dc82.html" title="Edit section: Franco-Russian Alliance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Franco-Russian Alliance</span></h3>
<p>Events were in fact rapidly tending to the rupture of the Franco-Russian alliance. Alexander, indeed, assisted Napoleon in the war of 1809, but he declared plainly that he would not allow the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_Empire_a475.html" title="Austrian Empire">Austrian Empire</a> to be crushed out of existence; and Napoleon complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign. The Tsar in his turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>. In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. "I don't want anything for myself", he said to the French ambassador, "therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, if it is a question of its restoration."</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Vienna_480d.html" title="Treaty of Vienna">Treaty of Vienna</a>, which added largely to the <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Warsaw_b51f.html" title="Duchy of Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a>, he complained had "ill requited him for his loyalty", and he was only mollified for the time by Napoleon's public declaration that he had no intention of restoring Poland, and by a convention, signed on the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a> but not ratified, abolishing the Polish name and orders of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chivalry.html" title="Chivalry">chivalry</a>.</p>
<p>But if Alexander suspected Napoleon, Napoleon was no less suspicious of Alexander; and, partly to test his sincerity, he sent an almost peremptory request for the hand of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_8a94.html" title="Grand Duchess">Grand Duchess</a> <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Pavlovna_of_Russia_e520.html" title="Anna Pavlovna of Russia">Anne</a>, the younger sister of the Tsar. After some little delay Alexander returned a polite refusal, on the plea of the tender age of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a> and the objection of the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_dowager.html" title="Empress dowager">Empress dowager</a> <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Marie_Dorothea_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg_5dcd.html" title="Sophie Marie Dorothea of Württemberg">Maria Fyodorovna</a> to the marriage. Napoleon's answer was to refuse to ratify the convention of the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a> and to announce his engagement to the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archduke.html" title="Archduke">Archduchess</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Louise_of_Austria_9b5a.html" title="Marie Louise of Austria">Marie Louise</a> in such a way as to lead Alexander to suppose that the two marriage treaties had been negotiated simultaneously. From this time the relation between the two emperors gradually became more and more strained.</p>
<p>The annexation of <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldenburg_%28state%29.html" title="Oldenburg (state)">Oldenburg</a>, of which the Duke of Oldenburg (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1754.html" title="1754">1754</a>–<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a>) was the Tsar's uncle, to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> in December, 1810, added another to the personal grievances of Alexander against Napoleon; while the ruinous reaction of "the continental system" on Russian trade made it impossible for the Tsar to maintain a policy which was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance. An acid correspondence followed, and ill-concealed armaments, which culminated in the summer of 1812 with <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_invasion_of_Russia_%281812%29_a618.html" title="French invasion of Russia (1812)">Napoleon's invasion of Russia</a>. Yet, even after the French had passed the frontier, Alexander still protested that his personal sentiments towards the Emperor were unaltered; "but", he added, "<a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> Himself cannot undo the past". It was the occupation of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and the desecration of the <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin.html" title="Kremlin">Kremlin</a>, the sacred centre of Holy Russia, that changed his sentiment for Napoleon into passionate hatred.

Alexander returned no answer to these "fanfaronnades". "No more peace with Napoleon!" he cried, "He or I, I or He: we cannot longer reign together!"</p>

<p>The campaign of 1812 was the turning-point of Alexander's life; and its horrors, for which his sensitive nature felt much of the responsibility, overset still more a mind never too well balanced. When Napoleon crossed the Russian border with his <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Army_0c50.html" title="Grand Army">Grand Army</a>, Alexander I was quite unprepared for the war, trusting the Francophile chancellor <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumyantsev.html" title="Rumyantsev">Nikolay Rumyantsev</a> more than his French ambassador <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Kurakin_4a2f.html" title="Alexander Kurakin">Alexander Kurakin</a>, who had warned him about Napoleon's bellicose plans. Russia proclaimed a <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon%27s_invasion_of_Russia_a24a.html" title="Napoleon's invasion of Russia">Patriotic War</a> in defence of the Motherland. At the burning of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, he declared afterwards, his own <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> had found illumination, and he had realized once for all the divine revelation to him of his mission as the peacemaker of Europe. Ironically, many people compared him to Napolean because of his genuine idea of scorched earth policy which burnt down 2/3 of Moscow but elimanated the French troops from occupying the "Great Bear", Russia. He tried to calm the unrest of his conscience by correspondence with the leaders of the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> revival on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>, and sought for <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omen.html" title="Omen">omens</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> guidance in texts and passages of <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">scripture</a>. It was not, however, according to his own account, till he met the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Juliana%2C_Baroness_von_Krudener_9694.html" title="Barbara Juliana, Baroness von Krudener">Baroness de Krüdener</a> — a religious adventuress who made the conversion of princes her special mission—at <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basel.html" title="Basel">Basel</a>, in the autumn of 1813, that his soul found peace.

<p>Once a suppoter of limited liberalism, as seen in his approval of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland_708b.html" title="Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland">Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland</a> in 1815, from the end of the year 1818 Alexander's views began to change. A <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolutionary</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28political%29.html" title="Conspiracy (political)">conspiracy</a> among the officers of the guard, and a foolish plot to kidnap him on his way to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Aix-la-Chapelle_%281818%29_1370.html" title="Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)">Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle</a>, are said to have shaken the foundations of his <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">Liberalism</a>. At Aix he came for the first time into intimate contact with <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klemens_Wenzel_von_Metternich_1cef.html" title="Klemens Wenzel von Metternich">Metternich</a>. From this time dates the ascendancy of Metternich over the mind of the Russian Emperor and in the councils of Europe. It was, however, no case of sudden conversion. Though alarmed by the revolutionary agitation in Germany, which culminated in the murder of his agent, the dramatist <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_von_Kotzebue_5061.html" title="August von Kotzebue">August von Kotzebue</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/1/1819.html" title="1819">1819</a>), Alexander approved of Castlereagh's protest against Metternich's policy of "the governments contracting an alliance against the peoples", as formulated in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlsbad_Decrees_43a6.html" title="Carlsbad Decrees">Carlsbad Decrees</a> of July 1819, and deprecated any intervention of Europe to support "a league of which the sole object is the absurd pretensions of absolute power".</p>
<p>He still declared his belief in "free institutions, though not in such as age forced from feebleness, nor contracts ordered by popular leaders from their sovereigns, nor constitutions granted in difficult circumstances to tide over a crisis. "Liberty", he maintained, "should be confined within just limits. And the limits of liberty are the principles of order".</p>
<p>It was the apparent triumph of the principles of disorder in the revolutions of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_%28Italy%29_cbbb.html" title="Piedmont (Italy)">Piedmont</a>, combined with increasingly disquieting symptoms of discontent in France, Germany, and among his own people, that completed Alexander's conversion. In the seclusion of the little town of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troppau.html" title="Troppau">Troppau</a>, where in October 1820 the powers met in conference, <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klemens_Wenzel_von_Metternich_1cef.html" title="Klemens Wenzel von Metternich">Metternich</a> found an opportunity for cementing his influence over Alexander, which had been wanting amid the turmoil and feminine intrigues of Vienna and Aix. Here, in confidence begotten of friendly chats over afternoon tea, the disillusioned autocrat confessed his mistake. "You have nothing to regret", he said sadly to the exultant chancellor, "but I have!"</p>
<p>The issue was momentous. In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolized by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolized by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">19 November</a> he signed the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troppau_Protocol_1e8d.html" title="Troppau Protocol">Troppau Protocol</a>, which consecrated the principle of intervention and wrecked the harmony of the concert.</p>

<p>At <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Laibach_8281.html" title="Congress of Laibach">Congress of Laibach</a>, whither in the spring of 1821 the congress had been adjourned, Alexander first heard of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_War_of_Independence_9b18.html" title="Greek War of Independence">Revolt of the Greeks</a>. From this time until his death his mind was torn between his anxiety to realize his dream of a confederation of Europe and his traditional mission as leader of the Orthodox crusade against the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. At first, under the careful nursing of <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klemens_Wenzel_von_Metternich_1cef.html" title="Klemens Wenzel von Metternich">Metternich</a>, the former motive prevailed.</p>
<p>He struck the name of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Ypsilanti_%281792-1828%29_b602.html" title="Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)">Alexander Ypsilanti</a> from the Russian army list, and directed his foreign minister, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Capodistria_7b9b.html" title="John Capodistria">Giovanni, Count Capo d'Istria</a>, himself a Greek, to disavow all sympathy of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> with his enterprise; and, next year, a deputation of the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morea.html" title="Morea">Morea</a> Greeks on its way to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Verona_09b8.html" title="Congress of Verona">Congress of Verona</a> was turned back by his orders on the road.</p>
<p>He made, indeed, some effort to reconcile the principles at conflict in his mind. He offered to surrender the claim, successfully asserted when the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Sultan_aa3a.html" title="Ottoman Sultan">Ottoman Sultan</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmud_II_63fc.html" title="Mahmud II">Mahmud II</a> had been excluded from the Holy Alliance and the affairs of the Ottoman empire from the deliberations of Vienna, that the affairs of the East were the "domestic concerns of Russia", and to march into the Ottoman Empire, as Austria had marched into <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>, "as the mandatory of Europe".</p>
<p>Metternich's opposition to this, illogical, but natural from the Austrian point of view, first opened his eyes to the true character of Austria's attitude towards his ideals. Once more in Russia, far from the fascination of Metternich's personality, the immemorial spirit of his people drew him back into itself; and when, in the autumn of 1825, he took his dying Empress <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_of_Baden_7fbb.html" title="Louise of Baden">Louise of Baden</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">January 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1779.html" title="1779">1779</a>–<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826.html" title="1826">1826</a>) for change of air to the south of Russia, in order—as all Europe supposed—to place himself at the head of the great army concentrated near the Ottoman frontiers, his language was no longer that of "the peace-maker of Europe", but of the Orthodox Tsar determined to take the interests of his people and of his religion "into his own hands". Before the momentous issue could be decided, however, Alexander died, "crushed", to use his own words, "beneath the terrible burden of a crown" which he had more than once declared his intention of resigning.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In the autumn of 1825, due to increasing illness of Alexander's wife, the Emperor undertook a voyage to the south of Russia. During this trip, he himself caught a cold which developed into typhus, from which he died in the southern city of <a href="../../../t/a/g/Taganrog.html" title="Taganrog">Taganrog</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a> (O.S.)/<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1825.html" title="1825">1825</a>. His wife died a few months later, as the emperor's body was transported to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_adeb.html" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> for the funeral. He was interred at the Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral of the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_and_Paul_Fortress_6208.html" title="Peter and Paul Fortress">Peter and Paul Fortress</a> in St. Petersburg on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826.html" title="1826">1826</a>.</p>
<p>The unexpected death of the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_Russia_4dbc.html" title="Emperor of Russia">Emperor of Russia</a> far from the capital caused persistent rumours that his death and funeral were staged, while the emperor allegedly renounced the crown and retired to spend the rest of his life in solitude. It was rumoured that a "soldier" was buried as Alexander, or that the grave was empty, or that a British ambassador at the Russian court said he had seen Alexander boarding a ship. Some claimed that the former emperor had become a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> in either <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pochaev_Lavra_5f63.html" title="Pochaev Lavra">Pochaev Lavra</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievo-Pecherskaya_Lavra_8c26.html" title="Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra">Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra</a> or elsewhere. Many people, including some historians, supposed that a mysterious hermit Feodor Kuzmich (or <i>Kozmich</i>) who emerged in <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberia.html" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> in 1836 and died in the vicinity of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomsk.html" title="Tomsk">Tomsk</a> in 1864, was in fact Alexander I under an assumed identity. While there are testimonies that "Feodor Kozmich" in his earlier life might have belonged to a higher society, his identity as Alexander I was never established beyond the reasonable doubt. In 1925, the Soviets had his tomb opened, and it was found to indeed be empty. The truth remains unknown.</p>
<p>The immediate aftermath of Alexander's death was also marked by confusion regarding the order of succession and by the attempt of military coup-d'etat by liberal-minded officers. The <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_presumptive.html" title="Heir presumptive">heir presumptive</a>, <a href="../../../t/s/e/Tsesarevich.html" title="Tsesarevich">Tsesarevich</a> and Grand Duke <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duke_Constantine_Pavlovich_of_Russia_cc47.html" title="Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia">Constantine Pavlovich</a> had in 1822 renounced his rights of succession, but this act was not publicly announced, nor known to anybody outside of few people within the tsar's family. For this reason, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a> (O.S.), <a href="../../../1/8/2/1825.html" title="1825">1825</a> the population, including Constantine's younger brother <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_I_of_Russia_77e9.html" title="Nicholas I of Russia">Nicholas</a>, swore allegiance to Constantine. After the true order of succession was disclosed to the imperial family and general public, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_I_of_Russia_77e9.html" title="Nicholas I of Russia">Nicholas I</a> ordered that the allegiance to him to be sworn on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a> (O.S.), <a href="../../../1/8/2/1825.html" title="1825">1825</a>. Seizing the opportunity, the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decembrists.html" title="Decembrists">Decembrists</a> revolted, allegedly to defend Constantine's rights to the throne, but in fact - in order to initiate the change of regime in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_I_284a.html" title="Nicholas I">Nicholas I</a> brutally suppressed the rebellion and sent the ringleaders to the gallows and Siberia.</p>
<p>Some confidantes of Alexander I reported that in the last years the Emperor was aware that the secret societies of future <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decembrists.html" title="Decembrists">Decembrists</a> were plotting the revolt, but chose not to act against them, remarking that these officers were sharing "the delusions of his own youth." Historians believe that these secret societies appeared after the Russian officers returned from their <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_wars.html" title="Napoleonic wars">Napoleonic campaigns</a> in Europe in 1815.</p>
