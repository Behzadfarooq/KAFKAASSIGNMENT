<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Delaware_84b9.html" title="Edit section: 1: When The Bough Breaks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1: When The Bough Breaks</span></h2>
<p>The first appearance of Alex Delaware. In this novel we learn that Delaware is a relatively young and quite successful, albeit retired, Child Psychologist. He regarded himself as a workaholic, and dedicated his life to his work. (The scope of the sorts of projects Alex took on as a Child Psychologist are slowly revealed over the course of this series).</p>
<p>When he found the dead body of infamous child molester Stuart Hickle, the overwhelming shock eventually led to Delaware's desire to retire. It is during the investigation of the death of Stuart Hickle that Alex is introduced to Milo Sturgis and the two become close friends.</p>
<p>This novel also serves as the first appearances of Robin Castagna, (a self imployed craftswoman who builds custom instruments) who serves as Alex's primary love interest as well as Rick Silverman who makes a brief appearance as Milo's new doctor boyfriend.</p>
<p>The plot of the novel concerns the murder of psychologist Dr. Morton Handler in his home. While investigating the case, Milo discovers that a seven year old child may have witnessed the murder and calls in Alex as a special consultant.</p>
<p>Alex, who is familiar with the use of hypnotism, attempts to discover what the girl saw and winds up getting sucked into the case, which may have ties to the death of Stuart Hickle, the man who caused Alex to retire years before.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Delaware_84b9.html" title="Edit section: 2. Blood Test">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2. Blood Test</span></h2>
<p>Blood Test, the second novel in the series, is set about a half a year after When The Bough Breaks. At this time Alex has come out of retirement to work as a consultant for court proceedings, namely the divorce and custody case of Richard Moody, a bipolar and potentially dangerous father of two.</p>
<p>At the same time, Alex is contacted by a former colleague, Dr. Raoul Melendez-Lynch. Dr. Melendez-Lynch is a member of the oncology department of the Western Pediatric Medical Center where he works developing cures and treatments for children's cancer.</p>
<p>We learn that before his previous retirement, Alex worked on a study performed by Dr. Melendez-Lynch. Alex's job was to look after the mental health and stability of a number of children who were put into quarantine isolation while receiving treatment for their illnesses.</p>
<p>Dr. Melendez-Lynch asks that Alex talk to Mr. and Mrs. Swope and convince them to allow their child Woody to receive treatment for his life threatening illness. Yet, before Alex can even talk to the boy's parents, they've taken off with their son. Now, Alex and Milo must find the child before his illness takes hold and ends his life.</p>
<p>During the course of the novel, love interest Robin Castagna plays only a minor roll, appearing in phone calls as she works on building custom instruments for a client in Japan. This book also has the appearance of Dr. Delaware's Koi pond a setting that reappears often in the Alex Delaware novels.</p>
<p><a name="3._Over_The_Edge"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Delaware_84b9.html" title="Edit section: 3. Over The Edge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">3. Over The Edge</span></h2>
<p>The third enstallment of the Alex Delaware series, while not specifically stated, is believed to take place about a one half to a full year after Blood Test.</p>
<p>In it Alex receives a phonecall in the middle of the night from Jamey Cadmus, a former partient. Before his self-imposed retirement (explained in When The Bough Breaks) Alex worked on a research study with Sarita Flowers on gifted children. The study, known as "Project 160" worked with genius level children. Dr. Delaware provided counciling and other services for the project about 5 years before the start of the novel.</p>
<p>By the time Dr. Delaware reaches the hospital where Jamey Cadmus is staying, he has escaped and is eventually aprehended by the police for a string of brutal murders. Employed by Cadmus's attorney, Delaware investigates the murders without the help of his faithful friend Milo Sturgis, as it seems they're both working opposite sides of the same case.</p>
<p>At this time, Robin Castagna is now living with Alex Delaware.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Delaware_84b9.html" title="Edit section: 4&#160;: Silent Partner">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">4&#160;: Silent Partner</span></h2>
<p>Silent Partnere is set about another six months after the previous book. At this time Alex and long time girlfriend Robin are separated. (We learn that after her return from Japan, she kept seeking more space in their relationship, until ultimately leaving). In this book, Alex runs into a former girlfriend of his, a woman named Sharon Ransom. She opens up to him and admits that things are not going so well in her life, and she wishes to have lunch with Alex in the hopes of talking about it. An emotional wreck, Alex turns down the lunch date in the fear of ending up involved with Ransom again. Later that day, Sharon is found dead in her home, a vicitm of suicide.</p>
<p>So obviously, Alex feels inclined to investigate.</p>
<p>This book once again shed more background into Deleware's life. We learn that he received his doctorate at age twenty four, and spent time shortly afterwards playing guitar in dance bands and working odd jobs, like substitue teaching classes from his Alma Mater, which is how he met Ransom. Their relationship lasted a year or two after falling apart, the circumstances pertinant to the overall plot of the novel.</p>
<p>At this time we can also figure that Alex Deleware is an estimated 37 years old in this novel.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Delaware_84b9.html" title="Edit section: 5&#160;: Time Bomb">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">5&#160;: Time Bomb</span></h2>
<p>Time Bomb is set an unspecified amount of time after Silent Partner. Early on in the book it is suggested that Alex is now 38 years old. It is also estabilished that Alex is no longer involved with Robin, and hasn't been for quite some time. After the events of Silent Partner, Delaware decided to seek therapy from friend and therapist Ada Small. At the time this novel takes place, Alex has completed any and all therapy for the time being.</p>
<p>The plot revolves around a school shooting at Nathan Hale Elementary school. Fortunately nobody is killed, except for the shooter herself, a girl named Holly Lynn Burden. Brudern's father contacts Delaware and asks that he perform a psychological autopsy, which he agrees to do. During the course of his investigation, Alex becomes involved with Dr. Linda Overstreet, the principal of Nathan Hale Elementary.</p>

<p>This novel is set less than six months after the events in Time Bomb. Alex is slowly working on a journal article based on the work he did during the previous novel. Milo, due to an incident at the end of Time Bomb is currently suspended. At this time Alex is still believed to be somewhat involved with Linda Overstreet, who debuted in Time Bomb.</p>
<p>In this novel Alex is contacted by former patient Melissa Dickenson. Alex treated her 9 years ago for a number of accute fears. Melissa's mother Gina Dickinson was a victim of an acid attack before Melissa's birth, and since then has faced acute agorophobia. Melissa asks Alex to look into her mother's case she Melissa prepares to go away to college.</p>
<p>Milo is given a freelance investigation job.</p>
