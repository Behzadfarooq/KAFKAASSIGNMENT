<p>Hi, I am writing from Ankara-Turkey. "to the Levite tribe of Ancient Israel..."</p>
<p>Actually the word "Alevi" is the same thing with Arabic "Alawi". For Islamic History, it is an Arabic word generally meaning Supporter of Ali. In Turkish language it is written as "Alevi", and has no connection with the Levites of Israel.

<dd>According to the article on <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alawi.html" title="Alawi">Alawi</a> <i>"The Alevis of Turkey are different from Syria’s Alawites, though they share the same name. Turkey’s Alevis are descended from the Kizilbash, a Sufi-Shi`a offshoot with connections to early Safavid Iran, whereas, Alawites are Nusayris."</i></dd>
<dd>There seems to be a similarity in certain beliefs between the two, however, there are many subtle (but important) differences. For example, Alawites recognise Ali as the incarnation of the divine diety. This is not the case for Alevis. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinar_ef6d.html" title="User:Pinar">Pinar</a> 05:21, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

"The name is possibly connected to the Levite tribe of Ancient Israel." This is an extremely interesting theory. Could any one elaborate on this. What is the evidence apart from the similatity in the names which does not seem to work for Turkish speakers who understand the root word Ali and its derivative Alevi. There are a few theories linking the Khazar Turks to the European Jews as Khazars voluntarily became a jewish state. Such theories have many political friends and enemies and it would be good to see any facts or evidence supporting Alevi-Levite connection. SunnyFrog 27/10/2004</p>

<p>Hi I am originally from South Azerbaijan, and thought to contribute to this discussion, as to my surprise there is no refrence to Alevi communities in South Azerbaican.</p>
<p>Alevi communities within Iran spread through out the north western and western region of the country. These large communities are more concentrated in small towns or villages of South Azerbaijan (Iranian Azerbaijan) and Kurdistan province of Iran.</p>
<p>The term Alevi was used till early twenty century for these communities and by themselves but at the present they are called with various names such as Ali Allahi, Ahl i Hag or Goran. The preferred name by the community is Ahl i Hag (literally meaning People of The Truth, or People of The Justice).</p>
<p>Ethnically they are either Azerbaijani Turks or Kurds. Azerbaijani of Ilkhichi (Ilxıçı), near Sahand mountain is mainly populated by Alevi, there also large vilages around , the Miandab (Miandoab) and Urmia within the western side of the Azerbaijan province.</p>
<p>The annual gatherings around the Shand (Sultan Dagi) in Azerbaijan province is one of the open rituals. At the peak of Sultan Dagi there is a small seasonal spring, which its water are considered to be blessed, by Alevi community. At the present there is a rather small Jamkhana (Cemxana) at the eastern foots of the Sahand.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There should be a clearification here, Ahl-e-Haqq(Yarsan) is not the same as Alevism, however they are ralated. The official term might be that they are Ahl-e-Haqq(Yarsan) but it should be more clear that Alevism and Ahl-e-haqq(Yarsanism) is not the same.</dd>

<p>Hi, in fact Turkish Alevis are not seeing themself as a part of islamic world. For example: The "official" language which is used rituals is Turkish while sects of Islam are using Arabic. Women and men are worshiping together this is strictly different from Islamic behaviour.</p>
<p><br />
Alevilik is a form of Shamanism which is covered by islamic image.</p>
<p>Turks where converted islam by force, many Turkish cities razed and nomad tribes were attacked, alevilik is a culture and religion of some Turkish formerly nomad tribes which are less effected by Persians and Arabs while traveligh through west asia and asia minor becouse of dramatic climate changes in middle asia. --Utku5 16:44, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Turkish Alevi community is, as the article correctly points out, merely tolerated (at best) by the wider Sunni majority. Alevilik is generally viewed as deviant, abberant and corrupted by Shamanism, Christianity and other "alien" influences. Faced by widespread ignorance and prejudice, few Alevis in majority-Sunni areas (and more particularly those in public life or the professions) feel able to openly reveal their identity let alone promote or celebrate it. That is to Turkey's loss.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it cannot be emphasized enough the degree to which Turkish Alevis overwhelmingly support Turkey's European Union accession process. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 85.97.206.199 (<a href="../../../8/5/2E/User_talk%7E85.97.206.199.html" title="User talk:85.97.206.199">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.97.206.199_896f.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.97.206.199">contribs</a>) 19:39, October 25, 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>There's a mention in the main article about the Sivas incident of 1993. It has been stated that the victims were burned by Sunni locals. This is an unacceptable remark, disgracing all Sunnis of Sivas. The perpetrators were and should be identified as "Islamic Radical Fundamentalists of Sunni origin".</p>
<p><br />
You are right, need to change it. Article should not be antagonistic towards Sunni majority. Alevis are integral part of Turkey, as most of them are Turks indeed. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">abdulnr</a> 01:25, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fighting MHP? who invented that, many MHP leaders and supporters are Alevi, as Alevi have succesfully changed their image into the protectors and stand-bearers of Turkish culture and identity (referring the Central Asian/Turkistan traits) this is commongly accepted as alot of their cerenomies are in the Turkish language, they have very old cultural traditions etc these today are being adopted by mainstream society and encouraged.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The part about "Sunni's of Sivas" should not be written like that, the vast majority of Sunni Muslims were disgraced, disgusted and dishonoured by these terrible terrorists hijacking sects of Islam and comitted attrocities against innocent people in its name.</p>
<p>Alevi are an integral part of Turkey and Turkish culture.</p>

<p>There should be a distinction made between secular Alevi music and sacred/religious <i>cemevi</i> music, as they represent two different styles that have had different impacts on Turkish music as a whole. Much of the music currently considered <i>türkü</i> (Turkic nationalist folk songs) in Turkey is Alevi secular music (the music of Alevi <i>aşık</i> bards), though little of the cemevi music would be considered the same. That there are strong secular and sacred music styles is unique in itself, as there isn't, for example, a huge body of secular music from other Sufi orders in Turkey (such as the Mevlevi or Sinani orders).</p>
<p>Second, I'm also puzzled about the inclusion of Mercan Dede - in most of his public performances stylized forms of Mevlana are depicted, but Alevi concepts have not been a prominent recurring theme in his art. Other prominent popular Turkish artists such as Cemali and Aynur Doğan have had much longer and more substantive interactions with Alevi music.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the 1993 hotel fire, one of the most important Alevi bağlama players in the country died in this fire - Hasret Gültekin. The wording of the "hotel fire" section, as it stands, reads very awkward, since it pits "intellectuals" against "Sunnis." Other writers above have already pointed out that much of the Sunni majority was outraged about the event as well (and of course not responsible). The blanket term "intellectuals" is misleading - some of the casualties were very important artists and musicians, as well as being intellectuals, too. In Istanbul, bağlama-saz players (Alevi and otherwise) continuously reference how brilliant Hasret was, the ways he drastically altered the way Turkey's "national" musical instrument is played, how he died too young, and so on. The loss in 1993 was a great cultural one for the country of Turkey. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliotbates_5360.html" title="User:Eliotbates">oudplayer</a> 10:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does anyone have more information about the ones that was killed in the fire? I added Hasret Gültekin as one of the victims. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreddyFred_8f02.html" title="User:FreddyFred">FreddyFred</a> 11:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article argues that the proper name for the religios system is "Alevi-Bektashi." This may not necessarily be correct. These are actually two different belief systems that have borrowed much from each other. This does not agree with the NPOV policy and the veriability policy of Wikipedia since it contains no references.</p>
<p>I change the article as the following: "Some argue that the Alevi belief should be recognized as part of a larger Alevi-Bektashi belief system."</p>

<p>Sounds good. Bulgarian Bektashis are about as similar to Turkish Alevis as Turkish Alevis are to the Ah le-Haqq of Iran. There is some familiarity, but quite a bit of difference. The biggest difference is in the early historical roots - the central Anatolian Alevis had a particular form of shamanism before adopting Islam (or aspects of Islam) which differs from the Bektashi in Bulgaria. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliotbates_5360.html" title="User:Eliotbates">eliotbates</a> 23:28, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article includes much wrong information. Using the views of Irene Melikoff and other subjective writers is not recommended. Alevism is the true path of Allah, Muhammad and Ali. There is no such thing as Shamanistic elements in Alevism. If there was, then there was a need to change ALL articles about beliefs in wikipedia! Then there should be added, that Sunnism was a mix of Judaism, Christianity etc.! As an Alevi I will not accept this discrimination. Alevism should be described as Alevism sees itself, and not as foreigners observ it! A great part of this article is useless! Where's Shah Ismail Safawi, and his ancestor Sheikh Safi al-Din Ardabili? Where's the 12 imams, Haci Bektas?</p>
<p>I advice the admins of wikipedia to add a note that explains the wrong/discussable containings of this article!</p>
<p>Please, you are more than welcome to contribute to the article. If you are Alevi, well, even better! Wikipedia is made to be corrected by YOU! Chop up the article, re-write it, add or remove stuff. Wikipedia is here for YOU! You seem to sit on alot of information: ADD IT! If you feel something are wrong, change it! You had enought energy to read the article, go in here at the discussion page and vent youre opinion, so focus that energy and contribute......This is youre chance to do so, whereelse whould that be possible....YOU are needed!

<p>Dear contributors, as a interested reader, here is my comment: this article has many interesting elements in it. However it shows that several strongly biased sentences were added/modified (in bad English too); so I would like to advise that someone takes care of amending this article, which I think has the potential to be very good.</p>
<p>Also, may I point out a "reputable" source of information on Alevism: the Turkish Daily News, who published a series on Alevism very recently, on Nov 12, 2006. Unfortunately, I could only read it in Google's cache, not on the newspaper's site: here is part 1: <a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:_oQr1lC7IwIJ:www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php%3Fenewsid%3D57542+alevism+AND+iran&amp;hl=fr&amp;gl=be&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2" class="external free" title="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:_oQr1lC7IwIJ:www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php%3Fenewsid%3D57542+alevism+AND+iran&amp;hl=fr&amp;gl=be&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2" rel="nofollow">http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:_oQr1lC7IwIJ:www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php%3Fenewsid%3D57542+alevism+AND+iran&amp;hl=fr&amp;gl=be&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2</a></p>

<p>IMHO this article needs a large overhaul. It does present how Alevi view their own religion, only unsourced outside criticism ("pagans"). Other passages are in inappropriate sections (origin and ethnicity in etymology, speculations in history). Historic events and figures like Haci Bektas Veli are missing, so are sections about religious practice. Is there someone with knowledge about the subject who can improve it, otherwise I could try to put information in from the <a href="../../../../de/a/l/e/Aleviten.html" class="extiw" title="de:Aleviten">de:Aleviten</a> article. --<a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurax_14a4.html" title="User:Hurax">Hurax</a> 14:22, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlevi_bd0a.html" title="Edit section: I removed incorrect material about the Bektashi Sufis in the Albanian lands.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">I removed incorrect material about the Bektashi Sufis in the Albanian lands.</span></h2>
<p>I don't know why someone included in this article the false claims that Bektashi Sufis in the Albanian lands are part of "Alevilik" or constitute 30-40 percent of the population among Albanians. These are rather typical legends one hears among New-Age types in the West but are quite incorrect.</p>
<p>Albanian followers of the Bektashi Sufi order do not constitute more than 25 percent of Albanians at a very generous estimate. I have no reason to understate this because I am quite close to and sympathetic to the Bektashis in the Albanian lands, but there is no need to exaggerate things. I also work closely with Turkish and Kurdish Alevis in Germany</p>
<p>Albanian Bektashis and Turkish Alevis, who may also be known as Alevi-Bektashis, both honor the Sufi saint Hadji Bektash Veli, but in very different ways, and it is incorrect to suggest that Albanians are part of "Alevilik." Some Albanian Bektashis visit the tomb of Hadji Bektash in Turkey, not in mass pilgrimages as Turkish and Kurdish Alevis do. Albanian Bektashis do not generally speak Turkish and do not employ Turkish as the language of their rituals. They consider Albanian Bektashism to be a kind of Albanian national sect.</p>
<p>Turkish and Kurdish Alevis employ popular music of a Western kind in their pageants. Albanian Bektashis do not do this.</p>
