<p>I was curious. In the Jurassic Park score article, you changed the name to soundtrack.</p>
<p>I was curious as to why wikipedia uses an incorrect term. Calling it a soundtrack is a misnomer. Soundtrack can apply to anything really that is sound and tracked into something.</p>
<p>A musical "score" has only two meanings. The actually written notes, and the recordings/music.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of times today, you will see a release of a films "Soundtrack" AND "Score" on separate discs. Such as Shrek 1 or 2. On the "soundtrack" you'd get the songs in the movie such as 'Funky Town' or 'Livin' la Vida Loca,' but on the "score" you'd get the Harry Gregson Williams orchestral music.</p>
<p>I was just wondering why Wikipedia chooses to use the incorrect term. Also, willthis cause probelms with the article because the article is not just about the "Album" (which btw is the correct term for what music is released in this case), but it also about the score. Will the article need to be restructured into two separate articles now?</p>

<p>I was actually going to do that myself eventually. Feel free to start that, and since we're on the topic, you can go ahead and do the same for <i>The Dark Knight</i> (though I'd mention your intentions on the talk page since there's a whole bunch of eyes on that particular article). I'd probably suggest stitching the Production section and Snyder's vision section together, but move the Casting subsection information to be under Cast, maybe with the Acting subsection information as well. The information isn't in chronological order, so watch the multiple-reference IGN citations when you move stuff around. I'll give you a hand when I have the time to fully dedicate myself to an article. Kind of in the midst of finals now; with Wikipedia as my "break" activity. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 19:30, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Damn, you work fast.&#160;:) I'd like to combine the Promotion and Merchandise sections under one Promotion section.

<p>I think the narrator information should be placed at the end of the second paragraph of the Production section, since the narrative device is an exception to the shot-for-shot adaptation. Plus, where the information is now is out-of-universe compared to the descriptions of the other characters. What do you think? —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 20:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a few more citations that could be included. I use Google Alerts to pick up anything about Zack Snyder and <i>300</i>. While I haven't added them yet, there are some useful interviews about Frank Miller being extremely collaborative with the director in creating this film. Compared to how Alan Moore has responded to the film adaptations of his comic books, this might be notable for inclusion. I'll see what I can put together. Also, I hope that there will be some more detail regarding the visual effects, as this is a prominent part of the film and might warrant breaking off into its own section if more information comes out closer to the film's release date. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 20:46, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Howdy! I noticed that you assigned some project importance ratings to various trek film articles. What criteria did you use? I noticed that the importance ratings happened to match the popularity of the films in question, which would seem to be an odd scale to use. I expected the wikiproject importance ratings to go more along the lines of, say, a film gets a high importance rating because many people saw it, it made X million, is a cornerstone of the franchise, etc etc etc while an episode or an article about a planet that's mentioned twice might merit low importance. If I'm barking mad and my perception of reality is constrained only by the physical reach of my straitjacket, let me know.

<dd>No. In fact, it's almost safe to say that no Flickr image is fair use. But Flickr images that are licensed CC-BY or CC-BY-SA are freely licensed and can be used however one wants. This is much, much better than making a fair use claim. Can you go to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Daniel_Craig_on_Venice_yacht.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Daniel_Craig_on_Venice_yacht.jpg">commons:Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht.jpg</a> and edit the description to indicate who the person you recognise is?

<dd>Hi, I just went through and made the required changes to the article, except for the biography note. I just went through that section and since it refers to events that happened in the past, shouldn't it be written in past tense?

<dd>I tried that, but it makes the article more sloppy and awkward and even though the style says to write fictional stuff in present tense, saying "Homer Simpson is born in Springfield" just doesn't sound right. If it was an episode synopsis, I'd agree, but not for a biography. I'm sure Wikipedia cares more about quality as opposed to whether or not a few words are written in past or present tense. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 19:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think you should ask on the talk page. I personally feel that the villains are unique enough to be separate from the Production section, as each character was specifically tracked by movie news aggregators. It's kind of hard to foresee what setup the article would benefit from, since the chronological news development of the villains would probably overlap a lot. The Production section could probably be improved a la <i>300</i>, perhaps. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 22:44, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Feel free to ask on <a href="../../../s/p/i/Talk%7ESpider-Man_3_fabc.html" title="Talk:Spider-Man 3">Talk:Spider-Man 3</a> about stitching the information together. Like I said, I think the villains should have their own section, especially as it's likely that more detailed information will come out about their creation, especially visual effects for Sandman and Venom. Also, do you watch <i><a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Man_%28film%29_6149.html" title="Iron Man (film)">Iron Man</a></i>? It's another superhero film article that might benefit from the stitch treatment. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 20:18, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice job on <i>At World's End</i> and <i>Iron Man</i>! Definitely puts these articles in line with da pros. Good luck giving <i>Spider-Man 3</i> the same treatment — quite a few citations, especially referenced multiple times, to move around. Wish I could help, but I'm going home from college today.

<p>It's occurred to me that there has never been a discussion involving this articles status. I don't think we've ever issued it to a peer review let alone a Good Article review. It doesn't matter if the film is yet to be released, because <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a> is a featured article that is still on the air. Have you ever thought about sending the article in for a peer review? I think a few tweaks to the format (which is being taken care of right now) are the only thing that should hold us back from a peer review. I think it would be good to get some outside views on the article's status.

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I noticed that you awarded an 'A class' assessment to the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_e151.html" title="Gun violence in the United States">Gun violence in the United States</a> article. It is my understanding that the article was undergoing 'GA class' nomination at the time, and thus cannot be an A class article (as A class is above GA class).</p>
<p>I later discovered that the A class rating given meant that the article was not awarded its GA class status despite meeting the criteria for it (according to the GA review page).</p>
<p>Therefore, i have removed the A class rating and given the article its true GA class rating as that is the one it has passed. A class rating require discussion prior to awarding in order to ascertain whether the article truly diserves the rating, and I could find no such discussion regarding the rating you awarded. In particular, there was no attempt to contact the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Law_Enforcement_2f71.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Law Enforcement">wikiproject</a> (that I can find).</p>
<p>Please bare in mind that, while i have searched everywhere i can think of for discussion relating to and approving of the A class status, I may have missed something that explains it all, and if this is the case then i apologise profusely and would be grateful if you could direct me to it.</p>
<p>However, in the mean time, if I may, I would suggest that the proper channels be observed when rating articles. If you are interested in rating, or working on, Law enforcement related articles, then please visit the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Law_Enforcement_2f71.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Law Enforcement">project page</a>.</p>

<p>I noticed. Seems like a better measure than guessing the importance of these upcoming films. I'll implement the same for any upcoming film articles you might've missed.

<p>Wait a minute here. I think group consensus already decided the <i>SM3</i> importance rating should be mid-level. And if I'm not mistaken, I don't remember you joining this discussion prior to lowering the rating. Do you think it's fair to come along and change it based on your own asumptions, without joining the debate? Until you discuss this with the other editors, I'm changing the rating back.

<dd>I was wondering, did you see something somewhere that led you to make this change, or did you just experiment in changing "Mid" to "Future"? If there's a policy you saw somewhere, it might be useful to cite. Otherwise, let's just make sure the other editors are fine with the change before we implement it (at <i>SM3</i>, at least). —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 18:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sure, I'll work on a condensed version of the plot for you. Do you want me to leave it with you, or place it in the Talk page? Basically I'll make it really condensed and then those that work on the page regularly can decide how to improve it, rewrite it for better wording, include something that may be more necessary, or decide something else can be taken out. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 19:00, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, I realized that plot is going to be hard to trim, because it has so much detail (unlike the sequels). Anyway, I figured the best way for us to work on this is to place it in a sandbox. So, I've already made some intial trims, cut like 400 words, but it still needs work. I could have also left things out that may need to be placed back in. It's been a long time since I sat and watched those films. You can edit as you see fit, if there is something you aren't sure about then leave a message on the talk page. The new plot workup is here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 01:28, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've noticed some of the changes, I haven't had time to really read all of it again, but I wanted to say Good Job. As with "Aliens", I was trying to explain to them that we don't need to explain who characters are if you have a "Cast" section. Otherwise a cast section is irrelevant. I noticed you had implemented one on the page. I really need to rewatch that film so that I can help better. I don't know if you changed it, but I know that I incorrectly labeled "Trinity" as the second caller before Neo goes to meet Morpheus, but it was really Morpheus himself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 13:57, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're down to about 941 words now. I tried to trim some things that weren't really necessary, like Trinity explaining to a dead Neo what the Oracle told her. We didn't establish that he was trying to find out what the Oracle told her earlier, so it really isn't that big of a deal. I removed "the bug" because we'd probably have to explain what "the bug" actually is, which is just a needless detail since it's something that is only seen very briefly. Let me know if the other trims I made where too much.

It says article but I'm not sure how that could affect the decision for the Green Day article itself. Also it seems that there is already an introduction in the article. Is that not sufficient? Either way your clarification is greatly appreatiated as we try to further improve the article. <font style="arial: ridge 2px #FF0000; background-color: #000000" color="#FF0000"><big><b>&#160;<a href="../../../o/r/f/User%7EOrfen_3254.html" title="User:Orfen"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="arial"><b><i>Orfen</i></b></font></font></a>&#160;</b></big></font><sup><small><a href="../../../o/r/f/User_talk%7EOrfen_ba32.html" title="User talk:Orfen"><font color="#FF0000"><font face="arial"><u>User Talk</u></font></font></a></small></sup> | <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orfen_d6cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orfen"><font color="#000000"><font face="arial"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sub> 20:22, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The Hobbit</i> is a good suggestion. If the film gets made, the initial struggle should be mentioned. Also, I've sort of gathered citations for existing films as well — you can see the "guides" I have next to my article focuses on the user page. Something like <i>Schindler's List</i> strikes me as tricky, though. The film's been around for a long time now, and I'm sure there's been a lot of information about the film on the various aspects of it. So I don't know if I could do a very thorough job rebuilding a page. Same thing with <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. I watch that article, and I notice a lot of minor edit wars that are WW2-based, such as what gun was used and all. I'm just not well-versed in that. You can see that I took on <i>The Fountain</i> as a project because it's minimal in scope; a lot of information out there is mostly in that article now. I think if I had to take on a past-film article, it would be <i>Fight Club</i>. It's my top favorite, and I have a pretty thorough guide filled with useful citations. Heck, I haven't taken advantage of my college account to look for <i>Fight Club</i> coverage in subscription-only database. (I just did that recently to put together a pretty extensive Film subsection for the comic book superhero Black Panther.) —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 21:22, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've often Googled for terms within the <i>Variety</i> domain to find articles from the past. Forget about <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> — their new archive format makes them unsearchable. Just type <b>site:variety.com &lt;keywords&gt;</b> — you can generally find articles that pertain to the beginning of production, such as a director being attached. Not good for actual production news, though. Another technique I'd suggest is using directories that contain a mountain of links. For example, there's a good number with the directory's <a href="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Movies/Titles/B/Batman_Series/Batman_Begins/" class="external text" title="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Movies/Titles/B/Batman_Series/Batman_Begins/" rel="nofollow">Batman Begins</a>. I'm sure sources can be found within sources — obviously, seek out the ones that are the most reliable. The database that I use is called Access World News; I just checked, it seems to go back to 1977. There might be other databases available to me for usage; I haven't really dug into this potential resource so much over the holiday. Another possibility as well is to go to a film page at Rotten Tomatoes, and click on the drop-down menu to get the narrow-down options. Go to the end and pick Essays. Might find something useful, but avoid stuff by EmanuelLevy.com; they just don't qualify as "essays". I think, though, it would be best to cite a book specifically devoted to a film; I've always wanted to pick one up for <i>Batman Begins</i>, as I know there are some books out there for the film. Anyway, hope some of my tips helped. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 15:39, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An example to type in Google for the <i>Variety</i> domain would be <b>site:variety.com "ghost rider"</b> (use quotation marks to find exactly that phrase, instead of "ghost" and "rider" in separate parts of an article). You'll get get news articles that I used in the <i>Ghost Rider</i> film article. I don't know how far back it goes, though. The 1977 was for the subscription-only database, Access World News, which I can access with my college account. I don't know if you have anything like that — sometimes libraries, both public and college, permit access to such news databases. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 18:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, I'm not sure if you're aware of this site, but <a href="http://www.comics2film.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.comics2film.com/" rel="nofollow">Comics2Film</a> is a good site for, well, film adaptations of comics. They keep headlines, even for films that never entered production. You can see a <i>Batman vs. Superman</i> section in the Alpha Index. There's also an insane amount of pages of headlines for the first two <i>Spider-Man</i> films... definitely something I'd use if we ever get to fix up the previous films' articles. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 19:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all, thanks for the extra bracket on my user page. Secondly, is there any chance you can provide me with excerpts about <i>Iron Man</i> from <i>Empire</i> magazine? I'm trying to expand the production history of the page, particularly using Access World News. I've already found out that Twentieth Century Fox had desired to develop it as early as 1996. I'm trying to trace the headlines from back then up to now. Also, about the article, do you think that the casting information would work better being inserted into the production section? Ace did that at <i>SM3</i> with decent effect that allowed a bit more exploration of the characters' development on that particular page. Just wanted to know your thoughts about doing the same for <i>Iron Man</i>. (Also, don't know if you're a Voltron fan since you like Transformers, but I've cleaned up the <i><a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltron_%28film%29.html" title="Voltron (film)">Voltron</a></i> film article.) —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 19:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if you were aware, but I had been developing <i>Avatar</i> for a while. Looks like in my absence, there's been some new information that came out, and the page's been turned upside-down by a user with information that's probably correct, but it's uncited and oddly sectioned -- "About Avatar", "Production Begins", and "Years of Pre-Production". He tried to revert back to his version with a fake edit summary ("corrected link"), so I question his ability to engage in discussion. I want to update <i>Avatar</i> with whatever latest information there is, but not in the style with which the user tried to edit the pagee. Any chance you can help out in citing the information or informing the user what needs to be done to make the content acceptable? —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 16:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What do you think of creating a Visual effects section below Production? Visual effects will be a prominent part of the film, and details like "the proprietary FUSION digital 3D camera system" could go into such a section and cover the more technical aspects of the special effects that Cameron has planned. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 20:15, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see why you had to fail the article immediately and not give me a little time to fix the page. The summary article is the best one I could find and I think it summaraizes the episode be showing him trying to be cool but being shunned by a pair of teens. I lengthened the lead, but not a lot can be done to lengthen it without providing a larger plot summary. And are you saying I should merge hidden jokes and cultural references, because the two sections are completely different... I think this page is far better than all the other episode pages, and I have worked hard to eliminate the trivia and make sections for it, and I have shortened the CR quite considerably. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 17:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
Now don't you think that's a little more productive that just immediately reverting the work and making a spurious claim about fair use? I think so. Now lets try to move forward.</p>
<p>Firstly, I don't see any text there that can be called non-fair use or needs citations - do you? Regarding the images, I don't necessarily disagree with you that there are too many. I'll look at removing one or two. Regarding their fair use rationale, each one was already used in another Jones related wikipedia article (i.e. no new images)<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikejstevenson_4c23.html" title="User:Mikejstevenson">Mikejstevenson</a> 20:04, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
OK, I'm getting the message that you really couldn't care less about collaboration. Fair enough - obviously no point in discussing things with you. Lets see who has more time on their hands, because I can see some revert wars on the horizon.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikejstevenson_4c23.html" title="User:Mikejstevenson">Mikejstevenson</a> 20:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I like what you did with the section, adding the bits about Ridley Scott. But I think the section should remain Script development. If you look at the actual <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_development.html" title="Script development">Script development</a> article you'll notice they moved the Development (film) article over to there to have less ambiguity because it could mean the development of film in a lab, etc... Overall, Development is too vague and Script development isn't strictly the domain of the writer and is considered the step before Production. Well, see the article, but I think should remain as <a href="../../../s/c/r/Script_development.html" title="Script development">Script development</a>.-BiancaOfHell 17:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
