<p>I'm not entirely certain what wiki policy is on this, but I've got to assume that any encyclopaedia article should be at least partially understandable by laymen, especially if it's about a topic that directly effects the general public. The reason I ask is that I've seen so many video game reviews (and now DVD review of South Park) which complain about aliasing, and I wish I knew what they were talking about. You'd think that video game reviewers would better explain how aliasing causes problems, but right now, I honestly don't know what the aliasing problems are in my games. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkhawk_b946.html" title="User:Darkhawk">Darkhawk</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. A visual illustration of video image aliasing would be useful. For example, the brick patterns at <a href="../../../m/o/i/Moir%C3%A9_pattern.html" title="Moiré pattern">Moiré pattern</a>. Maybe we should incorporate that or something like it. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 20:29, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We keep commenting that we need an illustration (preferably animated), but it sounds as if the only time anyone put one in here, it was removed as confusing. Does anyone know where we could post a request and someone technically skilled enough to produce the thing might see it? I came to this article for the same reason as Darkhawk did, but am equally in the dark after reading. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 04:02, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To answer Darkhawk and Lawikitejana, I have added a simple lede that describes in a layman's terms what aliasing is.

<dd>I find your new graphic and paragraph to be entirely unsuitable. The picture is just plain ugly, and the text is not at all encyclopedic. Surely you can do better.

<dd>Please lose the cartoon. Aliasing is something more subtle and much more <u>interesting</u> than that. It is an interaction of two different frequencies, one a characteristic of the observer and the other a characteristic of the observed. The result is the <u>illusion</u> of a different frequency than is actually present. It is caused by loss of resolution, but it is a special case. Defocussing my SLR camera lens causes a blur that looks like a lot of other blurs, but I would never refer to that as "aliasing".</dd>

<dd>The cartoon seems to illustrate a combination of lowpass filtering and sampling, in which the signals after filtering are substantially identical and therefore there is probably not much if any aliasing. It certainly doesn't illustrate the concept well. I'm going to pull it (and the text about it) for now. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 16:32, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok. You guys don't actually understand what the article says. The word aliasing describes two different but related phenomena. The first is when two different signals are mapped to the same sampled signals (signal-&gt;sample is not injective). That is what the smileys were about. The second is about when the signal-&gt;sample-&gt;reconstruction gives surprising results. That is what the moire patterns in the brick wall are.<br />
<a href="../../../l/o/i/User%7ELoisel_933f.html" title="User:Loisel">Loisel</a> 22:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is an unnecessarily divisive viewpoint. Your "second" phenomenon is more than just aliasing. It is aliasing and filtering (or whatever you want to call the reconstruction process). The aliasing happened when you sampled the signal, regardless of whether or not you subsequently reconstruct anything. The sampled signal is indistinguishable from the samples of many other signals. Your "first" phenomenon appears to require that at least one of those other signals also be sampled, so we can verify that the samples are indistinguishable. I do not think that distinction is important or helpful. I have also looked around the internet, and I do not find that distinction.</dd>
<dd>I am sorry if you feel "your" article has been hijacked. I know how that feels, and it's one of the warnings that Wikipedia gives to all contributors. Hopefully, I have convinced you that a single unified view of aliasing is preferrable to the divided one. But I doubt it, based on past experiences here with other contributors. If you still care, and want to make your point, I suggest you write a new article. If it stands up to the editors, a disambiguation page might be the right answer.</dd>

<dd>I think both views are already represented in this article. That lead already says that aliasing is when several different signals lead to the same set of samples. I didn't know the formal term ("not injective"), but that's not going to help make it understandalbe to a layman anyway. In a practical sense, however, since that kind of aliasing doesn't happen when the signal is bandlimited, the most interesting thing is what happens to signal that are not quite bandlimited, and have aliasing, of the other meaning, i.e. aliasing distortion artifacts. It might be sensible to further distinguish these things, or elaborate the first, in a subsection, but in the lead we need to keep it understandable, and if we illustrate it should do so with something that looks like what people know as aliasing. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 00:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, both views are represented. I know. And I am not going to change it. But my opinion is that it is unnecessarily divisive. The two viewpoints need not be different definitions, but rather just different manifestations of the same fundamental thing. The distinction is superficial. A window function applied to a single sinusoid creates new frequency components, but it does not perturb the frequency of the spectral maximum. A window function applied to two sinusoids perturbs their spectral maximums. But when we write an article about windowing or spectral leakage, we don't lead with that sort of information.</dd>

<p>I wrote probably over half of this article and for a long time I was defending it against non-<a href="../../../e/x/p/Expert.html" title="Expert">experts</a> who only have a rudimentary grasp of what aliasing is, but I'm not so sure I care anymore.</p>
<p>Defocusing your lens is again not the same as what the smiley faces represented. Defocusing your lens does not make the pixels big. In fact, you can recover a focused image from a defocused image if you know what you're doing (it's called <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconvolution.html" title="Deconvolution">deconvolution</a>.) However, you can't recover the smileys from the pixelized image I gave. They're aliased.<br />

<p>In <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_processing.html" title="Signal processing">signal processing</a> (including digital photography), <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_graphics.html" title="Computer graphics">computer graphics</a>, and related disciplines, "signals" that are essentially continuous in space or time must be <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_sampling.html" title="Signal sampling">sampled</a>, and the set of samples is never unique to the original signal. The other signals that could (or did) produce the same samples are called <b>aliases</b> of the original signal. If a continuous signal is reconstructed from the samples, the result may be one of the aliases, which represents a form of distortion. The term <b>aliasing</b> can refer to both the ambiguity created by sampling and to the subsequent distortion.</p>
<p>For example, when we view a digital photograph, the reconstruction (interpolation) is performed by our eyes and our brain. If the original image was a lawn, we no longer see the individual blades of grass. Therefore we are seeing an alias. A more interesting example (below) is the <a href="../../../m/o/i/Moir%C3%A9_pattern.html" title="Moiré pattern">Moiré pattern</a> one can observe in a poorly pixelized image of a brick wall. Techniques that avoid such poor pixelizations are called <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aliasing.html" title="Anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a>.</p>
<p>Digital imaging is an example of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliasing.html#Spatial_aliasing" title="Aliasing">spatial aliasing</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temporal_aliasing.html" title="Temporal aliasing">Temporal aliasing</a> is a major concern in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_to_digital_converter.html" title="Analog to digital converter">analog-to-digital conversion</a> of <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video.html" title="Video">video</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_reproduction.html" title="Sound reproduction">audio</a> signals: improper sampling of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_signal.html" title="Analog signal">analog signal</a> will cause high-<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency.html" title="Frequency">frequency</a> components to be aliased with genuine low-frequency ones, and to be incorrectly <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_reconstruction.html" title="Signal reconstruction">reconstructed</a> as such during the subsequent <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_to_analog_converter.html" title="Digital to analog converter">digital-to-analog conversion</a>.

<dd>It's not clear to me what it helps. I think that by focusing on a reconstruction being one of the aliases you may obscure the fact that the aliasing happens at sampling, not at reconstruction. And it's an issue even if reconstruction is not the goal, and even if the reconstruction is NOT one of the aliases. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 19:09, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, that was my objection too. What I've changed is that the first paragraph "defines" aliasing in terms of non-unique samples, period. And there is no subsequent "Aliasing <u>also</u> means ..." paragraph. The first paragraph could stand alone as an introduction. The rest of the intro is just elaboration.</dd>

<dd>I hadn't noticed the removal of aliasing meaning the distortion due to this effect. Seems to me that's a common usage, and leaving it out would be a mistake. That is, the term is commonly used not for its formal meaning, but the folding of frequency components that it typically leads to. I believe I provided refs once for that usage; sometimes they say "aliasing distortion," but more often they define "aliasing" as a distortion. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 05:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added this section as a further example that the conventional wisdom of sinc filters isn't always true. Sinc filtering the measured image <i>g</i>, regardless which sinc filter is used, does not lead to any accurate measurement of the radius of the star.</p>

<p>This could be the case if your eye samples the scene - perhaps periferal vision does this. I sometimes get a related effect if I see a TV screen or other flickering source out of the corner of my eye - the flicker frequency appears to be much less than 50Hz. -- Easter 15:32 Dec 20, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>For really freaky effects, try watching a TV screen or CRT monitor while using an electric toothbrush. The image wobbles up and down, it was quite alarming the first time I saw it. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>
<p>This is what my colleagues in broadcast engineering call the ginger biscuit effect. Any vibration to the head will do. -- Easter 15:47 Dec 20, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we need an article on this! -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>
<p>This effect is caused by a failure of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persistence_of_vision.html" title="Persistence of vision">persistence of vision</a>, although it could also be regarded as a kind of aliasing (with the vibration of your head providing the sampling frequency). I don't believe that the eye normally does any sampling in the time domain, at least not in a periodic way. Devices like CRT monitors rely on your persistence of vision, which is the slow response of your <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retina.html" title="Retina">retina</a> to changing or flickering images. This only works if your eye muscles can produce a stationary image on the retina. When you move your head faster than your eye muscles can track, as happens when you eat crunchy food, the TV image is spread out over your retina and appears fragmented, because parts of your retina see one field of the image and other parts see the next field, or the few milliseconds of darkness between fields. I'm guessing that this effect is more noticeable at the edge of the field of view, because the mechanism that stabilises the eyeball mainly uses data from the centre of the retina. -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 11:30, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a question regarding this paragraph:</p>
<p><i>The term "aliasing" derives from the usage in radio engineering, where a radio signal could be picked up at two different positions on the radio dial in a superheterodyne radio: one where the local oscillator was above the radio frequency, and one where it was below. This is analagous to the frequency-space "wrapround" that is one way of understanding aliasing. However, there is a deeper way of understanding aliasing, based on continuity arguments, which is outlined below as an introduction.</i></p>
<p>This is very interesting to me. I am not completely certain that this crosstalk between radio stations is covered by the "outlined below as an introduction" portion. Unfortunately, I am not a physicist (or an engineer) so I don't know what's actually going on.</p>
<p>I think it would be great if someone who understands the long-winded L^2 stuff I wrote could tell me how that relates to the radio waves. I mean, the wrapping around of frequencies I describe depends completely on using a simple sampling scheme (like S_0) and so it's mostly for digital signal processing. In the analog world, I'm not exactly sure what's going on.</p>
<p>If anyone can give us more details about the underlying physics of the radio wave crosstalk phenomenon described above, perhaps there's a section in the aliasing article that needs to treat the analog aliasing process separately, which might be different from the dsp aliasing stuff <a href="../../../l/o/i/User%7ELoisel_933f.html" title="User:Loisel">Loisel</a> 01:38 Jan 28, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this origin of the term accurate? Aliasing is usually associated with sampling, rather than AM modulation: namely when a sinusoidal signal is sampled at the wrong rate it becomes identical with (i.e. becomes an "alias" for) a sinusoid of another frequency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's a consequence of the signal mixing in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superheterodyne_receiver.html" title="Superheterodyne receiver">heterodyning process</a>, and would hopefully be filtered out in a decent radio design. I'm guessing it's merely due to the modulation: cos(a)*cos(b) = [cos(a+b) + cos(a-b)]/2. As for the terminology, it's conceivable that it had its origin in analog, but I wouldn't know. From what I've encountered in school, "aliasing" is strictly applied to the discrete-time situation. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako098765_2591.html" title="User:Mako098765">mak</a><i><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMako098765_ef35.html" title="User talk:Mako098765">o</a></i> 28 June 2005 20:21 (UTC)</li>

<dd>" First we will introduce a formal notion of "continuous signal". Since there are more than one possible choices (depending on the subject at hand), we will give some general outline, but fix our attention on a specific example for the purpose of this article. Second, we will give a notion of <i>similarity</i> of signals. Again, this precise notion depends on the underlying physical problem, but we will provide a common example for the sake of discussion. Third, we will give the most common sampling method as an example, and fourth we will show its failings. Fifth, we will give an improved sampling method that is more in-tune with the similarity notion introduced in the second section.<br />

<p>The "Technical description" section was way too long and too heavy on math, it confused more than clarified the concept. Thus I have done some rather radical trimming and replanting.</p>
<p>Specifically, I moved most details of the "reconstruction" sections to a new page <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_reconstruction.html" title="Signal reconstruction">signal reconstruction</a>, keeping only the definition of the "standard" reconstruction <i>R</i>. I also deleted the following paragraph since it was not germane to "aliasing"; it should go to some other page (Fourier analysis?):</p>
<dl>
<dd>" We note here that there is an efficient algorithm, known as the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_Fourier_transform_6cfd.html" title="Fast Fourier transform">Fast Fourier transform</a> to convert vectors between the canonical basis of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/0/6/906162d343492a23835a8d781865be80.png" alt="\Bbb C^n" /> and the Fourier basis <span class="texhtml">(<i>d</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>)</span>. This algorithm is significantly faster than the matrix multiplication required in the general case of change of basis. On the other hand, wavelets are often defined so that the change of basis matrix is sparse, and so again the change of basis algorithm is efficient. "</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following paragraph was deleted too; perhaps it should go to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_processing.html" title="Signal processing">signal processing</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The signal could arise from a variety of physical processes. For instance, one could measure the seismic movement of the ground with a <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seismograph.html" title="Seismograph">seismograph</a>. The output of a seismograph is a strip of paper known as a <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seismogram.html" title="Seismogram">seismogram</a>. This strip of paper can be interpreted as the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graph_of_a_function.html" title="Graph of a function">graph of a function</a>. This function will be in <i>L</i><sup>2</sup> as defined above, and thus we obtain a mathematical signal from a physical process."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following paragraphs did not seem to make sense: given that "signal" was defined as a *function*, it would seem that <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> is always well-defined in that case. Perhaps this text was assuming that a signal could be a *distribution* (such as, e.g., Dirac's)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The domain of <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> includes at least all continuous functions of <span class="texhtml">[0,1]</span>. On the other hand, for technical reasons, it is not clear how to extend <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> to all of <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><sup>2</sup></span>. In particular (and perhaps more telling) is that <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> is not continuous as a function on <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><sup>2</sup></span>.</dd>

<dd>Indeed, define <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></span> by</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then, the norm <span class="texhtml">| | <i>f</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> | |</span> in <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><sup>2</sup></span> is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/7/a/47ac5cd0438beb8cd4fd013b3f937034.png" alt="1/\sqrt k" /> and so <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></span> converges to zero. However, for any <span class="texhtml"><i>k</i> &gt; <i>n</i></span>, the vector <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub><i>f</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></span> is <span class="texhtml">(0,...,0,1)</span> and so <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub><i>f</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></span> does not converge to zero. Hence <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> is not continuous."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, the sampling function <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> very poorly represents our notion of closeness in our signal space <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><sup>2</sup></span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following section has the same problem, and it also assumes non-trivial concepts of wavelets etc., so it should probably go elsewhere, too:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"For instance, it is possible to choose a reconstruction formula based on the Haar basis (see wavelets) in which case <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> does not fold any high frequencies into the lower frequencies. However, this reconstruction formula (or the Haar basis) are inappropriate to most problems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If one is giving a reconstruction formula in terms of Hilbert bases, as is our case, then one can give a "perfect" filter, which does not fold any frequencies at all, in terms of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convolution.html" title="Convolution">convolutions</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This sampling method, unlike <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span>, is defined over <i>all</i> of <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><sup>2</sup></span>. Also, by the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cauchy-Schwarz_inequality_0bf5.html" title="Cauchy-Schwarz inequality">Cauchy-Schwarz inequality</a> (for instance,) <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> is also continuous in the root mean square norm. Hence, signals which alias to the same sampled vector will be related as far as the root mean square norm is concerned.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally the discussion of the operator <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> does not seem to be very useful. The operator does not eliminate aliasing, it only reduces it. On the other hand, when addressing this topic one MUST discuss the sinc filter (which does eliminate aliasing) and the Gaussian filter (which does a pretty good job, and is free from ringing). In any case, this material should be in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aliasing.html" title="Anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a>, not here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No filtering algorithm "eliminates" aliasing. Whatever algorithm you use, you will never be able to recover an unexpectedly complex signal after sampling and filtering. In the classical setting, if you have 1000 samples but the signal is sin(10000x) you will not be able to recognize it. Instead, you will guess that it's some lower frequency signal -- this, regardless of your filtering algorithm. Hence sin(10000x) aliases to something else, regardless of your filtering algorithm. With that in mind, sinc filtering is optimal in the sense I described in the article, which is not always the correct meaning. If you look at my example in the caveats, a normalized linear polynomial over T, you will see that if you apply any of the filters you mention (S_1, Gaussian or sinc) you get a very poor representation of the original function, regardless how many samples you have. In that case, the "optimal" filtering algorithm is to recover z completely using two samples cleverly. <a href="../../../l/o/i/User%7ELoisel_933f.html" title="User:Loisel">Loisel</a> 20:47, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Jorge, obviously you made many changes without knowing what you were talking about. The paragraphs you mention above as not making any sense are in fact highly relevant. I will therefore undo some of your damage. The sampling function S_0 is in fact ill defined on L^2, which is the space of signals. This need to be mentioned. The remaining text actually said specifically what anti-aliasing was and up to what point it worked. <a href="../../../l/o/i/User%7ELoisel_933f.html" title="User:Loisel">Loisel</a> 06:13, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<li>I have now fixed much of the damage. While the presentation is probably superior the way it is now, thanks to Jorge, I would request that unless you understand the details of the section marked "caveats", you refrain from further mangling this article. <a href="../../../l/o/i/User%7ELoisel_933f.html" title="User:Loisel">Loisel</a> 06:58, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Loisel, I don't claim to be an expert in math and signal processing, but I don think I am illiterate either. Note that a signal was *defined* in the article to be a *function* from [0,1] to C; that L^2, as defined, is therefore a set of *functions*; and that the S_0 operator merely evaluates f at specific points. Thus S_0 f is *always* well-defined, not only for L^2 signals or continuous signals, but for *any* function f defined on [0,1], even e.g. the is-rational predicate.<br />
&#160;<br />
Presumably what you meant is that S_0 is not *continuous*: which is true, and indeed relevant for sampling theory and practice -- but not to explain aliasing, as far as I can see. So perhaps this observation should go to the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_sampling.html" title="Signal sampling">signal sampling</a> page?<br />
&#160;<br />
I also don't understand the point of introducing the S_1 operator in this page, since it is neither a mathematically correct way to avoid aliasing, nor what is done in practice (where one typically uses a Gaussian-like sampling kernel, for physical limitations and mathematical reasons). Again, perhaps the S_1 operator should go to the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_%28signal_processing%29.html" title="Sampling (signal processing)">sampling</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aliasing.html" title="Anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a> page, as a pedagogical example to introduce the concept of general convolution sampling?<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a> 13:31, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Or perhaps S_1 could be moved to a later section, titled e.g. "Aliasing under convolution sampling" or some such?<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a> 14:07, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>L^2 is usually defined as a space of functions. However, for technical reasons, if two functions f and g in L^2 agree everywhere but on a small set (for instance, if they disagree at a single point) then it is not possible to distinguish f and g in L^2. This is because L^2 is in fact the space specified in the article <i>modulo a certain equivalence relation</i>. If f and g in L^2 agree everywhere except on a set E of measure 0, then f and g are indistinguishable in L^2. This is because ||f-g||=0. In order for || || to be a norm, we have to guarantee that ||f||=0 only when f=0. This particular piece of information is useful, but belongs in the Lp spaces article; at best, a reference to the relevant bit of that article should be inserted.</dd>

<dd>This nuance is often explained at some point when initially doing L^p spaces, never to be mentioned again (this is for instance how Folland and Rudin do it.) While it may be good to explain this technicality somehow, my opinion is that it belongs in the L^p spaces article, not this one. If you beg to differ, go ahead and make the change; however, you may then have to explain some measure theory so that people understand when functions in L^2 are indistinguishable.</dd>

<dd>Also worth mentioning, if one wishes to dig into the details, is that the evaluation map x-&gt;f(x), while not defined for all x \in R, is defined for all x \in E where R\E is a set of zero measure and E is called the Lebesgue set of f. Unfortunately, E changes with f, and so the "Lebesgue set of L^2" is empty. Still, the evaluation map, for a fixed x and with f varying in some subspace of V of L^2 whose Lebesgue sets contain x, is not continuous in f \in V.</dd>

<dd>The S_1 operator is just another linear map from L^2 to C^n, like S_0. However, it is better than S_0 since it is actually defined on L^2 (this refers to the paragraph I just wrote, which explains why S_0 isn't clearly defined on L^2.) It is also a better filtering method than point sampling (the Fourier transform of the point sampling method fails to decay, but the uniform averaging method has a Fourier transform which decays like sinx/x (or 1/x if you prefer) which is not very good but better than nothing. A gaussian filter has a Fourier transform that decays like a gaussian, which is much better. Of course, a sinc filter has a Fourier transform that looks like a square wave, which is often considered perfect. All the filtering methods I just mentionned <b>do</b> help with anti-aliasing, even S_1. <a href="../../../l/o/i/User%7ELoisel_933f.html" title="User:Loisel">Loisel</a> 06:52, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

But it seems to me that this change is not well motivated. The way it's stated now makes the "folding" or "mirroring" property of aliasing more explicit.

<dd>Yes, that appears to be correct and more acceptable. I'm still not sure what's wrong with the present version, or why this is an improvement, though. I see we do have the same error at Nyquist frequency in the other one, fixable the same way. This fix is however a bit misleading, as it confusing getting the frequency right with avoiding aliasing. Hmmmm... I'll let you change it as you see fit, given that I've had my say. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 01:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In case it isn't obvious, I think what we are saying is that an anti-aliasing filter (and a rectangular one at that) is a good thing to do before sampling.</p>
<p>But how do we confine a sinc function to the interval [0,1]? Is that why we need the "some sort of" caveat? And how do we design a "sort of sinc" filter?</p>
<p>Frankly, these sections don't do much for me. Why "teach" functional analysis here? The relevant points seem to be these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mapping from an higher dimensional space to a lower one loses information that cannot be recovered.</li>
<li>Filtered sampling is more realistic than instantaneous sampling.</li>
<li>Filtered sampling is "better" than instantaneous sampling, from the viewpoint of aliasing.
<ul>
<li>(assumes the distortion caused by the filter does not count)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An anti-aliasing filter with instantaneous sampling is equivalent to filtered sampling.</li>
<li>"Some sort of sinc" filter is the optimum anti-aliasing filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I missing something? Are these unsurprising (and in some cases vague) points enough to justify section 5?</p>

<p>I think this section may be largely incorrect, or at least somewhat wide of the mark. In my recollection, and what few revelant refs I've been able to find, an alias in radio is just am image frequency. Most of the discussion about spectrum reversal seems not quite relevant. The point of aliasing is not so much that you have a choice of high-side or low-side local oscillator, but that after you've chosen you still have to fight the image or alias from the other side. Is there a book that either makes this clear or supports the current text? <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 16:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But it does not confirm that as the origin of the term "aliasing" (if that is your concern). I don't know where that idea comes from.

<dd>Dick, I checked your reference, and it is more consistent with the "modern" meaning of "aliasing" than Jorge's description. That inconsistency is what led me to write the caveat: "Even when the aliases are identical there is still a fundamental difference between the modern and historical meanings. ..."</dd>
<dd>Your reference is poorly written, but if you stick with it, what it says is that a signal at <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/4/e/74ef41095731ea41db29aef5ed214238.png" alt="f_{LO}+f_{IF}\," /> and <u>at the same time</u> (same <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/0/b/30bb19ee5b6f67ba320a38a7e282fe94.png" alt="f_{LO}\," />)a <u>different</u> signal at <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/8/0/d80b3c88ffb714691fe8fbf927cb3062.png" alt="f_{LO}-f_{IF}\," /> will both end up at <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/0/0/100678d99a0cd540cd7cd84d355fea44.png" alt="f_{IF}\," />. (Low-side injection for one signal is high-side injection for another.) Two different signals map to the same frequency, just like sampling causes different sinusoids to produce the same samples (before interpolation) or at least the same frequency (after interpolation).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since that looks like a legitimate use of the word "aliasing", I think we should just fix up the description, rather than delete the whole section. I think it is interesting.</dd>
