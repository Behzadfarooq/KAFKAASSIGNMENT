<p>Since 2000, Jewish immigration to Israel/Palestine has fallen by more than half compared to the late 90s. In 2006, they numbered less than twenty thousand, a nine percent drop compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p>This drop should be referenced in the article, along with the Jewish Agency numbers for the past six years, which are availible. Avoiding this dramatic decline is part of a subtle, but pervasive tone of boosterism that compromises the the objectivity of the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The russian alyah being almost over, the drop is no surprise. Interestingly, the number of Western Jews has increased in the 2000's, in particular from the USA and France. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 11:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Land of Israel" in the lead sentence seems to me to be an anachronism, and one that is almost certainly here with the intent of making a political point. Our article <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a> makes the claim that "During the British mandate of Palestine, the name Eretz Yisrael (abbreviated א״י Aleph-Yod), was part of the official name of the territory." This may be (first I've ever heard of it, to be honest), but it was certainly not the case when the Aliyah started in Ottoman times. Jewish sources from the time almost universally used the term "Palestine", as can be easily ascertained from the 1901-1906 <i><a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a></i>. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:15, September 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>While Jews may have referred to the land as "Palestine" in English, nearly all Jews would use the cultural, religious term Eretz Yisroel (Land of Israel) when referring to Aliya. Aliya is at heart a religious term emphasising the spiritual "assent" that comes from living in the Holy Land. The term Aliya therefore is very much linked with the term Eretz Yisroel. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.178.107.145 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.178.107.145_3302.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.178.107.145">contribs</a>) 26 July 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Ah, the wonders of Wikipedia: I got a response from the man himself. Excerpting from our email exchange:
<dl>
<dt>LL</dt>
<dd>I've read your questions about me and my book, "Aliya," on Wikipedia, and would like to respond. I'm a ninth-generation Israeli who had left the country in 1999, for a variety of reasons, and immigrated to New York. As soon as I arrived here, I became fascinated with those American Jews who travelled the opposite path, making Aliya to Israel, and so interviewed a number of them and wrote a non-fiction book about it. My conclusions are that Aliya, commonly perceived as being an act motivated by a sole force, Zionism, is more complicated: While in 1947, for example, Zionism was certainly the driving force behind Aliya, in the present Aliya is mainly practiced by Orthodox Jews who often choose to move to West Bank settlements out of religio-political motivations. I have some more info on the subject, if you're interested, on my website, www.lielleibovitz.com.</dd>
<dt>JM</dt>
<dd>Thanks. Yes, I would agree that Zionism and aliyah as understood in the pre-State (or even pre-1967 or arguably pre-1982) years were a very different matter than what is mostly happening today.<br />
<br />
Did I mischaracterize you when I described you as "an advocate of aliyah of American Jews"?</dd>
<dt>LL</dt>
<dd>…I am not an advocate of Aliya, especially having myself chosen to leave Israel and settle in New York. I'm fascinated by it as a sociological phenomenon -- the lack of traditional push/pull factors and the predominance of ideology are thrilling -- but am far from embracing it as the only, or even the best, course of action recommended to American Jews. The book, in fact, ends with a conversation I had with one of the Americans who had made Aliya, in which he states his opinion (mine as well) that it matters not where you choose to live but what's in your mind and heart.</dd>

<dd>Thanks, being able to add "Shlomo Amar" to the search terms gave me much more relevant hits. Let me see if I understand correctly. In summer 2004, Amar (the Sephardic Chief Rabbi) led a delegation to India to examine the matter. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3575716.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3575716.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> In March 2005, he declared that they were genuinely descendants of the lost tribe of Menashe. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4400957.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4400957.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> In November 2005, out of respect for the Indian government, the Israelis have halted conversions <i>in India</i> to Orthodox Judaism, but are instead letting the Bnei Menashe emigrate first and then be converted. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4422510.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4422510.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> And the challenge was more a matter of Indian politics than actual dispute as to their descent, is that correct?

<p>Actually yes, the majority of the Indian state of <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizoram.html" title="Mizoram">Mizoram</a> (home of the Bnei Menashe) are still Christian and have not converted to Judaism, while half of them agree that they are decedents of Israelites, they choose not to convert anyway.

<p>Well it may not seem massive but remember, France is a very developed western country, where for the most part, people live comfortably.

<dd>Not to trivialize it, and clearly the rise suggests something that belongs in the article, but it seems to me that what has been written in the article is rather disproportionate to about 2% of French Jews making aliyah in six years. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First the number of Jews in France was 500,000 according to a large survey in 2000. Which means less than that today. The numbers here about the Aliyah do not include all the people who left to Israel without making aliyah&#160;; it does not include of course the people who left for the UK, Canada and the USA (many thousands also). And most important - the Jews who leave France are mostly young.

Perhaps he could elaborate as to why he believes otherwise. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 08:32, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I reverted it back. You can't introduce your own private point of view in Wikipedia, in particular before discussing it. Anyway the idea that the gathering to Israel occurs before the Mashiah is not an innovation of Zionism (which is a secular ideology and does not deal with the Mashiah issue), and in fact was the point of view of the Rambam and most great rabbis. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 10:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So, we can discuss it. It's not my private view. On the contrary, it's the view in the article that is someone's private view. Jews prayed throughout the ages to return to the Holy Land with Moshiach. That is the fact. That point is deliberately left out due to the writer's POV agenda.</dd>
<dd>I've reverted it back again.</dd>
<dd>On the contrary, the Rambam writes clearly in laws of kings 11:1 that it will be Moshiach who will gather the exiles only after the rebuilding of the Holy Temple. Now that I've quoted a source, if you have sources that indicate otherwise, the onus now lies on <i>you</i> to prove so. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 12:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, you are not going to impose your personal agenda. Your view is a very minority view inside Judaism. Most rabbis, may I remind you, are Zionists, and even Shas describes itself as Zionist. Their have been aliyoth all over history and the idea that we have to wait for the Mashiah before is *modern*. In fact, the Rambam himself *made Aliyah* and explained it was forbidden to leave Israel. The fact that the Mashiah will gather the remnants of the Jews to Israel does not mean that it is forbidden to make aliyah before him. Just that, as today 60% of Jews are still outside Israel, he will bring them back to Israel. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 13:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>1. Whoa, talk about lacking NPOV. "Most rabbis are zionists." (What does Shas' self description have to do with anything?) I'd always thought the opposite, but whatever. Did you take a vote, or something? Anyway, I have quoted a source, viz. the Rambam, and you have provided no counter-source, only made sweeping baseless statements. Now the onus lies on <i>you</i> to prove your point quoting a counter source.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You seem not to understand that your POV is only yours. Your source did nothing to support your point about the Zionism inventing something or the fact that "mass" Aliyah was forbidden. As for most rabbis being Zionists, it is easy: Zionist Religious represent 15-20% of the Israeli population&#160;; Shas Haredim are 5%&#160;; other non-Zionist Haredim are 5%. Easy count. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 15:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again (you didn't read my last post, apparently) I never said that "mass" Aliyah before Moshiach's coming is/was forbidden. All I said was that this was not something that Jews traditionally prayed for. As for most rabbis being Zionists, how about measuring it in terms of rabbis and in terms of world Orthodox Jewry, and you'll get a vastly different count. RZs are certainly not a majority of Orthodox Jews. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 17:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>RZ are a majority of Orthodox Jews in Israel and in the world. I gave you figures for Israel where the vast majority of Orthodox Jews live. In the Diaspora, it is more difficult to assess but from my personnal knowledge, it should not be very different. Sorry. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 11:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I did some online research (at least on the Holy Land), and I've found that you're facts are wrong. RZs are not a majority&#160;:
<dl>
<dd><i>Several recent studies by the Guttman Institute and the Avihai Foundation, the Floersheimer Institute, the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, and others reveal that the Jewish population of Jerusalem is divided into four more or less equal groups -- in Hebrew, haredim, datiim (meaning Religious Zionists), masortiim (traditional), and hilonim -- not just into haredim and hilonim.</i> <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg2.htm</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>According to this it is clear that RZs represent at most a third of the Orthodox population--which makes them, of course, <i>a minority group</i>, contrary to your claim. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 14:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you can't even know how to read now&#160;? You are speaking here of Jerusalem. And masoratiim are not Orthodox, they are not religious, by definition. So, in Jerusalem, known for its huge Haredi population, even there, they are only half of the orthodox population. Once again you prove my point. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 16:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. You misunderstand me. I never said that someone ever had to wait before making Aliyah. Indeed, it was done. Never said otherwise. I said that <i>the notion that it is proper for all Jews to make aliyah en masse</i> as opposed to waiting for Moshiach to redeem them, is an innovation of the Zionists, and I'm still waiting for you to adduce a counter-source. I certainly never said that "it is forbidden to make aliyah". I said that the notion that <i>mass</i> (operative word) aliyah before the coming of Moshiach is a positive goal that ought to be promoted is a new idea that did not exist historically, and it's intellectually dishonest to superimpose it on the prayers in the Amidah.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well you are wrong. Just a little example: ever heard of Rav Kalisher&#160;? He was before the Zionists. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 15:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, it started with him, then. When did he live, in the 1800's? If so, I can add that this idea started in the 1800s. Either way, you have proved my point that a prayer for a mass return to the land before Moshiach is NOT what the Amidah is talking about. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 17:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. As for not leaving, this is confusion. The prohibition to leave the land of Israel has nothing to do with a Mitzvah to get up and go there, which is a separate matter entirely. The former does not necessitate the latter. However, the article clearly implies that such an obligation is held to exist by "most rabbis", when the only one who holds this is the Ramban. I challenge you to find contemporaries of the Ramban (Rishonim) who agree with him on this point.</p>
<p>Please provide solide sources for your views before reverting again. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 15:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well you are the one who changed the text, not me, and you have until now absolutely no source at all to sustain your point of view. You are the one supposed to prove it BEFORE making the changes. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 15:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly did quote a source: re there not being a yearning for mass aliyah before Moshiach I quoted the Rambam in laws of kings 11:1 who rules that it will be Moshiach who will gather the exiles only after the rebuilding of the Holy Temple. As for the idea that there is an obligation to make Aliyah, I pointed out that only the Ramban holds this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I grant that I didn't quote sources before. But now that I have, it behooves you to find counter sources before reverting. I'm waiting. <a href="../../../y/e/h/User%7EYehoishophot_Oliver_7752.html" title="User:Yehoishophot Oliver">Yehoishophot Oliver</a> 17:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your source does not prove your point, in fact it means absolutely nothing in our discussion. And now you also contradict yourself as you say than Ramban defended the idea of mandatory Aliyah - so it is not an invention of Zionism. Thanks a lot. Do you even read what you write&#160;? And don't come with the innovation of the "mass" Aliyah argument - if it is a mitsvah to make Aliyah so all Jews should make it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, in Wikipedia you can't write POV things like "it's a Zionist invention" and say it is a fact when most people disagree with you and yourself have no argument for it. So either you write "some ultra-orthodox sects believe than mass Aliyah is possible only after the coming of the Mashiah" (and by the way, most non- Zionist Haredim do not believe that just a tiny minority), or you don't write anything. But if you continue your vandalism, I will ask for you to be banned from editing. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 11:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course my sources (the rambam and the ramban) prove my points. Why don't you <i>explain</i> why you think that it doesn't? It goes to show that you have no response. The ramban was the only one who believed that aliyah was an obligation, correct. That doesn't mean that he conceived of it as taking place practically; due to the danger of living in the land, it was next to impossible to put that into practice en masse. The idea of something being practically possible and it being an obligation are separate notions. Which is why the Ramban himself didn't live there for many years. Do you even read what I write? But I see that these "subtle points" are lost on you.</dd>

<dd>We are not here to discuss what the Rambam and the Ramban said but what YOU said, that coming to Israel before the Mashiah is a Zionist invention. The simple fact that the Ramban prescribed Aliyah proves you are wrong. The fact that is was not practical at his time just explains why it happened only during the 19th century when it became possible. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 16:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one believes that "mass Aliyah is possible only after the coming of the Mashiah", because mass aliyah has been done. It's a fact that no one denies. Maybe you should read what I write before reverting my edits. Did I talk about mass aliyah being possible in the posts above? I didn't address that issue before the previous paragraph, yet you refer to it as if I raised it. The point I made was that this was never widely deemed as a desirable goal, and certainly never prayed for, and <i>certainly not the meaning of the prayers in the Amidah, which are talking abou the Redemption through Moshiach!</i>. And you have brought not one shred of proof to the contrary. Which makes <i>your</i> edits POV.</dd>

<dd>I made no edit, you did. And you give no academic source, no reference, nothing that proves your point. It is about time that you understand that I have nothing to prove - you have and you did not. You are the one writing bold affirmations about a "Zionist invention". And this is your right, but only if: 1) You write a source (academic) with it that says that this is a Zionist invention &#160;; 2) and unless there is a scientific consensus about it, you write that this is the point of view of a particular group. You don't do it, you will be reverted over and over again. I will let you the benefit of the doubt, you seem to be new. So make a new edit that respects these rules, or I will call for an intervention. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 16:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
