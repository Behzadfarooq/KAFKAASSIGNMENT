               ALI HAIDAR was the only Pathan to receive the Victoria Cross in 
           the Second World War. His death reduces the number of living Second 
           World War VCs to 25. The action which brought him his award typifies 
           the sense of duty to comrades of the men of the North-West frontier 
           region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where warfare between 
           tribes or against an invader is a way of life. He was serving as a 
           sepoy (private soldier) in what would be regarded as his local 
           regiment - the 13th Frontier Force Rifles. 
</pre>
<pre>
               By the early spring of 1945 the 8th Army's long slog up Italy 
           appeared almost over, yet one final offensive was required to clear 
           the German 10th Army out of the north-eastern corner of the 
           peninsula. The enemy had plenty of fight left in him. General von 
           Vietinghoff had replaced Field-Marshal Kesselring in March but 
           inherited his instructions to hold northern Italy for as long as 
           possible.
           
               Unusually dry weather in January had allowed the 8th Army to 
           close up to the River Senio on the northern Adriatic coast. From 
           there it was planned to break into the plain of the Po and trap the 
           opposing German forces before they could escape across the river.
            
               But first it was essential to cross and establish bridgeheads 
           over the Senio. The offensive was opened on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a> by General Sir 
           Charles Keightley's 5th Corps with the 8th Indian and 2nd New 
           Zealand Divisions leading on the right and left respectively. The 
           6/13th Frontier Force Rifles, to which Ali Haidar belonged, were 
           with 19th Indian Brigade of the 8th Division. 
           
               The crossing of the Senio began in daylight after a prolonged 
           artillery bombardment and close support bombing by the United States 
           Army Air Force. Ali Haidar was with the extreme left-hand section of 
           his battalion. 
           
               The assault boats came under accurate machinegun fire as soon as 
           they left the river bank and, of his section, only he and two 
           comrades reached the far side. The remainder of the company were 
           held up by sustained fire from two enemy posts thirty and sixty 
           yards away. 
           
               Without waiting for orders, Ali Haidar told his comrades to cover 
           him and charged the nearer post and threw in a grenade. Almost 
           simultaneously the enemy threw one at him, wounding him severely in 
           the back. Undeterred, he continued his lone attack and charged into 
           the post and forced the occupants to surrender. 
           
               Leaving the prisoners with his two comrades, he began to stalk 
           the second post but was again wounded in the right arm and leg. 
           Although weakened by loss of blood he crawled closer, raised himself 
           from the ground, threw a grenade and charged into the second post. 
           Two enemy were wounded and the other two surrendered. Immediately 
           the second enemy post was silenced, his company launched its assault 
           boats, crossed the river and established its bridgehead. 
           
               Ali Haidar was picked up and carried to the river bank. His 
           citation for the award of the Victoria Cross concluded: "The 
           conspicuous gallantry, initiative and determination, combined with a 
           complete disregard for his own life, shown by this very brave sepoy 
           in the face of heavy odds were an example to the whole company. His 
           heroism saved an ugly situation which would - but for his personal 
           bravery - have caused the battalion serious casualties at a critical 
           time and delayed the crossing of the river." 
           
               Once over the Senio, the 6/13th Frontier Force Rifles made a 
           rapid advance and gained all their objectives. In the process they 
           took 220 prisoners. 
           
               Ali Haidar's wounds were indeed serious and he was unable to 
           return to active duty with his regiment until after the war. He did 
           eventually return and served until he had achieved the rank of 
           Jemadar (platoon officer). He then retired to his home district in 
           the North-West Frontier province of Pakistan to run a small scrub 
           farm with his wife. 
           
               Finally, age and poor health obliged him to sell his farm, as he 
           had no children to help with the work or to support him and his 
           wife. The fact that they were finding life extremely hard was 
           highlighted when he visited London for a reunion of the Victoria 
           Cross and George Cross Association in 1993. His wife had been ill 
           and the couple depended entirely on a modest Indian Army pension and 
           the £100 per year paid to all VC holders by the British Government. 
           
               The Pakistan High Commission in London was able to give him some 
           financial support in 1993. Two years later, he and his wife's 
           circumstances were much improved when the VC pension paid by the 
           British Government was increased to £1,300 per annum. 
           
               Ali Haidar visited England again for the 1995 celebrations to 
           mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. He 
           took part in the parade of the surviving Second World War holders of 
           the Victoria Cross who were able to attend. Although he was little 
           more than five feet tall and he spoke little English, his soldierly 
           bearing, decorative Pathan <i>pugri</i> and brilliant smile made him 
           an instantly popular figure. 
           
               He married, in 1947, Meena Jan, daughter of Hussain Ghulam and 
           Mehtab Jain. His wife, invariably known simply as "Begum Ali Haidar, 
           VC", predeceased him.
