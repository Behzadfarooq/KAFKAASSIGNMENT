<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photograph of Brendan Smyth</span></h2>
<p>Ali-oops - I just discovered the recently posted (October 2006) photograph of Brendan Smyth on your entry of the Wikipedia article concerning Smyth. Smyth was known to me as Father Gerry during his assignment at Our Lady of Mercy (OLM) in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. His birth name is John Gerard Smyth. I am interested in communcating with the individual (Illumina29) who shared the photograph taken in 1965 at age 9 while Smyth was assigned to Our Lady or Mercy (OLM).</p>
<p>Can you please forward this message to Illumina29? My e-mail address is attymcg@aol.com</p>
<p>According to newspaper accounts, Smyth was first assigned to OLM in the summer of 1965. He left OLM briefly and was returned to Ireland in March of 1968 where he received aversion therapy at Purdysburn hospital in Belfast. According to Father Bruno Mulvihill, whose interview was captured in the <i>UTV Counterpoint</i> four part documetaries <i>Suffer Little Children &amp; Keeping the Faith</i>, Fr. Smyth was returned to Ireland in 1968 because he had been molesting children in Rhode Island. Smyth was permitted to return to Our Lady of Mercy parish off and on through the 1980s and often stayed in the homes of parish families.</p>

<li>Firstly, don't attempt to intimidate me. Secondly, if something is non-notable IMO (and in other editors' opinion), it should be removed. Having the Starwood issue under mediation does not give you or anyone else carte blanche to insert the wikilink into any article you please. Frankly, it's not relevant to the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Farrar_e5eb.html" title="Stewart Farrar">Stewart Farrar</a> article.

<ul>
<li>I think the only way to resolve this is to go through all the Neopagan articles and say whether or not the subject of the article has ever appeared in Alison's Kitchen. We must document this with links not only to Alison's Kitchen, but also with external links to any commercial websites you might like to set up, such as ticket sales to Alison's Kitchen and sales of CDs from performances that have taken place in Alison's Kitchen, and places to buy the books of people who have visited Alison's Kitchen. It will take a lot of time and effort to place all these links, and defend them from those who would hate, persecute, and personally attack Alison's Kitchen, but it's the only way to be sure. And I'm certain the broader Wikipedia community will appreciate it, too. They are all dying to know about Alison's Kitchen and who has appeared there. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 03:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure how I did that, and no, I don't quite know everyone, but I've been lucky/blessed to meet and become friends with a lot of folks in the Pagan, Consciousness, and World Music communities. But you're right about my cooking; however, I make a mean Chorizo/split pea/sweet potato stew. Few of these folks have gotten a taste, though; it takes 2 days to make in a crock-pot, and when I see these folks I usually only have time for stovetop and campfire cooking, alas. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 17:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As to the relevance of his appearance at Starwood, I wonder what your insistance that it NOT be mentioned is based on? Starwood is the largest, and tied for the longest-running, Neo-Pagan festival in America, and it was the first major American event to host the collaborative team of Stewart, Janet, and Gavin Bone. The heading was "Involvement in Wicca", and I think a simple mention of this appearance is appropriate. Now if you think other appearances are also notable, then why not do you own research and add a list of appearances to the article like Oberon's has? I feel strongly about this in part because Kathryn and a few others seem determined to eliminate ANY mention of Starwood anywhere, and I sincerely believe that inclusion in the Starwood roster is notable. This is NOT a link to a "commercial site", just one to the Wiki page of the event mentioned. I would not delete any mention of Pagan Spirit Gathering, Rites of Spring, Free Spirit Gathering, or Pan Pagan Festival either, though they are smaller. Stewart's involvement in Wicca surely includes his lecture appearances at major Pagan/Magical events, though perhaps not the "bo-zillions of festivals/conferences/talks" he has spoken at you allude to. Such data makes the encyclopedia listing that much more complete. I don't understand why YOU don't think so. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 18:38, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Frankly, I'm highly suspicious of your touting of Starwood on just about every page you can get away with. Not to mention the revert-wars that have ensued. In the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Farrar_e5eb.html" title="Stewart Farrar">Stewart Farrar</a> article, I hardly see the notability of it as it certainly does nothing to embellish the biography of the man IMHO. Fine to mention Stewart on the Starwood page, but the converse certainly isn't true. You have way too much invested in this, for some reason. Why? - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">Alison</a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAli-oops_b892.html" title="User talk:Ali-oops"><font color="DarkRed">✍</font></a></sup> 18:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Here are some other statements in this article. Are they notable? I don't plan to challenge a single one.:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Farrar was one of the first British officers to enter Auschwitz, an experience that Knowles claims "greatly influenced his personal and political beliefs"[4]." (Who cares if he was first, or if someone claims it influenced him?)</p>
<p>"According to mystica.com, Farrar "found the ceremony both dignified and moving"[2]." (So what? Encyclopedic?)</p>
<p>"Farrar began work on his first non-fiction book, What Witches Do, and began taking classes on witchcraft from the Sanders'." (The publication date of the book is listed elsewhere, twice in fact. Who cares when he began it, or began some classes?)</p>
<p>"Maxine Sanders remembers Farrar as "a charming man, a sincere student with an active flexible mind"[6]." (Encyclopedic? That she found him charming and sincere?)</p>
<p>"Janet Farrar asserts that the couple were both elevated to the second degree "in an unoccupied house in Sydenham" by the Sanders on October 17, 1970," (Who cares if the house was unoccupied?)</p>
<p>"The ceremony was attended by Farrar's two daughters and two sons from three previous marriages - his marriage to Owen was his seventh." (Who cares that his kids attended his handfasting?)</p>
<p>"In 1976 the Farrars moved to Ireland to get away from the busy life of London[7]." (Who cares if they liked or disliked "the busy life of London"?)</p>
<p>I object to none of this. I see no reason that an article in an encyclopedia has to be boring, sparse, clipped, or contain only the barest necessary information. I've read plenty of articles in encyclopedias, and have NEVER found this to be true.</p>
<p>I've already told you reasons why I think the Starwood appearance is notable, certainly more so than the passages above. In fact, it is the ONLY reference to Stewart's decades-long career as a lecturer, teacher, and workshop facilitator in the whole article, certainly as important as the fact that "from 1953 to 1954 he worked in London's Reuters office" or that his death followed "a brief illness". In fact, it is the only mention of a public appearance by Stewart for ANY reason!</p>
<p>Now why do YOU insist on taking it down, aside from your personal view that "it certainly does nothing to embellish the biography of the man"? I have made no secret of the high regard I have for the Starwood Festival, and I think Stewart's featured headline appearance at America's largest magical festival DOES, in fact, embellish the section entitled "Involvement in Wicca" for his bio. I know, personally, he felt honored to be included, and offered more classes than the festival asked him to. He wanted to be a spokesperson for the Craft, and this is the only example of his doing so in the entire article. Aside from your suspicions about my motives, WHY doesn't the mention belong there? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 21:02, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">vandalism on breast implant page</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your help with the advertising links that were on the breast implant article, plastic surgery article, etc.</p>
<p>I'm having trouble with someone who calls himself Droliver who keeps reverting the breast implant page. If you read the discussion, you'll get a sense of what's going on. I am an epidemiologist and I keep trying to insert some NPOV -- currently the article reads like a plastic surgery website, because Droliver apparently is a plastic surgeon (and given the amount of time he spends on this article, perhaps is also paid by someone to edit the article).</p>
<p>The latest outrage is that when I tried to replace some old links at the end (including one with paid ads on it) and include some NPOV links from National Cancer Institute and FDA, he deleted them, replacing them again with an outdated article by a plastic surgeon. Can you help? Several women's health experts (doctors and public health folks) have supported my efforts, but he keeps vandalizing. He keeps calling me "political" because he disagrees that there are any risks for breast implants. I have published 4 books, numerous medical journal articles, etc, but that doesn't matter to him. Please help.Drzuckerman 00:31, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sadly, I think that the link that was recently removed from the TS page was actually strikingly understanding for a Christian source. Honestly, if most Christians held even those beliefs life as a transsexual would be easier.</p>
<p>Of course, it does show a number of issues and inconsistencies immediately, but you can't expect purityranical values to change significantly that quickly! I do like though, however the end of the medical page discussing the "true" transsexuals, "Theologically, the process is ethically problematical in that it questions the decision of God to create an individual as male or female." and the VERY NEXT PAGE talks about those who are born with an ambiguous gender. Uh... how can it be ethically problematic by questioning God's will to create something between male and female (or even to *gasp* get it "wrong") when there exist people, who by their very existance show that God does not have a problem with "creating" someone who is neither male nor female. Of course, the other inconsistancy with it is they say "Furthermore, the sex-change operation can ... and not their DNA and the chromosomes which make them biologically male or female." But yet, physical evidence exists that shows that "genetic gender" is misleading, inaccurate and in some cases out right wrong.</p>
<p>Again, they attack the problem from their assumed premises that exclude the possibility of people truly being something other than "perfect", in order to support their own bias against those who are different. But still! Despite all this wonderful misleading and inaccurate information, you can see that they're actually trying to truly deal with the problem logically, and not just dismiss it outright because "The Bible don't say nuttin' about no transssexuals." &#160;:) Just thought I'd share from a Christian perspective, that from many houses in the world, that that link would be considered blastphemous, and outright too liberal, and supportive. Even though, we already know by physical evidence that it's just wrong, and inconsistant. But I have to give them credit for at least <b>trying</b> to not be typical arrogant judgemental Christians. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 02:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OH! Do you know anything about this "contraversial study out of John Hopkin's"? I find it very hard to believe that anyone could come up with a regret rate of over 10%... I have a college text book that cites that high of a regret level, and it was being consistantly reverted away on the TS page. So, unless they were totally making data up (hey, it happens) then, I don't see how it could even have been done. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 02:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, no, because it's an article about Ireland, with a <i>very</i> brief mention of political entities. The very mention of the word 'province' introduces ambiguity and confusion to the reader (as you have just demonstrated). This has been gone over again and again on this article. You're not introducing clarity here, rather you're potentially introducing reader confusion and political bias. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> article already defines the political situation well enough and interested readers can go there directly from the {{<a href="../../../d/a/b/Template%7EDablink_fdf2.html" title="Template:Dablink">dablink</a>}} at the top - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">Alison</a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAli-oops_b892.html" title="User talk:Ali-oops"><font color="DarkRed">✍</font></a></sup> 05:44, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apologies if this comment is in the wrong place but I simply wanted to communicate and explain some edits made to the page on transsexualism (and its etiology). While there are several statements to the fact that the cause of transsexualism is unknown, a number of passages appear to promote the view that it has biological cause. I have tried to correct for this, while retaining as much of the original content as possible.</p>
