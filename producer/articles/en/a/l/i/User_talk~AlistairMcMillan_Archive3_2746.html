<p>I'm going to give it a shot at NPOVing it. I'd like to work with you on this one, perhaps modifying the language slightly. I don't want to reduce the impact of security however, but I'd like to give a stab at writing it from a slightly more neutral point of view. Any feedback you can give me in the process would be helpful! I'll start shortly, and I'll do it slowly so that I can give other parties time to assist me with the edits.</p>
<p>I figured you should know as your a major contributor to that article and obviously have a good deal of knowledge on the subject! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:10, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>remove some random blogger's link; even if it is an anti-Malkin alternative, the guy has [<i>sic</i>: should have been "hasn't"] quite earned the right to be considered a professional.

<p>A more detailed and updated policy on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> is in development; meanwhile I contend that the limited history of the blog and the anonymity of the author make it inappropriate to include this link in the list.</p>
<p>For now, I will annotate the link to save readers the trouble of following it, but I think it should be removed.</p>

<p>Greetings. I don't know the image's source. However, knowing the source is not necessary for making a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> claim; it's only required for a claim of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_dealing.html" title="Fair dealing">fair dealing</a>.</p>
<p>The most important part of image tagging is delineating between free images (GFDL, PD, etc) and fair use images.

After reading my user page, you may notice that I have a very strong "deletionist" policy towards Star Trek (and Star Wars, And Power Rangers, etc) articles.

<p>Good work creating new articles. When you create things, it helps tremendously to assign them to an accurate category (see <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a> for info). If you're <i>really</i> not sure about categories, at least assign your new articles a stub category (see <a href="../../../s/c/_/WP%7ESC_5cc9.html" title="WP:SC">WP:SC</a> for info). By assigning a category, you help make sure your new articles don't get lost as 'orphans' that are not associated with related topics. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if I offended. I check the last few articles the user created, if most are lacking categories, I give them the tag. I don't like seeing good articles floating around w/out categories, b/c that greatly lessens their usefulness. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a></dd>

<p>The constraint of OS-X not supporting multiple remote graphical logins simultaneously is due to the following two facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple does not possess a descent remote-desktop protocol. It only uses VNC, which really sucks (since it is only a framefuffer protocol). Microsoft, on the other hand, has licenced <a href="../../../i/c/a/ICA_7e0a.html" title="ICA">ICA</a> from Citrix, which is a lot better.</li>
<li>Quartz requires hardware accelerated rendring using a graphics card. Multiple simultaneously graphical logins would require the graphics card to multitask when rendering the screen of all users. Todays graphics cards does not support this (as far as I know).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't have any references on this topic.</p>

<p><br />
I agree that the claim of Quartz <i>not supporting mulit-user</i> should have been backed up by a reference. But the facts that Apple OS-X...</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not have a remote desktop protocol with performance comparable to its main competitor (Windows)</li>
<li>Does not support multiple (remote) simultaneously graphical logins, like Windows Server (over ICA/RDP) and UNIX/Linux (over VNC) supports.</li>
</ul>
<p>still remains, whatever the reasons may be; and should be adressed by the article, since they are serious drawbacks compared to its competitors. What about rephrasing the argumentation a bit?</p>
<p>Regarding your <i>local rendering</i> argument: The idea of remote-desktop protocols is to render the graphics remotely, sending (almost) only screendumps over the network to the local machine. This yields significant better graphical performance (especially over low-bandwidth connections) compared to X-11, which renders locally.</p>

<p><br />
<i>"Does not have a remote desktop protocol with performance comparable to its main competitor (Windows)."</i> Mac OS X has <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Remote_Desktop_faf4.html" title="Apple Remote Desktop">ARD</a> which allows remote login similar to <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_Desktop_Protocol_dea3.html" title="Remote Desktop Protocol">RDP</a> on <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a>. Note that RDP on WinXP only allows one login at a time, basically equivalent to Mac OS X.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is ARD in OS-X that I'm critizising. It is based on VNC, which has higher latencity (and poorer performance in general) compared to RDP/ICA. It also lacks support for audio redirection, remote disk drive mapping, clipboard sharing and printer mapping. Isn't this worse compared to windows?</dd>
<dd>Further, I wery much dislike your tone and politeness on this issue. I've tried to behave in a professional way, focusing on balancing the coverage of Apple operating-systems on wikipedia. If you look at the MS windows articles, you'll discover that they contain large portions of critique.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>"Does not support multiple (remote) simultaneously graphical logins, like Windows Server (over ICA/RDP) and UNIX/Linux (over VNC) supports."</i> Do you think it is right to compare Windows Server to Mac OS X? Perhaps you should add this criticism to the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_Server_f77d.html" title="Mac OS X Server">Mac OS X Server</a> page. Also are you aware that the most recent version of ARD uses the VNC protocol? It is the <a href="../../../x/_/w/X_Window_System_d6dd.html" title="X Window System">X Window System</a> that allows UNIX/Linux systems to offer multiple remote graphical logins.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, point taken. I'll move the criticism into the Mac OS X Server article. It is true that X of course offers multiple remote logins, but X wastes so much bandwidth so almost all UNIX users use VNC instead for remote logins.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another correction. You said <i>"The idea of remote-desktop protocols is to render the graphics remotely, sending (almost) only screendumps over the network to the local machine."</i> The reason that Citrix ICA protocol works so well, is it does not send screen-dumps like VNC, it sends basic instructions like "draw a button of width x,y at point x,y" and the local machine does the rendering. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 22:26, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are correct in that ICA works on a higher level of abstraction (and is thus smarter) compared to VNC, but it still requires the graphics to be converted into an <i>almost rendered</i> form (which is highly compressed) before transmitting the instructions to the client. A full local rendering would require ~100Mbps connection to acheive good interactive response (just look at the X-protocol in UNIX). Another problem facing the 3D-interface found in OS-X is that neither of the remote desktop protocols have any native 3D supports. The rendering must therefore be done remotely on the server first, presumably on the graphics card.</dd>

<p><br />
Tell me something. Honestly. Have you ever used Mac OS X? I'm getting the impression that you just want to criticise Mac OS X without actually having experienced any real problems.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've absolutely used OS-X! My institute owns a Xserve with Mac OS-X Server, which I like wery much to use. The main drawback, however, is that only one person can log into it graphically at one time. This limitation does not excist on Windows Server, Solaris or Linux. Don't you think this is a fact worth mentioning in a article regarding OS-X Server?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You say "It is ARD in OS-X that I'm critizising." Your criticism on Mac OS X did not mention ARD, you were criticising Quartz.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How can a comment on OS-X "does not have a remote desktop protocol with performance comparable to its main competitor" relate to anything other than ARD?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You say "X wastes so much bandwidth". That sounds like a criticism pulled right out of a Slashdot comment. Do you have any experience or better yet a credible source (NOT a Slashdot commet) to back that up. You say "A full local rendering would require ~100Mbps connection to acheive good interactive response (just look at the X-protocol in UNIX)." You are saying that the X-protocol requires ~100Mbps connection? Again that sounds like something out of a Slashdot comment, rather than someone talking from experience. The X-protocol works quite happily with much less.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My colleague had to upgrade his network connection from 100Mbps to 1Gbps to be able to remotely stream DVD-playback over X-11 (he did not want to have his computer on his office due to noise). By comparison he found out that VNC were abe to stream DVD over "only" 100Mbps. This is of cause an extreme example, but it highlights the difference between uncompressed X-11 traffic and the compressed VNC framebuffer protocol.</dd>

<p>I saw that on <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_Evil_ddb6.html" title="Axis of Evil">Axis of Evil</a> you changed the format of the multiparagraph quotation from Bush. As I read the Manual of Style, the previous format was correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer quotations may be better rendered in an indented style by starting the first line with a colon. Indented quotations do not need to be marked by quotation marks. In a quotation of multiple paragraphs not using indented style, double quotation marks belong at the beginning of each paragraph, but only at the end of the last paragraph.<br />
<br />
Use quotation marks or indentations to distinguish quotations from other text. There is normally no need to put quotations in italics unless the material would otherwise call for italics (emphasis, use of non-English words, etc.). (from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Quotation_marks" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation marks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was some discussion on the talk page about how to indent. Most people use the colon but there are some reasons to prefer the &lt;blockquote&gt; tag that I've used here on your talk page. Putting that difference aside, though, it seems to me that this quotation should go back to its previous format. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 19:53, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I've made the change. In general, I think we should try to make the quote "stand out" only in the sense of making it clear what is and is not quoted.

<p>I've decided that trying to go for a compromise isn't going to work, so have taken the pages off my watchlist. I agree with your reasoning that the weapons counts aren't sound.

<p>Sorry to take so long to reply... have been flat out with work and replying during my lunch break. Thanks for the encouragement! I've been meaning to tell you, if I ever get a chance I was thinking of setting up a Wikiproject that just dealt with Microsoft issues.

<p>Alistair, stay away from me. I have never seen you involved in Stargate related pages, and now less then a week after I've be involved in them you show up removing my work.

<p>Hi - I made a list of users who've been around long enough to have made lots of edits but aren't admins. If you're at all interested in becoming an admin, can you please add an '*' immediately before your name in <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_WP600_not_admins_50e3.html" title="User:Rick Block/WP600 not admins">this list</a>? I've suggested folks nominating someone might want to puruse this list. Thanks. --</p>

<dd>Speaking of which...I was rather surprised to see this here. I thought, er, yeah, the old cliche, I thought you were an admin.&#160;:) I run into your great edits all over the place. We seem to have all the same basic nerd-interests.&#160;;-) You have been here since 6 March, 2004, and have garnered over 10,000 edits. Are you interested in adminship? <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 7 July 2005 04:40 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is acceptable to cut and paste to do a merge when the page you are moving the text to already exists. This problem existed because the wrong redirect was set up in the first place. Your reasons for reverting this do not address the issue of where the the material on "Edward Irving Wortis" really belong, which is on that page since that is his name. With your changes, other valid uses of Avi will now need to select another link to find what they are looking for. I really think that my changes are correct and will be clearly more so in the future as the other Avi entries are added. So I'll ask that you revert your changes. We don't want to get into a revert war and it's usually better in the long run to have the DAB as the name page and not the article unless what is there is clearly the significant use and in this case it is not in my opinion. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 00:52, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I forgot to add that in a cleanup that I did, the most frequent reference to the <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi.html" title="Avi">Avi</a> article was for the video format and not for Wortis. So, by reverting the changes, it is likely that you are directing most people who enter <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi.html" title="Avi">avi</a> to a page they are not expecting. So your assumtion about what is linked there as justification is based on a cleanup that was done and not on what editors have actually put into the articles. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:42, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I did a merge and not a move. The redirect prevented the move. It is acceptable to do a merge as long as you comment that you did this in the description on the changes. I did that. The edit history is still retained at the old article to meet the GFDU requirements. If you are concerned about the history, you can request that an admin merge the history to the new page. How articles are named here should be based on the standards for this Wiki and not based on how many results you get from some other web site. If the article should called Avi, then it probably should be moved to Avi (author) which would be better then were it is now, but I still believe that is the wrong place. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:54, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your question about pointing to the edits for the avi redirects. They were done a while ago. Don't know if they were done on my current signin or as an anon user. I have too many edits to search through them to try and find this info. Sorry. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:57, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You said <i>The article itself says the author is "better known" by his pen name. All the links that currently point at the article, are all referencing the author, no-one else. The article should be named based on the standard of what do people think the thing/person/object is called</i>. What the author is better know as does not mean that it has rights to an article name. That is determined by what is the most common useage for that name. The fact that links were cleaned up over time is not a reason that can be used to justify keeping something at that place. If you look at <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_rename_%28move%29_a_page_3490.html#Page_histories" title="Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page">Wikipedia:How_to_rename_(move)_a_page#Page_histories</a> it explains a little about page histories again pointing out that what I did was not the best way but the only way without deleting the proper name and its redirect. So again, I'll make the point that this article is not correctly named and that more users will get there in error then do lokoing for the content of that artice and that is in fact why the changes I made should be reverted. The fact that this person is commonly know as Avi is not the issue. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 28 June 2005 05:20 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm sorry - miscommunication. I happened to be editing two VfD pages at the same time you were, thereby bringing up the "Edit Conflict" page. Someone else(I have no idea why), claimed that there was some kind of editorial conflict over Star Trek pages, on one of the VfDs. These things are unrelated. Sorry about the confusion...
