<p>Why would I lie? The logo with the white background is just as fake as the new one I put up. I'm not sure why you think it was official, but they were <b>Both</b> created by me, I assure you. if we can find a better way of contacting each other, I can prove it. it just really annoys me that someone would 1, use my logo without my permission or even acknowledging that I made it, and 2, to try and tell me that the new one is somehow less valid. I created this mock up logo for a pixar blog site just for kicks in a hurry, that's why it was so plain. my slightly revised version is nicer to look at. if your going to remove my new one, then you should also remove the old one. you cant (or at least shouldn't be able to) have it both ways. --Gmcube 00:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd quite obviously rather you didn't restore all that fictional biography to the article. I'm still trying to work my way around where all this info fits in and trying to get the article to the highest standard. Obviously we differ, but I really don't feel the discussions on the character's powers and fictional biography are of the utmost importance and can be discussed in a side issue. I hope you will reconsider your decision. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>and you can't have four main article links for a summary section. The article is now hugely bloated again. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And you're not even filling in edit summaries, that's a breach of the GFDL, you've got to note this stuff in the edit summaries when you move it, showing where it cam from to keep the history intact. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd much rather you replied here to keep the dialogue together. I'm making a strong appeal here, to please not put that stuff back in. I don't edit war but I am very close to doing so here. I feel very strongly about this. I posted my intentions many times to the FARC and not once was the plan challenged. I appreciate that you differ, but you haven't allowed any time for the article to stand, and you haven't sought to discuss the issue at all. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:24, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't get what you mean by recycling and I was quite clear when I said at the FARC that I would "hive off the character and cast sections to a separate article". I haven't even written the article yet and you're reverting me. I just feel that's, well...I can't put it into words. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that was the publication history stuff. That was before that comment. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:48, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And that stuff needs merging together and cleaning up. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eh? There is no popular culture section now? That said, the fictional biography doesn't comply with <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>. We've got to remember this article is about Superman as an icon, not Superman as a comic book character, and reflect that across this article. The sub-articles should be the places for the comic book depictions, which again need to be rewritten in keeping with <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. A lot of this stuff is only primary sourced and needs to be written from an out of universe perspective. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think we have to consider that Wikipedia is written for a general audience and that people are going to be coming here for different reasons. I'd also say the comics are quite heavily emphasised in the first half of the article. I'd say if anything was under represented it's the creators who have worked on the character, not the fictional biography. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><small><b>&lt;indent restarted&gt;</b></small>Um, unbroad? Don't follow what this means. We do have to be comprehensive though. I'd note also that the lack of cites was only your initial problem with the article, not the only problem full stop. No WikiProject claims precedent or ownership, I'm afraid, and all I'm interested in is presenting the information on the topic as comprehensively as possible. Superman means more than just comics. But I'm more interested in moving forwards. The article as it is now isn't too bad, some original research needs pulling in the powers and fictional bio sections, and we need to work out if the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Superman_f77f.html" title="History of Superman">History of Superman</a> article is discussing the character or the publication history. I feel it is doing the latter, and if that is the case then I suggest we merge that and the newer Superman cast and characters, and trim the character and cast section in the main article down to a summary of the cast and enemies. Once we get that done I would hope we'd be near enough there. There's some updating needs doing to the copyrights section, which I have but need to find time to do, and then the lead needs rewriting. Appreciate your thoughts. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 22:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You indicate you are going to support the FA status being removed. That doesn't solve the problem we have, which is an impasse on how to take the article forward. That impasse remains regardless of the FA status, I would hope you agree. I know what the comics guidelines say, I wrote them. However, they need revision, since people seem to believe they are hard stricture. They were never intended to be that, and seem to cause more problems than they solve. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Look, this is all sidelining the main issue. How do you see the article and it's sub articles being organised? I think I'll just start banging it all together and then maybe you'll see what I'm trying to do and we can take it from there. Personally I don't see a whole lot wrong with the article as it is now, and I can't see why you'd lose the FA status for the sake of your own opinion, but that's your call. I'd rather just find some common ground. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:32, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Since we have a road block there, what's your thinking on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Superman_f77f.html" title="History of Superman">History of Superman</a>. Is that a fictional biography or is it a publication history? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, so we need to find a compromise on the personality and supporting cast, that's cool. I'm reworking one section to be the Comic book character, and I will happily reinstate a supporting cast section. What specific bits that aren't in the article would you like to see back? And where would you put Clark Kent? Is he a supporting character or part of Superman? I can make arguments for both, so appreciate your opinion. Hopefully we could get this sorted by next week. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>See, what I'm thinking is that there needs to be a Superman in comic books article where a lot of this stuff can be explored in real detail. The personality section contains an awful lot of original research as it stands, to be honest. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've restored a fair bit on the supporting cast. I'll sort out the mess that is now <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_character_and_cast.html" title="Superman character and cast">Superman character and cast</a>, and start sourcing the bio, powers and cast sections. I'll try and squeeze some personality back in too. I think then all that is left to do is update the copyright section, I've got a few Comics Journal articles to use for that. What do you think? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd say the cite news template, as frequent magazines like <i>Time</i> qualify as news. I think you can directly cite information from the article, as <i>Time</i> is a fine reliable source. I don't think it's a concern to cite the information indirectly -- if you get the book later, just cite the book for whatever extra information you add.

<dd><i>Transformers</i> is definitely well-referenced, and I should bump it up in my link repository. (The repository isn't really up to date; I've done some things with it, but I haven't finished moving stuff around.) One thing I'd suggest doing for the article is to go through all the references and apply brackets to the date= attributes in the Cite news template. I see quite a few of them show up as 2006-08-27 instead of how it looks on <i>SM3</i> or <i>TDK</i>.

<p>I suggest placing a link on the talk page to the script review because we're not sure where the studio is going to go with the film yet. The citation indicated that the spec script was purchased for legal reasons, so the story may not even be used. Until there is indication that they will use the spec script for production, I think it would be irrelevant in the meantime. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 20:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We may need to check that better. It's in a forum, and even if it's on an official website, it's still a forum.

<p>What do you think of reducing the list of characters in the Infobox Film template for POTC3? The length of the template is, at least on my screen, screwing up the way the image in the Cast and character section is displayed. The film isn't an ensemble film, and most characters (with exceptions, like Barbossa) are not central to the film. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 16:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I just skimmed over the page and think it is generally good, especially enforcing WP:WAF and avoiding in-universe fan cruft. Also, it flows well and it solidly and eye-pleasingly sourced. However, it still has some room for improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Main point: throughout the article, you have to juggle with multiple concurrent story arcs in different media. Especially in the 2nd half, it is a challenge for non-experts to understand what is main canon at what place, and what is alternative history. I understand that with several concurrent comic book and TV series, it is very difficult, but it reads a bit clunkily atm.</li>
<li>A section with a sort of fictional timeline of the main canon, hung behind the real-life event section, and making clear what continuity belongs where, would be nice.</li>
<li>The article deteriorates at the end. "Variants" is totally unsourced, and the last sections (2001, Heroes 2007) appear short and stubby. In general, paragraphs (and especially sections) with just 2-3 sentences are not that good; merge some to achieve 4-5 sentences. I personally favour the decades approach (1980s, 1990s, 2000s), and would write subsections within these decades, but it is a matter of taste.</li>
<li>IMHO a "film" section would not be a bad idea, too, bringing in the 1984 and 2007 films. Films are always something remarkable, regardlessly whether in written fiction (e.g. Harry Potter), comics (e.g. X-Men) or TV series (Transformers). There are always enough bigger and smaller differences in interpretation and contuinuity.</li>
<li>There are interviews in the footnotes, can you directly quote some? Expository text is good, but some spoken words of the creators would make the article more lively IMHO.</li>
<li>The mid-section (1984) could use a pic, as it is the largest section.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, my many nitpickings aside, this article looks pretty good, it just needs some spit and polish. —<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnomatopoeia_fd00.html" title="User:Onomatopoeia">Onomatopoeia</a> 16:16, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>@No canon: my bad, but now you really know that it needs some words for non experts&#160;:D Well, a way would be to liberally use the words "multiverse", "different continuity" or "parallel universe" in the main lead and also in the section leads, With so many different series and continuities, I think this would improve the article. A more radical solution would to firmly enforce a <b>historical</b> timeline (1984-2007), which every series slotted in by real-life occurence rather by continuity. But I don't know enough of the series to make a definite statement. BTW, a <i>brief</i> introduction of some of the main protagonists and antagonists who appear in virtually every world (e.g. Optimus Prime, Galvatron / Megatron, Rodimus) stating their main powers, character traits, creators etc. would not be bad, to make it easier for non-experts. Hope I could help! —<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnomatopoeia_fd00.html" title="User:Onomatopoeia">Onomatopoeia</a> 09:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sure, I'll re-visit the first film's article later this afternoon and see if there's anything further I can suggest in the peer review. Also, it's likely that <i>JPIV</i> may need to be deleted; when I find the time, I'll clean up the article and review the citations to see how concrete production news is. If it isn't, we could probably move for deletion. I was wondering, though, what made you vote to keep <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28film%29.html" title="Magneto (film)">Magneto</a></i> when I made a motion for merging into <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28comics%29.html" title="Magneto (comics)">Magneto (comics)</a>?

<p>"Response" sounds better. "Defiance" was probably a bit borderline POV. Have you read the graphic novel?

<dd>Well, ideally, editors should be familiar with each other to work together better.&#160;:) <i>Watchmen</i> is definitely a brilliant comic... but I have no idea how Snyder's going to pull it off. When you finish reading it, look for some guides online that can refer you back to easter eggs in specific frames. It really makes you appreciate the work. I've heard it called the Citizen Kane of comics. As for the film, I don't know if a 9/11 context would have applied as fittingly for it. The Cold War background is what shapes the global conflict in the story, and today's conflicts are a bit too muddled to define a clear divide in international opponents. That's my opinion, anyway.&#160;;) Enjoy the read! —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 22:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being deaf, I can still watch films that are equipped with English subtitles or closed captioning. However, DVD featurettes and commentaries are not generally captioned or subtitles. For example, <i>Spider-Man</i> has some featurettes like a HBO "Making Of" episode, but there is no captioning or subtitles on it. Kind of disappointing. I've found some exceptions, but they seem to be far and few in between. A couple that come to mind is <i>Road to Perdition</i> and the <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> prequel. I haven't checked so often, so there might have been some captioned featurettes/commentaries that I've missed. I just got <i>Crank</i> from Netflix, so I'll try to see if there's anything in that regard. I have an idea kicking around in my head regarding keeping track of these things (off Wikipedia, of course), so I'll have to get around to that. I'll also see <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i> tonight -- Spanish with English subtitles, so it should be a real treat. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 22:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that was an odd situation. The admin Niskid64 said that he misread something and erred in protecting the page. Glad I was able to get the protectio nrescinded. I'll do my best to keep my eye on the film article come release time. You could ask Bignole to do the same, too. When does <i>Transformers</i> come out in the UK? Also, I'm taking a look at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformers_%28fiction%29.html" title="Transformers (fiction)">Transformers (fiction)</a>, and I think there could be more images used (under fair use rationale, of course), provide basic depictions of what Transformers are. I don't suggest images for each section, but probably the G1/G2 and Beast Era sections could use more upfront images for a "newbie" reading this. I also see some uncited passages, but I'm sure you're aware of them and will address them in time. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 18:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know if pictures of the Transformers toys will be helpful. The picture at the beginning would not be so bad, but it's awfully crowded and doesn't immediately define Transformers at first glance -- at least, not to me. Additionally, the article seems like a crossroads for the different Transformers universes, so as long as the information is copied and expanded upon in the respective universe's article, I think the information is fine. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 18:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, You reverted a relocation of material out of the lede of the Spielberg article. By analogy with the newspaper or magazine lede, I imagine that it should give the "who, what, where, when, why and how" of the subject. If the most reputable, serious film magazine gave him the title, it still arguably shouldn't be in the lede. However, Premiere magazine is a popular film magazine, not a serious film magazine. Its editor, Peter Herbst, also edits <i>Car and Driver, Road &amp; Track, Cycle World, Road &amp; Track Road Gear, Road &amp; Track Speed</i> and <i>Sound &amp; Vision.</i> This is not a 2007 version of Cahiers du cinema. //////Re: POV claim...there is no problem with Editors having POV. We all have a POV. The problem is if the article has POV in the text. I argue that putting such a laudatory, fluffy "title" in the lede is not balanced and neutral.Nazamo 17:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for your response. I argue that sources can be placed on a scale according to how reputable they are. Premiere Magazine's own website states that the mission of the magazine is " THE STYLE, SPIRIT AND SOUL OF HOLLYWOOD....Movies are today's defining form of entertainment. Premiere provides unparalleled access to this influential medium and to Hollywood's A-list." <a href="http://www.hfmus.com/HachetteUSA/Page.asp?Site=Premiere&amp;Page=Mission" class="external free" title="http://www.hfmus.com/HachetteUSA/Page.asp?Site=Premiere&amp;Page=Mission" rel="nofollow">http://www.hfmus.com/HachetteUSA/Page.asp?Site=Premiere&amp;Page=Mission</a> . As I mentioned, the editor also edits Car and Driver, Road and Track. An example of a serious film magazine might be <i>Cineaste</i>, which is independently operated with no financial ties to any film studios. Editor Richard Porton has a Ph.D. in Cinema Sudies from New York University. Editor Cynthia Lucia is an assistant professor of English at Rider University, who has written books and essays (e.g., for Cambridge Scholars Press)Nazamo 18:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Wiki-newbie. I noticed you put the unreferenced template back on the James Bond article. I agree that the article needs more references, but it is quite simply untrue that it is unreferenced. There are already too many articles tagged as unreferenced: tagging articles with 10+ references as unref'd because their subject is important and woul warrant more refs is only going to add confusion; it is not going to help. If you feel the article needs more sources, please add some, but don't add a tag that is clearly not fitting. I won't remove the tag, but I'm asking you to consider removing it. Thank you. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phil</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhils_0f89.html" title="User talk:Phils">s</a></span> 00:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Precisely: I think it will not attract more attention to the article; the article will be hopelessly lost in the of. The tag quite simply does not belong on the article because it is <i>not</i> an unsourced article. If you want to help, locate specific dubious or unsourced statements, and add the appriopriate tag to the appropriate section, or mention it on the article's talk page. <i>Too few references</i> (according to you) is not the same as <i>no references</i>. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phil</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhils_0f89.html" title="User talk:Phils">s</a></span> 01:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just noticed that some one (User:Wizardman) nominated <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbas_Kiarostami_1c17.html" title="Abbas Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_candidates" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_candidates" rel="nofollow">GA assessment</a> several days ago. I don't know this user and he/she was not involved in writing the article. No one has assessed the article yet. Would that be possible for you to assess it or ask someone else to evaluate it? The article is now under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Abbas_Kiarostami" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Abbas_Kiarostami" rel="nofollow">peer review</a> and I would like to make the article FA soon (hopefully!). Thanks. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 18:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. An IP address is responsible for removing the references in the awards section. I've reinstated them again (I noticed your exasperated edit summary from the last time). The IP is wishing to rely solely upon the IMDb ref for the entire section. Some people don't hold references to the IMDb in high esteem. Your references to the BBC are much more reliable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 21:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's cool; just thought I'd ask. I've asked Bignole as well, though I'm not sure about a real-life friend that would be willing to meet my wiki-needs, haha.

<p>Can you check the film article and tell me if the image of Tyler and the narrator in the second paragraph of the Synopsis section shows up without a problem? For some reason, my browser's not presenting it, and just the caption instead. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 18:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm thinking about removing the in-universe paragraphs at the beginning of each Design subsection, as it's extraneous and not really production information. I don't see it holding up in a FA nomination. The in-universe information can be mentioned at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsuit.html" title="Batsuit">Batsuit</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> articles.

<p>lol! I think we're stepping on each other as we edit the talk page for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prestige_%28film%29_f547.html" title="The Prestige (film)">The Prestige</a>! I'm going to wait a few days to see what happens next (haha). I'm really uncertain as to what the format is right now or what you think it should be. When I started it I wanted "Suggestions regarding . . ." to be a subsection of, or at least a continuation of, the "Differences to novel . . ." section. They are all on the same issue and I don't want the discussion to become disjointed (I'd really like the whole thing to go away, actually).</p>

<p>It's forever since I've seen the film, but I'll try and read through it in a little bit and see what I think could be cut out of it. I think we can do some major trimming from it's 2200 words.

<dd>Sorry. I have an exam tomorrow so I was going to trim it down while I was at work today. I did remove an image, 4 images are a bit much for a plot summary, even 3 are...but we definitely don't need 2 images of the ship sinking. I chose the one that best illustrates what is happening to the ship. I also rearranged the images in the plot so they weren't so close together. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 17:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
