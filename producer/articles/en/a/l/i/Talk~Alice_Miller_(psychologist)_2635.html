<p>I eliminated the second referent at the very end of the article since the “Natural Child Project” website, which I love by the way, is already mentioned in the “External Links” section. For writing style purposes, in a short article it is more elegant to have only one referent about the Stettbacher issue than two. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 19:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have essentially moved both links to the "external links" section, because that's what it's for; also, I think it's useful to have a separate links for the "Note ..." text because it saves people having to look it up separately via Google (although, personally, I don't find it that informative). <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaikel_c22c.html" title="User:Maikel">Maikel</a> 20:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for adding summarises of some of her books but this doeas not remove the need for a Bibliography which provides a full list with details of publisher, ISBN etc . <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 08:39, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK: I agree with your idea of keeping the list of all of Miller’s published books. However, the ISBN numbers look a bit awkward to me. If you click on those numbers and try to find a Miller’s bestseller in non Western countries there appears the message “No matches found”. Is it important to keep the ISBN numbers? It is very easy for any person in the world to purchase any of Miller’s books through Amazon. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 18:52, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please take a look at any Further reading or Bibliography section in Wikipedia and you will see that it normal practise to quote ISBN. The link then gives the reader the choice of finding the book in a large number of libraries as well as a choice of on line booksellers. Wikipedia needs to practise good citations in order to support its credibility. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 10:09, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was under the impression that top level links to other people with the same name, like that added here, should only be added if there is an article for that other person.

<dd>I guess my point is that if she isn't notable enough to have her own article, neither is she notable enough to require a notice at the top of another person of the same name's article.

Maybe one can say that according to Alice Miller the story of Paradise in the Bible is the origin of human misery (perhaps it is). Since there is no mother in that story it is the fathergod to be blamed.c The hope for improvement -according to Alice Miller- is to be found in the <i>parents</i> of Jesus, Maria and Joseph.

<dd>Hi again, Austerlitz, and thanks for the info in my subpage about Miller’s July 2006 recommendation in her web site of Donald Capps’ psychological study of the historical Jesus (which contrasts greatly with the mythical Christ of dogma). Since I know Capps’ views I see that Miller may have had second thoughts about the naive paragraphs about Jesus she wrote in <i>The Truth Will Set You Free</i>. Therefore, if you don’t mind I will remove the link to the now obsolete 2000 essay <i>“Mary and Joseph - Parents to emulate”</i>. That link does not come from Miller’s site. If you want to leave it there, let me know before midnight. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 16:34, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ciao Cesar, I don't understand why you think the 2000 essay to be obsolete, only because you think to <i>know Capps' views</i> not having read his book about Jesus. As you know many writers cherish selfcontradictory opinions in one and the same book and in different books erst recht. But -since the essay is to be found on the site <a href="http://www.naturalchild.org/alice_miller/" class="external free" title="http://www.naturalchild.org/alice_miller/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalchild.org/alice_miller/</a> , and other essays, too- you can remove the additional link on the mainpage.

<dd>Jan Hunt, not Miller, is the webmaster of Natural Child.org. In Capps’ <i>The Child’s Song: The Religious Abuse of Children</i> there is a 30-page chapter, “The Child Jesus as Endangered Self” that I read two years ago. Capps’ book about Jesus is an expansion of that chapter. I would like to know if Miller still clings to her views that appear in <i>The Truth Will Set You Free</i> (actually <i>Eve’s Awakening</i>: the original European title for the book). Anyway, I may restore tonight the critical link to Daniel Mackler’s essay (see below). This means that there will be a link about the controversy of Miller’s 2000 views of Mary and Joseph. Is that OK with you? —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 18:49, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You want to say that according to Capps Jesus has not been perfect? And that Alice Miller in <i>The Truth Will Set You Free</i> claims that Jesus had been perfectly free or any other perfection? I remember that Alice Miller in one of her books cited a saying of Jesus from the Bible talking about people having abused children (that's what I remember), and he said that they should be drowned with a big and heavy stone around their neck (I couldn't find the English word for that stone). And -according to my awareness- Alice Milleer liked this saying and that's why she trusted Jesus , he was against child molesters and perpetrators jugding this to be a crime worth death penalty.</dd>
<dd>The link to Daniel Mackler's essay, don't put it on the mainpage, please. that's my feeling. Just leave it here. That's my suggestion. It has to be talked about. Austerlitz 88.72.1.68 21:14, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK Austerlitz: I have removed the link of the small article on Mary and Joseph but won’t reinsert the Mackler link tonight. However, if no objections I may reinsert it next Sunday. By the way, the <a href="http://iraresoul.com" class="external free" title="http://iraresoul.com" rel="nofollow">http://iraresoul.com</a> site where the Mackler essay on Miller appears is the same forum where we can discuss Miller issues (such as the historical Jesus controversy). —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 22:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK Cesar: Daniel Mackler's essay is not perfect, most probably he is a therapist/patient, too. But there are many quite valid points in it, I think. That's why I (re)insert the link on the mainpage not waiting for Sunday. Austerlitz 88.72.1.119 11:34, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The link to <i>"An Analysis of the Limits of Alice Miller – biographical criticism by Daniel Mackler"</i> was reverted. The editor who reverted it indicated in edit summary “Rv link spam”.</p>
<p>While it’s true that Mackler’s piece hasn’t been published, I doubt it is spam. Actually, I have read it and can state it’s the result of serious scholarship.</p>
<p>One of the problems with Alice Miller’s critics is that, while she has been much criticized in psychoanalytic circles, it’s extremely rare to find such criticism published in scholarly journals or serious books. The only book by a respected writer I know who has criticized Miller is <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Rosenbaum_5af0.html" title="Ron Rosenbaum">Ron Rosenbaum</a>’s <i>Explaining Hitler</i>. And even there the criticism is meager: Rosenbaum used only a single page to dismiss Miller’s analysis of Hitler.</p>
<p>Since the Wikipedia article contains virtually no criticism of Miller, for NPOV purposes I believe Mackler’s paper deserves a link in this article. If no objection, I will restore the link tonight. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:24, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am glad that Kingbotk posted a “Blp” tag at the top of this talk page. However, though critical, the external link I want to reinsert tonight is respectful to Miller. I quote from the first page:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Alice Miller has influenced my thinking more than any other writer in the psychology field. She opened my eyes to the struggle of the child in the repressive family, she introduced me to the idea that an abused child will compulsively need to replicate his repressed traumas until he is able to resolve them, and she banished from my mind the idea of inherent evil in the child – or the adult. She taught me the ludicrousness of Freud’s drive theory (specifically his Oedipus complex) and she brought home the concept of the true self like no one else. Alice Miller is a genius, her writings are a step beyond the ferocity of anyone else I have read, and for this I owe her an immeasurable debt of gratitude. Yet I have come to see her limits, and see them clearly – and realize their terrible danger for anyone wishing to understand the truest depths of the child’s dilemma in the partially unenlightened family. So it is within the backdrop of great respect for her gifts that I write this paper. I write it to give all others who come along a new platform to stand on – one more solid and evolved than that which Alice Miller has provided.<a href="http://iraresoul.com/alicemiller.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://iraresoul.com/alicemiller.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
