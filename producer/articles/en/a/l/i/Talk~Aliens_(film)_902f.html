<p>This article states; "<cite>In real life Al Matthews, who plays Sergeant Apone, was the first black marine to be promoted to the rank of gunnery sergeant while serving in the Vietnam War.</cite>"</p>
<p>However, on the page for <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Matthews_42f8.html" title="Al Matthews">Al_Matthews</a>, it says;</p>
<p>"<cite>In real life, Matthews was a member of the United States Marine Corps. According to IMDb, he was first black Marine ever promoted to the rank of gunnery sergeant while serving in the Vietnam War, however, this is false.</cite>"</p>
<p>Which is true?</p>
<p>217.119.224.154 08:57, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, technically, Al Matthews was promoted to Sergeant, not Gunnery Sergeant. Sergeant is an E-5, Gunny is an E-7. I'll update the record and contact IMDB. From Al Matthews website:</p>

<p>I think the section under the title 'Analysis' needs some work. The Vietnam allegory is fine, as is the bit about Ripley's daughter, but that could be expanded to further explore the theme of motherhood in the movie, including the Alien Queen. However the third piece, Weaver's real-life stance on guns has no bearing on the movie in itself and would be better suited for a trivia entry.</p>
<p>I agree, Weavers stance on guns belongs in trivia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Vietnam stuff was mentioned by Cameron in the DVD commentary. I also agree with what both of you have said about Weaver's opinion. I'd like to suggest that "analysis" isn't a very good name for this section. It makes it sound too much like personal research, or a personal review. Would renaming it "themes" be a good idea? Remove the gun control bit and leave it the "Vietnam" and "motherhood" parts? Mount Molehill 06:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's my understanding that poontang is a word for sex, particularly between soldiers and natives, and that it came into heavy use during the Vietnam War. Cameron and others have commented on the movie's similarity to "Vietnam in space"--a technologically superior force decimated by a low-tech enemy and so forth. So wouldn't it be better to assume that when the marines in Aliens say "poontang," they mean what we think they mean, and not some "new" definition like eating indigenous species or something? Teflon Don 18:15, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Poontang is female genitalia. Check the urban dictionary.</p>
<p><br />
Female genitalia is always how I have heard it used (I don't think Ted Nugent was talking about extra-solar culinary practices on "Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"). And if you are familiar with the actual exchange in the movie, there is very little uncertainty about what is meant:</p>
<p>Frost: Hey, I sure wouldn't mind getting me some more of that Arcturian poontang! Remember that time? Spunkmeyer: Yeah Frost, except the one you had was MALE. Frost: It doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!</p>
<p>[taken from the first draft of the ‘Aliens’ script dated May 28, 1985]</p>
<p>The exchange does seem to support the hypothesis of the paragraph.</p>
<p>The film also continues a suggestion in the film [is "previous film" meant here? After reading the article for 'Alien', which states the film's "gender politics have been subject of much examination", I conclude that that is what is meant, though no supporting evidence for the claim is included in the 'Alien' article] that in the future sexual orientation and gender identity would be non-issues.</p>
<p>The onscreen biographical reports on the missing crewmembers from the first film all include information on whether or not they have had a sex change operation. [I can't verify this, but will assume it is so]</p>
<p>Later on while the marines are eating in the mess hall, two of the marines joke about having sex with an alien being that might have been transgender [if you read the entire exchange it sounds more like some form of hermaphrodite where both genders have a vagina], although the joke is obscure, referring to "had some Arcturean Poontang". It may reference many things, such as eating an Arcturean creature [again, not much ambiguity or obscurity about what is being referenced when you view the entire exchange].</p>
<p>Suggestion for a rewrite of the paragraph:</p>
<p>The film also continues a suggestion from the previous film that in the future sexual orientation and gender identity would be non-issues. The onscreen biographical reports on the missing crewmembers from the first film all include information on whether or not they have had a sex change operation. Later on while the marines are eating in the mess hall, two of the male marines are discussing the merits of "Arcturian poontang" when one says, "except the one you had was MALE!" and the other replies, "It doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!"</p>
<p>I'm also not sure if some of this paragraph, as well as parts of the paragraph on Vasquez (though I admit that the possibility of her being a lesbian or bisexual is more plausible considered in light of the Spanish comments translation), are more that the author is trying too hard to make a case for a theme in the movie about "sexual orientation and gender identity would be non-issues".</p>
<p>(btw, I'm not familiar with editing an article like this. Does someone have 'ownership' of it, and so should do any actual editing of the article?) MrFurry 08:00, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That whole gender/orientation section needs to be pared down and reworded (not to mention it belongs as Trivia, not Impact). There is no doubt what the "Arcturian poontang" exchange is meant to convey in the film and it actually serves to discredit the premise it supposedly supports.</p>
<p>If sexual matters were a "non-issue" why would one male be making a joke about another male mistakenly having sex with a creature of the same gender? The very idea that that exchange might be seen as about consuming an Arcturian is kind of ludicrous.</p>
<p>The film is reflecting the attitudes of the time it was made (for example consider the "illegal alien" joke directed at Vazquez. In the future we defeat all sexual issues/hangups and bias but it's still common to make jokes about ethnicity and homosexual sex with aliens? That doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>This article speaks of the portrayal of women in action movies and references Ripley, Vasquez, Farro, and Deitrich as strong female roles. However, I thought that Deitrich was a male grunt and Crowe was the fourth female (who was pulled up the wall by the first attacking alien in the scene under the atmospheric processor after speaking the line "Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all"). Anyone know for sure?</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Nope; Deitrich was the fourth female Marine, and the one who was first to be attacked. If I recall correctly, Crowe had the least screen time of any of the Marines. I don't remember if the film even depicted his fate. *EDIT* Seems my memory was slightly off: Crowe was the one who died when Frost's ammunition bag exploded.

None of the weapons have their correct names, the pulse rifle is listed as firing a 7.2mm round instead of the 10mm rounds specified in the film, and the flamethrower is described as being built out of power drill parts, when in fact the props were made using M16 receivers.</p>

<dd>Neither is Scream, but it is popularly categorised as being in a subsection of the horror genre. Aliens is 'Sci-Fi Horror', but Resurrection and AvP are more 'Sci-Fi Action'.

<dd>absolutely, there is a difference between being excellent because it's detailed and being excellent because it's just right for an encyclopaedia. this is the former - needs to be the latter! have put a suggestion on the films project talk page to the effect that 500 words is recommended as preferred length to save future editors writing more than they need.. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaining_girl_3add.html" title="User:Raining girl">raining_girl</a> 14:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that a version of the movie was released that contained the deleted scenes is not notable. There isn't a history behind the scenes. For example, Richard Donner was fired from Superman II, and Richard Lester scrapped just about every scene Donner filmed for that movie. When Donner's cut was released, 50% of the film was new to audiences, like 10% was completely new (as in just filmed) and the film itself was like a completely new film. Now, <i>Alien</i>, <i>Aliens</i>, and the rest or just films that had their deleted scenes reinserted by the directors (or in the cast of <i>Alien</i> had some scenes removed). Part of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wiki's policies about information collection</a> is that it's an encyclopedia and not just an "indiscriminate collection of information"; you have to find notability in it. These aren't new films, several of them had their releases on Laserdisc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Episode_IV_a02b.html" title="Star Wars Episode IV">Star Wars Episode IV</a> comments about the "Special Edition" versions, and only lists the really major scenes like the Han/Jabba scene that couldn't be filmed because of budget reasons. It was a major scene that set up conflict in the next installments. The addition of these scenes in these movies weren't scenes that couldn't be filmed but scenes that Directors removed for time constraints or "they just didn't like them". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 14:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

It also discusses the new CGI used throughout the film to achieve scenes they couldn't achieve with their budget. That is that makes it notable. The fact that a scene was removed because of time is not notable, that happens with ever movie. You don't list the deleted scenes for ever movie article. Notice <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaws_%28film%29.html#Releases_and_sequels" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws (film)#Releases and sequels</a>, it mentions "deleted scenes" but doesn't list them. Both of these are Featured Articles. My suggestion is following Episode IV's way of only detaiing the "special edition", ones that have a history. Ripley's daughter adds nothing to a plot, but adds to a character. If there was a reason behind the removal, other than time, a source is needed. It's about citations, and listing scenes is not notable, that's like writing a plot detail for detail. It's against Wiki policy, namely their "not an indiscriminate collection of information" part. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 15:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Scenes are cut due to time constraints in every film, yes. But they aren't always reinserted into the film, and I think that is the main difference, for example between Jaws and this.

<p>As I said, I'd look to Star Wars as a good exampled of a Featured article, where the film has had editions where scenes have been reinserted or created from scratch. You best bet is to get discussions from the film makers about why they were reinserted/removed in the first place. It needs depth. There is a "SE" section and a "DVD release" section. As "Aliens" was re-released with these additions, but added for the Quadrilogy box set. I would note the entire "Releases" section of "Star Wars" and how it isn't limited to the "Special editions" or DVD releases. This way you don't run into a shortage of topics. If you find that you can't find enough info for the "SE" or "DVD" sections, then you just don't use a subsection header, and keep it all under "Releases". I'd read through the whole "Releases" section to get a better understanding of what is acceptable for featured articles, as "Good Articles" are often just a couple notches below, and you should always strive to get to the FA status. I'll try and help out with what I can find, and I'll always be watching for cleanups or opinions about things, but I have several other film articles that I'm working on, and an entire book article that has yet to be written, so I may not be able to help as much as I'd like. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 15:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed the revert war going on regarding the plot. Sorry ShadowToa, but I have to agree with Bignole. Very little of your additions seem to add anything to the understanding of the plot. I realise it is annoying to do hard work on an article only to have it radically changed, but your edits don't follow WP guidelines on movie plot summaries.</p>
<p>It might be better to add your edits one at a time, or better yet put them here so we can debate them. Regards, <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 04:21, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I made mention of the eggs in the beginning as it was important to understanding Ripley's fears and motivations behind her aggressive reaction to there being colonists on the planet. However, the rest of my edits were just that, edits. Read the two side by side, Gorman isn't mentioned as being revived until all the way into the big attack by the aliens prior to the escape in the tunnels, but he had been conscious since just after the dropship crash. Further, the editing of Vasquez and Gorman in the tunnels, and their subsequent deaths wasn't clear at all. My further were for better flow, and to tie in the end of the plot analysis to the beginning. If you want to reduce the size of my text, that's fine, but I don't appreciate Bignole's altering the positioning of important plot elements, or the exclusion of specific points.ShadowTao 04:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You also added that Gorman was not a subordinate, which isn't relevant to the plot. You also added "<b>while Ripley and Newt use the time to take a moment's rest in a another room.</b>", which I changed to "<b>try and get some rest</b>", as <b>take some time....in another room</b> isn't necessary to the sentence. Or "<b>Ripley awakes to find two empty specimen containers, the one that had been holding two live [[facehuggers]</b>"; we don't need a detail of the scene they see--simply say there are the two live facehuggers with them. It's things like that that I changed. Again, I didn't initially revert you, as I didn't change the position of when Gorman is said to be "revived", I just removed the "subordinate" part. I didn't change positions of what you added, I removed items that were unnecessary. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 04:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's not important to the plot to understand that the platoon leader was removed from his command by his subordinate who is now making all decisions for the team? I disagree. Gorman's position in the team needs to be explained after his failure.</p>
<p>There is room for dramatic effect, especially for a movie like Aliens. You get this great review from Ebert, then a Wiki plot synopsis that reads like a technical manual. No one says a Wiki has to be dull.ShadowTao 04:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, you fail to understand that this is an encyclopedia, and what happens in a movie is not important to how the movie was made. Plot are just supposed to deal with major points, and Gorman not being in command is not a major point, especially when it isn't even address by anyone (i.e. I don't recall him ever "questioning Hick's authority"). Your opinion that Gorman was a failure falls under Original Research, as you are interpreting why he didn't become the leader when he was revived, that's a policy in Wiki too. As for "dramatic effect", Wiki is an encyclopedia not a publishing house for wannabe novelists. If you want to "spice up" text for a plot synopsis I suggest IMDb, or a personal fan website, as "spicying up text" isn't what Wikipedia is. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 04:52, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well Gorman is a very minor character so it is not so important in a plot synopsis to exactly spell out his status. Also, he is never explictly demoted in the movie, it's just that events go on without him, so why should the synopsisi explicitly said it? Lastly while we don't want to produce a dull article, if a reader wants drama, they can go watch the actual movie. Like the guideline says, the article is not a substitute for watching the movie. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 04:55, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see anything in the WP that states a wiki cannot be edited for text flow or for purposes of adding interest. You're interpreting the WP. As for my "opinion" of Gorman's failure, there is no interpretion, it's fact; watch the movie. Vasquez states quite clearly, "Man, I'm gonna kill you," to Gorman. Burke states quite clearly, "You've had your chance." And, when Gorman tries to explain himself to Ripley, he is cut off. I took all three of those events are surmised them, how's that for concise? Or, would you rather I have added that info?ShadowTao 05:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You probably need to read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, as taking scenes and trying to interpret them is clearly a violation of that. Gorman being demoted has no bearing on the movie. Also, you may want to check into <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_455d.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality">neutrality</a>, as using your "preferences" isn't keeping with a neutral tone, as your preferences might not be agreed upon by someone else. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 05:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>You're trying to ignore my points, and argue policy that has no bearing on this discussion. There is no interpretion or opinion when I point out the actions of the characters with regards to Gorman. When several people state their disapproval of another character, it's factual that said character is disliked as a result of previous actions, in this case, the overt failure of the mission... or, do you feel that the numerous deaths, destruction of property and subsequent marooning on LV-428 was only a questionable failure, subject to reasonable differing interpretation, i.e. that the previously mentioned deaths could have been signs of success?ShadowTao 15:33, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, it's LV-426, not 428 but that's beside the point. Secondly, expressing dislike for a character, or disapproval of their actions does not insinuate "demotion", which is irrelevant as he was a secondary character. You have already had another editor tell you that him being demoted was unimportant to the plot, but yet you persist in this arrogant rant that you are so right and everyone else is so wrong. I've provided you with Wiki's policy regarding plots, and that they are not substitutions for watching the film; yet you persist that the section needs "more specifics" which is a violation of that policy. We want this article to get to GA status, and overly long plots with needless details will be restrictions to that status. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 15:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Who said anything about "demotion?" That's your word, not mine. Further, you've got the argument entirely wrong. I said Lt. Gorman had become a "subordinate," which is obviously true since he was no longer giving orders, despite his being the highest ranking marine. I then stated, separately, that Lt. Gorman's efforts were a "failure," as evidence by the comments and actions of those around. There was also the small matter of his platoon being "wiped out," as you say. If you can explain how getting one's platoon slaughtered can be viewed as anything other than a failure, please, do tell. As for the "arrogant rant," don't call the kettle black.ShadowTao 00:04, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The funny part is that a lot of it I cut from your original edits so that you couldn't say that I "undid" what you added. Secondly, I don't believe anyone else had this "5th grade" assumption about it, and as far as college goes, I generally get A's on all my papers, even in the grammer portion. Since I threw this up there without proofing it, and without proofing what YOU had added originally and that I kept, I think it was fairly good. Just because I don't try and "dress it up" doesn't make it 5th grade in the least. It follows Wiki's policy for plot summaries. It's short, to the point, doesn't digress over minor details, it isn't a substitution for watching the film. You aren't supposed to walk away from the article going "wow that plot summary was 'tight'", you are supposed to walk away going "wow that article had a lot of encyclopedic information about the film (not the mythos of the fictional universe)". Also, a very important policy is that Wikipedia does not promote other websites, or any venue for that matter. This is also applied to films. "Spicying" up words, creating "dramatic effect" is indirectly promoting a film, or dismissing a film (if you write it negatively). If you read about what Wiki wants for plots, they should be able to be read by anyone, especially those not familiar with the franchise. You don't need to explain who characters are, because you have a "Cast" section for that. This isn't IMDb, there is a formula for how a page should be. "Dressing" plots up is indirectly promoting films, just the same if you only list positive criticisms for the film. If you notice, even films that have received high praise still have to have some negative feedback on that section, because Wiki has a NPOV policy. That policy extends to not just the reception sections but to every section including the plot. Creating dramatic tension in a plot is not in keeping with the NPOV policy. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 02:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Further, you're in college; the grammatical rules I was observering are taught from 5th grade (hence my 5th grade comment) on towards 12th. I'm guessing you're an American (judging from your personal wiki page); so, you would recognize the book of grammar of which I speak- it's gray, and disproportionately longer than it is wide. As for personal attacks, don't start- you've been playing the intellectual superiority card since you started harassing me on my edits. Ad hoc need not be overt, so don't think I haven't noticed the venom from your tenuous insults.ShadowTao 23:55, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unlike ShadowTao, I'm going to point out some wording that could be improved and not say it's "5th grade level" writing in general.</p>
<ul>
<li><strike>"Although initially reluctant to join, Ripley agrees on the condition that the alien species is exterminated, and not brought back for experiments."</strike> This sentence is a little awkward from my perspective. Maybe "exterminated instead of being brought back for experiments."</li>
<li><strike>I think the word "marine" needs to be capitalized.</strike></li>
<li>"After locating the colonists, via their surgically-implanted transceivers, the marines attempt to rescue them." Shouldn't the surgically-implanted transceivers be in the previous sentence, since that's how they found the facehugged folks and the girl? Sorry, I haven't seen the film, so this didn't make sense to me.</li>
<li><strike>"...the aliens spring to life. After most of the squad is wiped out, Ripley uses the APC..." Needs to be more clear here that the aliens attacked the squad.</strike></li>
<li><strike>"A plan to escape the planet and nuke the site from orbit is commissioned." An "active" verb could be used here, such as "They commission a plan to... blah blah."</strike></li>
<li><strike>"They soon learn the processing plant was damaged..." How about "find out" in place of "soon learn"?</strike></li>
<li><strike>"The two live facehuggers are set loose on Ripley and Newt while they sleep in hopes that they will become impregnated with an alien." The two "they"s are confusing. Perhaps write it as "...while the humans sleep in hopes that the facehuggers will impregnate them with... (better wording than 'an alien' here)."&lt;/strik&gt;</strike></li>
<li><strike>"When Vasquez is injured Gorman returns to help, but the two are overwhelmed with aliens and Gorman is forced to detonate a grenade killing them both in the process." I do believe this is one of the run-ons that ShadowTac failed to point out. I think the sentence could be broken down into two or even three, since there's a lot going on in that sentence. <b>recheck sentence, it's been adjusted</b></strike></li>
<li><strike>"She finds and frees Newt from an alien cocoon, then accidentally stumbles into the nest's main breeding chamber, where both are confronted by the monstrous alien Queen." While not technically a run-on, it's a bit long and could be separated into a couple of sentences. <b>recheck sentence, it's been adjusted</b></strike></li>
</ul>
<p><strike>Hope these suggestions help. I don't want to suggest too many changes in one sitting. I'll let you read my feedback, and I'll review it some more later. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 18:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<dd><strike>Thanks for the feeback. It was a quick draft. I didn't capitalize "marines" becuase it wasn't in the previous plots, so I wasn't sure if it needed to be since it wasn't refering to the "Marine Corps" but just solidiers. Anyway, I implimented that change since it isn't a "wording" issue. Shadow should be happy because the last two paragraphs (morphed into one paragraph) were originally his. So I didn't eliminate everything that he added. I placed the "surgical trans..." there because initially they didn't find anyone but the girl (who was running about outside the room they were in) and the two facehuggers. Later, they used their tracking system to scout the colonists' receivers. Chronologically, they found the girl and the facehuggers well before they found the dead colonists. I've made the corrections to the rest, please feel free to go back and re-read the text for more suggestions or to critique the corrections made from your first suggestion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 18:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>I'm a big fan of brevity, but to be honest, I think this new plot summary might be a bit too brief. I think the existing plot summary is quite ok, and would prefer to keep it, with some minor modifications. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 23:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>I ran the sypnosis through the meatgrinder again. Characters were being mentioned with no explanation as to who they were (including the various types of aliens), the links were a mess, and I think it's most accurate to say that Gorman and Vasquez detonate the granade <i>together</i>.--<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoduck_c4d6.html" title="User:Geoduck">Geoduck</a> 07:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd><strike>I think that the newer version of the plot is superior. It needs minor alterations but it is generally tighter then the current edit.

<p><strike>"The production was somewhat problematic, marred by several disputes between Cameron and the film crew, which eventually led to an all-out strike late in the production."</strike></p>

<dd><strike>I believe that this is documented on one of the special features on the special edition DVD (released with the quadrilogy), with James Cameron saying how terrible the British crew was because they kept asking for tea breaks!

<dd><strike>I looked thisup in McIntee's book and it talks about quite a bit of conflict between UK and US ways of working (and the way things were done at Pinewood) which lead to the lighitng guy being given his cards but that the differences were largely smoothed out in the course of the production. can't see the mention of a strike. The whole story about the history of the production is interesting but unless a strike can be proved it might be better leaving such things for a section on the production history.

<p><strike>I can attest to several citation sources for some of the info on which they are required, though they're hard to attain- the one pertaining to the musical score is cited in the Aliens: The Deluxe Edition soundtrack- I believe the academy award nomination for Best Actress can also be found in that source. The source for the Alien Nest&gt;Batman fact is mentioned in the DVD commentary, as are the tidbits pertaining the the gun-props within the movie. Ridley Scott's affinity for Conrad is a known fact and is listed in several other Alien-related entries. I just thought I should list these if others wanted to double-check these sources.</strike></p>
<dl>
<dd><strike>I'll check when I can. We can't use the DVD for the BA nomination, we need to go to the source for that. Also, "well known facts" aren't good enough, we would need Scott actually saying so. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 13:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<p><strike>Do we really need a list of the ratings this film recieved in every country, it is quite long and causes a large area of white between two sections of the article.

<dd><strike>Depending on what article you look at, it could be there. I personally don't care for it, and don't mind if it's removed.
