<p>I don't understand why you accused me of vandalism on the iPod article when I edited to talk about an accessory case. Other accessory products are mentioned in the article but you chose only to remove my edit. Why? Belkin and Griffin products are mentioned, yet you unilaterally erased my entry. Many software accessories are mentioned as well. (spunkmeyer)</p>

<p>I accept your apology. However the only difference between what I said and what was previously said was an issue of semantics. Since no official statement has been released, the "expectation" is just as speculative as the "rumour". The only reason to use the word "expectation" over "rumour" is that "expectation" sounds more credible, when only the supporting links should affect credibility; which I neglected to include, so that fault is mine. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 09:19, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think you've expanded the pre-emptive stuff on Mac OS 8/9 a little far. Very little could run pre-emptively; I don't think any applications ever used this feature. It was just for hardware drivers. I'll probably take a stab at fixing it tomorrow, but right now I'm too hungry/tired.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 05:54:15, 2005-08-26 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why not revert the edit when the page is up to replace the copyright violation?

<p><a href="../../../w/i/n/Win32.html" title="Win32">Win32</a> has to do with the Win32 API that runs underneath Windows that prevents the usage of the filename -- therefore it's not Windows directly that causes the issues with the <b>reserved file names</b>. You can note this in the command I referenced in my edit ( <i>echo delete me &gt; \\?\C:\TEMP\NUL</i> ) and how it works at the command prompt level but not with Windows applications because they all run under the rules of the Win32 API. Does that help explain it to you? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadra23_8ed3.html" title="User:Quadra23">Quadra23</a> August 29, 2005.</p>

<dd>Yes, but the source of the problems with such filenames is how the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Win32.html" title="Win32">Win32</a> API acts with such files, and not <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> directly.

<dd>Thanks for the heads up. Saw your note this morning and went back to the source, listed them on each image.

<dd>Are you asking for exact sources, in terms of who took that picture and who released it to the commercial/news sites? Isn't it appropriate to assume that images provided to legitimate, commercial sites that are clearly used to promote a movie/TV program are part of the public domain? I work in PR - we release company materials for appropriate public consumption all the time.

<p>The page says that articles are moved in a week when there's a clear consensus. I guess that total lack of attention to the article is a clear consensus, no?</p>

<p>Not to beat a dead horse, but why did you re-add the redirect on the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_64-bit_Edition_0f38.html" title="Windows XP 64-bit Edition">Windows_XP_64-bit_Edition</a> page? I wasn't claiming that it's just 'another port', it is, indeed, a completely separete edition, like Media Center or Tablet. That's why it has a different name. "64-bit Edition" was for Itanium processors. The x64 edition is "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition", and is completely separate. (NT 4 for alternate processor architectures had no mechanism for executing x86 code, you needed platform-specific programs. And the variations were all on the same CD, and were all called the same thing, a.k.a. 'Windows NT 4.0 Workstation'.)</p>
<p>And Microsoft still sells '64-bit Edition'; even though they seem to have wiped it from their website. It is neither a 'dead' product, nor is it a simple port of Pro x64. (In fact, quite the opposite is true, x64 is closer to a direct port of 32-bit Pro than 64-bit Edition is.) <a href="../../../e/h/u/User%7EEhurtley_1062.html" title="User:Ehurtley">Ehurtley</a> 11:05, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I at least added real information on the Itanium version stub-page. The current x64 page just barely mentions it; and as x64 really is a separate edition than 64-bit, putting 64-bit info on the x64 page is out of place, that's why I re-separated the pages. (x64=="Windows XP Professional x64 Edition", 64-bit=="Windows XP 64-bit Edition") <a href="../../../e/h/u/User%7EEhurtley_1062.html" title="User:Ehurtley">Ehurtley</a> 11:10 UTC</p>

<p>Hello! I hope you're well; thanks for your note. No problem; I will cite what I can. Also exercise caution when outright deleting (and not necessarily revising) specs; you also removed those that were derived or adapted from canon source (or did not revise them appropriately). For instance, in the episode "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conundrum_%28TNG_episode%29_aebb.html" title="Conundrum (TNG episode)">Conundrum</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worf.html" title="Worf">Worf</a> gave a brief description of the <i>Enterprise</i>-D's armaments: 10 phasers, 250 torpedoes, high-capacity shield grid. As well, the crew complement has been cited on numerous occasions (1,012 or 1,014).</p>
<p>Remember: specs needn't necessarily be <i>solely</i> from canon sources but can also be from 'semi-canon' sources like licensed reference works, tech manuals, and magazines. For example, many of the <i>Enterprise</i>-E specs appear in <i>Star Trek: The Magazine</i> (semi-canon). I've added such notations to the template (which you removed, inadvertently?). Fanon additions should be discouraged and rightfully excised.</p>
<p>I know this may be problematic to some, particularly given the incoonsistency of some of the manuals et al., but to remove the information as you have obviates the template and cannot possibly provide visitors with an informative perspective about this and that in the Star Trek universe. Thoughts? Thanks! E Pluribus Anthony 03:24, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will cite what I can; as well, however, verifiability is not about truth. It is what others can corroborate by consulting appropriate sources. You indiscriminately removed information that is from multiple sources (canon <i>and</i> not), and this is unacceptable. You must discount this information before doing so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'Inferences' are from canon/semi-canon sources; for example, the aft torpedo launcher on the saucer module. We don't see it in any episode, but is in the ST:TNG manual; ditto for the Captain's Yacht. Specs for the <i>Defiant</i> (and many other ships) are in the DS9 tech manual. My point: as long as information is sourced, there shouldn't be a problem in verifying it. Please take the time to do this before your deletions. E Pluribus Anthony 03:32, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes: sources should be elaborated upon (and I regret not doing this more); see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Star_Trek_db1a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Star Trek">Wikipedia:WikiProject Star Trek</a> for appropriate guidelines, some of which I've contributed. Feel free to remove information which does not conform to the guidelines laid out (I was somewhat exasperated when <i>all</i> the specs were totally deleted, so forgive my restoration of the E-history link you cited), but please investigate beforehand, don't obliterate.&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony 03:39, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, you are mistaken: <i>you</i> removed <i><b>almost all</b></i> the information without discussion. Have you even attempted to verify any of this information? Where is the discussion regarding this? Nada. If you cannot take the effort to validate information and discuss it before deleting it (and I doubt you afforded appropriate attention given your wholesale deletions of even canon information), just as I did when restoring the information, don't do so; otherwise, this will proceed to higher channels.

<dd>I feel your edits (save fixing some of the wikilinks) did not add any <i>substantive</i> value and colluded the article.

You will also note that <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_%28Star_Trek%29_6d8e.html#Key_episodes_and_milestones" title="Data (Star Trek)">this article section</a> also lists relevant eps and highlights.

<dd>I'm not re-inventing the wheel: in academic writing, an endnotes section includes citations <i>and</i> extra text, like (as proposed) episode summaries/highlights. "References" is too narrow a description (though may do) in this regard: a reference section generally lists/cites appropriate works solely. I'm not suggesting we don't include it and that policies do not apply to the ST articles, but we need to do so descriptively and practically. There are a plethora of articles/pages that use varying terms for such a section, so the ST articles are no different in that respect. E Pluribus Anthony 09:49, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to talk to you about the Michael Moore page. You continue to replacing the parts of the "depictions" section that I have removed several times. I'll leave it up there for now, but let's talk through this. I find the entire depictions section unnecessary. His depiction in "Team America" belongs under controversy and his Simpsons appearance is relevant because it's actually him. Why should the fact that a comedian mocked him on MadTV belong in the article?</p>
<p><br />
i think you'll find this helpful: As a result of the strikes, and the union negotiations that took place over the subsequent decades, autoworkers became middle class. By the time Moore was growing up, his father, as a member of the United Auto Workers, was entitled to free medical care, free dental care, and four weeks of paid vacation. If he needed legal help for any civil matter, the union provided a lawyer free. He had two cars and owned his home outright. He lived not in the city of Flint itself but in Davison, a white middle-class community a few miles away. His family took nice vacations and he sent his three children to college. Moore’s father didn’t particularly like his work at the plant, but it paid well and could be relied upon—something he appreciated, having grown up in the Depression. He worked the first shift, from six until two, then played golf at the public course—paid for by families whose money came from General Motors—down the street from the factory. He retired with a full pension after thirty-three years, at the age of fifty-three, whereupon he took it easy and did volunteer work at the church.<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/040216fa_fact7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/040216fa_fact7" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Alistair, sorry to bother you with this, but I just noticed you blocked Dbiv, even though you were involved in the content dispute. That's a violation of the blocking policy, so it might be best (for your own sake) if you were to unblock him and let an uninvolved admin handle it.

<dd>Hi again, I've only just started editing the article, so I don't know the issues or who is taking which side. All I know is that we're not allowed to block people we're having content disputes with, so regardless of the consequences, you should really unblock him, for your own sake as much as anything else. Another admin is likely to come along and reblock if it was a genuine violation (and I'm not saying I think it wasn't, only that I haven't looked at the diffs). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:36, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We should really have this discussion on the 3RR page, so I'm going to move the comments there. By "for your own sake," I meant that you have violated the blocking policy, which is regarded as a serious offence for an admin, particularly in the current climate, as there have been a couple of recent controversial instances of it. You'd therefore be doing yourself a favor if you were to unblock and perhaps ask an uninvolved admin to look at the situation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:43, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
