<p>Unlike his mentor, Amir Kirolos was born into a life of poverty. His mother abandoned him at birth and he came to live in the sewers of Cairo. Here he befriended a family of rats who raised him as their own. It was these rats that taught him the ways of pictionary, although he soon outgrew their methods.</p>

<p>At age 13 Kirolos left the sewers and began top seek a life above the ground, a life where he ould show the world his pictionary skills.</p>
<p>However, he needed money. One thing that his rat parents could not give him. He began to steal and eventually was caught. The shop owner chopped his left hand off and had him arrested. Kirolos was in trouble. The sentence was death and even at the age of 13 they would carry it out. He spent what appeared to be his last days playing pictionary with the inmates.</p>

<p>Days before he was due to be killed he was told he was free to go. He didn't understand; neither did the prison guard. All he was told was that he must have important friends. As it turned out, young pictionary prodigy Paul Hendry has visited Cairo as part of his world tour. The 20 year old had noticed Kirolos playing with the prisoners and insisted he leave with him.</p>
<p><br />
They trained together for 8 months in preparation for the World Championships. The plan was to register as a team rather than go it alone, and with their skills no-one could stop them.</p>
<p>However, Hendry's suggestion of training on the top of mountains was not met with approval by Amir. His rat parents had taught him science and he knew it would do no good. They decided it would be better to go their seperate ways.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAligators_0296.html" title="Edit section: World Championships">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World Championships</span></h2>
<p>Kirolos arrived at the Championships alone and the youngest competitor. His mentor turned rival Hendry was considered favourite, but Kirolos knew that would mean nothing. The pair met in the Quarter Finals.</p>
<p>A battle between the titans of pictionary took place that evening, with viewing figures reaching an all time high during the 2nd hour of the contest. Both were evenly matched, but eventually Paul got the better of his friend and won the round. He went on to win the tournament.</p>
<p>In the next world championship, 2001, the pair met again, this time in the Semi Finals. Like before Hendry edged it. People were really taking notice of the two players by now, they had become famous amongst the pictionary addicts of the world. They were billed as unstoppable unless against one another. This was strengthened by the fact Hendry went on to win his second title.</p>
<p>In 2003 Paul and Amir competed again. However, being rated as the two best the seedings kept them apart right up to the final. And what a final it was. The longest official pictionary match on record, at 8 hours, was once again claimed by Paul Hendry. He had now won a record 3 in a row, which made him statistically the greatest ever. Critics claimed h had become "too good" and that Kirolos "didn't stand a chance". The pair were no longer capable of fighting evenly, as Hendry seemed to win every time. Fans suggested Kirolos retire as he had done as much as he could do. However, this was the last thing on his mind.</p>
<p>The day after the Championship Kirolos announced that he had noticed a fatal flaw in Hendry's gameplan and vowed to exploit it at the next competition. He then withdrew from the lesser tournaments to concentrate on his training. In the two seasons leading up to the World event Hendry won everything.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAligators_0296.html" title="Edit section: 2005">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2005</span></h2>
<p>The 2005 World Pictionary Championship has gone down as the best. Once again Hendry and Kirolos blew all opposition aside and reached the final. But hendry was getting cocky. He had done this 3 times before, why not 4? But Kirolos had been training. For two years solid he had been preparing for the dule with his mentor. And he got out of the blocks quickly. After 4 hours it was a total stalemate. But Kirolos was slowly beginning to get the luck of the draw, and started to sneak ahead of Hendry. Two hours later he had won and Hendry's monopoly on the Pictionary world had been broken.</p>
<p>Kirolos then announced he would retire after the next tournament in 2007. He said he felt frustrated with the game but that he needed to defend the title first.</p>

<p>In 2007 Kirolos reached the Semi Finals where he met Hendry. Hendry delt with him in one on the most one-sided events ever witnessed.</p>
<p>After this encounter Kirolos wwithdrew his retirement plan and prepared himself for revenge. He will wait until 2009, and so will we all.</p>
