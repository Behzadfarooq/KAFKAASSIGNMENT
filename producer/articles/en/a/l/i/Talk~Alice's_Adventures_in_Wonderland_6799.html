Yes, because any book that seems silly or nonsensical in any way must have been the result of drug use, not a good imagination and writing skill. ¨¨¨¨</p>

<p>Should there be anything discussing the theories of hidden messages, psychology or philisophical meanings of the things in Alice and Wonderland? I, at least, have heard in the past many things about the hidden messages or ideas within this story. An example would be the references within the Matrix trilogy, and Matrix fan-base (Red Queen, Looking Glass, Rabbit, etc) and the story may even have a cult following.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why not, as long as it's also mentioned that Carroll himself didn't seem to be aware of any such "hidden messages" (beyond private jokes for his friends and child-friends. <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 18:40, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The articile attributes Freudian elements to Alice in wonderland. While it is true the book can be interpreted in this way, Lewis Caroll was not influenced by Freud because Freudian psychology hadn't started when he wrote Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p><br />
Look at the Trivia part of the article. I don't quite understand how that is accurate. It says:</p>
<p>In what might seem to be nonsensical, Alice says 'Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is - oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!' This may seem mathematically absurd, until you consider that she's working in basic math: 4*5=12 in base 18, 4*6=13 in base 21 .. if you keep doing this and increase the base increment by three each time, it's actually impossible to reach 20.</p>
<p>But that's not true at all. The pattern here is 4*x in base [3*(x-5)+18]. You start with x=5 and increase it by one each time. So, 4*7=14 in base 24, 4*8=15 in base 27, 4*9=16 in base 30, 4*10=17 in base 33, 4*11=18 in base 36, 4*12=19 in base 39, and 4*13=20 in base 42. So, if you maintain the pattern, you will reach 20.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not necessarily true. 4*13 does not equal 20 at base 42, it would more likely equal something like 1A, as the decimal value of 11 is represented in another symbol, like in Hexadecimal. Put simply, 4 * 13 = 52 in decimal, and 20 at base 42 = 84 in decimal.</dd>

<p>I have recently read Alice in Wonderland. I checked it out from the library, and found it a most difficult book to read. Much of it made no sense. However, I did conclude that Caroll was a drug user. I mean, the mushroom, the hookah. There are so many things about that book that could most undeniably be seen as someones trip on shrooms or acid. The Disney movie didn't help much either, with all the colors and everything all over the place. I've done shrooms once and I didn't like it, but once was enough to be able to associate the trip with the story. I mean, I felt like I was lost in some sort of wonderland. Then I watched the movie while I was on it. You do weird things, like my girlfriend. I went up to her and held her hand while on it. She looked at me and just said, "why are you touching me?" not angry, just asking. As I look back, that just reminds me of the way the characters were in the movie and book. Like you ask yourself hard questions. It's a simple show of affection, but she asks me why? "Well, I don't know because I love you" I say. "Why do you love me?" she asks. I really couldn't answer that. I mean how could I, being young and in a fairly new relationship. I was faced with a question I couldn't answer yet couldn't ignore. You think of those things that you normally wouldn't put thought to. Then I ask myself, what is love. I started to think that love was nothing. It's really weird, by the end of the whole thing I was laying on the floor, in a corner, in the fetal position. About the book though, no one seemed to worry about anyone but themselves. The feel of the book, and it may also be that the movie is influencing my perspective, is what it felt to be on shrooms. I feel as though I can associate with the mind set of the characters. It's hard to explain if you've never done them, I just wanted someone elses opinion. I was just wondering if anyone else agrees with me. Perhaps someone has read other more intellegent peoples theories as to why this seems to be a drug users story.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that anyone who has actually read about Lewis Carroll would find it very, very hard to imagine the man smoking psyllocibin. Carroll was a logician who liked to play word games and who enjoyed twisting logic until it broke. His personal habits appear to have been very, very abstemious.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>Well, to correct you there, you sure don't smoke mushrooms... spores will get in your lungs and it could make you go blind if your eyes come in contact with the smoke. I bet he was a user.</dd>

<dd>He may have seemed that way to the people to the people that knew him, but fact tells a different story. It's a fact that Lewis CArroll smoked opium. He was also in love with the person alice was based off of. (A 7 year old niece or something.) As for the bad trip thing I don't know but it's possible that he tried to imagine what it would be like to be on different drugs. I'm just looking for what drug each character is on so it can give more insight on the movie.</dd>

<p>I don't think the whole book is about drugs and bad trip. I think it is about life. Esspecialy about the Lewis Carroll's life. He wrote the things he encountered while growing up. In Chapter IV: The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill, Alice says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now.</p>

<dd>Ummm...no, that is not a "fact," and I would like you to source that fact. Your near complete ignorance of the person the story was based on ("A 7 year old niece or something") sort of demonstrates that you are really in no position to be making pontifical pronouncements about "facts."</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The story isn't really "about" anything (aside from perhaps nonsense). It's sole purpose was to entertain the many child friends that Carroll had; so to say it was about life or drugs wouldn't be very accurate. The periodic references to people doesn't give the book any sort of deeper meaning.</dd>

<dd>There's no proof that Carroll was involved with any drugs or hallucinagens, and if there is I'd like to see it. I don't remember the quote exactly, but in one of the notes from Martin Gardner in The Annotated Alice, he says that Carroll most likely wasn't on drugs and was probably just a very imaginative person.</dd>

<p><i>Taken from this perspective, the novel (as well as Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There) is a sinister, pernicious world characterized by persons who exist fully by a self-sustaining logic that exists without reference to outside influence, including the influence of a sane, rational, and moral mind. By this perspective, at its essence, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is not a dream but a surreal nightmare involving loss of control, inability to communicate or reason, rampant uncontrolled change of one's self and everything around, and a total inability to gain any foundation in the world.</i></p>

<p>I cleaned up the last part of this section on American McGee so that it makes more sense to the average reader. However, given the format and tone of the rest of the section, I'm not sure if this part is even necessary or particularly relevant. I just want to see what everyone else thinks. - <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunch_22cb.html" title="User:Runch">Runch</a> 14:47, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It should be obvious what it's really about. All that craziness and inability to reason with people is how a lot of people, particularly children, see real life.. with all its baseless rules and ability to make you feel powerless.</dd>

<dd>As the original (anonymous) author, I would state that the American McGee section is not mandatory, but is intended as an additional cite on the concept of the original novel (not any of the adaptations) as horror more than simple fantasy. However, adding it might make take it away from NPOV - presenting a thesis against a the perspective taken in most of the rest of the article isn't really POV (indeed, to my mind it the definition of NPOV), but adding a series of incidental "and this person agrees, and this person agrees" might be belaboring the point. I'll leave it for more nonymous (sic) writers to work out - with hindsight, I sit the fence.</dd>

<p>I am a terrible writer (or at least I seem to think so) and so I do not wish to add anything to this article on my own. But I would like to point out that in the cinematic adaptation section, at least one adaptation was missing. In 1998, there was a made for TV adaptation Called "Alice Through the Looking Glass" starring Kate Beckinsale. here is the link to IMDB with the information: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167758/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167758/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167758/</a></p>

<p>The article says "One of the best-known critics is fantasy writer Terry Pratchett, who has openly stated that he dislikes the book". While true (wow, he "openly stated" it?), its placing in the article seems to convey (upon careless reading) that Pratchett is one of the most outspoken critics of the Alice books or that his has a somewhat central place among Alice criticism, but the <a href="http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html" rel="nofollow">the reference</a> only has a line or two about the books being unfunny and revolting. I think the proper place for mentioning Pratchett would be as just an entry in a (small) list of people hating Alice, if such a list could be put up here. --<a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreevatsa_6099.html" title="User:Shreevatsa">Shreevatsa</a> 07:08, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Terry Pratchett is quite successful, and in my opinion, quite good. And he is often regarded as a children's writer, although he writes for all ages. There's no need to make the article a puff piece. <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 11:59, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I've read some Terry Pratchett, and I agree he's quite good. But that's beside the point. The mention of him should obviously stay on the page; my comment was more a formatting issue than a content one. I mean, does "best-known critic" mean that he is well-known <i>and</i> a critic, or that he somehow spearheads the anti-Alice movement?&#160;:) It probably means the former, but sounds like the latter (to me). Has he repeatedly criticised Alice, as others (I assume) have done? Are there references besides the one given, which is scant?</dd>
<dd>I guess all this is too much nitpicking. It just sounded odd to mention, in the very second line, the name of one random person (albeit famous) without any reason for his being special. I'd be happier if there were names of more people who dislike Alice. --<a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreevatsa_6099.html" title="User:Shreevatsa">Shreevatsa</a> 14:32, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article does not talk about the mathematical symbolism of <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> at all. That is a very important part of the book.

<p>The author Lewis Carroll, was a mathematics teacher whose real name Charles L. Dodgson. He wrote mathematics books such as <i>Euclid and His Modern Rivals</i>. One of the mathematical symbolisms in the book is when Alice sees the cards talking to each other and they all refer to each others' names as numbers. Another example is how there is the White Rabbit wearing white gloves, those are a symbol for a secret society dedicated to the study of mathematics called the Masons, the author of <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> was both a professor of mathematics and a Mason. In Through the Looking one of the characters asks what 8-9 equals, this has to do with negative numbers. There are cards in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and cards involve a lot of mathematics and there is chess in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> and chess involves a lot of mathematics. And Alice talks about latitude and longitude at the beginning of the book and tries to remember her multiplication tables. <a href="../../../f/d/r/User%7EFDR_67d4.html" title="User:FDR">FDR</a> <a href="../../../f/d/r/User_talk%7EFDR_b075.html" title="User talk:FDR">MyTalk</a> 4:31:21 December 5, 2006</p>

<p>This artilce switches back and forth a lot referring to the author as Dodgson and Carroll.

<dd>He was never (AFAIK) known as Carroll in real life. The right convention to use would be Carroll for the author and Dodgson for the person.
