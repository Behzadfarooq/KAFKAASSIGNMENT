<p>The Prophet did not know that an army had left <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, was marching toward <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a> to protect the caravan of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quraysh.html" title="Quraysh">Quraysh</a>, and to challenge the Muslims. When the Prophet arrived in the environs of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badr.html" title="Badr">Badr</a>, he sent Ali to reconnoiter the surrounding country. At the wells of Badr, Ali surprised some water-carriers. In reply to his questions, they told him that they were carrying water for an army which came from Makkah, and which was encamped on the other side of the nearby hills.</p>
<p>Ali brought the water-carriers before the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet_of_Islam_1120.html" title="Prophet of Islam">Prophet of Islam</a>. From them he learned that the caravan of the Quraysh had already escaped, and that the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>, at that very moment, were confronted by the army of Makkah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On reaching the neighborhood of Badr, Mohammed sent forward Ali, with a few others, to reconnoiter the rising ground above the springs. There they surprised three water-carriers of the enemy, as they were about to fill their sheepskins. One escaped to the Coreish; the other two were captured and taken to the Moslem army. From them Mohammed discovered the proximity of his enemy. There were 950 men; more than threefold the number of the Moslem army. They were mounted on 700 camels and 100 horses, the horsemen all clad in mail. <b>(Sir William Muir, <i>The Life of Mohammed, London, 1877</i>)</b></p>

<p>Ali, along with his uncle <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamza.html" title="Hamza">Hamza</a> and cousin Obaida ibn Al Harith, proceeded to single duels. Ali's duel was against <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walid_ibn_Utba_6494.html" title="Walid ibn Utba">Walid ibn Utba</a>, one of Mecca's fiercest warriors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The youngest pair engaged first, Ali stepping forward to meet Waleed. After a few moments of fencing, Waleed fell by the sword of his Muslim opponent. Then Hamza engaged Otba and cut him down. Ubaida ibn Harith, the third Muslim champion, received a fatal wound from Shaiba. Ali and Hamza hastily dispatched Shaiba, carrying Ubaida to die in the Muslim lines. <b>(Sir John Glubb, <i>The Great Arab Conquests, 1963</i>)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By noon the battle was over. The Quraysh fled. Forty-nine of the enemy had fallen and Ali had killed twenty-two, either alone or with the help of others. An equal number was captured. The believers had lost fourteen men on the field of battle. <b>(Tor Andre, <i>Mohammed, the Man and his Faith, 1960</i>)</b></p>

<p>One year after the battle of Badr, the new army of the idolaters of Makkah was ready to take the field against the Muslims. In <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> <a href="../../../6/2/5/625.html" title="625">625</a> AD, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Sufyan_2e35.html" title="Abu Sufyan">Abu Sufyan</a> left Makkah at the head of three thousand seasoned warriors. Most of them were foot soldiers but they were supported by a strong contingent of cavalry. Also accompanying the army, was a band of warlike women. Their duty was to wage "psychological warfare" against the Muslims by reading poetry and by singing amatory songs to spur the courage and the will-to-fight of the soldiers. They knew that nothing held such terror for the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs.html" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> as the jibes of women for cowardice, and they also knew that nothing was so efficacious to turn them into utterly reckless fighters as the promise of physical love. These amazons included the wives of Abu Sufyan and <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amr_bin_Aas_6c79.html" title="Amr bin Aas">Amr bin Aas</a>, and the sister of <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalid_bin_Walid_df47.html" title="Khalid bin Walid">Khalid bin Walid</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Meccans, generously assisted by the women who had brought their timbrels, flung insults at the Moslems. These were alternated by Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan, who led triumphant choruses as she danced round the idol which perched on the camel. Talha, the hereditary standard-bearer of the Koreishites, was the first Meccan challenger. As he stepped out of Abu Sufyan's ranks, Ali stepped out of Mohammed's. The two men met in the middle of 'no man's land.' Without words or preliminary flourishes the duel began. Talha never stood a chance. Ali's scimitar flashed in the morning sun and the head of the standard-bearer leaped from his shoulder and rolled away on the sand. 'Allahu Akbar!'(<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> is the greatest) echoed from the eagerly watching Moslems. (<b>R.V.C. Bodley, <i>The Messenger, the Life of Mohammed, New York, 1946</i></b>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Ali ibn Abu Talib killed the carrier of the Makkan flag, Talhah ibn Abu Talha, it was immediately raised again by Uthman ibn Abu Talha. And when Uthman fell at the hands of Hamzah, it was raised again by Abu Sa'd ibn Abu Talhah. At the moment he raised the Makkan flag he shouted at the Muslims. "Do you pretend that your martyrs are in paradise and ours in hell? By God, you lie! If anyone of you truly believes such a story, let him come forward and fight with me." His challenge attracted Ali who killed him on the spot. The Banu Abd al Dar kept on carrying the Makkan flag until they lost nine men. (<b>Muhammad Husayn Haykal, <i>The Life of Muhammad</i></b>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ali alone had killed eight standard-bearers of the idolaters of Mecca.</p>
<p><b>Ibn Atheer</b>, the Arab historian, writes in his '<i><b>Tarikh Kamil'</b></i> "<i>The man who killed the standard-bearers (of the pagans) was Ali.</i>"</p>

<p>Ali ibn Abu Talib pressed on undismayed into the enemy ranks – it was Badr again; the Muslims were invincible. (<i><b>Sir John Glubb, The Great Arab Conquests, 1963</b></i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ali and <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamza.html" title="Hamza">Hamza</a> had broken the ranks of the Quraysh, and he was already deep inside their lines. Unable to resist his attack, they began to yield ground. Between them, they were grinding back the army of Quraysh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...when somebody raised the cry that Muhammad was killed, chaos reigned supreme, Muslim morale plunged to the bottom and Muslimzsoldiers fought sporadically and purposelessly. This chaos was responsible for their killing of Husayl ibn Jabir Abu Hudhayfah by mistake, <i><b>as everyone sought to save his own skin by taking flight except such men as Ali ibn Abu Talib whom God had guided and protected.</b></i> (<b>Muhammad Husayn Haykal, <i>The Life of Muhammad, 1935, Cairo</i></b>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first of the Quraish to reach the Prophet's position was Ikrimah. As Ikrimah led a group of his men forward the Prophet turned to Ali and, pointing at the group, said, "Attack those men." Ali attacked and drove them back, killing one of them. Now another group of horsemen approached the position. Again the Prophet said to Ali, "Attack those men." 1 Ali drove them back and killed another infidel. A regiment arrived from Kinanah in which four of the children of Sufyan Ibn Oweif were present. Khalid, Abu AI-Sha-atha, Abu Al-Hamra, and Ghurab. The Messenger of God said to Ali: "Take care of this regiment." Ali charged the regiment, and it was about fifty horsemen. He fought them while he was on foot until he scattered them. They gathered again and he charged them again. This was repeated several times until he killed the four children of Sufyan and added to them six more ... (<b>Ibn Abu Al Hadeed, in his Commentary, vol 1 p 372</b>)</p>

<p>The leader of Mecca Abu Sufyan ibn Harb made yet another attempt in 627 A.D. to defeat Muhammad. With an army of 10000 soldiers he left for Medina to finally overcome the Muslim forces. The Meccans however, were in for a big surprise, as Muslims established trenches outside the city on Salman the Persian’s advice. On reaching Medina, Meccan army was left bewildered at the new defensive technique acquired by the Muslims. The Meccan army was counting on its cavalry, which was rendered useless. But still few horsemen led by Amr ibn Abdawad managed to cross the trench finally; Amr was considered one of the finest warriors in whole of Arabia. Once in the Muslim territory Amr called the Muslim army and asked for a challenger, Ali emerged from the Muslim camp and came face to face with Amr who was better equipped for the battle than Ali. The duel began, nothing could be seen from far as the dust cloud began to grow thicker, but it was soon pierced by the sound of Allaho Akber, and the Muslim camp basked in sheer jubilation as Ali killed Amr in what is remembered by Muslims as the most important duel in Islamic history. Others who accompanied Amr ran away, one of them fell in the trench and was later killed by Ali. Ali’s remarkable performance affirmed his position at the pinnacle of the fierce warriors pyramid.</p>
