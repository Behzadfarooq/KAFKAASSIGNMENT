<p>All Muslim traditions describe him being born inside the <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, the most sacred site in Islam; however, non Muslim contemporary academic historians choose to not mention it. One historian, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Ockley_b198.html" title="Simon Ockley">Simon Ockley</a>, retold it as a "strange" narrration <sup><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Saracens_bc81.html" title="History of the Saracens">History of the Saracens</a> <a href="http://www.dinsdoc.com/ockley-1-3.htm#331" class="external text" title="http://www.dinsdoc.com/ockley-1-3.htm#331" rel="nofollow">page 331</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Ali's father, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Talib_70dc.html" title="Abu Talib">Abu Talib</a>, was a member of the powerful tribe of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quraysh.html" title="Quraysh">Quraysh</a>, and an uncle to the young Muhammad. When Muhammad was orphaned and then lost his grandfather, Abu Talib took Muhammad into his house. Ali and Muhammad were thus cousins raised as brothers, with Ali in the role of a younger brother, looking up to Muhammad and ready to follow his lead. Ali never worshiped any idol before Muhammad announced his prophethood and when Muhammad reported that he had received a divine revelation regarding <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawheed.html" title="Tawheed">tawheed</a>, a claim that Islamic sources indicate was initially greeted with derision, Ali was one of the first to believe him and profess <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>.</p>
<p>Ali stood firm in support of Muhammad during the years of persecution of Muslims in Mecca. In <a href="../../../6/2/2/622.html" title="622">622</a> CE, the year of Muhammad's <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijra_%28Islam%29_85e0.html" title="Hijra (Islam)">flight</a> to Yathrib, or <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>, according to Islamic sources, Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> plot, so that his cousin could flee in safety. Ali survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping.</p>

<p>The small community of Muslim immigrants in Medina, the <i><a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhajir.html" title="Muhajir">Muhajirun</a></i>, were at first extremely poor. They had no land, no houses, and lived on the charity of the Medinans who had converted to Islam (the <i><a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansar.html" title="Ansar">Ansar</a></i>). They hired themselves out for labor and engaged in the raiding of Meccan <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caravan.html" title="Caravan">caravans</a>. Ali shared in all the labor and hardships of the community.</p>
<p>Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in <a href="../../../6/2/4/624.html" title="624">624</a> CE, at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Badr_04cf.html" title="Battle of Badr">Battle of Badr</a>. He defeated the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Umayyed_8c05.html" title="Banu Umayyed">Banu Umayyed</a> champion <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walid_ibn_Utba_6494.html" title="Walid ibn Utba">Walid ibn Utba</a> as well as many other Meccan soldiers. He was publicly praised by Muhammad. After this, he was emboldened to ask for the hand of <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatima_Zahra_26ba.html" title="Fatima Zahra">Fatima Zahra</a>, Muhammad's daughter by <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khadija.html" title="Khadija">Khadija</a>, in marriage. Fatima and Muhammad consented, and the marriage was solemnized two months after the battle <a href="http://al-islam.org/restatement/23.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://al-islam.org/restatement/23.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>From that moment he became a part of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammads</a> <a href="../../../a/h/l/Ahl_al-Bayt_a489.html" title="Ahl al-Bayt">Ahl al-Bayt</a>. Further ahead he had two sons with Fatimah, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hassan_ibn_Ali_9573.html" title="Hassan ibn Ali">Hassan ibn Ali</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husayn_ibn_Ali_7823.html" title="Husayn ibn Ali">Husayn ibn Ali</a>. Al four where included in the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Event_of_the_Cloak_ac10.html" title="Event of the Cloak">Event of the Cloak</a></p>
<p>Ali was also prominent on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Uhud_51d2.html" title="Battle of Uhud">battlefield of Uhud</a>. He is said to have received seventeen wounds in the battle.</p>
<p>In 9 A.H. (<a href="../../../6/3/0/630.html" title="630">630</a> CE), Muhammad prepared to lead an expedition against Syria. This was the well-known <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tabouk_9084.html" title="Battle of Tabouk">expedition of Tabuk</a>. He did not want to leave Medina, the capital city, unguarded, and decided to leave Ali behind as his deputy. Ali asked if he was going to be left behind with the women and children <a href="http://al-islam.org/restatement/34.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://al-islam.org/restatement/34.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Muhammad is reputed to have said:</p>
<p>"Will you not be pleased that you will be to me like <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron.html" title="Aaron">Aaron</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>? But there will be no prophet after me." <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.700" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.700" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>For the ten years that Muhammad led the community in Medina, Ali was extremely active in his cousin's service, serving in his armies, leading parties of warriors on raids, carrying messages and orders. With the exception of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tabouk_9084.html" title="Battle of Tabouk">Tabuk</a>, Ali joined all of Muhammad's battles and expeditions. As Muhammad's son-in-law and one of his lieutenants, Ali was a person of authority and standing in the Muslim community. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Muir_606f.html" title="William Muir">William Muir</a> describes him thus: <i>"Endowed with a clear intellect, warm in affection, and confiding in friendship, he was from the boyhood devoted heart and soul to the Prophet.

<p>Muhammad had been ailing for some time, but seemed to have recovered somewhat. He left his house to take part in prayers at the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a>, then returned to his quarters and died.</p>
<p>Ali had a strong claim to the leadership, both as one of Muhammad's closest assistants and as his cousin and son-in-law. But he was passed over for the leadership. (See <i><a href="../../../s/a/q/Saqifah.html" title="Saqifah">Saqifah</a></i>) At first he refused to swear fealty to <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a>, another prominent Muslim and Muhammad's father-in-law. In this he was followed by a significant portion of Medina's Muslim community, including the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Hashim_ba43.html" title="Banu Hashim">Banu Hashims</a>. They were known as the <i><a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafidi.html" title="Rafidi">Rafidi</a></i>, or "Refusers", and later as the <i>Shi'at Ali</i>, the party of Ali.</p>
<p>This is an extremely contentious issue, covered in detail in the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> article. Muslims ultimately split into <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">sects</a> based on their attitudes towards this issue. The <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> believe that Muhammad, in accordance with God's command, designated Ali to succeed him, and that Ali was a victim of worldly intrigue; the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> believe that the community made a wise choice in uniting behind Abu Bakr.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/s/m/Asma_bint_Umais_2af6.html" title="Asma bint Umais">Asma bint Umais</a> was first married with <a href="../../../j/a/27/Ja%27far_ibn_Abu_Talib_958d.html" title="Ja'far ibn Abu Talib">Ja'far ibn Abu Talib</a>, Alis brother. When Ja'far died during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mut%27ah_91ee.html" title="Battle of Mut'ah">battle of Mut'ah</a>, Asma married Abu Bakr. After Abu Bakrs death, she married Ali and moved to his household with her two children, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Abi_Bakr_f4e6.html" title="Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr">Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr</a> and <a href="../../../u/m/m/Umm_Khultum_bint_Abu_Bakr_f29f.html" title="Umm Khultum bint Abu Bakr">Umm Khultum bint Abu Bakr</a>, leading to ibn Abi Bakr becoming Alis son in law. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was tutored by Ali and became one of his great partisians, being held in great honour and respect by Shias.</p>
<p>Sunni and Shi'a also disagree on Ali's attitude towards Abu Bakr, and the two caliphs who succeeded him, <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar_al-Khattab_dfbc.html" title="Umar al-Khattab">Umar al-Khattab</a> and <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman_ibn_Affan_8dbc.html" title="Uthman ibn Affan">Uthman ibn Affan</a>. Sunnis tend to stress Ali's acceptance and support of their rule, while Shi'a claim that he distanced himself from them. They argue that Ali confined himself to his home and settled with working with his garden, not taking any military or formal administrative post.</p>
<p>Ali did not aid Abu Bakr during the <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridda_wars.html" title="Ridda wars">Ridda wars</a> in any way, but he did gave writen advices to the armies marching to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> during <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umars</a> time, but did join in any of those battles.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Drawing_board_4cbc.html" title="Edit section: Inheritance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inheritance</span></h2>
<p>Ali and Fatima, as well as Muhammad's widows, had an additional cause for disaffection with Abu Bakr. Muhammad had acquired various lands and properties in the last years of his life. Those he left behind expected that this property would come to them, according to the inheritance laws proclaimed by Muhammad himself. However, Abu Bakr claimed that he had heard Muhammad say that prophets do not leave an inheritance <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/053.sbt.html#004.053.325" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/053.sbt.html#004.053.325" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Abu Bakr argued that the property had been held by the Prophet in trust for the community, and was rightfully the property of the state -- despite Ali's rejoinder that Muhammad's revelations included accounts of prophetic inheritance (Qur'an 27:16, 21:89). Abu Bakr gave state pensions to Muhammad's widows, but Muhammad's blood relatives, Ali, Fatimah and <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Abbas_d33f.html" title="Ibn Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a>, did not receive even that much.</p>
<p>After Fatima's death, Ali again claimed her inheritance, but was denied with the same argument. The caliphs who followed Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman, also refused to return the various properties, whether to Ali or to Muhammad's widows. Shi'a Muslims regard this as yet another instance of the persecution of Muhammad's lineage, the <i><a href="../../../a/h/l/Ahl_al-Bayt_a489.html" title="Ahl al-Bayt">Ahl al-Bayt</a></i>, at the hands of the caliphs they regard as usurpers.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../6/5/6/656.html" title="656">656</a> CE, the third caliph <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>, was murdered in his own house, in Medina, by rebellious Muslim soldiers. Medina, now a large city and the capital of an empire stretching from <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> to <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, fell into chaos. In the crisis, some Muslims turned to Ali, who had been for years a faithful and steady lieutenant of Muhammad and his successors, and urged him to seek the caliphate. Ali at first refused. He is said to have been horrified by the assassination of Uthman, and did not wish to appear to be profiting from the situation<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. But his supporters persevered, and Ali finally allowed himself to be proclaimed caliph.</p>

<p>Some opponents at the time claimed that he had connived at the murder of Uthman, or at the very least been negligent in seeking the murderers. However, most current and historical opinion absolves him of any blame. He had sent his two sons to protect Uthman, and it is reported that he was dissapointed that they did not succed in preventing his death. Uthmans wife sent a letter to one of Uthmans relatives, Muawiya I, describing Alis son-in law participiating in the riots and urging Muawiya to avenge his fallen relative.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Drawing_board_4cbc.html" title="Edit section: Caliphate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Caliphate</span></h2>
<p>Almost the first act of his caliphate was to put down a rebellion led by <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/-/Az-Zubayr_f94f.html" title="Az-Zubayr">az-Zubayr</a>, two childhood friends and prominent <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> of Muhammad, who were urged on by <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>, one of Muhammad's widow, having "revenge the blood of Uthman" as their cry. However, Mu'awiyah did not aid them. In the view of Shi'as, Aisha was a bitter enemy of Ali, and one of the chief hindrances to his advancement to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">caliphate</a>. Ali engaged in conversation with Talha and Zubayr, reminding them of their childhood friendship and urging them to end the hotilities, resulting in Talha not going to the front lines and Zubayr leaving the battle scene. However, Aisha was in command and battle started. The rebel army was defeated at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Camel_6cf2.html" title="Battle of the Camel">Battle of the Camel</a>, Talha was killed by one of his own troops, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwan_ibn_al-Hakam_8123.html" title="Marwan ibn al-Hakam">Marwan ibn al-Hakam</a>, Uthmans cousin. Someone had followed Zubayr and killed him while <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salah.html" title="Salah">praying</a>, and Aisha was captured and escorted with all respect to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>, where she was given a pension. The death of Talha and Zubayr grieved Ali, as they both where old friends.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, Ali dismissed several provincial governors, some of whom were relatives of Uthman, and replaced them with <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">companions of the Prophet</a> and trusted aides such as <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik_ibn_Ashter_2141.html" title="Malik ibn Ashter">Malik ibn Ashter</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_the_Persian_dfff.html" title="Salman the Persian">Salman the Persian</a>. Ali then transfered his capital from Medina to <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a>, the Muslim garrison city in what is now <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. The capital of the province of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, was held by <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muawiyah_I_c2c7.html" title="Muawiyah I">Mu'awiyah</a>, the governor of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> and a kinsman of <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>, Ali's slain predecessor.</p>
<p><br />
Soon after Ali demanding Mu'awiyah to release his post, he raised an army and marched against Ali, demanding vengeance for the death of Uthman. A prolonged battle took place in July <a href="../../../6/5/7/657.html" title="657">657</a> CE in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Siffin_3bb8.html" title="Battle of Siffin">Battle of Siffin</a>, near the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphrates.html" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. To this point had his son in law, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Abi_Bakr_f4e6.html" title="Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr">Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr</a> and his two childhood friends <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik_ibn_Ashter_2141.html" title="Malik ibn Ashter">Malik ibn Ashter</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammar_ibn_Yasir_9287.html" title="Ammar ibn Yasir">Ammar ibn Yasir</a> died, adding to Alis grief.</p>
<p>The battle was turning in favor of Ali when a number of the opposing army, fixing copies of the <i><a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a></i> to the points of their spears, exclaimed that "the matter ought to be settled by reference to this book, which forbids Muslims to shed each other's blood."</p>
<p><br />
At this point, some of the soldiers of Ali refused to fight any longer, and demanded that the issue be referred to arbitration. The appointed advocate for Ali became Abu Musa al Asha'ri. <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amr_ibn_al-As_f9bb.html" title="Amr ibn al-As">Amr ibn al-As</a>, a veteran diplomat, was chosen to act for Mu'awiyah. It is reported that `Amr persuaded Abu Musa that it would be to the advantage of Islam that neither candidate should reign, and asked him to give his decision first. Abu Musa having proclaimed that he deposed both Ali and Mu'awiyah, `Amr declared that he also deposed Ali, but invested Mu'awiyah with the caliphate. This decision greatly injured the cause of Ali, which was still further weakened by the loss of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to Mu'awiya's forces.</p>

<p>According to tradition, three Muslim zealots (purists later termed <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharijites.html" title="Kharijites">Kharijites</a>) had agreed to assassinate Ali, Mu'awiyah and `Amr, as the authors of disastrous feuds among the faithful. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassin.html" title="Assassin">assassins</a> sent against Mu'awiyan and `Amr failed; the only assassin who succeeded was the one who attacked Ali.</p>
<p>Ali suffered a mortal head wound the 19th of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramadan.html" title="Ramadan">Ramadan</a> while he was performing morning prayers. The sword that wounded him is said to have been poisoned.</p>
<p>Before Ali died, when offered milk, he is said to have asked if his assasin, Abdur Rahman bin Muljam al Sarimi, had been offered milk as well. Ali further decreed that if he was not to survive, then Bin Muljam should be killed with no more than one stroke, as he had only struck Ali once.</p>
<p>Ali died on the 21st of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramadan.html" title="Ramadan">Ramadan</a> (three days after he was stabbbed) in Kufa in <a href="../../../6/6/1/661.html" title="661">661</a> CE.</p>

<p>Ali had eight wives after Fatima's death, and in all, it is said, thirty-three children.

Mu'awiyah I thus became caliph and established the <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umayyad.html" title="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> dynasty of caliphs.

<p>Just as Muslims do not picture God, or <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>, but reference him by his <a href="../../../9/9/_/99_Names_of_God_f84b.html" title="99 Names of God">Ninety-nine Names</a> or titles, so Muslims honor Muhammad, Ali, and other pious Muslims with titles of praise and add pious interjections after their names.</p>
<p>All Muslims, Sunni and Shi'a alike, agree that Ali deserves these titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amīr al-Mu'minīn <i>(The Commander of the Faithful)</i></li>
<li>Abu Turab <i>(Father of Dust/Soil)</i></li>
<li>Asad-ullāh <i>(Lion of God)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Many Muslims add the phrase "May Allah be pleased with him" after mentioning the name of a prominent or pious companion of Muhammad. Ali is given an additional pious modifier. When Ali's name is mentioned, along with "May Allah be pleased with him", Shi'a add "Allah has honoured his face", a reference to the Shi'a belief that Ali converted to Islam at such a young age that he never joined in any worship of the traditional Meccan gods, whom the Muslims believe to be <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idol.html" title="Idol">idols</a>. His face, they say, was never defiled by prostrations before idols.</p>
<p>Both Shia and Sunnis agree that hating Ali nulifies Islam, and loving him is obligatory.</p>

<p>Shia regard him with great respect and insist that he is <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammads</a> choosen successor, designated by God. Also, Shia concluded that even if that was not the case, Ali should have still been the first Caliph, since he was by all and any standard the one most merited for the task, something shared by some western scholars. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mills_%281788%29_4761.html" title="Charles Mills (1788)">Charles Mills</a>, one of the leading historical writer of his time:</p>

<dd><i>As the chief of the family of Hashem and as the cousin and son-in-law of him whom the Arabians respected …, it is <b>apparently wonderful that Ali was not raised to the Caliphate immediately on the death of Mohammad</b>. To the advantages of his birth and marriage was added the friendship of the Prophet. The son of Abu Talib was one of the first converts to Islamism and Mohammad’s favourite appellation of his was the Aaron of a second Moses. His talents as an orator, and his intrepidity as a warrior, were grateful to a nation in whose judgement courage was virtue and eloquence was wisdom." <sup><a href="../../../a/n/_/An_history_of_Mohammedanism_9a45.html" title="An history of Mohammedanism">An history of Mohammedanism</a> <a href="http://www.al-shia.com/html/eng/articles/mahdi/almahdi/04.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.al-shia.com/html/eng/articles/mahdi/almahdi/04.htm" rel="nofollow">p. 89</a></sup></i></dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> venerate him as second only to Muhammad. They celebrate the anniversaries of his martyrdom and birth and in their confession of faith (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahada.html" title="Shahada">shahada</a>), the Shi'a have a voluntarily reference to Ali. (This can be spoken during the call to prayer, but it is not obligatory either).</p>
<hr />
<p>Etymological note: <i>Shi'a</i>, in Arabic, means "party of", or "partisans of". <i>Shi'a</i> is actually an abbreviation of <i>Shi'at Ali</i>, meaning "the partisans of Ali [and his descendants]."</p>
