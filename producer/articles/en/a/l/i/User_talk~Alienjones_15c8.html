<p>I have thought of creating a WikiProject for South Park since it is now near its' 10th anniversary and has more articles than ever. I feel we could all do the following things through this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanup any short/poorly written/unformatted articles</li>
<li>Merge/lengthen the many character articles</li>
<li>Improve the South Park main page</li>
</ul>
<p>I have seen your South Park fan template and wondered if you were interested in joining. If so reply to my talk page and I'll get back to you as quick as I can.
