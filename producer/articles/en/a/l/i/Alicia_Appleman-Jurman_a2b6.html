<p>She was the only daughter and the second-youngest of Sigmund and Frieda Jurman in a family of five children (she had four brothers, all of whom would perish in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>).</p>
<p>Raised from the age of five in <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buczacz.html" title="Buczacz">Buczacz</a>, which was roughly â…“ Jewish at that time, Alicia was sheltered relatively well from the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> that plagued her town, as well as the rest of Europe. Unfortunately, this changed on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, when German soldiers <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Poland_%281939%29_e800.html" title="Invasion of Poland (1939)">invaded Poland</a>, and Alicja would gradually have her whole family brutally torn from her.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Appleman-Jurman_a2b6.html" title="Edit section: Moshe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Moshe</span></h3>
<p>Her second-eldest brother, Moshe, was the first to die. The <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a> worked out a deal with Stalin and they divided Poland between themselves. <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buczacz.html" title="Buczacz">Buczacz</a> fell under <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> occupation. A few weeks after the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a>/German treaty was signed, the Russian army entered Buczacz and occupied it. The communists began removing so-called "Enemies of the Soviet Union" from the area in their effort to "Russianize" this new territory. With the Russian occupation, Moshe decided to go to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Leningrad</a> for an education as this was being offered to the students - both Jewish and non-Jewish.</p>
<p>Moshe had determined this would help him and his family. Over time, letters written home from Moshe were strange and seemed cold - something was not right, and his family was consumed with worry at this odd tone. Within a year, he returned home, frightened and gaunt ... he had "escaped" from "school". He told his family how he was forced to write what he had in those letters. He had been treated terribly and the situation in Russia was grim, he explained. He had been forced do hard labor every day after school. He had decided to escape from this "education" and come home.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, the Russians were looking for him. They did not want anyone spreading rumors of how bad that the conditions were in Russia. Moshe knew the truth; he was caught and imprisoned. In a few weeks Moshe would become the first Jurman brother to die.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Appleman-Jurman_a2b6.html" title="Edit section: Sigmund Jurman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sigmund Jurman</span></h3>
<p>In June <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, the Germans broke their pact with the Soviets and swept through eastern Poland on their way to Russia - <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> had begun. The Germans, however, had an even worse plan than the Soviets had had for Europe's Jews: it was known as <b>Endlosung</b> (aka <b>The Final Solution</b>).</p>
<p>The plan was to kill them all eventually. In <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buczacz.html" title="Buczacz">Buczacz</a>, a decree was made that all of the Jewish men were to go to a central place and "register". What truly happened to these 600 leaders of the Jewish community was that they were detained and then taken out to a large <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meadow.html" title="Meadow">meadow</a> and massacred by firing squads. Before the truth was uncovered, however, the Germans pretended that the men were still alive and demanded ransom payments for their release.</p>
<p>Alicja's mother gave the Germans all the money and jewelry that she had. The truth that Sigmund Jurman was already dead would not be known until much later. 600 or so fathers had been slaughtered to render the remaining Jews leaderless so that the Germans would be able to have more control over those who were still alive. Alicja and her family now had little support and were imperiled more than ever.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Appleman-Jurman_a2b6.html" title="Edit section: The Ghetto">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Ghetto</span></h3>
<p>Alicja, with her mother, a younger brother, and two older brothers were forced to leave their beautiful home to be "resettled" in the worst section of Buczacz - for this is were the ghetto for the Jews was created. Jewish families that lived in villages and remote areas were rounded up with the help of the local Ukrainian and Polish police and shipped into these medieval-styled ghettos as well. Along with white <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armband.html" title="Armband">armbands</a> bearing the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_of_David_a785.html" title="Star of David">Star of David</a>, curfews and other "rules" it was edicted by the occupying Nazis that:</p>
<ul>
<li>any Jew who entered the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogue</a> would be punished by death</li>
<li>anyone trying to leave the ghetto would also be shot</li>
<li>any Jew not wearing the armband with the Star of David would be arrested and (presumably) executed</li>
</ul>
<p>Alicja was told she could no longer attend school. She wanted to be in school so badly that every day she climbed a tree and gazed into her former classroom, trying to hear the lessons. Her former teacher could see Alicja, there in the tree, but, out of compassion, said nothing. One day, Alicja fell out of the tree and, because of the commotion it caused and the danger it risked to both women, the teacher was forced to gently direct the young girl to stay away from the school thereafter.</p>
<p><a name="Bunio" id="Bunio"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Appleman-Jurman_a2b6.html" title="Edit section: Bunio">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bunio</span></h3>
<p>Alicja's elder brother, Bunio, disappeared one day while out getting wood. They would never see him again. This was part of the actions taken by the Germans to secure slave labor. Bunio had been "picked up" and transported to a slave camp called Borki Wielki, about 100 miles away. The Germans informed the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judenrat.html" title="Judenrat">Judenrat</a> (the Jewish "government" inside the ghetto) that packages could be sent to these boys twice-a-week. Then terrible news leaked into the ghetto. One of the boys had tried to escape and the Germans, using their typical terror-tactics, had lined the remaining ones up and separated every 10th boy to be executed. Bunio had been of the 10 or so boys pulled out of line - he was now dead from a German bullet. Not even halfway through the war Alicja had already lost 2 brothers and her father in the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Appleman-Jurman_a2b6.html" title="Edit section: Swept-Up in an Action">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Swept-Up in an Action</span></h3>
<p>One day while visiting a Jewish family, Alicja was swept up by an action. The Germans kicked in the door and ordered everyone out. The father of the family was a doctor and he pleaded that Alicja be allowed to go home, but his plea was ignored by the officers and they were all loaded on a train. After several hours on the trip, feeling that the worst was about to happen, the Jewish adults in the train car discovered a loose bar in the window and they managed to spread the bars over the window and children were pushed out in the hope that they might survive. How terrible this must have been, for everyone was sure that the train-ride was bringing them somewhere that was worse than the ghetto ... many had guessed the truth: this train was taking them to an <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_concentration_camps.html" title="Nazi concentration camps">extermination center</a>.</p>
<p>Alicja was thrown through the window and, although injured, followed the railroad tracks back home; she survived her first brush with death ... it was only the winter of 1941 and many other brushes with death would await her.</p>
<p><a name="Zachary" id="Zachary"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Appleman-Jurman_a2b6.html" title="Edit section: Zachary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Zachary</span></h3>
<p>Zachary at 17 years old was a beautiful <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blond.html" title="Blond">fair-haired</a> boy and was Alicja's only elder brother remaining. She also still had little nine year-old brother, Herzl and her mother, Frieda. These four were the only surviving members of the immediate Jurman family. Zachary, furious at the murder of a sweetheart by the Germans and at being helpless to do anything, took to loosely organized resistance activities. He became active in a group of friends who were trying to find a way to fight back.</p>
<p>One day Zachary was betrayed by a Polish "friend". He was caught and hanged right in front of the police building for everyone to see. Alicja was brought to the place by her friends and that night, they returned, cut him down and buried him in the Jewish cemetery.</p>
<p>Zachary had been the closest of all her brothers, and the utter devastation she endured overwhelmed her but a new resolve came over her. Alicja swore on Zachary's grave that she would protect her mother and only remaining sibling, her little brother, with her life and would speak for her silenced family when and if she survived.</p>
