<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Cooke_448a.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salford.html" title="Salford">Salford</a>, in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to a Methodist father and an Irish mother, as <b>Alfred Cooke</b>, he legally added the name "Alistair" at age 22. He was educated at Blackpool Grammar School and was awarded a scholarship to study at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_College%2C_Cambridge_8ccf.html" title="Jesus College, Cambridge">Jesus College, Cambridge</a>, where he gained an honours degree (2:1) in English. He was heavily involved in the arts of the college, becoming the editor of <i>The Granta</i>, the student magazine, and setting up the Mummers, the first co-sex theatre group, from which he notably rejected a young <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Mason_105f.html" title="James Mason">James Mason</a>, telling him to stick to architecture.</p>
<p>While still in England, Cooke became engaged to Henrietta Riddle, the daughter of actor <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ainley_86a2.html" title="Henry Ainley">Henry Ainley</a> and the novelist Bettina Riddle, also known as the Baroness von Hutten; but as a graduate student, he went to <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> in the United States for two years on a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship, and his fiancée was to desert him while he was away on this trip, in January 1933. However at the end of this year he met Ruth Emerson, who was the grand-niece of <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_1ca0.html" title="Ralph Waldo Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>. They were married the next year. Originally <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Chaplin_96fc.html" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, whom Cooke had befriended in Hollywood, was supposed to be his best man, but the mercurial actor vanished at the last minute.</p>

<p>In 1934, at the end of his study fellowship, Cooke saw a newspaper headline that Baldwin, the prime minister's son, had been fired by the BBC as film critic. Cooke sent a telegraph to the so-called "Director of Talks" asking if he could be considered for the post. He was invited for interview and took the Cunard back to England, arriving 4 hours late for his interview. He suggested typing out a critique on the spot, and a few minutes later, he was offered the job. In October 1934, Cooke became a film critic for the BBC. He was also London correspondent for <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>. Each week, he recorded a 15-minute talk for American listeners on life in Britain, under the series title of <i>London Letter</i>. He also sat on a committee for the BBC headed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bernard_Shaw_f7b2.html" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> on correct pronunciation. The fact that Shaw spoke with a strong <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> accent caused him some amusement.</p>

<p>Cooke began what was to become a permanent emigration in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, although his claim for citizenship took over four years to be processed<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. He swore the Oath of Allegiance on 1st December 1941, six days before Pearl Harbor was attacked, and despite the time between his claim and its eventual realisation, it was taken by some in Britain as a type of desertion, a perhaps undeserved stigma that never entirely left him.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Cooke_448a.html" title="Edit section: London Letter, American Letter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">London Letter, American Letter</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after emigrating, Cooke suggested to the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> the idea of doing the <i>London Letter</i> in reverse: a 15-minute talk for British listeners on life in America. A prototype, <i>Mainly About Manhattan</i>, was broadcast intermittently from 1938, but the idea was shelved with the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1939. During the war, he broadcast a weekly <i>American Commentary</i> on the BBC concerning the war.</p>
<p>During this time, as well, Cooke undertook a journey through the whole United States, recording the lifestyle of ordinary Americans during the war – and their reactions to it. The manuscript did not arouse much interest after the war, but it was discovered a few weeks before his death in 2004 and published as <i>The American Home Front: 1941-1942</i> in the United States (and as <i>Alistair Cooke's American Journey: Life on the Home Front in the Second World War</i> in the UK) in 2006.</p>
<p>The first <i>American Letter</i> was broadcast on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> (Cooke said this was at the request of Lindsey Wellington, BBC's New York Controller); the series was initially confirmed for only 13 instalments. The series finally came to an end 58 years (2,869 instalments) later, in March 2004. Along the way, it picked up a new name (changing from <i>American Letter</i> to <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_From_America_f9f0.html" title="Letter From America">Letter From America</a></i> in 1950) and an enormous audience, being broadcast not only in Britain and in many other <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries, but throughout the world by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_World_Service_bff7.html" title="BBC World Service">BBC World Service</a>.</p>
<p>In 1991, Alistair Cooke received a special <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts_be92.html" title="British Academy of Film and Television Arts">BAFTA</a> silver award for his contribution to Anglo-American relations.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Cooke_448a.html" title="Edit section: The Staff Reporter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Staff Reporter</span></h2>
<p>In 1947, Cooke became a foreign correspondent for the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a></i>, for which he wrote until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. (It was, incidentally, the first time he had been employed as a staff reporter; all his previous work had been freelance.) He has also served as foreign correspondent for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>.</p>

<p>In 1968, he was yards away from <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy_5b34.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> when he was assassinated, and was a witness to the events that followed.</p>
<p>In 1971, Cooke became the presenter of the new <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterpiece_Theatre_f35d.html" title="Masterpiece Theatre">Masterpiece Theatre</a></i>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Broadcasting_Service_0dd7.html" title="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</a>'s showcase of quality British television. He remained presenter for another 22 years, retiring from the role in 1992. He was a well-known figure in this role, and was the subject of many parodies, including "<a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_Monster_c348.html" title="Cookie Monster">Alistair Cookie</a>" in <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i>’s "<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsterpiece_Theater_f2f8.html" title="Monsterpiece Theater">Monsterpiece Theater</a>" and, arguably, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Pinth-Garnell_8a1a.html" title="Leonard Pinth-Garnell">Leonard Pinth-Garnell</a> in <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i>’s "Bad Conceptual Theater" etc.</p>
<p>In 1973 Alistair Cooke was awarded an honorary <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knighthood.html" title="Knighthood">knighthood</a> (<a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">KBE</a>). However, he could not be called "Sir Alistair" since he had lost his British nationality during World War II.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Cooke%27s_America_ae16.html" title="Alistair Cooke's America">Alistair Cooke's America</a></i>, a 13-part television series about the United States and its history, was first broadcast in both Britain and the US in 1973, and was followed by a book of the same title. It was a great success in both countries, and resulted in Cooke being invited to address the joint Houses of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> as part of Congress's bicentennial celebrations. Alistair Cooke said that, of all his work, <i>Alistair Cooke's America</i> was what he was most proud of; it is the result and expression of his long love of America. (Cooke was once asked how long it took him to make the series. "I do not want to be coy," he replied, "but it took 40 years.")</p>
<p>For more than 50 years Alistair Cooke lived in a <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent_control.html" title="Rent control">rent controlled</a> apartment in Manhattan, easily outliving several property owners and all fellow-tenants.</p>

<p>Cooke died at midnight on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> at his home in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York City</a>.

<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a></i> reported that bones of Cooke and many other people had been surgically removed before cremation by <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body-snatching.html" title="Body-snatching">bodysnatchers</a> working for a tissue-recovery firm. The thieves allegedly sold the body parts for use in (among other things) dental and bone <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implant_%28medicine%29.html" title="Implant (medicine)">implants</a>. What makes the story even more bizarre is the fact that the cancer that Cooke was suffering from prior to his death had spread to his bones, making them unsuitable for <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_transplant.html" title="Organ transplant">transplant</a> and implant therapies. Reports indicated that records had been falsified by the people involved in selling the body parts, to alter the cause of death and reduce his age from 95 to 85. Soon after, Mr. Timothy O'Brien, the owner of the New York Mortuary, was implicated in involvement of the harvesting of Mr. Cooke's bones. This incident may have been the inspiration for an episode in the first season of the TV show "<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bones_%28TV_series%29_2071.html" title="Bones (TV series)">Bones</a>" in which a young girl develops end-stage bone cancer after receiving an illegally-harvested bone graft.</p>
