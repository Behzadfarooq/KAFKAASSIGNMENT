<p>That's not important enough to be included, Striver. Frankly, Ali comes off better if he's NOT whining about how he was cheated. From my Buddhist POV, it's hard to respect someone who cares that much about STUFF. Or power, or fame. If you want the Shi'a to look good, leave it out. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:06, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I simply do not agree. I belive that one oppresed have full right to express his discontent, and i dont understand how you called an oppresed mans crys for justies as "whining" when "cheated". I whant everything i added to be included. You expresed discontent with my format. Ok, feel free to change in any way it pleases you.

<dd>Of course you have a full right to express your discontent. If you want to go to Hyde Park and whine about oppression, you can do so.

<dd>Zora, im fairly unintrested right now in what or why you have the oppinions regarding Ali reaction to not receiving his inheritance. The thing you are reffering to as "stuff" is their INHERITANCE for gods sake! What if i whent to you, took your fathers inheritance and said i heard it was his last wish, would you think "oh, whadever, its just STUFF"? WHEN did Abu Bakr hear that, he WAS NOT EVEN IN THE CITY when Muhammad (as) died, he was TWO MILES AWAY!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, Ali didnt care for it as stuff, he wanted it to use it for the better of the comunity, instead of using it to butcher Muslims that didnt want to pay zakat to Abu Bakr. As you know, Ali always strover to have nothing for himself and everything in his good deeds account.</dd>

<dd>Zora, in no way is inclusion of that information render the article unredable. Further, the facts are not "shiny thing" that "magpie editors" (i take that as a personal insult) include for personal resons. That is facts that are very relant to Shias, Shia do not hesitate to mention that Ali and Umar had a became what my edits show. Books are writen about Ali and Abu Bakr and the Inheritance, articles in the net has been writen about it. You know it. You try to remove it since you know that it will make Sunni feel bad, but since they can not refute it or say they dont belive in it, you simply try to marginalize it and try to claim it is uninportant or not relevant. It is very relevant. And it will remain there. Persist in removing it by no other motivation that you think it to be irrelevant and i will be forced to seek other meand to have it included, beggining with a RFC. Here you have a example of a article DEDICATED to represent Ali, Abu Bakr and the inheritance <sup><a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/en/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/en/index.php" rel="nofollow">answering-ansar.org</a></sup>, writen in a very prominent Shia site, and here you have a the same topic given a whole chapter in a very prominent Shia Book <sup><a href="http://www.al-islam.org/guided/22.html#2" class="external text" title="http://www.al-islam.org/guided/22.html#2" rel="nofollow">And then i was guided</a></sup>.

So dont claim its uninportant, you KNOW its not since you have been a editor of Islam related articles for a long time. It is Factual. It is Relevant. It is NPOV. It is Well sourced. It is NOT unreadeble. It will remain there, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMOVE IT! --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:37, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Muhammad had a reflective turn of mind and routinely spent nights in a cave (Hira) near Mecca in meditation and thought. Around the year 610, while meditating, Muhammad had a vision of the Angel Gabriel and heard a voice saying to him in rough translation "Read in the name of your Lord the Creator. He created man from something which clings. Read and your Lord is the Most Honored. He taught man with the pen; taught him all that he knew not." (See surat Al-Alaq for a fuller account.)</i></dd>

<dd>In the same manner, you can not remove the parts you removed from the inheritance article and just briefly state that Shias dont like Abu Bakr! THAT was the event that cippled Alis economical resources and any hope of having any authority or power at all! Otherwise, he would have inherited a vast amount of resources though Muhammds daughter!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The facts of the matter must be reported, you can not simply present the Abu Bakr argument that he heard prophets (plural) did not inherit, but not present that Ali countered that the Quran refutes that! That is not a neutral point of view, both arguments must be presented. Further, it is inacurate to claim that Shia <b>POINT</b> to that event as <b>A</b> example of persecution, even if you said that shia CLAIM that Ali BELIVED that Umar and Abu Bakr was a lier, treacherous, sinner and so on, it would STILL be inacurate, since it is regarded as AUTHENTIC by SAHIH MUSLIM! <b>NO ONE</b> disputes the authenticity of that part of the hadith, Umar himself said that those two belive them to be low-lifes, Shia belive it and the second most authentic Sunni source around reports it as AUTHENTIC! I will not settle with NOT presenting Alis view, not even presenting that Shia belived that Ali belived that, no, you just want to replace that with some general line about Shia not liking it!</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<p>Zora delets iformation regarding what Alis thought of Umar and Abu Bakr, as reported in Sunni sources that classified the narration as authentic, and also in prominent Shia collections. Alis oppinion are regarding the subject that the section is about, and his oppinion are further also highly relevant to the biography of Ali. Zora gives the following motivations for doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"you're acting like a conspiracy theorist"</i></li>
<li><i>"we (dont) include every "shiny thing" that magpie editors try to jam into an article"</i></li>
<li><i>"We are trying to create READABLE articles"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>As can easly been seen, the first point ignores that i am citing the most prominent mainstream sources of both Shia and Sunni. That does not make a conspiracy, that makes reporting acknowledged and authenticated facts.</p>
<p>The second point is a pure personal assualt on me, calling me a magpie editors trying to insert non-sense in the article. As is evident, Alis oppinion regarding a pivital event in his life according to the most prominent sources around does not qualifie as legitimate information in Zoras eyes.</p>
<p>The third point... i dont event get what it supposed to mean. Maybe that she does not like me sourcing the informatino in <sup>this</sup> format?</p>
<p><br />
And here is her forth argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Striver, please stop mangling the article"</i></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Dont you love how well she articulates her arguments?</p>
<p><br />
What she <b>DOES NOT</b> manage to do, is to either disprove one of my arguments for insertnig it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a fact that is not disputed</li>
<li>Is is reported in the most prominent books around</li>
<li>Its is NPOV</li>
<li>It is relevant</li>
<li>It needs to be sourced</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Zora, if you delet my editions one more time, without properly addresing my arguments and insiting on giving oppions regarding my person as the only motivatin for deleting Alis oppinions and the sources given, i will take it to the next step, making a RFC.</p>
<p>You started by deleting the whole section. When i asked why, you claimed that my editinos did not have the right prose, they where "hadith dumps". I said ok and let you correct my prose. But you did not only correct my prose, you also deleted, and keep insinting on deleting the relevant and factual informatin that i demand to have represented. That is in violation of WP rules. Stop it.</p>

<p>Well, striver I can only hope that both Sunni and Shi'a point of view will be be reflected in the article. I would just like to point out though that the link ("answering-islam.org/Silas/rf1_mhd_wealth.htm") is from an anti-Islamic site that wants to create conflict between Muslims. The site is also plagued with lies and distortion of the Qur'an so it can make christianity look good. Yes, it is very pathetic and so, I would recommend that the link be deleted and a better one found from a Shi'a site. But remember the article can't simply be the Shi'a perspective - you have to reach middle ground with the Sunni POV.

<dd>Wa aleikom salam Anonymous editor! I dont know exactly who Sunni relate to this topic, they seem to admit the facts, but i dont know how they interpret it. So i just laid out the facts from Shia and Sunnis most prominent sources without commenting on them. However, Zora added a line regarding Shia pov and i did not delet it. I welcome a sunni to also add the sunni pov to that event, since it is lacking as it is. I recall reading a Sunni article basicly saying that "sure, they said harsh stuff, but it dosnt matter, friends say harsh stuff". In any case, my concern in this matter is not so much to have the Shia or Sunni pov included, rather the factual event it self, and having it well sourced.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the answering Islam link, i know its a bad link, but i could not find tabari in any other place online... ill try to search for a alternative tabari quote...--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:49, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not censoring a Shi'a view -- I think any reasonable Shi'a would conclude that I'm keeping Striver from depicting Ali as a mean-spirited, grasping monomaniac. Striver's quote re "Ali didn't give bay'ah" didn't prove what he thought it did. One quote is from an anti-Islamic site. The quote from Ali seems to refer to the caliphate rather than lands or goods. The hadith that Striver cites, so that he can enter a string of epithets directed at the non-Alid caliphs, is actually a Sunni hadith that depicts Ali and Abbas as squabbling over stuff and motivated by greed, and shamed by Umar who contrasts their behavior with that of Muhammad, who kept only what he needed for the bare essentials and gave the rest of his income to the community. The version of the article that I'm championing accurately summarizes the dispute, and is missing only the complaints and the epithets. Does Shi'ism consist of hatred and complaints of persecution? I refuse to believe that it does. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:02, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Bay'ah quote is not concerned in this dispute. The quote is from Tabari, that happens to be on a anti Islamic site. If you manage to find it somewhere else, you are welcomned to quote Tabari from there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I'm keeping Striver from depicting Ali as a mean-spirited, grasping monomaniac" is your pov, not everyones. I for my self dont belive that persisting to receive ones inheritance makes one a "mean-spirited, grasping monomaniac"</i>. - Rather, whitholding somones inheritance might cause one to deserve those titles. However, its is totaly irrelevant, since i dont aim to represent pov of some group, rather the facts of what Ali thought.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The quote from Ali seems to refer to the caliphate rather than lands or goods."</i> must refer to the Nahj al-Balagha quote "I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one went his way but handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after himself." since its the only Ali quote in the section. "I watched the plundering of my inheritance" not refering to inheritance is Zora pov, im sure that manny would agree that i does refer to what it says, inheritance.</dd>

Does Shi'ism consist of hatred and complaints of persecution?"</i> - What you refer to as Your version is simply the deletion of Alis reaction to having his inheritance denied and nothing more. Your version does nothing more that remove all referens to Alis oppinions and also removes the reference given, and as if that was not enough, you also removed his answer/rebutal to Abu Bakrs argument. that is not acceptable --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 22:08, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is Alis answer to Abu Bakr according to <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabari.html" title="Tabari">Tabari</a>. He did not mention vers number:</p>
<p>Fatimah came to Abu Bakr and demanded her share in the inheritance. Al-Abbas came to him and demanded his share in the inheritance. Ali came with them. Thereupon Abu Bakr said, “The Apostle of Allah said, “We leave no inheritance, what we leave behind us is sadaqah.” I shall make provisions for those for whom the Prophet had made.” <b>On this Ali said, “Sulayman (Solomon) inherited Dawud (David), and Zakariya said, ‘He may be my heir and the heir of the children of Yaqab (Zachariah and John the Baptist)’”</b>. Abu Bakr said, “This is as this is. By Allah! You know it as I know.” <b>Thereupon Ali said, “This is the Book of Allah that speaks.”</b> Then they became quiet and retired. (page 393). <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/rf1_mhd_wealth.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/rf1_mhd_wealth.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>But it is the following verses:</p>
<p>[27.16] And Sulaiman was Dawood's heir, and he said: O men! we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given all things; most surely this is manifest grace.</p>
<p>[21.89] And Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord leave me not alone; and Thou art the best of inheritors.</p>
