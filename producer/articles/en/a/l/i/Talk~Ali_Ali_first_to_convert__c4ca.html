<p>Other than the Prophet, of course. Or is this (as might be expected) a controversial point?</p>
<p>Nop, ther is no controversy, it was Ali. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:29, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that there is no controversy. Al Sideeq (Abu Bakr) was the first male convert, it's quite famous. Also, Muawiyah I is the universally accepted fifth Caliph of Islam, not Hassan (by any stretch of the imagination). Rival claimants, like anti-popes, are not universally accepted. Such is the case of Hassan, who did not even seek the office, but is termed Caliph or Imaam by some Shi'a devotees. Similarly, from 929 onwards, the Umayyad Caliphs of Cordoba were not as accepted as the Abbasids of Baghdad, though claiming the title. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>I seriously doubt this claim that Abu Bakr was first or second male convert to Islam. According to Ibn Ishaq, Abu Bakr was around 20th person to accept Islam. Were all previous 20 converts women? I suggest we remove that claim of being first convert. It's clearly disputed in some sources <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 19:36, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to Ibn Ishaq (per Guillaume's translation) "'Ali was the first male to believe in the apostle ... he was a boy of ten ... Zayd the freedman of the apostle was the first male to accept Islam after 'Ali. Then Abu Bakr ... ". There is a hadith in which Sa'd ibn Abu Waqqas claims to have been one-third of Islam for a while (but it does not name the other two). Kleinecke</dd>

<p><br />
First Converts to Islam (consensus knowledge among both Sunni &amp; Shia scholars): 1) First women convert = Khadija w/o Prophet. Then the only wife of Prophet. 2) First child convert = Ali ibn Abi Talib. He lived under Prophet's guardianship. 3) First male adult convert = Abu Bakr Al Sideeq. Prophet's closest friend. These converts were also in the order as mentioned above. I am not sure if these were the first 3 converts.</p>

<p><b><i>Statement of Ali being the first male to convert is disputed. NOTE: This was not stated in the reverted version made by Striver.</i></b></p>
<p>Ibn Ishaq gives two stories, one putting Abu Bakr first and one putting Ali first. Since none of these traditions were written down until Abbasid times, it is really IMPOSSIBLE to decide which story is true. That's why "one of the first" is accurate -- it doesn't decide on priority. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:21, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aside the fact that you are incorrect (and I dont have time to teach you why), the point is that at least a statement should be mentioned that <i>the Shi'as believe it to be true</i>. Your suppression of this amounts to suppression of the Shia view, which is unacceptable.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 03:29, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Acctualy, if there is no way to establish it, it should go to the "Shia view" article. However, <b>SOME</b> Sunnis agree that he was the first male, no matter the facts. Further, the ibn Ishaq version needs to be looked at in detail. For example, if one is about the famouse dinner hadith, and the other simply states that Abu Bakr was fisrt grown up, then that would put Ali as first male, no conflict. However, that needs to be looked at to determine. Conclusion: Ibn Ishaq having two versions does not <b>necesarily</b> mean a contradiction. In either case, i repeat: THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VERSION MY VERSION! If no further points are raised, then please revert back to my version. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 03:36, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is <b>unanimously</b> agreed by both Sunni and Shia that Ali was first. What Zora is pushing as fact is a view in overwhelming minority, pushed by some malicious modern Sunni revisionists. There are 4 lines of evidence that Islamic scholars both Sunni and Shia have given to prove Ali was first. There are literally hundreds of sources supporting it. In fact, Ali himself says that he was first, in one of his sermons where he says: انا عبد الله و اخو رسول الله‏و انا الصديق الاكبر، لا يقولها بعدي الا كاذب مفتري ولقد صليت مع رسول الله قبل الناس بسبع سنين و انا اول من صلى معه‏</dd>

<dd>Nasr ultimate source? Zereshk, that is SO wrong. I just checked -- of the fifteen academic works I have that MIGHT mention Nasr (as in, they were published after he started publishing), fourteen have NO mention of Nasr whatsover. Not in bibliography, not in index. Just one book, Esposito's <i>Encyclopedia of Islam</i>, mentions him on page 297, as a Persian philosopher. He's just one of a list of dozens of names of current Islamic thinkers. He may be recognized as a philosopher of sorts, but he is certainly nonexistent as far as historians are concerned.</dd>

<dd>Of course Shi'a thinkers would support this claim. Of course Ali would advance this claim. Your hadith (untranslated, unsourced) may or may not be useful evidence. If you cite in a language other than English, do you really expect to "win" on the grounds that you can read it and I can't? Ibn Ishaq dates from the early Abbasid period when both history and hadith were first being written down; if he gives two stories, then it's to be expected that there would be a number of hadith supporting BOTH stories. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:21, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, a press release advertising a lecture proves anything?

Sorry, rep in the field is usually proved by citation indexes, not by press releases.</p>

<p>Ali was the first to convert. No ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>In addition to Ali having stated it himself in his own Nahj-ul Balaghah, and <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasr.html" title="Nasr">Nasr</a> (which Zora amusingly dismisses as unrelaible), it is even stated by <i>Zora's own references</i>:</p>
<p>It is clealrly stated by <b>Ibn Ishaq</b> in p114 where he says: "Ali was the first male to beleive in the apostle of God, to pray with him, and to beleive his deivine message..." This is given in p153 of <i>Muhammad and the Origins of Islam</i> by Peters, F. E, 1994.</p>

" You shall inform my nation about the truth and what they dispute after me": Sunni reference:</p>
<p>al-Mustadrak, by al-Hakim, v3, p112, who wrote this is an authentic Hadith according to the stipulation of the two Shaikhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim). [This would mean that the chain of narrators are considered to be authentic as stipulated by Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p><br />
al-Hakim also narrated that:</p>
<p>Salman al-Farsi said that the Messenger of God said: "The first one of you to drink from the Basin on the Day of Judgment is your first Muslim, Ali, the son of Abu Talib." Sunni reference: al-Mustadrak, by al-Hakim, v3, p112</p>
<p><br />
Ibn Hisham recorded that:</p>
<p>Ali Ibn Abi Talib was the first male to believe in the Messenger of God and that he prayed with him while he was only ten years old. Sunni reference: Biography of the Prophet, by Ibn Hisham, v1, p245</p>
<p><br />
The famous Sunni Historian, al-Tabari also wrote:</p>
<p>The first three to offer prayers were Muhammad (PBUH&amp;HF) , Khadija and Ali (AS). Sunni reference: History al-Tabari, v2, p65</p>
<p><br />
Also Khateeb al-Baghdadi, in his book quotes Imam Ali that:</p>
<p>Ali said: "I was the first one to accept Islam at the hands of the Holy Prophet." Tarikh, by al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi, v4, p333</p>
<p><br />
Despite overwhelming evidence, Zora still refuses to give up. And I just used resources at my personal disposal.

<li>The Sunni reference <i>al-Mustadrak</i>, by al-Hakim, v3, p112, says it.</li>
<li>The Sunni <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hisham_f7c9.html" title="Ibn Hisham">Ibn Hisham</a> records it: Vol1, p245</li>
<li>The Sunni <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabari.html" title="Tabari">Tabari</a> says it: Tarikh al-Tabari, v2, p65</li>
<li>The Sunni Khateeb al-Baghdadi says it, in: Tarikh, by al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi, v4, p333</li>
<li>Ali says it himself in his own Nahj-ul Balaghah in 3 places.</li>
<li>There is a whole bunch of other hadith that I can provide from the Shia side. But the aforementioned shouyld suffice.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if needed, I can continue quoting more academic books again and again and again and again and again, until the page overflows with references.</p>
<p>So this is clearly not a mere Shia argument.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 23:04, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b><i>Conclusion of argument irrelevant for reversal to previous version.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>It is has been proven that Ali was the first male in Islam.</i></b></p>
