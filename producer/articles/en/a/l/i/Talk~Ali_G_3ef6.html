<p>On what evidence are you basing your assertion that Ali G is supposed to be of Pakistani extraction? I've never seen such evidence. The name "Ali" is not proof enough. I'm not sure what color Ali G is supposed to be, but I doubt very much Cohen has ever said explicitly that he is meant to be Pakistani. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 00:22, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most reports I've seen say Cohen is Jew pretending to be a white guy pretending to be black. I've always thought he was mocking middle class white boys, not Asians. The article should be changed, perhaps it could be mentioned that some feel he is mocking asian homeboys instead.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 05:10, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I alwats though the name "Ali" was the bit that made him Asian. And nothern English cities are chock full of Asians who look and act just like Ali. But I recall now that his full name is Alistair Leslie Graham -- a WASP name if ever there was one. So I stand corrected, and thank you for checking me. MichiganDan 03:50, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>How does Ali make him seem Asian? As he says, "Is it cuz I is black?" In the US, hip-hop culture is influenced by Islam, or rather by the Nation of Islam and its offshoots. The name Ali is part of the parody of the white English guy who thinks he is/wants to be an urban black American.</p>
<p>Re: today's edit. I want to say that I thoroughly disagree that Ali G is meant to be Asian in any way. I think the joke works best because his full name is actually Alistair and he is in fact a white guy from Staines. I think any "reading" that imputes that Ali G is in fact meant to be Asian is a projection on the part of the person doing that assuming. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 09:41, Jan 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFAIK it has been admitted that the choice of the name Ali was deliberate, and intended to make people wonder if he might be a Muslim. The point of this was to discourage interviewees suspicious about whether he was genuine to challenge him, as it might be taken as religious bigotry to say "this guy can't be real" if he was a Muslim. As for race, it's pretty clear he's not Asian from the colour of his skin—the humour lies in the way he says things like "Is it because I is black?" when he obviously isn't. This parodies the sort of people who might be referred to as <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigger.html" title="Wigger">wiggers</a>. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 13:50, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cannot understand for the life of me why one editor of this page believes, despite Ali G's full having been revealed as being traditionally English; despite his creators intentionally having him live on "Cherry Blossom Close" in Staines; despite all of the indications that he is meant to be entirely a poseur and not in fact anything but English.... despite all of this, why one user insists that he is in fact Asian or Middle Eastern. The very point of him is that he isn't. This is not an "American" reading. This is just the obvious conclusion of the clues his creators have developed. Moreover, you will have to explain why you think that Arab and Asians in the UK have more in common with African Americans than blacks in the UK do. This seems a wild assumption to me; if you want to argue it, explain why you think it's true. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 20:02, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well his name might have been revealed to be Alistair but his uncle’s remains Jamal. It’s surely deliberately ambiguous. I’ve seen white and Asian Alis and the joke works the same whichever is the target: neither have much in common with African Americans. Bombot 14:35, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And I have Armenian relatives - I'm still as white as they come. Uncles' names are not his name, and so don't mean squat. Ali is a more "street friendly" form of Alistair - nothing more, nothing less. He does, however, mention the Asian adoption of such "street" culture in the character <i>Hassan B</i>, his arch-nemesis and leader of the East Staines Massive.

<p>For one thing,it's make believe and two, I think he does both, when its convienent to be British, thats what he is, when he wants to be Asian, thats what he is.it depends on what Sasha Cohen wants.</p>

<p>The line "Sacha Baron Cohen is not black himself, but because he portrays a character who purports misogyny, he has been accused by some of racism and of ridiculing black street culture." would seem to be accusing black men of being generally mysogenistic.

<p>The use of the word English in this sentence has been incorrectly used, if you are referring to white boys in the United Kingdom you should use the term 'British', as it is NOT only English boys who immitate black people. I find the fact that you have solely implicated in the article that it is only English boys who display this behaviour as in fact, RACIST! Please change this word to British because Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish white boys also immitate black people and can also be chavs, or in Scotland, Neds. Do not single out English peopel because they are the majority race in the United Kingdom because it si not fair and it IS a form of racism. <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETammiMagee_2d02.html" title="User:TammiMagee">TammiMagee</a> 10:00, 7 September 2006 (UTC)Tammi</p>

<dd>Exactly. To talk about all the white British kids, use the term "white British kids", as nothing else is even approaching accurate. As Scottish, Welsh, English, Irish and even the French are all genetically identical, it can't be racism. As <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopGear_fd23.html" title="User:TopGear">TopGear</a> said, they're nationalities, not races. Dave420 15:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Actually, i work for the racial equality council and nationalities ARE included in the Race Relation Acts, so therefore, it IS possible for someone to be racist against a nationality.<a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETammiMagee_2d02.html" title="User:TammiMagee">TammiMagee</a> 14:50, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tammi, while this could definitely be the case (As an American, I'm not familiar with the Race Relations Act), I think it is more appropriate to say "bigoted", "discriminatory", "intolerant" or "biased" when referring to nationality... whereas "racism" should generally refer to race, although it can be attributed to ethnicity in certain circumstances. It's all a matter of terminology though. Apart from this, I generally agree with your statement. The generalization that only "English boys" are imitating hip-hop and street culture is pretty ridiculous, because I live in rural <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth%2C_New_Hampshire_fc9e.html" title="Plymouth, New Hampshire">Plymouth, New Hampshire</a> and such behavior exists here as well. But Ali G is clearly lampooning the suburban British <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigger.html" title="Wigger">wannabe-gangster</a>, and his character is primarily English with a few hints at a possible Jamaican background. So when concerning his character, I think it's fine to use both <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_people.html" title="British people">British</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a> labels... but when referring to the kids he lampoons I would suggest "British" as the best term... since such behavior is not exclusive to England, Wales or Scotland. That's just my 2 cents. -<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrezboy1_6ff2.html" title="User:Prezboy1">Prezboy1</a> 15:03, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the claim that the Ali G name was supposed to have a "whiff of Islam" at the same time as the character has black american influences... would that be a reference to Malcolm X&#160;? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:30, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I doubt it&#160;:) If it was to have a whiff islam, Ali would be a surname, not a first name. As it is, Ali G's real name is Alistair, and his surname begins with a G. Dave420 15:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
