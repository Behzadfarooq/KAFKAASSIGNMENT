<p>well, that is your statement, not the articles. The articles simply states that Simon Ockley held that view, nothing else. No, as for your comment, please prove that by refering to three western scholar that:</p>

<p>I edited Brandon's version even further. I removed all but one of the fulsome quotes. This is just not encyclopedic. There seems to be a belief in some quarters that if the quotes are from Western scholars, I won't oppose them. Not so. It's a question of balance. This article is to give neutral information about Ali; it is not intended to praise Ali, or to convert people to Shi'a Islam. The claims re "born in the Kaaba" are better treated in the "Shi'a view" section. The hundred-year-old quote was deleted, because it doesn't prove a #$%@$# thing. I have seen enough shoddy hundred-year-old scholarship while proofreading for Distributed Proofreaders that I do not consider an old quote from J. Random Scholar as proving anything (unless it's a primary source, which this quote is certainly NOT). <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:47, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is neither biased nor un-neutral to claim that manny western scholars praised him to the heavens. What is unbalanced about that information?

<dd>Because he isn't. You're cherry-picking quotes. The academic material I read is neutral vis-a-vis Ali. Even Madelung, who often takes the Shi'a viewpoint, does not praise Ali to the heavens. As for the older Western scholars -- Madelung regards them as generally prejudiced against Ali. Lammens, he says, describes Ali as "dull-witted and incapable". I am darn sure that I've read more academic material than you have and I regard those quotes as serious misrepresentations of the academic viewpoint. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:15, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ibn Ishaq gives two stories, one putting Abu Bakr first and one putting Ali first.

<dd>Acctualy, if there is no way to establish it, it should go to the "Shia view" article. However, <b>SOME</b> Sunnis agree that he was the first male, no matter the facts. Further, the ibn Ishaq version needs to be looked at in detail. For example, if one is about the famouse dinner hadith, and the other simply states that Abu Bakr was fisrt grown up, then that would put Ali as first male, no conflict. However, that needs to be looked at to determine. Conclusion: Ibn Ishaq having two versions does not <b>necesarily</b> mean a contradiction. In either case, i repeat: THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VERSION MY VERSION!

<dd>It is <b>unanimously</b> agreed by both Sunni and Shia that Ali was first. What Zora is pushing as fact is a view in overwhelming minority, pushed by some malicious modern Sunni revisionists. There are 4 lines of evidence that Islamic scholars both Sunni and Shia have given to prove Ali was first. There are literally hundreds of sources supporting it. In fact, Ali himself says that he was first, in one of his sermons where he says: انا عبد الله و اخو رسول الله‏و انا الصديق الاكبر، لا يقولها بعدي الا كاذب مفتري ولقد صليت مع رسول الله قبل الناس بسبع سنين و انا اول من صلى معه‏</dd>

<dd>Nasr ultimate source? Zereshk, that is SO wrong. I just checked -- of the fifteen academic works I have that MIGHT mention Nasr (as in, they were published after he started publishing), fourteen have NO mention of Nasr whatsover. Not in bibliography, not in index. Just one book, Esposito's <i>Encyclopedia of Islam</i>, mentions him on page 297, as a Persian philosopher. He's just one of a list of dozens of names of current Islamic thinkers. He may be recognized as a philosopher of sorts, but he is certainly nonexistent as far as historians are concerned.</dd>

<dd>Of course Shi'a thinkers would support this claim. Of course Ali would advance this claim. Your hadith (untranslated, unsourced) may or may not be useful evidence. If you cite in a language other than English, do you really expect to "win" on the grounds that you can read it and I can't? Ibn Ishaq dates from the early Abbasid period when both history and hadith were first being written down; if he gives two stories, then it's to be expected that there would be a number of hadith supporting BOTH stories. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:21, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ibn Ishaq in p114 clearly says it. And he is considered by <b>western academics</b> as one of the safest reporters. I can quote, if needed.</li>

<li><a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasr.html" title="Nasr">Nasr</a> asys it in <i>Expectation of the Millennium: Shi'ism in History</i>.</li>

<li>Betty Kelen says it in <i>Muhammad: The Messenger of God</i>.</li>
<li>The Sunni reference <i>al-Mustadrak</i>, by al-Hakim, v3, p112, says it.</li>
<li>The Sunni <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hisham_f7c9.html" title="Ibn Hisham">Ibn Hisham</a> records it: Vol1, p245</li>

<li>Ali says it himself in his own Nahj-ul Balaghah in 3 places.</li>
<li>There is a whole bunch of other hadith that I can provide from the Shia side. But the aforementioned shouyld suffice.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if needed, I can continue quoting more academic books again and again and again and again and again, until the page overflows with references.</p>

The Quran Compiled by Imam Ali (AS)</p>
<p>There is no dispute among Muslim scholars, whether they are Sunni or Shia, concerning the fact that the Commander of Believers, Ali (AS), possessed a special transcript of the text of Quran which he had collected himself, and he was THE FIRST who compiled Quran. There are a great number of traditions from Sunni and Shia which states that after the death of the Holy Prophet (PBUH&amp;HF), Imam Ali sat down in his house and said that he had sworn an oath that he would not put on his outdoor clothes or leave his house until he collects together the Quran.</p>

The accuracy of the article was challenged, and in the above separate sections i defended the balance and accuracy of my article. Regarding the Kaaba, it says:</p>

<dl>
<dd>Now here's my question for you -- so many of these conflict-heavy discussions with other editors break down to this repetition of Shia vs. Sunni beliefs. Is that dichotomy absolutely essential? Are we quite sure we wouldn't be serving the article better -- and preventing future revert wars -- with something like the following?</dd>

<dd>So far as I know, there are no EARLY traditions claiming Ali's birth in the Kaaba. The earliest written texts we have re Islamic history say nothing about this. It seems to me that if it had happened, it would have been noted by authors such as Ibn Ishaq and Tabari. The tradition seems to be a late invention. Therefore I object strongly to BYT's proposed compromise. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, i take that back. First fo all, there are no traditions of him being born elsewhere, second, nobody refutes him being born there. "Some traditions relate" imply that others relate a alternative version and "this view is not unanimous" implies that somebody refutes it or does not accept it.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Zora</span></h4>
<p>Striver, they aren't keeping quiet about it. It's too silly to refute. Anyhow, here's one Sunni site that claims Ali was born in his father's house, as one might expect: <a href="http://www.yazehra.com/fatimabint.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yazehra.com/fatimabint.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</p>
<p>You're operating from the assumption that any claim is true unless refuted. OK, I claim that I can levitate. Nobody has refuted that. Therefore I levitate. Hmmmm? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:58, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What are you talking about? This is YET another case where you see things you want to see, like demanding archealogical evidence for people pasing by a pond. Have you even read what you linked to?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is an <b>undisputed</b> historical fact recognized by all historians that the Holy Ka'bah is the birthplace of Ali bin Abi Talib (A.S).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>All traditions and historians are unanimous in saying he was born in Kaaba. You calim they are wrong, the burden of proof is upon you to prove them wrong, they have the evidence in their history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "It's too silly to refute", we still have one direct quote from a admited western historian that agrees to it- Yet again, Zora pov strikes! Zora, pleace, i beg you, stop with your orginal research! Give us sources, not random oppinions!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All you have presented is that <b>you have have not read a modern historian give a opinion about it.</b> That means absolutely nothing. For all we know, there can be plenty of modern scholars agreeing to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if not a single modern scholar mentions it, it means just that, nothing more, nothing less, any interpretation of their silence is up to the reader to decide not you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>You</b> not reading about it does not mean that they belive its a fable. <b>It only means that YOU have not read about it</b>. It being a fable is a assumption from your part, original research, and has no value what so ever to WP. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:27, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Regarding:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Some medieval Muslim traditions relate that he was born inside the Kaaba, the most sacred site in Islam, although this is not accepted by any contemporary academic historians.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Some" is false, it "All".</li>
<li>"medieval" is missleading, as it gives the impression that earlier traditions do not. Zora claims no early traditions recount it, but its her oppinion and that has no weight in WP</li>
<li>"not accepted" is false, no one claims it to be false, we only know that those Zora read do not mention it. Nothing more, "Not accept" is Zora pov presented as facts.</li>
<li>"any" is false, she has not presented proof of that, not even proof of "manny". And we all know how accurate Zora can be, i can right away show tree occasions where where Zora has accused Sunni sites of being Shia sites.</li>
<li>Further, it is biased to Zora pov to not mention the one AND SINGLE quote we have from western scholars regarding the matter, the one explicitly saying he was born in it.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Zora, im starting to get enough of your non-sens. Persist and we will have someone someone decide whom of us is not using due prosses, logic and sourcing. I have warned you before, DO NOT PERSIST IN YOU UNSOURCED ZORA POV PUSHING!</p>

<p>I reply:</p>
<p><br />
<b>First</b> of all, al four are both POV and inaccurate, none of the have WP standard and would be slaped with a {{TotallyDisputed}} tag i no time and warrant a total and complete rewrite. None of them are acceptable ny any means:</p>
<p>This is POV:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>With the death of Muhammad in 632, the Muslim community was for a short period without a leader, and without clear indications on how to chose the new leader</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
And this is inaccurate:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 658, Ali gave in to Mu'awiyya's criticism, and established an investigation committee.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>More Inaccuracy:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For most groups of Shi'is, the hope of a just ruling elite inside Islam, i.e. a just Islam on earth, disappeared after this.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Read: <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahdi.html" title="Mahdi">Mahdi</a></p>
<p>And that is only found in <a href="http://i-cias.com/e.o/ali.htm" class="external text" title="http://i-cias.com/e.o/ali.htm" rel="nofollow">one</a> of the four articles.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Second</b>, they omitt information between themselves, they cant even agree as to what is relvant. Considering that, it is uterly non-sense to evalate if something is encyclopedic by seeing if they have included it or not.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Thirdly</b>, our article have already information not included in any of them:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ali was also prominent on the battlefield of Uhud. He is said to have received seventeen wounds in the battle.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>"Will you not be pleased that you will be to me like Aaron to Moses? But there will be no prophet after me."</i></dd>

</dl>
<p><br />
Now, after having <b>refuted</b> what you sugestion of consult those sources:</p>
<p><br />
I take your sugestion as a way of diverting the issue, something not very uppright. I now that you did not mean anything bad.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">100% sunni</span></h4>
<p>Then, as to <b>prove the contrary</b>, i quote witness-pioneer.org, a <i><b>100% sunni</b></i> site:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Birth of Ali</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ali was born under unusual circumstances. On the thirteenth of the holy month of "Rajab", Fatima, the mother of Ali, visited the Kaaba for performing the pilgrimage. During the course of the pilgrimage while circumambulating the Kaaba, Fatima felt the pangs of childbirth. She retired to a secluded place in the precincts of the Holy Kaaba, and there Ali was born. <b>Ali had thus the unique honor of being born in the House of God.</b> This unparalleled honor has endowed Ali with a halo of sanctity, which has become the subject of many legends. A hundred years later, Zain-ul-Abidin a grandson of Ali (son of Husain) met as Arab woman at Najaf who told him that her grandmother had helped on the occasion of the birth of Ali. She narrated that according to the account of her grandmother, the child was beautiful, a smile played on his lips, it did not cry like other children, and its birth did not cause any pain to his mother.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Name</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fatima wanted to name the child "Asad" after the name of her father. Abu Talib wanted to name him Zaid. When the mother and the child came home, the Holy Prophet, and Khadija came to see the newborn child. Since his birth, the child had not opened his eyes, and that worried Fatima and Abu Talib. As the Holy Prophet took the child in his lap he opened his eyes. The first person that Ali saw after his birth was the Holy Prophet. When the Holy Prophet was asked whether he approved of the child being named as Asad or Zaid, he said that <b>as the child was born in the House of God, he should be named Ali, the word Ali being a derivative of Allah.</b> Ali had thus the distinction of being named after Allah. No person before him had ever been so named. The name acquired further sanctity as it was proposed by the Holy Prophet.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
So, having that said: <b>i repeat my question</b>:</p>

<p>I believe this is a Sunni source, regarding the birth of Imam Ali in the Holy Ka'ba:</p>
<p>Hakim in his Mustadrak and nuru'd-din Bin Sabbagh maliki in his Fusulu'l-Muhimma, Fasl 1, p.14, say: "No one before Ali was born in the Ka'ba. This was a distinction given to Ali in order to enhance his honor, rank, and dignity."</p>

<p>Ali is quoting from Peshawar Nights, Persian forgery, see this refutation <a href="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/beshawer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/beshawer.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. A quote from this refutation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Books besides the Sahihayn are all subject to scrutiny of their isnads to determine to what extent they conform to the criteria of authenticity. There never has been a claim, neither by the authors of these works, nor by anyone else, that these works incorporate exclusively authentic material. Muhaddithin like al-Hakim, the author of al-Mustadrak, and Ibn Hibban, the author of at-Taqasim wal-Anwa‘ (commonly known as Sahih Ibn Hibban), have attempted to follow the example of al-Bukhari and Muslim by documenting only authentic ahadith, but their criteria, as well as the extent to which they abided by those criteria left a lot to be desired, and consequently came under censure from later muhaddithin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indiscriminate quoting from these works would therefore only occur if a person suffers from one of two defects: ignorance of the science of hadith; or a Machiavellian attitude of the end—-in this case the conversion of the Ahl as-Sunnah—-justifying the means. Either of these defects is sufficient to disqualify anyone as an objective polemicist."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not that I accept hadith, or the science of hadith, as authoritative unless accepted by those academic historians who study them (which is not all historians). Accepting 12th century evaluations of tradition is like accepting 12th century science or medicine: pointless and retrograde. Still, quoting da'eef hadith doesn't prove a thing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:50, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is narrated that:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&amp;HF) said: "He who wants to see Noah (AS) in his determination, Adam (AS) in his knowledge, Abraham (AS) in his clemency, Moses (AS) in his intelligence and Jesus (AS) in his religious devotion should look at Ali Ibn Abi Talib (AS)." Sunni references:</p>
<p>Sahih al-Bayhaqi Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, as quoted in Sharh Ibn Abil Hadid, v2, p449 Tafsir al-Kabir, by Fakhruddin al-Razi, under the commentary of the Verse of Imprecation (Mubahilah), v2 p288. He wrote this tradition has been accepted as all genuine. Ibn Batah has recorded it as a tradition related by Ibn Abbas as is stated in the book "Fat'h al-Mulk al-Ali bi Sihah Hadith-e-Bab-e-Madinat al-Ilm", p34, by Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Siddeeq al-Hasani al-Maghribi. Among those who have admitted that Imam Ali (AS) is the store house of the secrets of all the Prophets is the Chief of Gnostics, Muhyiddin al-Arabi, from whom al-Arif al-Sha'rani has copied it in his al-Yawaqeet wa al-Jawahir (p172, topic 32).</p>

<p>Dear brother in Islam. Peace.</p>
<p>I did not write that in thoughtless anger, nor in a state of furor. I made that statement to Zora as a informative gesture, so she knows my intentions explicitly. I made an effort to show her my determination in doing so, and i belive it was a fair warning. She <b>WILL</b> get a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RFC</a> on her neck the same instance she reverts any information with regards to "Ali being born in the Kaaba" without proving her case on the talk page - And she <b>knows</b> she has <b>proven</b> absolutely nothing. No reference, no quotes no nothing, only PURE oppinions.</p>
<p>I see no other alternative than threatening her with a RFC. She stubbornly refuses to give any sourceing of any kind, but still persist in editing in violation of given proof to the opposite. She persist in confusing her own personal conclusion with giving sourced statement; personal conclusions do not have a value what so ever to WP, but she refuses to recognize that and blatantly ignores due process. I will not tolerate any more of that and are prepare to go all the way to the <b><a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a></b> if necessary.</p>

<p>You missunderstand me. I do not want to file it, i hope it wont be necesary, i hope that the mere threat of it will make her alert enough to understand that she is acting on mere opinions. As for you, i have no quarell with you, you dont revert blind and you dont persist in her stuborn way. It does look like she has stoped givin pure opinions, so the threat did do what it was intendet to do. Lets hope it will be a permanent change in her attitudes.

<p>Tabari, that is NOT a book published by a contemporary academic historian. It seems to be a self-published book, available as POD (print-on-demand) or downloadable as a PDF.

I did not object since i wanted to make a thorough argumentation about your objection, and now we have done that. <b>Stop playing</b>, do you want me to bring a copy of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Drawing_board_4cbc.html" title="Talk:Ali/Drawing board">Talk:Ali/Drawing board</a> to here? Just look at it and say if you have any problems with it. As is now, you are refusing it with no arguments whatsoever, except that i wrote some of it. <b>Friend</b>, you know very well that me writing it is not a argument for refusing it. if you have any reason for not letting me change to it, state it, so we can work through it. <b>This is as cooperative as i can get</b>. I have not even changed the article, <b>only talked</b> about you omitting and deleting my article <b>for like 3 days now! Is this the kind of response i get?</b> What more issues do you have with <a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Drawing_board_4cbc.html" title="Talk:Ali/Drawing board">Talk:Ali/Drawing board</a>? Look at the first line, that is my first suggested change. If that line is ok, then look at the second line. If that line is ok, look at the fourth line. Repeat that until you come to a objection to it, or you reach the end of the article. Then tell me what you concluded. <i>I am getting really tired of doing childish reponses like this one, this is below our level!</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ali as member of the ulema? Not!</span></h2>
<p>Striver, please stop inserting the "academic line" bit in the Ali article. I have a suspicion that this is all part of a plan to link the Shi'a ulema directly to Ali and Muhammad, through an unbroken line of scholarly transmission, and it just won't do. Ali was not a scholar, he was not a member of the ulema. The ulema as an institution evolved slowly over the course of the Umayyad dynasty, instead of springing full-blown from the head of Muhammad, as Athena is said to have sprung from Zeus. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
