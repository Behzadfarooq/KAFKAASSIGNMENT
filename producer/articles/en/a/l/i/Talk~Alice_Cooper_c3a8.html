<dd>Yes, the <i>name</i> is French but no more than 3% of his ancestry is French. He is over 90% British (Irish/Welsh/English). His French Huguenot Fourniers settled in Maryland before the Revolution and once here, did not marry into other French families. They may have been in London before their arrival on these shores but being Protestant, certainly never touched foot in Quebec or New Orleans. <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuestors_0a08.html" title="User:Questors">Questors</a> 04:29, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

 "Cooper has still not been inducted - on balance, unjustifiably, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."

<p>I am a huge fan of Alice Cooper - I agree that he should be inducted. In spite of this, my opinion is that this fails to be NPOV.</p>

<p>Of Course he needs to be inducted. He is not only one of the moist influential rockers of all time, He stage shows introduced a new side to Rock Concerts</p>

<p>Thanks to Redwolf24 for asking about the photograph. The one that is currently shown is fairly current (only a year or two old, I'd guess) but it really doesn't capture much about Cooper. I'd either go with a current one that is more engaging, or with a classic mid-70's image that captures him at his commercial peak.

<p>I have taken the liberty of correcting the "2000's" article to mention the completion of the "Brutal Planet" and "Dragontown" trilogy with the release of "Dirty Diamonds" earlier this month (August 2nd).</p>
<p>Dirty Diamonds has nothing to do with Brutal Planet or Dragontown. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilCheeseWedge_e504.html" title="User:EvilCheeseWedge">EvilCheeseWedge</a> 19:21, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, whoops. Sorry. I just assumed since it's the latest since Dragontown it was the completion of the trilogy. --SWFan00 17:07, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where did you find this stuff about "The Last Temptation" not being part of the trilogy? I've seen a lot of web pages, and even a Rolling Stone article, that say it is the first part of the threesome. --Alex, not a registered user 10:45 PM December 11, 2005 (Maryland's time zone, whatever that is)</p>
<p>Response to above comment: I believe the whole idea of "The Last Temptation" being the beginning of a trilogy actually came from a goofed up Press Release by Eagle Records when "Brutal Planet" was released. Besides, after "Dragontown" came out, there was some mention that a "Third album in the trilogy" was being planned. But of course that hasn't happened yet obviously.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAlice_Cooper_c3a8.html" title="Edit section: Influence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence</span></h2>
<p>Many of the bands cited as being influenced by Cooper are about the same age as him, which makes it a bit fishy. Maybe add the Beatles, Stones, Zep, Sabbath, Floyd and Madonna too to the list of his fans? I mean c'mon, KISS, UFO, Priest and Maiden Cooper fans? I don't have anything against him, but when those bands came out he was still pishing in diapers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAlice_Cooper_c3a8.html" title="Edit section: Response">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Response</span></h2>
<p>That argument falls down when you consider artists and bands can be influenced by their peers. Lennon was influenced by Dylan and vice versa.</p>
<p>Most of Kiss, UFO, Priest and Maiden are younger than Alice so The Coop was hardly pissing in dipers when they came around.</p>
<p>Kiss though musically not in the same league as Cooper got the idea of theatrics from the master who in turn was influenced by Arthur Brown visually and The Doors and Yardbirds musically but what makes the Coop original is he fused the influences and also came up with something new. Something Madonna didn't do when she tried the electric chair.</p>
<p>The bands that came later that were really influenced by him were Guns n Roses and that whole LA Scene of the 1980's</p>

<p>I heard somewhere Alice Cooper became a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Born-again.html" title="Born-again">born-again</a> Christian, but haven't verified it. I couldn've swore it was on Wikipedia but it isn't on here anymore. I do know that he's a member of Solid Rock (or its chair or something) and that he <em>is</em> indeed a Christian (verified by the interview at the bottom), but I specifically heard "born-again". Maybe I'll Google it. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinneyboy90_f313.html" title="User:Kinneyboy90"><font color="blue">Эрон</font> <font color="red">Кинней</font></a> 10:54, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't the article tell about Alice Cooper convertion to Born Again Christianity. I know he don't like to be a poster boy for born again Christianity because he want people to see Jesus and not him, but when Alice is a eageer born again Christian isn't it important that an article about him mentions the most importen thing in his life? 17.

<p>Before the "Sn0wflake" yokel goes and reverts a revert, I'll take the time to point out that: (a) if linking a word in an article is "vandalism", then please tell me _right now_, with direct references to official wikipedia policy, and I'll never, ever, link again -- otherwise, I say this "Sn0wflake" dude owes me an apology (which he can place on my talk page in suitable typeface) for a baseless accusation, and (b) the reason why I link to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chicken</a> is that, despite the unfortunate consequences to the chicken, the link adds to the general hilarity of the story related in the paragraph. Anyone who has watched the famous episode "Turkey's Away" on the old <a href="../../../w/k/r/WKRP_6852.html" title="WKRP">WKRP</a> series knows what I am talking about. Indeed, the similarity makes one wonder about provenance of the WKRP joke... <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 22:34, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>cleaned up a few wiki-links in the article(or tried too) Some had been sitting 'in the red' for quite some time. Until someone actually takes the next step and creates a proper bio for the individual, there's no sense in having a link for them. Also tried to have just 1 wiki-link per person. How many wiki-links does Dick Wagner actually need? He;s listed(with a link) in the main article. I removed the link in the year-by-year listings. Having second thoughts on that one though. Anybody else think it should be put back? Feel free if there's a valid reason for it.

<p>I checked the Alice Cooper website, and I didn't see anything about Alice being one of Dylan's "favorite" songwriters. It says Dylan said, "I think Alice Cooper is an overlooked songwriter." I'm changing it.</p>

<p>Hi, new here. I,ve noticed no mention of early ACG venue's except the Hollywood location. I don't know how to edit the main article right now, so if someone wants to post the info, they can. I grew up in a Detroit suburb and have a wealth of info on many of the area's local one hit wonders to mega-stars since I used to sell instruments and accessories at a large music store in the area at the time. Many DSO musicians, as well as Motown, and local artists along with major stars would visit when in the area. The ACG came into our store before "I'm Eighteen" launced their careers. They were playing local venue's getting their "act" together. I was invited to see their concert/show at Aquinas High School, in Southgate, Mi. They played there a few times as well as the "Chatter Box" and other small venue's including the Michigan State Fair. Their show opened when the lights went down and Neal Smith and Dennis Dunaway took their places to start "Sun Arise" as their lighting tech Charlie would manipulate the lights in time with the beat. As Buxton, Bruce and Alice came out of the shadows and took their places, Alice came to front center stage, got on one knee with a hammer in hand, and proceeded to beat the floor with the hammer in time with the tom's. Once he brought the microphone to his mouth, the light would hit hit him and he began as well as the whole band. Actually, I prefer their earlier performances over the harsher tones adopted later as they developed. All in all though, they had a stage presence that was better than the music, eventually, as they became seasoned performers, and their material more commercialized, a blend of the old and new emerged into what they were until 1974. I still like their small venue performances better, but I had the benefit of being their up close and personal several times. Hope this helps if someone wants to fit a small sentence or paragraph into a venue section.<a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrganizedconfusion_0dc3.html" title="User:Organizedconfusion">Organizedconfusion</a> 23:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)Organizedconfusion</p>

<p>Alice Cooper appeared in a well made PSA some time in the 90's. He was following some guy around who was mowing his lawn. The upshot of it was that the guy should have been spending time with his son (daughter?) because (as they cut to Alice in full makeup) "you don't want the kid growing up to be some kind of freak." Anyway, I thought the spot was well made and carried a good message. I'd like to see someone, who knows the facts, write paragraph on that. Thx</p>
<p>-I think the commercial was banned for some reason or something. I downloaded the commercial and it was labeled as "banned alice cooper commercial"</p>

<dd>Well, I found the commercial: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=D5o8fhz0AAQ&amp;search=alice%20cooper" class="external autonumber" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=D5o8fhz0AAQ&amp;search=alice%20cooper" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. And judging from the narrator, it seems like it was just a commercial for a hotel. Not a PSA. Cooper has appeared in a couple of commercials over the years. MB 06:59, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've read that there is a fued between Alice and Gary Lewis of Gary Lewis and the Playboys. Does anyone know why? I guess its jealousy becuase Alice had to start out at pits like the Rainbow Room and The Whiskey NOT at a lounge at the Disneyland hotel.

<p>I think that the discography section especially needs to be reorganized. Reason being that numerous concert films are being listed in there, when they should technically be posted under filmography. Additionally, I feel that such films (Strange Case of Alice Cooper, Alice Cooper: Trashes the World, etc.) should be recategorized into "#### films" or something similar instead of "#### albums" as they currently are listed as, simply because they aren't albums, nor were soundtracks for said films released on cassette/disc at any point. --<a href="../../../d/b/m/User%7EDbm11085_f530.html" title="User:Dbm11085">Dbm11085</a> 06:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's said in the reference that "Cooper drew equally from horror movie, vaudeville, heavy metal and garage rock..."

Garage should be there if the reference says so...</p>
