Her mother died of <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> when Alice was only eight. Alice herself was <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">consumptive</a> from birth.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alice was introduced to wild social life ever since her early adolescence. She was one of the most prominent <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialite.html" title="Socialite">socialites</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> during the late <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910s.html" title="1910s">1910s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, frequenting the most fashionable <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclubs</a> of the time, with the encouragement of her father. Her father also took her to several travels around <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and further encouraged his daughter's image as a notable <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debutante.html" title="Debutante">debutante</a>. However, her wild adolescent years had left Alice with a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_%28medicine%29.html" title="Chronic (medicine)">chronic</a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> that was to accompany her for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>After her mother's death, she was raised by a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">German</a> <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governess.html" title="Governess">governess</a> in large houses in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, due to the fact her father was frequently absent by reason of his professional obligations. While she was still a teenager, William Silverthorne was involved in an inexplicable and mysterious accident, which was possibly owing to his <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_%28medicine%29.html" title="Chronic (medicine)">chronic</a> <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a>.

<p>Due to her glamorous lifestyle and extraordinary life, Alice herself had grown eccentric and unconventional. Her two great passions, based on her own words, were <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocktail.html" title="Cocktail">cocktails</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animals</a>.

<p>When she was 21 years old, she travelled to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. There, she briefly worked as director of the model department of <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Patou_7fd9.html" title="Jean Patou">Jean Patou</a>'s dressmaking establishment<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> until she met Count of Janzé alias Comte Frédéric Jacques de Janzé, a well-known <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> racing driver of the time (a participant in <a href="../../../2/4/_/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans_fec9.html" title="24 Hours of Le Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> races) and heir to an old aristocratic family of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bretagne.html" title="Bretagne">Bretagne</a>. Frédéric also used to frequent literary circles, having formed a close friendship with individuals such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Proust_9cf8.html" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Barr%C3%A8s_7b42.html" title="Maurice Barrès">Maurice Barrès</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_de_Noailles_0f80.html" title="Anna de Noailles">Anna de Noailles</a>.

Nolwén would later marry famous art historian <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Clark_ae15.html" title="Kenneth Clark">Kenneth Clark</a>.</p>
<p>Alice was conscious of the fact she often neglected her children. Her daughters were practically raised in the hands of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governess.html" title="Governess">governesses</a> or by Frédéric's sister, in their family <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chateau.html" title="Chateau">chateau</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a>. After having permanently set in Kenya, Alice only scarcely visited her children in Paris. Years later, Nolwén would state that she did not feel bitterness or hostility for her mother during their brief meetings together but would actually be fascinated by this virtually unknown woman who brought with her an air of mystique, owing to her permanent stay in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alice and Frédéric first travelled to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>. There, they spent some time in the so-called <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Valley%2C_Kenya_069f.html" title="Happy Valley, Kenya">Happy Valley, Kenya</a>, a community located in Wanjohi Valley, near the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdare_Mountains_bd9a.html" title="Aberdare Mountains">Aberdare Mountains</a> that consisted mainly of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">British</a> colonials. The community had become notorious among socialites in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> for being a paradise for all those seeking an <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonism.html" title="Hedonism">hedonistic</a> lifestyle, including <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug.html" title="Drug">drugs</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and various sexual affairs between the members of the community. Frédéric de Janzé documented his time in Happy Valley and all the various eccentric personalities he met there in his book, <i>Vertical Land</i>, which was published in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> In the book, Frédéric provides several non-eponymous references to members of the <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Valley_set_e572.html" title="Happy Valley set">Happy Valley set</a>, including a psychological portrait of his wife, Alice that alludes to her suicidal tendencies:</p>

<p>The de Janzés were essentially among the founding members of this newly-formed community of expatriates. The house where they lived was next to the house of the founders of Happy Valley, namely, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josslyn_Hay%2C_22nd_Earl_of_Erroll_20f1.html" title="Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll">Josslyn Victor Hay</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Erroll_7218.html" title="Earl of Erroll">Earl of Erroll</a> aka Lord Erroll, and his wife, Idina. According to author <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Trzebinski_111e.html" title="Errol Trzebinski">Errol Trzebinski</a>, Frédéric and Alice had already met with Erroll and Idina while in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montparnasse.html" title="Montparnasse">Montparnasse</a>, some time earlier, though this meeting was discrete and widely unknown to the public.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alice caused a sensation to the people of Happy Valley, due to her wild personality, sarcastic sense of humour, natural beauty and unique sense of fashion. She would often speak passionately about animal rights or play <a href="../../../u/k/u/Ukulele.html" title="Ukulele">ukulele</a>. Alice would also soon fall in love with Erroll himself, arguably one of the most famous residents of Happy Valley and a notorious philanderer. The two of them enjoyed a secret love affair for some time. Ultimately they remained lifelong friends, although Alice possibly retained feeling for him. After Alice and Frederic returned to Happy Valley in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, she started another love affair, this time with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">British</a> nobleman Raymond Vincent de Trafford (<a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>), son of Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet. Frédéric soon became aware of his wife's infidelity, though he did not became extremely preoccupied by that, as the de Janzés had already acclimated in the libertarian atmosphere that prevailed in the community. However, Alice's infatuation with de Trafford was so great that the couple attempted to elope at some point, though they promptly returned. Frédéric then returned to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> with Alice, in a desperate attempt to save his marriage, but it was already too late. Alice, madly in love with de Trafford, soon returned to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> and eventually she and de Janzé <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">16 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>.

<b>Alice</b> and her husband, <b>Frederic</b>, circa mid-1920s. This newspaper article reports the infamous shooting incident that would eventually sent Alice to prison</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">25 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, while in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> Raymond informed Alice that his family (of strict Catholic views) had threatened to disinherit him were he to marry her; therefore, the two of them had to part ways. A few hours later, in the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gare_du_Nord_b34d.html" title="Gare du Nord">Gare du Nord</a>, while he was about to leave the city by an <a href="../../../e/x/p/Express.html" title="Express">Express</a> boat train to London and bidding farewell to Alice in his compartment, she kissed him, pulled a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a> from her purse, shot him and then shot herself. Raymond was gravely injured near the heart, whereas she was also gravely injured in her stomach. It was later revealed that after Raymond had announced his decision and the couple had lunched in a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a>, they had visited a gunshop where Alice, unbeknownst to Raymond, bought the fatal <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a> that she was determined to use.</p>
<p>Following the shooting, both Alice and de Trafford were carried to the hospital, where they spent several days in a critical condition. However, both declined to give any reasons or explanations over what happened, even though Alice - practically under arrest from the very moment of the shooting - claimed to repent shooting the Englishman, who was almost on the brink of death.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The incident made headlines all over the world. <i>Fort Covington Sun</i> reported the following on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">14 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>:<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>America, France and England were all threatened in the tragedy in the Gare du Nord, Paris, when Countess de Janze, estranged wife of Frenchman, shot Raymond V. de Trafford, scion of a prominent British family, and then put a bullet through her own body. The countess was Alice Silverthorne of Chicago, cousin of J. Ogden Armour and well-known in American social circles. Her relations with De Trafford recently led her husband to file suit for divorce. For several days after the shooting it was believed both the countess and De Trafford would die, but latest reports are that they are out of danger.</i></p>
<p>After recuperating, de Trafford returned to London on mid-April, whereas on May Alice, who was officially charged of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attempted_murder.html" title="Attempted murder">attempted murder</a> since <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">5 April</a>, was temporarily freed by the police pending her recovery.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> When she eventually described what happened in the train station, she stated the following:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">... The whistle of London Express blew, and I realized that he was going away from Paris - and from me forever - I suddenly changed my mind and resolved to take him away with me into the Great Beyond. Slowly - very slowly - I loosened my grip around his neck, placed the revolver between our two bodies, and, as the train started, fired twice - into his chest and my own body.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></td>

<b>Alice de Janzé</b> in obituary photo in <i>The Vidette Messenger</i>, shortly after her death</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">24 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Lord Erroll was found <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murdered</a> (shot) in his car, in an intersection outside <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairobi.html" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>. Police started investigations in order to solve the crime and questioned all of Erroll's closest acquaintances, including Alice. Even though she had an <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alibi.html" title="Alibi">alibi</a>, having spent an intimate night with a fellow member of the community, Dickie Pembroke, she was immediately regarded as a major suspect by the rest of the community, being one of Lord Erroll's former mistresses and, most importantly, burdened with the epithets of "half-mad" and "drug-addict" and with a notable former assassination attempt aimed at a lover.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> Alice went on to become emotionally attached to Pembroke and start a regular relationship with him, although he was never committed to this affair as much as Alice. He would later be transferred by the military service he worked for in <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> and Alice would keep on sending him letters in the following months.</p>
<p>On the morning after Erroll's corpse was discovered, Alice went to the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgue.html" title="Morgue">morgue</a> with a friend of hers, Julian Lezzard, also a member of the community. According to eyewitnesses, Alice shocked everybody when she left a tree branch on Erroll's body and subsequently smeared her <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vaginal</a> juices over Hay's lips and whispered the words: <i>"Now you are mine forever"</i><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup>(the notorious scene was also included in the <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Mischief_9e5c.html" title="White Mischief">White Mischief</a></i> film). After this story was circulated, many people considered Alice as being Erroll's murderer, having committed yet another crime of passion. It was also rumoured that Alice herself had admitted to the killing.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, it was <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jock_Delves_Broughton_8893.html" title="Jock Delves Broughton">Sir Henry John "Jock" Delves Broughton</a> who was accused of Erroll's <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>. Sir Jock was the most obvious <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspect.html" title="Suspect">suspect</a>, since it was quite known that his young wife, Diana, was openly Erroll's mistress, an affair that was humiliating for Delves Broughton, to say the least. Eventually, Delves Broughton was acquitted due to lack of evidence (following testimonies that reportedly involved a great deal of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a>). Years later, <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Mischief_9e5c.html" title="White Mischief">White Mischief</a></i> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> James Fox claimed that Jock Delves Broughton was in fact the murderer and that he had confessed the murder to a 15-year old girl, Juanita Carberry, whose parents were friends with Erroll, though the girl did not admit the story until decades later.</p>
<p>Alice paid regular visits to Delves Broughton in prison. On August <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, she was submitted to <a href="../../../h/y/s/Hysterectomy.html" title="Hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>, after being diagnosed with uterine <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. Shortly afterwards, she attempted suicide by overdosing on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentobarbital.html" title="Pentobarbital">Pentobarbital</a> but was rescued by a friend of hers, who called on a doctor to perform <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastric_lavage.html" title="Gastric lavage">gastric lavage</a>.

She was found dead in her <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmhouse.html" title="Farmhouse">farmhouse</a> in <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgil.html" title="Gilgil">Gilgil</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, two days after turning 42.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> She left three suicide notes, one aimed to the police (whose content was never disclosed), one to her daughters and one to Pembroke. She reportedly asked her friends to throw a <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocktail_party.html" title="Cocktail party">cocktail party</a> above her <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave.html" title="Grave">grave</a>.

<p>The events surrounding the murder of Lord Erroll were the basis of the non-fiction book <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Mischief_9e5c.html" title="White Mischief">White Mischief</a></i>, written by James Fox and published in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. The book investigates the murder of Lord Erroll and consists of a large gallery of characters, mainly members of the Happy Valley set, including Alice. The book was later made into a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> movie by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Radford_e8ed.html" title="Michael Radford">Michael Radford</a>, starring British actress <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Miles_f3df.html" title="Sarah Miles">Sarah Miles</a> as Alice. The film adaptation focuses heavily on Alice's eccentric traits. As such, Miles' role was among the most memorable of the film. Miles generally received positive reviews. There are numerous memorable scenes involving Alice's character, such as watching polo match with a python draped around her shoulders or the encounter with Lord Erroll's corpse, as well as (arguably the most famous line of the movie) <i>"Oh God, not another f*****g beautiful day"</i>).</p>

The novel is set in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920s</a> Kenya and encompasses a set of real-life historical figures, mainly members of the Happy Valley set and other colonials, including Lord Erroll, Idina Hay, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beryl_Markham_d869.html" title="Beryl Markham">Beryl Markham</a>, Karen Blixen, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denys_Finch_Hatton_1c09.html" title="Denys Finch Hatton">Denys Finch Hatton</a>, Lord Delamere and Alice herself. However, as with other Kilian novels that employ real people as heroes in fictitious situations, the plot here is also fictitious and revolves around the murder of a character named "Lord Ramms". Kilian's novel seems inspired by the <i>White Mischief</i> book and the real-life Lord Erroll murder mystery, as most of the characters, including Alice, are considered as suspects for the murder, like in the actual murder case in 1941.</p>
