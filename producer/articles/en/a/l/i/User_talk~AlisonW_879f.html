<p>Please replace the Treasure Valley Rollergirls article. Not only is it a tyro <i>bona fide</i> Division Three roller derby league, there's a brand-new citation in the local media, namely Thrive. I put to you that the TVR is indeed significant as a) a DIY, grass roots effort which is one part of b) the current roller derby revival.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That article was tagged for 'speedy deletion' by another editor on the grounds that the subject - Treasure Valley Rollergirls - isn't that notable. I looked at the article and agreed with the editor who tagged it and so I deleted it as, basically, it was one line of information and a list of people. It didn't meet our standards for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, basically, although the basic information about the team (ie excluding the names) would certainly be relevant on an article about the roller derby <i>league</i> it is difficult to see that individual articles on each division or every team would become important enough in their own right. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 13:46, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. But I suspect that this shall change as derby's popularity increases. I have redirected "TVR" and "Treasure Valley Rollergirls" to Wiki's "List of roller derby leagues"; people can still dig out the information they want. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKencf_9538.html" title="User:Kencf">Kencf</a> 22:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you deleted the image <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:341 mL Bottles with Ice w.jpg">Image:341 mL Bottles with Ice w.jpg</a> used in the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakeport_Brewing_Company_333d.html" title="Lakeport Brewing Company">Lakeport Brewing Company</a> article recently and I'm still sort of unclear on the reasoning. It's been suggested to me that <i>a free alternative exists</i> in the fair use criteria actually means <i>it is possible for someone to create a free alternative</i> but this is hard for me to read into <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublicity_photos_4459.html" title="Wikipedia:Publicity photos">Wikipedia:Publicity photos</a> or reconcile it with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EPromotional_images_195b.html" title="Category:Promotional images">Category:Promotional images</a> which is filled (for example) with images of specific car brands, athletes, actos, what have you all of which seem to be essentially identical in circumstance to the one I was trying to use in the Lakeport article.

<dd>Basically, the image you were using isn't a 'free' image for Wikipedia. It can't be reused elsewhere in the same way all our GFDL text and the majority of other images can be because it is a publicity image supplied by Lakeport and has restrictions on what can be done with it. In order that Wikipedia can meet its intention of providing free and open content that anyone can use then it needs to be replaced by an image that lets us continue to do that. The easiest way being to buy three bottles similar to those previously pictured, and take a photo yourself of them! You are also welcome to drink the contents, of course&#160;;-P --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 13:46, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, but can you be less "basic" than that? Fair use images are used all the time, for things one could easily take a picture of. There are an uncountably large number of such photos in use - are they all inappropriate? To pick an example where I don't get the difference, the article on <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Hill_%28baseball_player%29_23ff.html" title="Aaron Hill (baseball player)">Aaron Hill (baseball player)</a> uses a publicitiy photo, where anyone could just go to a Blue Jays game and snap a photo - is that use inappropriate? What is it about the Lakeport image that made its use inappropriate while tons of other publicty photos are used? Or are they all inappropriate? Given the existence of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EPromotional_images_195b.html" title="Category:Promotional images">Category:Promotional images</a> that seems unlikely to me, but I may be mistaken. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:19, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While <i>Fair use images are used all the time</i> is true it is also a serious problem. "Fair use" doesn't apply outside the USA and also requires a number of legal tests to be passed. Wikipedia needs to remove - eventually - as many fair use images as possible and yes, publicity department-supplied pictures of baseball players amongst them. That category is currently being used as the basis for <i>finding</i> the images we need to most urgently replace. For more about how Wikipedia sees this problem refer to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 14:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm pretty confused by this new update about FU for living people. See for instance [[Image:Ryan Lochte.jpg]] - there is a disclaimer at the website which seems to imply that it is copyrighted, but non-profit distribution/use which is not misused for pornopgraphy/obscenity, etc against the US Olympic Committee is allowed - does that make it "free" for non-profit promotion purposes, or does this need to be deleted.

<dd>Yeah, it isn't usable by WP projects in the long term *because* there are limitations on the use. Wikipedia is around to let people everywhere have access and that means that we don't want to have content that can't be reused elsewhere. An image that can *only* be used on Wikipedia might be fine for someone reading us online on Wikipedia, but isn't acceptable for the other uses people make for our content - on CDs, DVDs, course materials, etc. Ideally someone will have a camera around when Ryan is next 'doing his thing' and supply a photo that can be <i>freely</i> used. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 09:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, AlisonW. The September 9 <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fair use</a> clarifications generated a lot of heat discussions, with some editors claiming that it was more of a policy change than a simply clarification of an already existing (but often misinterpreted) policy. Some users complained that you were acting on your own while "<i>changing</i>" the policy, rather than expressing Jimbo's view on the matter.</p>
<p>The user <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a>, in a (imho) very sensible move, left a <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html#Fairuse_clarification_badly_needed" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">message</a> to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> asking for a confirmation of your statements in regard of your IRC conversation with Jimbo that led to the policy clarifications. After this move, the discussions somewhat coolled, as if everybody silently agreed that to wait for Jimbo's word was the best thing to do.</p>
<p>It has been some few days since Crzrussian's message and no word from Jimbo. I know his a busy person, and so are you, but.. can you, in some way, ask him to drop a note about the issue? It's doesn't need to be more that "<i>Yes, AlisonW is right</i>" or "<i>No way.</i>". Thanks in advance.

<dd>I've no idea which country he is in, and although I'll probably have an IRC log of his confirmation that the new paragraphs (which I note have been extensively edited since) are good copying IRC logs is generally not permitted!

<dd>I believe he has been travelling a lot (as per usual, really!) so quite possibly never saw the comment in his talk page, though I did mention it to the office. Looking at FU's talkpage things seem to have settled down (somewhat) but if this is still an issue I'll chase it up further. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 20:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believe things have settled down exaclty because, after the message was left to Jimbo, a "truce" has been silently declared and images are not being nominated for deletion based on the new clarification. I know of whole categories of images that should be deleted if that wording is confirmed, but I can forsee the hot waters one would put himsself into while trying to enforce the policy as it is explained now.</dd>
<dd>I highly appreciate you efforts in this issue so far, and if it's really not an abuse of your dedication, I'd like to accept your proposal to chase it further. And let me know if I could be of any help on this matter. Best regards, --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 01:16, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings. I understand you are interested in, and knowlegeable about, Wikipedia's fair use guidelines. As I understand it, "reproduceable" non-free images are not allowed on Wikipedia. For some time, there has existed a {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_replace_d0d1.html" title="Template:Fair use replace">Fair use replace</a>}} which was designed to fix the problem. Unfortunately, the tag is simply ignored 99% of the time. The tag also says that violating images should be replaced "as soon as possible", but allows the images to exist on Wikipedia until then. But as I understand it, these images are not allowed on Wikipedia at all, and should be deleted (rather than kept until a replacement is found, if one ever is). With that in mind, I created a new template that tags offending images as violation <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> #1, and says they may be deleted in seven days if no one contests the assertion that the image is "replaceable". Discussion is ongoing <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Fair_use_ece5.html#Replaceable_fair_use" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Fair use">here</a>, and I would appreciate your input. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random</a>)</sup> 20:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
