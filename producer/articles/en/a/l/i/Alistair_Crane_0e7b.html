<p>Alistair Crane is the primary villain on <i>Passions</i>, and is usually behind evil plots when they're not caused by <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabitha_Lenox_b1d6.html" title="Tabitha Lenox">Tabitha Lenox</a>. He was formerly the head of <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crane_Industries_0ef4.html" title="Crane Industries">Crane Industries</a>. He has made constant attempts to separate <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheridan_Crane_446d.html" title="Sheridan Crane">Sheridan Crane</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Lopez-Fitzgerald_f093.html" title="Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald">Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, as well as to disrupt the lives of the Bennetts and to persecute the Lopez-Fitzgeralds. Everything about or related to Alistair has been made out to be evil. He is supposedly <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexist.html" title="Sexist">sexist</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic.html" title="Homophobic">homophobic</a>, and may be a <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile.html" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a>, since he raped <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Sanbourne_8ccf.html" title="Liz Sanbourne">Liz Sanbourne</a> when she was fourteen. Many of the relationships Alistair has had with women usually saw him not really loving women but possessing them, and sometimes <a href="../../../r/a/p/Raping.html" title="Raping">raping</a> them.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Crane_0e7b.html" title="Edit section: The Faceless Years (1999-2004)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Faceless Years (1999-2004)</span></h3>
<p>For the show's first five years, Alistair's face was never seen. During this time, he was less of a primary villain, focusing his efforts on keeping his daughter, Sheridan, away from <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Lopez-Fitzgerald_f093.html" title="Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald">Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, whom Alistair did not want discovering the secrets of the Crane empire, and making certain that Julian and Ethan stayed in line. He disinherited both Julian and Ethan in 2000, after they dallied with women Alistair did not approve of. In 2000, Alistair tricked Sheridan into thinking that Luis had cheated on her by fitting another man with a Luis mask; in 2001, when Luis and Sheridan were to be married, he had her wedding ring poisoned, and when the couple's nuptials fell through, he had their boat in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> blown up, presumably killing Sheridan.</p>
<p>When Sheridan became pregnant with Luis's child in 2003, Alistair took the appearance of a lesbian named Charlie in order to help Luis's ex-fiancée, Beth Wallace, kidnap Sheridan and hold her prisoner in a pit until she could give birth. Once Sheridan gave birth to her son, whom Beth later named <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Lopez-Fitzgerald_e843.html" title="Marty Lopez-Fitzgerald">Marty</a>, Beth threw Sheridan into the ocean attached to an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor.html" title="Anchor">anchor</a>, and Alistair drove off a cliff; "Charlie", as well as Luis and Sheridan's child (an empty carseat was found in the back), was presumed dead.</p>
<p>In 2004, Alistair convinced Sheridan's husband, Luis's weaker-minded older brother, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Lopez-Fitzgerald_c8fc.html" title="Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald">Antonio</a>, to have his wife placed in a psychiatric ward after she showed clear signs of mental distress after the death of her baby. In the psych ward, Alistair had Sheridan administered <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_shock_therapy.html" title="Electric shock therapy">electric shock therapy</a> until she could no longer remember her love for Luis. When Sheridan did finally remember, her husband, Antonio, kidnapped her and forced her onto the Crane jet with him; he later let her go, and Alistair blew up the plane, unaware that Sheridan was no longer on it (Antonio was killed as a result).</p>
<p>When Luis and Sheridan traveled to Puerto Arena, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, that same year, Alistair finally realized that his wife, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Barrett_45b5.html" title="Katherine Barrett">Katherine</a>, was living there with Luis's father, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Fitzgerald_8fc3.html" title="Martin Fitzgerald">Martin</a> (Alistair had faked Katherine's death years earlier after she left him). Alistair attempted several times to murder the four, plus Martin's daughter <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paloma_Lopez-Fitzgerald_f23e.html" title="Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald">Paloma</a>, to no avail.</p>
<p><a name="With_a_Face_.282004-2006.29" id="With_a_Face_.282004-2006.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Crane_0e7b.html" title="Edit section: With a Face (2004-2006)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">With a Face (2004-2006)</span></h3>
<p>When Alistair's face was finally revealed in September 2004, the patriarch's reign of terror truly began to start. In 2005, he helped Beth, whom he had learned was actually his biological daughter with Edna Wallace, escape with Luis and Sheridan's son, Marty. When Luis went after Beth and Marty, Alistair had his goons kidnap Luis in <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangier.html" title="Tangier">Tangier</a> and hold him prisoner in <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> for several months; Alistair faked Luis's death during this time. Alistair also had his wife, Katherine, as well as <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Hotchkiss_6306.html" title="Gwen Hotchkiss">Gwen</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Winthrop_5ad0.html" title="Jane Winthrop">Jane</a> and grandson <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Foxworth_Crane_3b1f.html" title="Nicholas Foxworth Crane">Fox</a>, held hostage at one of his compounds in the Atlantic. He also physically tortured Gwen on the compound, after she tried to stop him from raping Katherine, which he proceeded to do anyway.</p>
<p>With Luis out of the picture, Alistair began focusing on punishing the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bennett_family.html" title="Bennett family">Bennett family</a> for opposing him for so many years. Alistair had <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Bennett_71d0.html" title="Sam Bennett">Sam Bennett</a> fired as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_police.html" title="Chief of police">chief of police</a>; he also saw to it that his associate, Spike, lead Sam's lost young daughter, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bennett_b3b4.html" title="Jessica Bennett">Jessica</a>, into a life of <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>. He also had Sam's youngest son, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Bennett_b3cb.html" title="Noah Bennett">Noah</a>, arrested on false drug and weapon charges, fearing that his beloved granddaughter, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancy_Crane_87a9.html" title="Fancy Crane">Fancy</a>, might fall in love with the boy.</p>
<p>Alistair also entered into an alliance with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theresa_Lopez-Fitzgerald_c7ca.html" title="Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald">Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, who agreed to be Alistair's <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistress.html" title="Mistress">mistress</a> in exchange for his help in getting back her ex-fiancée, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethan_Winthrop_9595.html" title="Ethan Winthrop">Ethan Winthrop</a>, and her daughter, Jane. When Theresa later refused to sleep with him as she had promised to do, he forced her; the two were later married on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. Alistair repeatdly raped and tortured Theresa, he even made her do sexual things that she would never normally do. Alistair then adopted her son, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethan_Crane_bd16.html" title="Ethan Crane">Little Ethan</a>, and made him his <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir.html" title="Heir">heir</a>, believing him to be his grandson by his oldest child, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_Crane_a5dc.html" title="Julian Crane">Julian</a> (Little Ethan was later revealed to be Ethan's biological son). At this time, Alistair disinherited the rest of his family (some members had already been disinherited) for having turned their backs on him.</p>
<p>Though Theresa attempted to murder her husband several times, it wasn't until <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Sanbourne_8ccf.html" title="Liz Sanbourne">Liz Sanbourne</a> stabbed him in the neck that it seemed that Alistair might finally be put out of commission. Alistair lapsed into a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a>, and was put into Lyndon Hill Nursing Home. While everyone thought that he was in a coma, Alistair was really setting his <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega.html" title="Omega">omega</a> plot into motion.</p>
<p>Alistair began dressing as a monk and appeared several times to <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novice.html" title="Novice">novice</a> <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Russell_2a29.html" title="Whitney Russell">Whitney Russell</a>, who was eager to do penance for her sins of <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>. Believing he was <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, Whitney followed Alistair to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, where she helped him to come into possession of a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalice_%28cup%29.html" title="Chalice (cup)">chalice</a> belonging to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, which would allow whomever unlocked its secrets to rule the world. Alistair also lured other people to Rome, including <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Harris-Crane_67f1.html" title="Chad Harris-Crane">Chad Harris-Crane</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simone_Russell_c6a3.html" title="Simone Russell">Simone Russell</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paloma_Lopez-Fitzgerald_f23e.html" title="Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald">Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bennett_b3b4.html" title="Jessica Bennett">Jessica Bennett</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Lester_6892.html" title="Spike Lester">Spike Lester</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethan_Winthrop_9595.html" title="Ethan Winthrop">Ethan Winthrop</a>, <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Hotchkiss_6306.html" title="Gwen Hotchkiss">Gwen Winthrop</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theresa_Lopez-Fitzgerald_c7ca.html" title="Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald">Theresa Crane</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Wallace_a3ee.html" title="Beth Wallace">Beth Wallace</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Lopez-Fitzgerald_e843.html" title="Marty Lopez-Fitzgerald">Marty Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Lopez-Fitzgerald_f093.html" title="Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald">Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancy_Crane_87a9.html" title="Fancy Crane">Fancy Crane</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Bennett_b3cb.html" title="Noah Bennett">Noah Bennett</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_Chinn_057f.html" title="Maya Chinn">Maya Chinn</a>; in addition, he hired a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> named Lena, along with Spike and Maya, to break up Noah and Fancy, and assisted Beth and Marty in escaping from <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis.html" title="Luis">Luis</a>.</p>
<p>Though Alistair was able to gain some of the chalice's powers, sleazy <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a> editor JT Cornell stole the chalice; it was later recovered by Chad Harris and returned to the Pope. Alistair then focused his efforts on escaping Rome with Beth and Marty. He commandeered a train for them to escape on; they were on their way out of Rome when a <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drone.html" title="Drone">drone</a> plane fired missiles at a bridge, destroying it; the train plunged into the ravine below, presumably killing Alistair, Beth, and Marty on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. With Alistair gone, Theresa assumed control of the vast Crane fortune.</p>
