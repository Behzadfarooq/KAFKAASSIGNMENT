<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the quotes section is biased. First of all, quotes sections have pretty much disappeared throughout wikipeda and are being transferred to wiki-quotes. Second of all, it seems as if someboy sat down, read through the Islamic decleration, and just handpicked the quotes that would portray him as a complete radical. If we're going to provide quotes there's no need to provide 50 from a single text. As it is, this section is hardly NPOV. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 20:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm generally satisfied with ChrisO's rewrite, although I believe the connection between Mladi Muslimani and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazis.html" title="Nazis">Nazis</a> / <a href="../../../u/s/t/Ustasa.html" title="Ustasa">Ustasa</a> could have been further debunked.

<dd>"One of the many tests that Mladi Muslimani successfully passed was their distancing from the Ustasa government that wanted to incorporate this organization with their (Ustasa) youth.

<p>Bosnian Muslims started calling themselves Bosniaks only after 1994. Calling 1940’s Mladi Muslimani organization “Bosniak” is not accurate, they thought of themselves as Muslims, purely.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 07:37, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you please provide the sources for this statement:</p>

<dd>If I recall correctly, it's based what Noel Malcolm says about it in "Bosnia: A Short History". I could dig out the specific citation, if you like.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Please do. With the evidence that Young Muslims distanced themselves from Ustasa that I provided above, I'd say that if Mr. Malcolm claimed such a thing he's probably - pardon my language - pulling it from his ass. The people of the period are still alive and, being personally acquinted with some of them, I can say with certainty that Young Muslims criticized the Fascists and Ustasa as heavily as Chetniks. --<a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> 10:50, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just looked in the index of my copy of "Bosnia: A Short History" (1996 updated edition). 'Young Muslims' is mentioned on pages 196 and 208. Page 196 talks about it working against the Communist government's suppression of Islam, and page 208 talks about the 1983 Sarajevo trial against Izetbegović and others (as mentioned in the Wikipedia article). I think people are getting things mixed up - unintentionally, I hope - with Derviš Šušić's 1979 exposé in <i>Oslobodjenje</i> (encouraged by the authorities at the time) of senior members of the Muslim clergy who had apparently collaborated with the Nazis and the Ustaša during WWII. As I have mentioned later in this section about <i>Young Muslims</i>, this had nothing to do with the Young Muslims movement, who view such collaborations as un-Islamic. -- <a href="../../../b/u/y/User%7EBuyoof_395a.html" title="User:Buyoof">Buyoof</a> 12:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>"As such, while it was not officially pro-fascist in orientation, the Young Muslims generally supported the Nazi/Ustase efforts to promote an Islamic identity in opposition to the Chetnik and Partisan guerrillas."</i></p>
<p>If it wasnt fascist and only agreed with the Nazi's and Ustase's in one thing, and that was religious freedom, why do you have to link Mladi Muslimani with Nazi's and Fascist's?</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Because they <i>were</i> linked to fascists and nazis!</dd>

<p>Yeah right</p>
<hr />
<p>Not sure what's going on here, it appears that the writer(s) are not familiar with the (worldwide) Young Muslims movement (see links <a href="http://www.youngmuslims.ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youngmuslims.ca" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="http://www.ymouk.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ymouk.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, the Canadian and the British Young Muslims organisation respectively, for more info).</p>
<p>None of the <i>Young Muslims</i> movements, including the Bosnian one, have ever advocated the type of nationalism spoken about here. Young Muslims itself advocates "pure" <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> teachings, and it must be noted that <b><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">Nationalism</a> goes directly against the Islamic teaching of <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a></b>.</p>
<p>An Islamic organisation cannot therefore advocate such nationalism without losing its legitimacy; indeed the vast majority of Islamic scholars (and therefore of Muslims) believe that Islam is incompatible with any type of nationalism, i.e. that one cannot be a nationalist and a true Muslim at the same time. Nationalism is often described by Islamic scholars as a "disease" in the Muslim community, and many Islamic organisations -- including Young Muslims -- give great importance to defeating nationalist ideas and advocating the idea of <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a> in its place.</p>
<p>One must therefore be careful to differentiate between the Young Muslims movement itself and the actions of some of its members. Any Muslims that supported Nazi/Ustaše efforts would have done so due to their own lack of belief in -- or ignorance of -- Islamic teachings, and not because of the Young Muslims.</p>
<p>I hope this helps clear things up. I have amended the paragraph on Young Muslims to make it NPOV.</p>

This article is riddled with both inaccuracy and NPOV problems. "Hardline Muslim government" - err, no. Multiethnic legitimate government of the state.</p>
<p>Similarly - the army of BiH was not a "Muslim" army. It was a multiethnic army of a multiethnic state.</p>
<p>Army of BiH was a Muslim army, 2-3 Serb and Croat offices, holding no real power, where window dressing, pure cosmetics. As the new war crimes charges will show. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 02:43, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have many NPOV and accuracy issues with this article. I'll try to list them in order of appearance (sorry, all the external references are in <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbo-Croatian_language_560d.html" title="Serbo-Croatian language">Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian</a> language, I don't have the time to dig for English versions but a translation can be provided as needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>The term <b>Muslim</b> is used consistently for <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniak.html" title="Bosniak">Bosniaks</a></li>
<li>It is generally believed among Bosniaks that the 1983 trial was falsified and that the communists simply couldn't allow an opposing view, as expressed in Izetbegovic's "Islamic Declaration" <a href="http://www.mm.co.ba/art18_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mm.co.ba/art18_1.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
<li><i>Bosnian Federation (Muslim-Croat) Army</i> - There is nothing in Bosnian Federation that is "Muslim-Croat", this is POV. A proper name with a link - <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_e3a9.html" title="Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina">Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> - should be used with no reference to ethnicities. Later on, the text has a reference to "Izetbegovic's Army" - Izetbegovic had no private army of his own!?</li>
<li>The article claims contradictory that Izetbegovic was president until 1997, and later that he remained in power until 2000. This should be cleared up and ordered chronologically.</li>
<li><i>Izetbegovic headed a Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina which existed only on paper, no longer legitimate according to some 60% of its population</i> - notes such as this one are a POV and in contradiction with what is said in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_5483.html" title="History of Bosnia and Herzegovina">History of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. These kind of comments should be avoided, and See Also with above reference provided.</li>
<li><i>Izetbegovic proclaimed Bosnia's independence</i> - Again, he did nothing on his own. Again, the history of Bosnia is not a subject of this article, especially not if things claimed here are clashing with stuff in the relevant article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several passages in this article serve absolutely no purpose, apart from "story-telling", obviously from an anti-Izetbegovic POV. More specifically, a discussion on Fikret Abdic which wasn't deemed important enough to be a part of the Bosnian History article and the paragraph on his "elongated" presidency under three different Constitutions. Certain persons reverted several attempts of removing these (and other) passages under the claim of "vandalizing". Well some judgment on relevance of facts to the article has to be made.</p>

<p>This article has a lot of problems, as the previous contributors to this talk page have pointed out. I've rewritten it pretty much from scratch in an effort to expand the detail and get it into some kind of NPOV shape. Major changes that I should point out include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of much more info about the period between his birth and 1989 - which is, after all, three quarters of his life!</li>
<li>Removed the bits about Fikret Abdic; the article should be focused on Izetbegovic, and the Abdic elements are fairly incidental.</li>
<li>Removed lots and lots of POV elements - as <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> says above, the original article was very clearly written from an anti-Izetbegovic viewpoint. But I've also tried to acknowledge and represent the points made by those POV elements.</li>
<li>Removed the purported photo of Osama bin Laden, but providing detail of the claim of his involvement and giving a proper attribution (to <i>Der Spiegel</i>). I'm suspicious of this claim and would prefer to get a bit more detail on it before bringing it into a Wikipedia article. I'll see what I can find out.</li>
</ul>
<p>A significant part of the original article, and some of the new version, deals with Izetbegovic's involvement with Islamic fundamentalism. I think this is a topic which would be worth an article of its own - is anyone up to writing an article on Islamic fundamentalism in Bosnia? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:47, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nikola, I don't think reversion is the appropriate thing to do. It's wiped out a large amount of factual content and restored all the POV material that other users complained about. Could you please explain what <b>specific</b> aspects of my rewrite you object to?

<dd>Well, first of all, article itself says that it's biased: "He was well regarded in Western countries but was a controversial figure in the former <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>", but at the end all sources are Western ones. You left out details about his family, that trial, "an attempt to obtain the loyalty" I won't even comment, you left out details about forming SDA (and I don't see why would mentioning other people who formed the party be objectionable to anyone!), and I'm too tired to look further. See also my talk page. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 23:36, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest, I'm very distrustful of most of the Yugoslav sources - they're so heavily contaminated by the propaganda of the 1990s that it's hard to work out what's real and what's propangandistic invention or distortion. (This is true for all sides, I might add). My main sources were a slew of contemporary (yes, Western) media accounts and a number of (again Western) histories of the Yugoslav wars and of Bosnia itself.
<dl>
<dd>It is quite normal that one does not trust Yugoslav sources - but why do you trust Western sources??????? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a>
<dl>
<dd>That's a pretty good question. I don't really have a clear answer, but there are a few reasons that I can think of. The Western sources tend to list their own sources, so these are at least verifiable, but the English-language Yugoslav accounts (including your own!) tend not to give many - if any - sources. The other factor is that the Yugoslav sources are so heavily tainted by propaganda that it makes it difficult to work out what is factual. In theory, reputable Western observers may be a bit more objective given their physical and political distance. Maybe this is an assumption I shouldn't be making? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:36, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Heavily tainted by propaganda" are the Yugoslav sources? Aren't you referring to Western reports?!!</dd>
<dd>Come on ChrisO, how many Western newspaper reports have you seen listing sources? Please...I mean that's the problem with Western newspapers; they don't usually list footnotes and they don't often direct you to their sources. That doesn't show good credibility.</dd>

<dd>Thanks, but I'm puzzled by your assertion that I left out material about his family - I actually included a lot of information about his pre-WW2 life which you deleted. Your version had nothing on this period other than saying that he was born in Bosanski Šamac, so I felt that it needed a bit more background. But you make some fair points about the trial and the formation of the SDA. I'll address those.

<p>There's one point I need to mention - I don't think we should use the Alijaibinladen.jpg picture. Three reasons why:</p>
<p>1) Nikola has acquired permission from freesrpska.org to use the image but I'm not at all sure that that meets the requirements of the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> policy. The image actually comes from <a href="http://www.slobodnasrpska.org/mudzahedini/naputudzihada.html" class="external free" title="http://www.slobodnasrpska.org/mudzahedini/naputudzihada.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slobodnasrpska.org/mudzahedini/naputudzihada.html</a>. I don't see any copyright notices or acknowledgements on that page, so it's not clear what rights they might have. Don't forget that copyright belongs to the person or group which <i>created</i> the image and the linked video clips. One thing we can be absolutely sure of is that the person who shot the video was <i>not</i> a Serbian nationalist. Unless Nikola can provide some details of the source and its copyright status, I suggest that we ask for the picture to be deleted from the database.</p>
<p>2) The picture is entirely conjectural; it is <i>alleged</i> to show bin Laden with Izetbegovic. About all we can say for certain is that it shows Izetbegovic with a man with a very long beard (not exactly uncommon among Islamists). We don't even know that it's genuine. I would hesitate to state this for sure without some more convincing evidence than a rabidly nationalist website's assertions.</p>
<p>3) In any case, the picture is "Completely and iredeemably POV" as Nikola puts it. Given that, it probably shouldn't be included in the article in any case.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a good quality public domain picture of Izetbegovic that can be included? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:36, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I must protest at listing the NDH primarily as <i>Greater Croatia</i> and then listing its proper name and article in the parenthesis. There's really no point in such conjecturing right at the first mention, it reeks of an insinuation that I'd expect from the likes of Igor, not ChrisO who has a good record on keeping things straight.&#160;:| --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShallot_7c68.html" title="User:Shallot">Shallot</a> 00:55, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I lived in Bosnia during that very war you people seem to be disussing and whilst Alija was very pro-Muslim it is pretty much to be expected considering the very real possiblity of complete genocide.

I believe any further adding of this claim (without decent referencing) should be treated as vandalism.</p>
<p>This and other (always unreferenced and never explained in Talk) POV edits are a constant problem here.

<p>In the "Personal life and other information" section, there's a tag asking for a citation for Croat and Serb politicians denouncing Izetbegovic for his fundamentalism. The article then contains the following section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fact is Alija Izetbegovic was a Muslim fundementalist. On his orders Arab freedom fighters moved to Bosnia in as early as 1992. Some of them are still present in Bosnia in and around Tuzla, changing their names from typical Arabic to slavic sounding last names. The majority of those "freedom fighters" also recieved Bosnian passports upon arrival on Izetbegovic's orders. His connection to the terrorist group Al Qaida is undeniable.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Aside from the fact that it's not very well written, there is no citation for such claims - and anything like this should be well cited. Indeed, the fact that a citation is requested for the earlier claim of denunciation would suggest that this section should be excised until the former is cited. Therefore, I'm removing it forthwith.</p>
<p>And before anyone claims political motivation, let it be known that I'm not remotely connected to any of the ethnic groups involved in the region. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 00:37, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article does not mention that Izetbegovic was set to be indicted by the ICTY when he died. A representative of the OTP of the ICTY, Hartmann, made the following statement:</p>

<dd><i>She added to answer the second part of the question that Izetbegovic was one of the suspects under investigation as part of the current investigations, but the fact that he had died meant that all legal proceedings against him were dropped.

<dd><i>The ICTY on 23 October confirmed that former wartime Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had been under investigation for war crimes against Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats.

<p>As Tudjman and Milosevic were both on line to be indicted by the ICTY, the above might be a useful piece of info for anyone interested in Izetbegovic.<a href="../../../o/s/l/User%7EOsli73_41ba.html" title="User:Osli73">Osli73</a> 00:57, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Bosniak</b>, as I've explained above, given that Milosevic was indicted and Tudjman on line to be indicted by the ICTY, it is fair to give the reader of the article information about Izetbegovic's status vis-a-vis the ICTY. Granted, he wasn't a Milosevic or Tudjman, but apparently the ICTY did have some reason to investigate him. This is something a lot of readers are likely to want to know about.

<dd>Nah, nope. The article still fails to properly address the controversies surrounding Izetbegovic. I semi-protected the article to stop the revert war and encourage discussion on this talk page. As for the Handzar division, even if it did exist (which a dubious assertion from the start), what proven links are there between Izetbegović's personality and them, as well as Mujaheddin units (which certainly existed)? All sorts of dogs of war were present on all sides in the Bosnian conflict, and they should certainly be mentioned in <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_edc0.html" title="War in Bosnia and Herzegovina">War in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> article if properly sourced, but as long as their (and their war crimes) ties to Izetbegovic himself are only rumors, they have no place in the article. In your version, most of it remains on the level of hints that "there might be something".</dd>

<dd>Yes, there could be more about the allegations of Izetbegovic's fundamentalism (which is not confined "to Serb and Croat politicians"), but (preferably neutral) sources are required. Trust me, I saw a lot of partisanship all over the internet when I started rewriting of "Dissident and Activist" section, but many are fairly one-sided and often on the level on the debate that Izetbegovic ought not be praised by West as much. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 19:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Izetbegovic wrote what is generally regarded as his major work, Islam Between East and West, in 1980. He declared that this was not a "book of theology" but a serious attempt to define the "place of Islam in the general spectrum of ideas." Like The Islamic Declaration, it focused on the importance of Islam and the need to serve God; it consisted primarily of a dialectical argument placing Islam as the synthesis of two opposing poles in human ideals, which he placed under the headings of "Moses" and "Jesus". Unfortunately for Izetbegovic, its appearance coincided with a spate of nationalist unrest following the death of Tito, which resulted in a widespread crackdown on nationalists and dissidents across Yugoslavia. Nationalists from many parts of Yugoslavia were tried and imprisoned for activities deemed harmful to Yugoslav "brotherhood and unity."</dd>
