<p>My work has been ups &amp; downs of busy, more ups than downs. Then this summer, my employer was bought out by a competitor, whose leadership told the rank &amp; file that there would be no changes for a while, until they figured out how to combine operations in an economical way.</p>
<p>For example, the conglomerate has about a dozen factories in 3 nations, that originally were4 different companies, including ours, in which perhaps half of them are making stuff for the same customers. If we can consolidate what is being made for a customer in less factories, then with volume, we can lower cost for sourcing the raw materials, have our work force become more expert on those customers needs, be more responsive, more competitive, except for pricing.</p>
<p>The main reason we got bought out is the customers were playing us off against each other ... they ask for quotes for some new part ... then say "This other vendor quoted X ... can't you give us a better price?" Well after the bigger company heard that a few thousand times from customers, where we were named, they decided to make a bid to buy us out.</p>
<p>The statement that not much will change for a while, that may be true for the rank &amp; file, but the new leadership has a parade of what appear to be new ideas to many line managers &amp; department heads, who need help from the computer guy to implement ASAP whatever. So I have been in crisis mode for several months now. When I get home from work each day, I am exhausted.</p>
<p>I do all the ERP software work for a company that has approx 250 employees, does a few $ million business a year, sometimes called a mid-sized company.</p>
<p>Recently my boss has had me spending a lot of time reverse engineering dirty data in the accounting area, interesting but I not have a lot of experience or training there. Also he, and the auditors live and breathe Excel for data analysis, not the Data Mining Tools of the ERP, plus the company has refused to purchase good interface tools for converting data between different computer realities, meaning the process is not user friendly, meaning I am stuck with a lot of conversion efforts on an almost daily basis, to get the data they want from the dynamic systems to their Excel windows on historical data sets.</p>
<p>Another manager I doing a lot of recent work for, is the guy in charge of inventory accuracy, which I think is probably more important to the company than accounting accuracy, but the top managers are more interested in the accounting data than the data from which that is derived.</p>
<p>When I have leisure time, Wikipedia is only one of several outside interests. I still desire to contribute, but I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel at present in my day to day work, and when i do see it, probably an on-coming train. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice work. I like the cquote things by the way. Yet another thing I learnt from you. The 'yarn' (referred to above) was the piece of history "The death of W.J.

<p>I really got into a knot this morning. The response below was written with user "sopoforic" in mind,who responded to my cry for help, and as I was editing you also responded. I then had an "edit conflict" to deal with. I have not got a clue as to whether this is the best way. I simply deleted me edit to "sopoforic".</p>
<p>Thanks for such a speedy response. No there is only one Joyce Holms Scottish crime writer. The problem arose thus: I have a fairly long article on this writer but before I was prepared to submit it (since this is a first for me) I, foolishly, as it turns out, attempted to enter the name Joyce Holms, and only that, on the list of writers. This was blocked. I then found the page "Articles for Creation" (2007-01-08) and since I clearly need help I place the long article there. As far as I can see it is still there No.41 on that day. That page gave me the impression that all on it were waiting to be examined and helped (hopefully) on their way. This may be the case? I hope this clarifies my problem. Thanks again.

<p>Your little gem of article still has tiny flaw. I probably could have explained the problem better.</p>
<ul>
<li>The architects have a close connection to the Town Hall</li>
<li>A google search shows this to be true.</li>
<li>The opening occurred on June 22, <i>18</i>87.</li>
<li>The architects were around in the <i>19</i>90s.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe they were responsible for the architectural <i>assessment</i> included in the article space. They may have contributed to more recent (internal) alterations to the building. This is what I meant by <i>unlikely</i>. Hope to see more interesting pages. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred.e_8a59.html" title="User talk:Fred.e">Fred</a> 11:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not want to change it, again, without resolving our discussion. I am still not sure if you see what I see.
<ul>
<li>Architects working <b>ten years</b> ago would not be the same persons who designed the building, over <b>one hundred years</b> earlier. (Pardon my bold emphasis.)</li>

<dd>Ref? I met one of them! This is <i>not</i> of course an adequate reference.</dd>
<dd>The company Considine and Griffiths dissolved at the beginning of this year. Geoff Considine can be reached at Considine Architects in Subiaco on 9381 1744; Phil Griffiths, a conservation expert, is at 9381 1666. The 'white pages' is also not a good reference. The Molyneux report on the heritage of perth will support this. I could go on, but the onus is on editors to produce a verifiable reference supporting the edit.</dd>

<p>Glad you saw the funny side.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Suggestions. The heritage of the same period, gold boom and <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federation</a>, has public buildings that the present day suburbs are built around. Especially some of the suburbs in your major contribs. Guildford has preserved their distict and they have a very helpful information centre and heritage walks. Cinemas and theatres, like Regal, were very important in early twentieth century. One of the most interesting buildings is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth_Observatory_7551.html" title="Perth Observatory">Perth Observatory</a>, before this was built there was no accurate time in Perth.</p>
<p>But these are starting points, and can extend in all directions. Have a good look round our project (<a href="../../../w/a/_/WP%7EWA_d3b3.html" title="WP:WA">WP:WA</a>) and dig through the lists or categories. The other editors there are very helpful. Keep a look out in the real world too. You have a 'good eye' for subjects. I will drop back with some pages to start soon.</p>
<p>Here is a quick and satisfying one for you. Change "Fremantle Town Hall" at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_historic_buildings_in_Perth%2C_Western_Australia_04a7.html" title="List of historic buildings in Perth, Western Australia">List of historic buildings in Perth, Western Australia</a> to a wiki-link.

<dd>Satusuro and I send each other numerous emails every week. This is about topics that arise on wikipedia but are not about articles on it. We share gossip about WA history, for example, things that would be inappropriate to put in a public. It also keeps conversations between only two editors from cluttering up the talk pages, which are for the whole community. Wikipedia is a strange space that takes a little getting used to, I still am.

I tried to change the year of birth to 1961 which is correct ( according to IMDB) and Ali K changed it to 1967 which is incorrect.

I had to change the year of birth back to 1961 even after Ali K was provided with a lot of evidence she still refused to admit that she was wrong. Why was this Ali K?

<p>I was cheered by your approach, so thank you. I have left numerous comments with 'the boys' but did not receive a reply or any indication they had read it. This was on the talk page and their own if they missed it. Have a look in the Archive on the talk page for their (unintentionally) hilarious comments. I've tried a different track lately.

<dd>Just saying I agree broadly with your comments. They're enthusiastic but if they're *ever* to get past B-class they're going to have to take a step back and see this the way a Wikipedian with no knowledge or care of Perth, the Public Schools Association or whatever will see it. The problem isn't so much one of content but of perspective. If this is at some point addressed the will and enthusiasm is there within that group of people to see it succeed.

<p>Hi&#160;:) Thanks for that - just working on <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamersley%2C_Western_Australia_472a.html" title="Hamersley, Western Australia">Hamersley</a> to get it to FA standard and hopefully nominate it around 1 Feb. I've spent a few weeks reading up and researching at the SRO and State Library to get the documentary side of it up to scratch, as no books have (yet) been written about it. So if you see anything that could be done better in the sections that have been worked on (haven't yet got to a few), and especially on the graphics front, let me know&#160;:) <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 08:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Haha that's cool&#160;:) Was more a clarity issue than anything else as I wasn't sure if I'd missed something I should have seen.

<p>Hi Ali K, Do you remember me? I'm that poor innocent wikipedian you refused to help when they were blocked, just a quick message to let you know i've been unblocked and am back on wikipedia. I hope you don't ever need help with anything wiki-related, because you can never rely on your fellow wikipedians, as you've proved that to me.

<p>Hi Ali K, I assume you're the same Ali K who contributes to Commons. I want a photo of the head of a tulip as a logo for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Calvinism_68da.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Calvinism">WikiProject Calvinism</a> (It's a visual reference to the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_points_of_Calvinism_df2e.html" title="Five points of Calvinism">Five points of Calvinism</a>). I'm not really up to speed with image licensing and I was wondering if my reading of the licence you released Image:Tulip single.jpg under is right. Can I download your photo, crop, rotate and upload the finished product to Commons, as long as I release it under the same license and mention that you took the original photo? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlarneytherinosaur_d96a.html" title="User:Blarneytherinosaur">Blarneytherinosaur</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlarneytherinosaur_0246.html" title="User talk:Blarneytherinosaur">talk</a> 01:26, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
