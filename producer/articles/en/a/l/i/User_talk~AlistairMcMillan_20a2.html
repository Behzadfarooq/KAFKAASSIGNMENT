<p>Okay, while I'll conceed that "Ms. Warrior"'s comments many not be substantial as a reference, I don't see what is wrong with the "Copycat Issues" section, as the references for that are a well-established newspaper making its own opinion, not just re-stating a comment. Surely under Wikipedia policy it is acceptable as long as you cite it with a reference from an established and respectable source? 217.44.169.174 18:31, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, the answer to your question ("are you saying I was making personal attacks because of the Gracenote page") is no, and yes. That talk page was getting pretty heated, and some of the things that were said, I felt, were bordering on personal attacks so I left identical messages on the talk pages of everyone that seemed to be involved in the dispute reminding them to avoid personal attacks and to stay calm. I was not saying you personally made personal attacks, but simply reminding you and everyone involved to stay calm and avoid them. If you take a look at the talk page I had an idea for a way to reach a compromise, but no one seems to have paid it any attention. At any rate, no I was not saying you made personal attacks, and yes, I left that message because of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a> page. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I noticed that you managed to remove all links to third party applications that are able to handle dmg files. I really want to know why. Advertising, you claim, and maybe that is true, but it can be very valuable advertising/information to people wanting to access contents of dmg files from other operating systems than OS X. There's a lot of similar links all over wikipedia and I can't understand why you felt these specific ones were not appropriate. I write partly because I'm the author of one of these tools, DMGExtractor (which is open source and GPL'd, so there's no profit in it for me). The wiki entry has led a lot of people to my page, and I've had a lot of positive response because of it. It's a win-win situation, so why remove the link? Looking forward to an explanation... --<a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnsound_9c91.html" title="User:Unsound">Unsound</a> 07:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I just skimmed through the page you linked to, and you're probably right according to rules, as I added the link to my page myself. It kinda troubles me that the current trend in wikipedia seems to be removing as much information as possible, because it doesn't have "encyclopedic" value. The high amount of information is what made it useful for me, and probably lots of other people as well. My GPL'd app, DMGExtractor, would never have existed if it wasn't for the link I saw on the dmg page in wikipedia to the GPL program dmg2iso. I'm trying not to whine here, but I just think you're going in the wrong direction, trying to tame wikipedia too much with extensive rules... --<a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnsound_9c91.html" title="User:Unsound">Unsound</a> 03:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was some time since we communicated, but I just wanted you to know that I've redone the page with DMGExtractor, thus eliminating the annoying ad that you complained about when you felt like testing my app...&#160;:) I'm lazy, so it took me some time to deal with the issue.

<p>Come on, Alistair. I know from the past 2+ years that you are trying to keep the FAT (and other MS-related) article clean, and maybe make it a "good article" ("featured" would require some drawings at least), but please have a little patience with new significant additions - I spent maybe an hour trying to write things clearly, and to ultimately eliminate the rather vague and misplaced mention of fragmentation from the intro (not to speak about lack of cites). The discussion I added was mostly based on the already cited Ray Duncan's article about HPFS. Adam Mirowski 01:19, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adam, the problem with your contribution is that you've provided no verifiable sources.

<dd>Of course. But the Ray Duncan article is already ref #1 and Chen article about FAT32 limit is the last external link already. Don't people ever read the references, in order to recognize that newly added information was already present in them? Adam Mirowski 01:51, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I did some looking around to see if I could find a source for this. I'm pretty sure I was the one who put it into the article almost a year ago, based on information that Thurrott had published about the original list of editions. The information for Home Premium did indeed list DVD ripping... but there doesn't appear to have been any coverage of it anywhere else. Unless the feature is buried away in Media Center somewhere (which is the only place would make sense, i.e. if DRM was applied and it could be accessed on the local network), it doesn't appear to be present in the final code. Good catch. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 01:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I just moved it because footnote markers generally go at the end of a sentence, rather than in the middle.

<p>Hi Alastair, thanks for you comments. When I deleted the comments on my talk page, I wasn't doing so to hide things, it just seemed a bit strange to me to leave previous comments for me on a public page, apart from the initial one which I thought I might want to use later for help with editing. I haven't used user talk pages much, and after looking at others, I've decided it does seem to be the best action to leave the comments up.</p>
<p>I have taken into account your comment about my additions to articles, and I should probably have replied to tell you so. While I don't think my additions of references to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proprietary_software.html" title="Proprietary software">proprietary software</a> were particularly biased, the way I did so, by putting the reference in the first sentence, probably was a bit inappropriate and slightly biased. After your comment, I've decided to stop doing this, and if I do refer to a programme being proprietary, I'll do it in a less prominent and more appropriate place. I've noticed from a comment above that the user <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmax-_a23e.html" title="User:Jmax-">Jmax-</a> agrees with my addition on that particular page. With <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free (as freedom) software</a>, it is often appropriate to mention its freeness at the very beginning, because for many of these programmes, its sole reason for existing is to be free software, especially anything which is part of the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_project_03cd.html" title="GNU project">GNU project</a>, and this is a major reason for it being notable.</p>

<p>Removing contradictions and making up excuses as to how they would fit counts as original research. As it stands right now, one event is made specific in one novel, and its changed in the next.

<dd>Original research is defined as "unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position". There is nothing to indicate that Hannibal's dream, when it occured, was false. Unless Harris himself stated that it was false in <i>Hannibal</i> it should count as a contradiction. What I wrote was the simple facts of what occured without any additional commentary, which is how it should stay.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 18:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is what happened. In Hannibal, Hannibal recalls seeing his sister's teeth in a stool pit. NOTHING indicates that this is false. In Rising, Hannibal notes this is to be false. As this is DIFFERENT INFORMATION than was previously established, it is a CONTRADICTION. In the current continuity, Harris retconned it to be a figment of Hannibal's dream. I can agree with that. But NOTHING indicates that this was the case in Hannibal. The same goes to Hannibal's animal abuse. Yes, Hannibal has been nice and cruel to humans, but you can't use that to argue "Oh, well that means he was mean to animals too". Nothing indicated that in Rising he was EVER abusive to animals at any point in his life. Neither before or after Mischa's death was Hannibal shown to be cruel to animals, and if he was, Harris would have mentioned.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 21:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look. I'm not doubting the whole idea of it being a dream. Thats beside the point. What I'm trying to say is, it WASN'T FALSE in Hannibal. It was treated as fact in that particular book.

<p>I don't really think you made a good judgment call deleting the link to an interview conducted today with Rick Sternbach. Your reason of "not covering anything new" is not sufficiant and I think you should put the link back. It is current, addresses <b>Star Trek XI</b> and certainly not hurting anyone. Someone looking for information about Sternbach would probably like to read an interview with him.

If you doubt that there are problems please take a look at Apple Support discussion to see the large number of users having this particular problem. The previous version worked fine - the new one doesn't. So not a problem due to me but one due to the software team at Apple. Anyone wishing to avoid this problem shouldn't download the update.

<b>Installable file systems</b><br />
Another portability feature of NT is its ability to support many different file systems. Currently, NT supports the FAT (File Allocation Table used in DOS, Windows 95, and OS/2 systems), NTFS (Native Transactional File System introduced with Windows NT), and CDFS (CD-ROM File System). However, because of NT’s modular nature, support for additional file systems can be easily added in the future by simply creating new file system drivers and adding them to NT. This makes it relatively easy for NT to incorporate new technologies.</p>
