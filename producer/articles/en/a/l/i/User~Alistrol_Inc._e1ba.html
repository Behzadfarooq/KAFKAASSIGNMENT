	    <p>High blood pressure is a condition that afflicts millions of Americans and Canadians. Physicians monitor blood pressure and urge their patients to change their diet and exercise habits and to take medications, all in an effort to get their blood-pressure numbers into an acceptable range. Physicians routinely prescribe an ever-expanding array of medications aimed at lowering blood pressure. Alistrol is the #1 natural supplement proven to regulate your blood pressure and provide the best in heart health maintenance. Alistrol does not merely treat high-blood-pressure symptoms; its effects go further, to mitigate some of the underlying causes of high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Alistrol is a truly different blood-pressure-reducing supplement — a brand-new, all-natural approach to mitigating stubborn and dangerous high-blood-pressure conditions.</p>
<p>Alistrol has fine credentials. For instance, its formula was highlighted at the 2003 Inter-American Society for Hypertension Conference, sponsored by the American Heart Association. Its three major natural ingredients work synergistically with each other.</p>
<p>Alistrol is not your run-of-the-mill blood-pressure supplement. Its ingredients have been used in China for literally thousands of years, and only recently 'rediscovered' by one of today’s most innovative nutritional formulators.</p>
<p>Alistrol works for some people who have tried many other remedies without success. It has no known interactions with prescription high-blood-pressure medicines; you don't have to risk stopping your other therapies in order to try out Alistrol.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll find inside Alistrol's patented, natural, organic formula:</p>
<p>Holly Leaf (Ilex aquifolium). For centuries now, holly leaf has been used as a tea in the mountains of southern China; the people there — leisurely sipping this tea — live serene, unhurried lives. Generally speaking, these folks don’t have high blood pressure. The dramatic therapeutic effect that this wonderful holly leaf can have on high blood pressure has only recently come to the attention of modern medical science. One pharmacological study found that the herb could enhance overall blood circulation by expanding blood vessels, while also helping to diminish cholesterol. What’s more, holly leaf is a mood elevator — many people who take Alistrol, notice a feeling of calm wash over them. (More on that topic in a few paragraphs.) Daikon Seed Extract (Raphanus sativus). 'Daikon' (in Japanese, 'large root') is a large, mild radish much esteemed in Asian cuisine, often served grated with sushi and sashimi. And, in traditional Chinese herbal medicine, radish seed is recognized as a wonderful digestive aid. But modern medicine has also found that compounds in daikon seed in particular can help to normalize blood pressure and cholesterol, while improving overall cardiovascular health. Its main effect, according to Chinese tradition, is to enhance a person’s vital energy circulation.</p>
<p>Chinese Hawthorn Fruit (Crataegus pinnatifida). Pharmacological studies indicate that Chinese hawthorn fruit can improve heart function, repair heart- muscle damage, enhance blood flow by dilating heart vessels, reduce arrhythmia, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. You’ve probably heard of it before — the American version is found in many blood-pressure formulas at health-food stores. In the case of Alistrol, Chinese hawthorn fruit has a profound synergistic effect on the other two ingredients.</p>
<p>So… Does Alistrol really work?</p>
<p><br />
The bars indicate the average Systolic &amp; Diastolic Blood Pressures at the end of 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. Subjects in this graph took Alistrol.</p>
<p>This is probably a first: The exciting results from a University of Maine study on Alistrol were featured as a highlighted presentation at the 2003 Inter-American Society for Hypertension Conference.</p>
<p>Those exciting results? In that FDA-approved study, the average drop in systolic pressure (the first, higher number) was 14.2… and the average drop in diastolic pressure (the second, lower number) was 9.9! Plus, Alistrol achieved an impressive 90% efficacy in the tests — 9 out of 10 Alistrol takers experienced a beneficial effect. And that was during a test duration of only six weeks!</p>
<p>Now… those results alone would be credible, important news for someone who has suffered from this quiet killer of a disease. But it’s what the study also found that really demands attention: Four weeks AFTER the study, the study participants who had achieved normalized blood pressures through Alistrol’s help still enjoyed blood pressures in the normal range. Alistrol’s benefits had persisted for a while, even after the study participants were no longer taking it.</p>
<p>These results are important, because they imply that Alistrol’s effect was not just a one-time-only 'chemical reaction' comparable to that achieved by prescription remedies. Something else must have been going on here — perhaps some positive change at a deeper physiological level.</p>
<p>So, try Alistrol today and make this safe and most effective natural high blood pressure supplement part of your daily regime and live a life of happiness and longevity. The Power To Live Stronger!</p>
<p>Benefits of Using Alistrol High Blood Pressure Supplement</p>
<p>• Clinically tested, 90% efficacy • Improves blood circulation • Supports arterial elasticity • Helps maintain healthy arteries • Enhances cardiovascular health • Helps support blood flow and central and peripheral vascular circulation • No known side effects • Doctor Recommended • Guaranteed Results</p>
<p>So, in short, the time-tested ingredients in Alistrol can…</p>
<p>Help you to maintain the healthy, elastic arteries that you want and need as you get older.</p>
<p>Support your peripheral vascular circulation — the vital blood vessels outside your heart and brain.</p>
<p>Aid healthy blood flow to your heart itself.</p>
<p>Help to support normal blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, through which your blood gets pumped to your lungs.</p>
<p>Help support normal blood pressure over the long term.</p>
<p>And, all this without any known side effects. You can, in fact, take Alistrol along with your current drug medication. There is no known adverse interaction. Actually, people have reported a positive interaction between Alistrol and their other medications.</p>
<p>You know the term 'hypertension' only too well, right?</p>
<p>Well, what about 'hypotensive?' This adjective describes anything that reduces blood pressure.</p>
<p>Alistrol with holly leaf may have a powerful effect on your central nervous system. Its patented formula — due largely to compounds in its special variety of holly leaf — may work to relax your central nervous system… which, of course, relaxes you. And, when you’re relaxed, your blood pressure naturally tends to drop. You experience a wonderful hypotensive effect.</p>
<p>Although Alistrol is far more than just the sum of its parts, the creator of Alistrol calls the holly leaf herb ingredient in particular a “secret weapon.” That’s appropriate, because it has a relaxing, mood-elevating effect that people who have participated in some of the Alistrol studies have noticed. In fact, in one study, participants who had already lowered their blood pressure with Alistrol also commented about “being in a better mood” and “having more energy.”</p>

<p>Q-What is normal blood pressure?</p>
<p>Normal blood pressure is less than 130 mm Hg systolic (as the heart beats) and less than 85 mm Hg diastolic (as the heart relaxes)</p>
<p>Q-What is high blood pressure?</p>
<p>Blood pressure is considered high if it is above the optimal levels. Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher is considered high blood pressure. High blood pressure is defined by the College of Family Physicians of Canada as "hypertension that occurs when your blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than normal" (CFPCA, 2006).</p>
<p>Q- Why high blood pressure is harmful?</p>
<p>It is estimated that one in every four Americans has high blood pressure. Once it develops it can last a lifetime. It is considered as a silent killer as it has no warning signs or symptoms. High blood pressure has harmful affects on all the body systems especially on vital organs, i.e brain, heart and kidneys. Hypertension increases the risk of developing heart diseases. It also is associated with kidney diseases and stroke.</p>
<p><br />
Q-Who can develop High Blood Pressure?</p>
<p>Anyone can develop high blood pressure but it is more common in: • African Americans- get it earlier and more often then Caucasians. • Old age- 60% of Americans over 60 have hypertension. • Overweight. • Family history of high blood pressure •</p>
<p>Q- How do I know that I have High Blood pressure?</p>
<p>Some people with high blood pressure are asymptomatic, whereas others may experience headache, blurring of vision, fatigue, palpitation, numbness, numbness and tingling of feet and hand, etc.</p>
<p>Q- How can my doctor know that I have High Blood pressure?</p>
<p>Your doctor may take measurements of blood pressure on several occasions. A persistent high reading of 140/90 or higher indicates high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Q- How high blood pressure affects the Brain?</p>
<p>Hypertension or high blood pressure is a major cause of stroke. Increased pressure in the blood vessels can rupture it thereby causing bleeding in the brain. High blood pressure promotes clotting which can block the narrowed arteries in the brain.</p>
<p>Q- How high blood pressure affects the heart?</p>
<p>High blood pressure is a known cause of heart diseases. It may deprive the heart muscles of oxygen, causing chest pain, also called as angina. If the blood flow to the heart is totally blocked, it is called heart attack. High blood pressure can also result in heart failure, a condition when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s requirement.</p>
<p>Q- How high blood pressure affects the Kidney?</p>
<p>Kidneys functions to filter the blood remove and dispose the toxins from the body. High blood pressure may constrict the blood vessel wall making filtration difficult. As a result, toxins may accumulate in the body. In severe cases, the kidneys may fail altogether.</p>
<p>Q- How high blood pressure affects the eyes?</p>
<p>Blood vessels in the eye may break and bleed due to high blood pressure. It may lead to blurred vision or even blindness.</p>
<p><br />
Q- How is high blood pressure treated?</p>
<p>High blood pressure can be treated by lifestyle changes, weight management and medications.</p>
<p><br />
Q-How can I prevent High blood pressure?</p>
<p>High blood pressure is preventable by modifying few factors. • Adopt a healthy life style • Limit sodium • Weight management • Healthy eating • Exercise • Avoid alcohol and smoking • Manage Stress</p>
<p>Q: What is high blood pressure?</p>
<p>High blood pressure is defined by the College of Family Physicians of Canada as "hypertension that occurs when your blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than normal" (CFPCA, 2006).</p>
<p>Q: What causes high blood pressure?</p>
<p>The College of Family Physicians of Canada state the "exact cause isn't known" because high blood pressure is subject to change often during the day depending on many factors" (CFPCA, 2006). Therefore the College of Family Physicians strongly urges that you consult with a physician in order to determine whether you have high blood pressure, and if so how to prevent heart disease and stroke (CFPCA, 2006). It is recommended by the College of Family Physicians that you "should have your blood pressure taken once every year or two by your doctor" (CFPCA, 2006). Statistics according to www.AmericanHeart.org High blood pressure (hypertension) killed 52,602 Americans in 2003. • About 65 million Americans age 20 and older have high blood pressure. • Nearly one in three adults has high blood pressure. • Of those people with high blood pressure, 63.4 percent are aware of their condition.</p>
<p>Q: How many Alistrol capsules should I take everyday?</p>
<p>If your blood pressure readings are above the optimal range, that is above 130/80, we recommend that you take 2 capsules each time, two to three times a day. We find many people get optimal results when they take Alistrol three times a day and highly recommend you do so. When your blood pressure gets back to optimal range (120/80), you can take one to two Alistrol capsules each time, once to twice a day to maintain healthy blood pressure.</p>
<p>Q: How long will it take me to finish one bottle of Alistrol?</p>
<p>There are 120 capsules (420 mg/capsule) in each bottle of Alistrol. If you take normal dosage of two capsules each time twice a day, it will take you 30 days to finish a bottle of Alistrol. Some people find it more beneficial to take larger dosage. For example, you may get better results if you take 2 capsules each time, three times a day. If you do so, you will finish one bottle of Alistrol in 20 days. For people who have optimal blood pressure, you can take one Alistrol capsule each time, once or twice a day for supporting healthy blood pressure. In this case, you may finish one bottle of Alistrol in 120 days (once a day) or 60 days (twice a day).</p>
<p>Q: How can Alistrol help me support healthy blood pressure?</p>
<p>Alistrol supports healthy blood pressure by promoting more elastic blood vessels, improving blood circulation, and relaxing your central nervous system. It does not simply mechanically lower your blood pressure. It improves your cardiovascular and arterial health.</p>
<p>Q: When can I expect to see improvement in my blood pressure when I take Alistrol?</p>
<p>You should be able to see some improvement on your blood pressure in 10 days. Alistrol promotes healthy blood pressure by improving arterial and cardiovascular health. You should, however, give it about 2 to 8 weeks to take full effect. In a double blind, placebo controlled, clinical study, people obtained significant improvements in their blood pressure readings after taking Alistrol for two months. For some people, their blood pressure starts to improve after taking Alistrol for two weeks. For others, it takes more than a month. We find some people need larger dosages, such as 2 capsules each time, three times a day, to significantly improve their blood pressure. If you haven't seen improvement on your blood pressure in one or two months, please try a bigger dosage or take it for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Q: Can I still take Alistrol if I am taking prescription drugs?</p>
<p>Yes, you can take Alistrol with your prescription drugs. Alistrol is made of holly leaf tea extract, hawthorn fruit extract, and radish seed extract. It is as safe as most food. No adverse drug interactions have been found or reported so far. Many people take Alistrol with their prescription drugs. We have not received any report of harmful or side effects. In fact, some people find Alistrol helps enhance the efficacy of their medication, reduces the side effects of drugs, and improves their energy level and mood. Your blood pressure may be greatly improved after taking Alistrol. However, by no means should you stop taking your prescription drugs without consulting your doctor.</p>
<p>Q: Should I continue taking Alistrol when my blood pressure gets back to normal after taking Alistrol?</p>
<p>Yes, you should keep taking Alistrol even after your blood pressure is back to optimal range. You can consider taking a lesser dosage of one (1) capsule once or twice a day. We find that when people get their blood pressure back within a normal range after taking Alistrol, their blood pressure will remain healthy even after they stop taking Alistrol. However, for some people, their blood pressure remains at healthy levels after they stop taking Alistrol. But, we recommend that you continue taking Alistrol to maintain healthy blood pressure and cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Q: Does Alistrol cause allergies?</p>
<p>No. We have not found any allergic reactions to Alistrol.</p>
<p>Q: What is your guarantee in case it doesn't work?</p>
<p>You must be happy at all times. If you are not satisfied, simply return the unused portion within 30 days for a FULL MERCHANDISE REFUND, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Q: What is “randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study”?</p>
<p>Randomized double blind, placebo controlled studies are the gold standard of scientific research.</p>
<p>Q: What if I miss a serving?</p>
<p>Since this is not a drug, it is not problematic if you miss a serving. If you forget to take it in the morning, just take it later in the day when you remember. If you forget completely, just take the next day’s serving in the morning with breakfast. There is no need to ‘double-up’ in an attempt to catch up.</p>
<p>Q: What is your shipping policy?</p>
<p>Standard shipping in the U.S. and Canada is $ 14, and all customer orders are shipped via United States Postal Service. Customer orders are shipped within 24 hours of order confirmation and arrival time for customer orders are 3-4 busines days for U.S. Canada &amp; Caribbean.
