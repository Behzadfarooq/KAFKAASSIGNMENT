<p><b>Alice Cooper</b> (born <b>Vincent Damon Furnier</b>, <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>), is a <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock</a> singer, songwriter and musician whose career spans four decades. With a stage show that featured guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood and boa constrictors, Cooper drew equally from <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_movies.html" title="Horror movies">horror movies</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaudeville.html" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> to create a theatrical brand of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_rock.html" title="Hard rock">rock music</a> that would come to be known as <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_rock.html" title="Shock rock">shock rock</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Alice Cooper" was originally a band name with frontman Vincent Furnier portraying the lead persona. In 1974 Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and launched a successful solo career. Since their first <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_%28music%29.html" title="Single (music)">single</a> release in 1966, when the band was known as "The Spiders", the original Alice Cooper band broke into the international music mainstream with the 1972 hit "<a href="../../../s/c/h/School%27s_Out_%28song%29_533b.html" title="School's Out (song)">School's Out</a>" and reached their commercial peak with the 1973 <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album.html" title="Album">album</a> "<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion_Dollar_Babies_28c9.html" title="Billion Dollar Babies">Billion Dollar Babies</a>".

<p>Vincent Furnier was born in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> to Ether Moroni Furnier and Ella Mae McCart. His grandfather, Thurman Sylvester Furnier, was an ordained Apostle of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_%28Bickertonite%29_3e94.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)">Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)</a>. Vincent's father was an ordained Elder. Vincent has some distant <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> <a href="../../../h/u/g/Huguenot.html" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestry; the remainder of his ancestry was <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a> and Scottish. After a series of childhood illnesses, Vincent and the Furniers moved to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>.</p>
<p>As a teenager Furnier attended <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale_Union_High_School_District_c4b0.html" title="Glendale Union High School District">Cortez High School</a> in northern Phoenix. In 1965, Furnier was eager to take part in the local annual Letterman's <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talent_show.html" title="Talent show">talent show</a> and gathered fellow <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_country_running.html" title="Cross country running">cross-country</a> <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team.html" title="Team">teammates</a> from the school to form a group for the show. They named themselves "The Earwigs", and as they didn't know how to play any <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_instrument.html" title="Musical instrument">instruments</a> at the time, they dressed up like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mime.html" title="Mime">mimed</a> their performance to Beatles songs. As a result of winning the talent show and loving the experience of being onstage, the group immediately proceeded to learn how to play instruments. Furnier could sing and would learn the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonica.html" title="Harmonica">harmonica</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Buxton_b4e1.html" title="Glen Buxton">Glen Buxton</a> - <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_guitar.html" title="Lead guitar">lead guitar</a>, John Tatum - <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm_guitar.html" title="Rhythm guitar">rhythm guitar</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Dunaway_016c.html" title="Dennis Dunaway">Dennis Dunaway</a> - <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a>, and John Speer - <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum.html" title="Drum">drums</a>. Musically, the group were inspired by artists such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janis_Joplin_70f1.html" title="Janis Joplin">Janis Joplin</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kinks_a7b7.html" title="The Kinks">The Kinks</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, and in particular <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Yardbirds_9c9b.html" title="The Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a>.</p>
<p>In 1966, with Cortez High footballer <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Owen_Bruce_5c36.html" title="Michael Owen Bruce">Michael Bruce</a> replacing John Tatum on guitar, the members of The Earwigs graduated from Cortez High School and renamed themselves "The Spiders". The band scored a local #1 radio hit with "Why Don't You Love Me", an original composition from their first single release. In 1967 the band renamed themselves "The Nazz" and drummer Jim Speers was replaced by <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Smith_1cba.html" title="Neal Smith">Neal Smith</a>. However, upon learning that <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Rundgren_d96f.html" title="Todd Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> also had a band called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nazz_52fc.html" title="The Nazz">The Nazz</a>, the band were again in need of another stage name. Furnier recognized that the group needed a <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimmick.html" title="Gimmick">gimmick</a> to succeed, and that other bands were not exploiting the showmanship potential of the stage. He subsequently chose the band's name to be "Alice Cooper" and adopted this stage name as his own. Early press releases claimed that the name was agreed upon after one of Cooper's <a href="../../../o/u/i/Ouija.html" title="Ouija">Ouija</a> sessions, and learning that he was a reincarnation of a 17th century <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witch</a> of the same name. However, Cooper in later interviews has said the name actually came out of thin air conjuring an image of "a cute, sweet, little girl with a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatchet.html" title="Hatchet">hatchet</a> behind her back." It was once said to be an inside joke associated with a <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayberry_RFD_1634.html" title="Mayberry RFD">Mayberry RFD</a></i> character. Alice Cooper is also the name of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Cooper_6f41.html" title="Betty Cooper">Betty Cooper</a>'s mother in the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie.html" title="Archie">Archie</a> comic strips. Nonetheless, at the time Cooper and the band figured that the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept.html" title="Concept">concept</a> of a male playing the role of an <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgynous.html" title="Androgynous">androgynous</a> witch, wearing tattered womens' clothing and <a href="../../../m/a/k/Make-up.html" title="Make-up">make-up</a> would definitely have the potential to cause quite a social <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a>.</p>
<p>The classic Alice Cooper group <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line-up.html" title="Line-up">line-up</a> consisted of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a> Alice Cooper, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_guitarist.html" title="Lead guitarist">lead guitarist</a> Glen Buxton, <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm_guitarist.html" title="Rhythm guitarist">rhythm guitarist</a> Michael Bruce, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bassist.html" title="Bassist">bassist</a> Dennis Dunaway, and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drummer.html" title="Drummer">drummer</a> Neal Smith. All of the band members except Neal were on the Cortez High School cross-country team. Original drummer, Jim Spears, was the team equipment manager. Many of Alice's stage "effects" were inspired by their cross-country coach, Emmit Smith, who also was the journalism teacher. One of Smith's class projects was to build a working guillotine for slicing watermelons. Cooper, Buxton and Dunaway were also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a> students, and their admiration of the works of <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealist.html" title="Surrealist">surrealist</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artists.html" title="Artists">artists</a> such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a> would further inspire their future stage antics.</p>
<p>After moving to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> in 1968, the band enlisted Shep Gordon as their <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_manager.html" title="Music manager">manager</a>, who managed to strike an audition for the band with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a> and renowned <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>, who was looking to sign up bizarre music acts for his new record label, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Records_6ba7.html" title="Straight Records">Straight Records</a>. For the audition Zappa told them to come to his house "at 8:00", and the band mistakenly assumed he meant 8:00 AM. Waking Zappa up from his slumber, a band that was willing to play that particular brand of psychedelic rock at 8 in the morning, a time unbeknownst to most in the rock music world, impressed him enough to sign the band to a three-album deal. Alice Cooper's first album <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretties_For_You_a753.html" title="Pretties For You">Pretties For You</a> was released in 1969 and, though it touched the US charts for one week at #193, was ultimately met with critical and commercial failure.</p>
<p>Even though the band incorporated theatrics into their stage act from the outset, a chance case of the press misreporting an unrehearsed stage routine involving Cooper and a live <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chicken</a> led to the band changing, tack—capitalizing on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloids.html" title="Tabloids">tabloid</a> <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">sensationalism</a>, and creating a new subgenre, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_rock.html" title="Shock rock">shock rock</a>. Cooper claims that the "Chicken Incident", which took place at the Toronto <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll_revival.html" title="Rock and roll revival">Rock 'n Roll Revival</a> concert in September 1969, was an accident. A chicken somehow made its way onstage during Alice Cooper's performance, and not having any experience around livestock, Cooper thought "Chickens have wings, so they must be able to fly" so Cooper picked it up and threw it out over the crowd, with the intention of having the chicken fly away. But chickens cannot fly particularly well, and the bird plummeted into the crowd and was reportedly ripped to shreds by the rowdy audience. The next day the incident made the front page of many national newspapers. Zappa phoned him shortly afterwards to ask if the story, which reported that Cooper had bit the head off the live chicken and drank its blood onstage, was true. Cooper denied the rumor, whereupon Zappa told him, "Well, whatever you do, don't tell anyone you didn't do it". <a href="http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/marilyn2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/marilyn2.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Zappa considered that kind of publicity priceless for the band.</p>
<p>Despite the infamy the band received from the Chicken Incident, their second album, <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_Action_dc02.html" title="Easy Action">Easy Action</a></i> released in 1970, met with the same fate as its <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predecessor.html" title="Predecessor">predecessor</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._Records_a338.html" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> then purchased Straight Records from Frank Zappa and the Alice Cooper group was set to receive a higher level of promotion with this major label. It was around this time that the band, fed up with the Californians' indifference and general dislike to their act, relocated to Cooper's birthplace, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, where their bizarre stage act was much better received. Detroit would remain the act's steady home base until 1972. "LA just didn’t get it. They were all on the wrong drug for us. They were on acid and we were basically drinking beer.

<p>In 1970, after their first two albums on Straight Records, the band was teamed up, by the insistence of their new label master <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._Records_a338.html" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>, with fledging producer <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Ezrin_63c5.html" title="Bob Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> for their third album, the final of three in their original Straight Records contract, to be entitled <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_It_to_Death_8da4.html" title="Love It to Death">Love It to Death</a></i>. This album would be the first of 8 Alice Cooper group and solo albums done with Ezrin who is credited with having helped create and develop the band's definitive sound. Their first hit single soon followed, 1971's "<a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_Eighteen_20ef.html" title="I'm Eighteen">I'm Eighteen</a>". The band's trailblazing mix of glam and increasingly violent stage theatrics stood out amongst bearded, denim-clad hippy bands by sporting tight sequined costumes by the prominent rock fashion designer Cindy Dunaway (Pink Floyd, The Who), and stage shows that involved mock fights and Gothic torture modes being imposed on Cooper whose androgynous stage role now incorporated a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">villainous</a> side posing a threat to society. With Cooper needing to be punished for his immoral ways, the first execution instrument was incorporated into the show - the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Chair_8bd1.html" title="Electric Chair">Electric Chair</a>. Cooper's outspoken views on the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> stood out no less, as Cooper was always staunchly pro-war—in stark contrast to the vast majority of musicians at the time, who were rebelliously anti-war<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>. The success of the band's single, the album, and their tour of 1971, which saw their first tour of Europe to massive success (audience members reportedly included <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>), was enough encouragement for Warner Bros. to offer them a new multi-album contract.</p>
<p>The follow-up album <i><a href="../../../k/i/l/Killer_%28album%29.html" title="Killer (album)">Killer</a></i>, released in late-1971, continued the commercial success of "Love It To Death" and included further singles success with "Under My Wheels", "Be My Lover" in 1972, and "Halo Of Flies" which was a Top 10 hit in the Netherlands. Thematically, "Killer" expanded on the villainous side of Cooper's androgynous stage role with its music more becoming the soundtrack to the group's morality-based stage show, which by then featured a <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boa_Constrictor_3afd.html" title="Boa Constrictor">Boa Constrictor</a> hugging him onstage, the murderous axe chopping of bloodied "dead babies", and the choice of execution had developed into death by hanging - The <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallows.html" title="Gallows">Gallows</a>. By mid-1972 the Alice Cooper show had become infamous, what they really needed then was a smash hit. That summer saw the release of the appropriately-titled single <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/School%27s_Out_%28song%29_533b.html" title="School's Out (song)">School's Out</a></i>. It went Top 10 in the US, was a #1 single in the UK, and remains a staple on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_rock.html" title="Classic rock">classic rock</a> radio to this day. Their smash hit had arrived. <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/School%27s_Out_%28album%29_305f.html" title="School's Out (album)">School's Out</a></i> the album reached #2 on the US charts and sold over a million copies. The band now relocated to their new mansion in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. With Cooper's onstage androgynous persona completely replaced with <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoiled_brat.html" title="Spoiled brat">brattiness</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machismo.html" title="Machismo">machismo</a>, the band's travelling carnival of filth and terror cemented their success with their subsequent US and European tours, winning over idol fans in droves while horrifying parents and outraging the social <a href="../../../e/s/t/Establishment.html" title="Establishment">establishment</a>. Beneath the surface, however, the repetitive schedule of recording and touring had begun to take its toll on the band. By then, Cooper, who was under constant pressure of "getting into character" for that night's show, was consistently sighted nursing a can of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>.</p>

<p><i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion_Dollar_Babies_28c9.html" title="Billion Dollar Babies">Billion Dollar Babies</a></i>, released in February 1973, was the band's most commercially successful album, reaching #1 in both the US and UK. "Elected", a 1972 Top 10 UK hit included on the album which inspired one of the first MTV-style story-line promo videos ever made for a song (three years before Queen's promo video to "<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Rhapsody_f7ac.html" title="Bohemian Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>"), was followed by two more UK Top 10 singles, "Hello Hooray" and "No More Mr Nice Guy", the latter of which was the last UK single from the album; it reached #25 in the US. The title track, featuring guest vocals by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donovan.html" title="Donovan">Donovan</a>, was also a US hit single.</p>
<p>With a string of successful <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_album.html" title="Concept album">concept albums</a> and several hit singles, the band continued their gruelling schedule and toured the US once again. Attempts by politicians and pressure groups to ban their shocking act only served to fuel the myth of Alice Cooper and generate more audience interest. Their 1973 US tour broke box office records previously set by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> and raised rock theatrics to a new level. The multi-level stage show by then featured numerous special effects including Billion Dollar Bills, decapitated baby dolls and mannequins, a Dental psychosis scene complete with dancing teeth, and the ultimate execution prop and highlight of the show - The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillotine.html" title="Guillotine">Guillotine</a>. The guillotine and other stage effects were designed for the band by magician <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Randi_0c19.html" title="James Randi">James Randi</a>, and during some of the shows, Randi appeared onstage as the executioner. By this stage, the Alice Cooper group had reached its peak in every way and were the biggest band in the industry. Cooper's stage antics would influence later bands like <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_%28band%29.html" title="Kiss (band)">Kiss</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%C3%96yster_Cult_2e36.html" title="Blue Öyster Cult">Blue Öyster Cult</a>, and <a href="../../../w/2E/a/W.A.S.P._2420.html" title="W.A.S.P.">W.A.S.P.</a>.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle_of_Love_b574.html" title="Muscle of Love">Muscle of Love</a></i>, released at the end of 1973, was to be the last studio album from the classic line-up, and marked Alice Cooper's last UK Top 20 single of the 1970s with "Teenage Lament 74". A <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_song.html" title="Theme song">theme song</a> was recorded for the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> movie <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Gun_%28film%29_5eb8.html" title="The Man with the Golden Gun (film)">The Man with the Golden Gun</a></i>, but a different song of the same name by <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lulu_%28singer%29.html" title="Lulu (singer)">Lulu</a> was chosen instead.</p>
<p>By 1974, the "Muscle Of Love" album had not matched the top-charting success of its predecessor and with constant disagreements within the band, with Cooper wanting to retain the theatrics in the show that had brought them so much attention whilst the rest of the group thought it should be toned down and concentrate more on the music which had given them credibility, the band decided to take a much-needed hiatus for the first time. During this time, Cooper relocated back to Los Angeles and started appearing regularly on TV shows such as <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Squares_6908.html" title="Hollywood Squares">Hollywood Squares</a>, and Warner Bros. released the <i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Cooper%27s_Greatest_Hits_e66c.html" title="Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits">Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits</a></i> compilation album which performed better than "Muscle Of Love", reaching into the US Top 10. However, the band's feature film <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_To_See_You_Again%2C_Alice_Cooper_4e84.html" title="Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper">Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper</a></i> (mainly concert footage with a faint storyline and 'comedic' sketches woven throughout), released on a minor theatrical run mostly to drive-in theaters, saw little box office success.</p>
<p>As some of the band members had proceeded in recording solo albums, Cooper decided to do the same. Collaborating with producer Bob Ezrin and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a>'s guitarist <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Wagner_165b.html" title="Dick Wagner">Dick Wagner</a>, and supported by Lou Reed's backing band, the project eventually resulted with <i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_To_My_Nightmare_6b5a.html" title="Welcome To My Nightmare">Welcome To My Nightmare</a></i>. Spearheaded by the US Top 20 hit "Only Women Bleed", a ballad, the solo album was released by <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Records_25c4.html" title="Atlantic Records">Atlantic Records</a> in March 1975 and became a Top 10 hit for Cooper. It was a concept album, based on the nightmare of a child named Steven, featuring narration by classic horror movie film star <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Price_ab84.html" title="Vincent Price">Vincent Price</a> (several years before he guested on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "<a href="../../../t/h/r/Thriller_%28song%29.html" title="Thriller (song)">Thriller</a>"), and served as the soundtrack to Cooper's new stage show, which included more theatrics than ever (including an 8-feet tall furry <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclops.html" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> whom Cooper decapitates and kills). Accompanying the album and stage show was the TV special "The Nightmare", starring Cooper and Vincent Price in person, which aired on US prime-time TV in April 1975 and was regarded as another groundbreaking point in rock history as the first rock music video album ever made (it was later released on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_video.html" title="Home video">home video</a> in 1983 and gained a Grammy Awards nomination for <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Long_Form_Music_Video_e7d2.html" title="Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video">Best Long Form Music Video</a>). Adding to all that, a concert film, also called <i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_to_My_Nightmare_%28film%29_e8d5.html" title="Welcome to My Nightmare (film)">Welcome to My Nightmare</a></i> and filmed live at London's <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Arena_520e.html" title="Wembley Arena">Wembley Arena</a> in September 1975, was released to theatres in 1976. Though it failed at the box office, it later became a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_movie.html" title="Midnight movie">midnight movie</a> favorite and a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_classic.html" title="Cult classic">cult classic</a>. Such was the immense success of this solo project that Cooper decided to continue as a solo artist and the original band was defunct. It is during this time that he co-founded the drinking club <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollywood_Vampires_236e.html" title="The Hollywood Vampires">The Hollywood Vampires</a>, contributing to his ample appetite for <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcohol</a>.</p>
<p>Following the 1976 US Top 20 hit "I Never Cry", another ballad, two albums, <i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Cooper_Goes_to_Hell_dfcf.html" title="Alice Cooper Goes to Hell">Alice Cooper Goes to Hell</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/a/c/Lace_and_Whiskey_ca7a.html" title="Lace and Whiskey">Lace and Whiskey</a></i>, and another ballad hit, the US Top 10 "You and Me", it became clear from regularly shambled performances on his US tour of 1977 that the musician was in dire need of specialized help with his <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a>. Following the tour, Cooper had himself hospitalized into a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanitarium.html" title="Sanitarium">sanitarium</a> for treatment, during which time the live album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Alice_Cooper_Show_8ae6.html" title="The Alice Cooper Show">The Alice Cooper Show</a></i> was released. At his alcoholic peak some fans rumored that he was up to two cases of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budweiser_%28Anheuser-Busch%29_c6c1.html" title="Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)">Budweiser</a> and a bottle of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a> a day. His experience in the sanitarium was the inspiration for his 1978 semi-autobiographical album <i><a href="../../../f/r/o/From_The_Inside_3eb7.html" title="From The Inside">From The Inside</a></i>, which Cooper co-wrote with <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Taupin_e8c0.html" title="Bernie Taupin">Bernie Taupin</a>. The release spawned another US Top 20 hit "How You Gonna See Me Now", yet another ballad, based on his fear of how his wife would warm to him after hospitalization. The subsequent tour's stage show was based inside an asylum, and was filmed for Cooper's first home video release, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strange_Case_of_Alice_Cooper_7e6c.html" title="The Strange Case of Alice Cooper">The Strange Case of Alice Cooper</a>", in 1979.</p>
<p>Around this time, Cooper led celebrities in raising money to remodel the famous <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Sign_a9b2.html" title="Hollywood Sign">Hollywood Sign</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>.

<p>Cooper's albums from the beginning of the 1980s, <i><a href="../../../f/l/u/Flush_the_Fashion_08ed.html" title="Flush the Fashion">Flush the Fashion</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Forces_%28Alice_Cooper_album%29_99b0.html" title="Special Forces (Alice Cooper album)">Special Forces</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipper_Catches_Skin_5b81.html" title="Zipper Catches Skin">Zipper Catches Skin</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../d/a/d/DaDa_f989.html" title="DaDa">DaDa</a></i>, were not as commercially successful as his past releases. <i>Flush the Fashion</i>, produced by <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> producer <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Thomas_Baker_c25d.html" title="Roy Thomas Baker">Roy Thomas Baker</a>, has a sparse, edgy musical sound that was so unexpected as to have been truly baffling to long-time fans, but yielded the US Top 40 hit "Clones (We're All)". The album <i>Special Forces</i> featured a more accessible form of New Wave style, and included a new version of "Generation Landslide". The following album, <i>Zipper Catches Skin</i> was a more <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_pop.html" title="Power pop">power pop</a>-oriented recording, with lots of high-energy guitar-driven quirky songs. These albums continued with the experimental "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave</a>" sound with energetic results, while 1983 marked the return collaboration of producer <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Ezrin_63c5.html" title="Bob Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> and guitarist <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Wagner_165b.html" title="Dick Wagner">Dick Wagner</a> with the haunting epic <i>DaDa</i>, the final album in his Warner Bros. contract.</p>
<p>In 1983, after the recording of <i><a href="../../../d/a/d/DaDa_f989.html" title="DaDa">DaDa</a></i>, Cooper was re-hospitalized for alcoholism. In a deathly state of health Cooper relocated back to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, to the support of family and old friends and to save his <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> from falling apart. Alice was finally clean and <a href="../../../s/o/b/Sober.html" title="Sober">sober</a> by the time "DaDa" and "The Nightmare" home video (of his 1975 TV Special) were released in the fall of that year, however both releases performed under expectation. Even with "The Nightmare" scoring a nomination for 1984's <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Long_Form_Music_Video_e7d2.html" title="Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video">Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video</a> (he lost to <a href="../../../d/u/r/Duran_Duran_0e68.html" title="Duran Duran">Duran Duran</a>), it wasn't enough for Warner Bros. to keep Cooper on their books. In 1984 Alice Cooper was, for the first time in his career, a free agent.</p>
<p>After a year on hiatus, and starring in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../b/-/g/B-grade.html" title="B-grade">B-grade</a> <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_movie.html" title="Horror movie">horror movie</a> production <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Dog_bd21.html" title="Monster Dog">Monster Dog</a></i>, Cooper sought to pick up the pieces of his musical career and, in 1985, met and began songwriting with guitarist <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kane_Roberts_98b2.html" title="Kane Roberts">Kane Roberts</a>. Cooper was subsequently signed to <a href="../../../m/c/a/MCA_Records_8b22.html" title="MCA Records">MCA Records</a>, and appeared as guest vocalist on <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twisted_Sister_e212.html" title="Twisted Sister">Twisted Sister</a>'s song "Be Chrool To Your Scuel". A video was made for the song, featuring Cooper donning his black snake-eyes make-up for the first time since 1979 and for the first time sober, however any publicity it would have given to Cooper's return to the music scene was cut short as the video was promptly <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_%28law%29.html" title="Ban (law)">banned</a> due to its graphically gory <a href="../../../m/a/k/Make-up.html" title="Make-up">make-up</a>, by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Savini_1fec.html" title="Tom Savini">Tom Savini</a>, of the innumerable <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombies.html" title="Zombies">zombies</a> which starred in it and their appetite for human flesh.</p>

<p>In 1986, Alice Cooper officially returned to the music industry with the album <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Constrictor_%28album%29.html" title="Constrictor (album)">Constrictor</a></i>. Cooper had a hit with the theme song "He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)" for the movie <i><a href="../../../j/a/s/Friday_the_13th_Part_VI%7E_Jason_Lives_1742.html" title="Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives">Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives</a></i> (1986) as well as the fan favorite "Teenage Frankenstein". The album contained a heavier rock-sounding album which had more (but still very limited) success, followed by <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raise_Your_Fist_and_Yell_2708.html" title="Raise Your Fist and Yell">Raise Your Fist and Yell</a></i> (1987) which had an even rougher sound than its predecessor, as well the Cooper classic "Freedom". Both <i>Constrictor</i> and <i>Raise Your Fist and Yell</i> were recorded with Kane Roberts &amp; bassist <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kip_Winger_2b5e.html" title="Kip Winger">Kip Winger</a>, both of whom would leave the band by the end of 1988 (although Kane Roberts played guitar on "Bed Of Nails" on 1989's album <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Trash_%28album%29.html" title="Trash (album)">Trash</a></i>). Kane Roberts would go on as a solo artist while Kip formed <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winger.html" title="Winger">Winger</a>.</p>
<p>Also in 1986, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megadeth.html" title="Megadeth">Megadeth</a> was asked to open for Alice Cooper during current US tours. After noticing the hardcore <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_abuse.html" title="Drug abuse">drug and alcohol abuse</a> in the band, Cooper personally approached them to try and help them control their "demons", and stayed close to front man <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Mustaine_192a.html" title="Dave Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a> ever since. Mustaine considers him his "Godfather" [VH1 <i>Behind the Music</i> 2001].</p>
<p>In 1987, Cooper made a brief appearance as a vagrant in the horror movie <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Darkness_%281987_movie%29_c482.html" title="Prince of Darkness (1987 movie)">Prince of Darkness</a></i>, directed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carpenter_cfa6.html" title="John Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>. His role had no lines and consisted of menacing the protagonists and impaling one of them with a bicycle frame. Cooper also appeared at <i><a href="../../../w/r/e/WrestleMania_III_4bdf.html" title="WrestleMania III">WrestleMania III</a></i>, escorting wrestler <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake__The_Snake__Roberts_b4d6.html" title="Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts">Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a> to the ring. After the match was over, Cooper got involved and threw Jake's snake Damien at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Honky_Tonk_Man_890d.html" title="The Honky Tonk Man">The Honky Tonk Man</a>'s manager <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hart_65e9.html" title="Jimmy Hart">Jimmy Hart</a>. Jake considered the involvement of Cooper to be an honor, as he idolized Cooper in his youth and has remained a fan of Cooper.</p>
<p>In 1988 Cooper's contract with MCA Records expired and he signed with <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Records_6e4e.html" title="Epic Records">Epic Records</a>. Then, in 1989, his career finally experienced a real revival with the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Child_1dc6.html" title="Desmond Child">Desmond Child</a>-produced album <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Trash_%28album%29.html" title="Trash (album)">Trash</a></i>, which spawned a hit single "<a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_%28Alice_Cooper_song%29_51a8.html" title="Poison (Alice Cooper song)">Poison</a>", which reached # 2 in the UK and #7 in the US, and a worldwide arena tour.</p>

<p>A pause between studio albums, lasting for six years, ended in 2000 with <i><a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutal_Planet_c63f.html" title="Brutal Planet">Brutal Planet</a></i>. <i>Brutal Planet</i> was a return to horror-lined heavy metal with a brutal injection of industrial rock, with subject matter thematically inspired by the brutality of the modern world, although set in a post-apocalyptic future. The accompanying world tour was a resounding success, introducing Alice Cooper to a new audience and produced the live home video "Brutally Live" in 2001. The album was succeeded by the sonically-similar sequel <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragontown.html" title="Dragontown">Dragontown</a></i>, which has been described by Cooper as being "the worst town on Brutal Planet". Like <i>The Last Temptation</i>, both <i>Brutal Planet</i> and <i>Dragontown</i> were albums which developed out of Cooper's personal faith perspective.</p>
<p>In 2003, Cooper again adopted a leaner, cleaner sound for his critically acclaimed album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Eyes_Of_Alice_Cooper_15c2.html" title="The Eyes Of Alice Cooper">The Eyes Of Alice Cooper</a></i>. Recognizing that many current bands were having great success with his former sounds and styles, Cooper worked with a somewhat younger group of road and studio musicians who were very familiar with his oeuvre of old. However, instead of rehashing the old sounds, they updated them, often with surprisingly effective results. The resulting <i>Bare Bones</i> tour adopted a less-orchestrated performance style that had fewer theatrical flourishes and a greater emphasis on musicality. The success of this tour helped support the growing recognition that the classic Cooper songs were exceptionally clever, tuneful, and unique.</p>
<p>Cooper received a star on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 2003. It is located at the corner of Orange Drive and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Boulevard_d612.html" title="Hollywood Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>.</p>
<p>On January 26, 2004, Cooper's radio show, <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Nights_with_Alice_Cooper_3b11.html" title="Nights with Alice Cooper">Nights with Alice Cooper</a></i>, began airing in several US cities. The program showcases classic rock, Alice's personal stories about his life as a rock icon, obscure rock history facts, as well as interviews and special segments like the "OffBEAT News" with his counterpart, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistress_Kitty_a320.html" title="Mistress Kitty">Mistress Kitty</a>. The show appears on nearly 100 stations in the USA and Canada, and has been sold in the UK, Ireland and Australia as well.</p>
<p>In 2005, Cooper released his 24th studio album <i><a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Diamonds_de92.html" title="Dirty Diamonds">Dirty Diamonds</a></i>. This first release on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_West_Records_c8c0.html" title="New West Records">New West Records</a> (for America) was released on August 2, 2005 in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> and July 4, 2005 in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It is a continuation of the songwriting approach the band used on <i>The Eyes of Alice Cooper</i>. <i>Dirty Diamonds</i> is Cooper's highest charting album since 1994's <i>The Last Temptation</i>, coming in at #169 on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Billboard_200_9734.html" title="The Billboard 200">The Billboard 200</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Dirty Diamonds tour launched in America in August 2005.</p>

A previous attempt was made in 2004 by fan Robert Floto using an online petition which logged more than 2,700 entries before being mailed to the RRHF in July of that year. This earlier attempt was unsuccessful.</p>

Europe won the Cup for the 2nd year running. Cooper won his match on the first day, and lost his match on day two. The event was a big success, with large crowds attending, and the two main days of competition were shown live on UK television. The commentators made many references to Cooper being the best player and that he played six days a week back home in Arizona.</p>
<p>On August 30 2006, with the Dirty Diamonds album still fresh in memory, Cooper announced on his website that he will start working on his next album in January, and start its tour in 2007 afterwards. His 2006 tour matched him with the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> in a number of 40,000 plus seat venues in Canada at the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax_Commons_e0fe.html" title="Halifax Commons">Halifax Commons</a>(on Sept. 23rd 2006) and the US (Louisville, Phoenix).</p>
