Yes it is taken from her dances just watch J'en ai marre and look same time on a female night elf. /// 03/01/06</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is it not possible the dances were independently choreographed? I have seen Lili's performance and played the game as well. Though there are similarity in steps, none looks the copy of other. In fact, I had even read somewhere that there exists one style of dance similar to the ones in question. It may be possible both were inspired by the same style. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch">Soumyasch</a> 07:08, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just to point out, if you watch the J'en Ai Marre live performance videos (the actual music video has no choreography) at around 3:25 into it, it is the exact steps used in the female night elf dance. The only difference is that Blizzard did not copy the hand movements exactly as Alizée does them. You can also see some steps from the female night elf dance in the video for Jai Pas Vingt Ans, though not the same move as the one from J'en Ai Marre, and not as pronounced as the female night elf does them.</p>
<p>You can fnd both videos on Google Video.</p>
<p>Could they be from the same style of dance? Yes. But, is it a coincidence that they would both (Blizzard and Alizée) use the same steps... just Alizée in different dances, and Blizzard in the same dance? Possibly. Is it highly likely this is a coincidence? Not really. The entire dance from the night elves may not be from Alizée's dance repertoire, but it does seem like at least some moves were inspired by some moves Alizée has done on stage and video.--7:31 EST March 2, 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well then they both (Blizzard and Alizée) have settled the scores...lol...</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Dancing" class="external free" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Dancing" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Dancing</a> also has information on the dances. Apparently a Blizzard poster on the Blizzard forums also confirmed it back in December, but the forums have auto-deleted the thread and the waybackmachine doesn't have it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Should this info needs to be put into the article somewhere? --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch">Soumyasch</a> 14:08, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can try and get confirmation about it. But it might be something to consider putting in as something like "Alizée's choreography has been rumored to have been the inspiration for at least part of the dance sequence used by the female Night Elf characters in World of WarCraft, published by Blizzard Entertainment" And just link the appropriate parts. If I can get the verification through my contacts, I will let you know.
<dl>
<dd>I am putting this info as an unconfirmed rumor. Please as references if you can find. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch">Soumyasch</a> 14:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>There exists a brand of alcoholic drink by the name <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliz%C3%A9.html" title="Alizé">Alizé</a>. Does it need a mention when describing the namesake of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliz%C3%A9e.html" title="Alizée">Alizée</a>? My vote is against.

<p>I learned about the alcoholic drink <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliz%C3%A9.html" title="Alizé">Alizé</a> by someone mentioning it when I talking with a number of people about the "J'en ai Marre" sexy dance video. I now enjoy <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliz%C3%A9.html" title="Alizé">Alizé</a> with my meals at a local French restaurant. So I say, yes, keep the comment in. Not all can be black or white when it comes to such a great and inspiring entertainer such as Alizée. I enjoy learning about the little nuances about Alizée's life, rumors about her, her videos and music and even a namesake alcoholic drink. --User: Cybersoil 9:21, 23 March 2006</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Images</span></h2>
<p>The images of J'en Ai Marre and J'ai Pas Vingt Ans (in pic gallery) have been taken from these videos and NOT from their English versions. Even though the videos are more or less same, the titles should not be changed, as it will amount to a violation of copyright. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch">Soumyasch</a> 07:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The videos for each are exactly the same, actually, until they show close ups of her singing in French or English, anyway. I truly doubt most people would know she had English versions of the songs. I can get pics from the I'm Not Twenty Version and the I'm Fed Up version, if it is really necessary for them to be from the different versions.</p>

<dd>Some sequences are different in the two versions. Also, I don't feel it to be necessary to put in shots of both the versions.

<dd>There is no real information. In staying objective, i kept the unpublished 2004 interview as a lead to her future plans. However, this interview is more then likely to be fake, because of what i keep saying and Soumyasch keeps deleting: No artist gives such important information without being paid for it, and a contract saying it will be published.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What i'm saying is, that without that interview, you don't have a heck of a lot left to support any other idea then that at this point everything is pointing in the direction that Alizée is going to raise her daughter. The recent gossip in the magazines is merely drawn from what reporters have read in forums. We already know that Voici regulairly gets information from fan-forums, and that other gossip magazines start to repeat what Voici said, is merely the domino effect gossip. At Alizée-fanpage forums someone mentioned the possibility of Alizée being married in Las Vegas long before Voici had any clue.</p>
<p>The fans have been really desperate since the OS went offline, and from that point on, rumor after rumor have been coming up and going down. It bothers me to see the fan community in such dispair, and what i find absolutely horrible is that over the pas few months, people have been pretending to be "In the know". The fakers have brought the fans to a level of trust where now these false rumors are posted here as if they would still be relevant information.</p>
<p>Ofcourse when someone claims that he is "in the know", and gives us that what we want to hear, it's hard to say: He's fake. But on the other hand, there have been at least 3 people directly claiming to be the "bringers of the good news", and all of it has not delivered anything to support their claims but false information.</p>
<p>There have been people calling dates as far back as August 2005.... Then in August the Official site went offline, and then it was November when Alizée would release the first single... The album is already finished, was what was claimed late November...</p>
<p>A cheaply made photoshopped fake single cover was posted at one point...</p>
<p>December, January, February... Each month has a new false rumor...</p>

<dd>What I am saying is that Wikipedia article is not a place where personal opinions should be posted to bias public feeling either way. If you haven't noticed I have NOT deleted anything which you claim to be a fact; I have ONLY deleted opinions which tend to bring in a biased POV. Whenever I edit the section in question (<i>Future</i>), I have always said that each claim made is unverified. It IS a fact that Alizée's return is speculated, so I have kept it. But am against detailing the rumored speculations, as they are NOT a fact. Also personal opinions should not be put into encyclopaedia articles. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch">Soumyasch</a> 19:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alizée's Future</span></h2>
<p>The revision regarding Alizée's future by Frits Van Houten had some structural glitches, and I made some edits to it, to state the same facts minus the seemingly biased POV. I am writing the rationale behind doing it.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In what was claimed to be an unpublished interview with Alizée herself, from November, 2004 Alizée would supposedly have said that this new album would be more in the style of rock music. However, the validity of this interview has never been verified, and it should be noted that celebrities of Alizée's status normally don't give interviews without being paid and/or having a signed contract saying it will be published.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The second line (<i>it should be noted...</i>) shows one's personal opinion to a general practice, and is not a verifiable claim. This is not from a neutral point of view, and hence should not be included in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Since the following information is almost 3 years old, it doesn't say anything about Alizée's plans today</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Just because the information is old, it does not mean it will become irrelevant in today's context, specially when no action is visible to suggest either ways.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>So, at this point nobody besides Alizée herself can say what her plans for the future really are.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to Alizée, her production team will have some information, even though it <i>might</i> not be as exhaustive as what she knows. So, it is better to say that "her future plans can't be confirmed right now" (or something similar) rather than pinning it down to who knows and who doesn't.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In what was claimed to be an unpublished interview with Alizée herself, from November, 2004 Alizée would supposedly have said that this new album would be more in the style of rock music. However, the validity of this interview has never been verified, and it should be noted that celebrities of Alizée's status normally don't give interviews without being paid and/or having a signed contract saying it will be published.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The article claims this interview to be unofficial and unverified. But it is claimed <a href="http://www.alizee-fanpage.com/page.php?language=en&amp;id=213" class="external text" title="http://www.alizee-fanpage.com/page.php?language=en&amp;id=213" rel="nofollow">here</a> that the interview was official. This is a reference against what is claimed in the article. I am not removing it but am bringing it up for discussion. There is also no reference for the pre-tour interview mentioned.</p>
<p>In addition, the flow of the section was not coherent. First it dealt with present scenario, then moved back 2 years, then further 1 year, then to present again. I tried to fix it by first describing the present situation, then the situations which led to the current belief (the two interviews mentioned) chronologically. But there can be a better structure.</p>

<dd>These seem like sound changes and I think they improve the article. It would be good if others voiced their opinion so that we can get consensus. Everyone please stop revert warring, as this is not likely to get any disputes resolved.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alizee</span></h2>
<p>Nothing i said was personal opinion, and certainly not vandalism.</p>
<p>The edits you constantly make come from a point of view based upon the same talks i've seen Alizée fans discuss for almost a year, in relation rumors about a 3rd album. Your edits show a clear personal preference to believe that the third album is coming in a few months. That's personal opinion, and while i admit that i am sceptical, my sceptisizm is closer to objectivity then hope and belief.</p>
<p>There is no objective reason to say "Probably within this year".</p>
<p>Also, the gossip magazines such as VOICI have been known to get their info from fan-forums. The marriage for one, was first suggested in Alizée-fanpage's forum months before Voici wrote an article about it.</p>
<p>The 2004 interview was merely claimed "official" only because someone in the fan community said it was. That's not ojectivity. That interview is practically 80% to wich all the rumors are based. Alizee-fanpage is not an official source.</p>
<p>I'm merely pointing out that in one of the last official interviews, Alizée stated that if the 2nd album wasn't going to be equally succesfull as the first, then a 3rd album wasn't going to happen, and that this technically is where official news left off.</p>
<p>T. Hendriks from www.Gourmandises.nl probably still has the article.</p>
<p>In that interview in 2003, she also said that she'd like to have a baby when she's 20, and look where we are now.</p>
<p>All i did was clear the fog of lies and rumors. That some Alizée fans have grown so emotionally attached to these false rumors that they can't see that it is not objective to talk about them as if they were more then just grains of sand in a beach full of false information, is sad for them, - but not my problem.</p>
<p>Do i hope a 3rd album is coming? Orcourse i do. Infact, i'm quite frustrated myself about the complete silence, but i prefere to stay silent and wait objectively for official news, rather then nitpicking and putting my hopes up again and again everytime one jackass or another claims to have inside information about Polydor and Alizée's plans. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Frits van Houten (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFrits_van_Houten_8c42.html" title="User talk:Frits van Houten">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frits_van_Houten_3047.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frits van Houten">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><i>...it should be noted that celebrities of Alizée's status normally don't give interviews without being paid and/or having a signed contract saying it will be published</i></li>
<li><i>...Some fans seem to have have great difficutly dealing with the current break from music Alizée is taking, wich might explain why there have been so many false rumors and speculations over the last year.</i></li>
<li><i>However, it seems likely to assume that at some point in the future "She'll be back".</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Aren't these clearly your personal opinion, which do NOT have a neutral Point of View?</dd>
<dd>I haven't deleted any of the facts that you mentioned, and have actually used many of your edits (like your change to <i>probably this year</i>) to give the article its present state. Its only your biased comments that I have deleted, and restructured the sentences to give a better flow to the section. And doesn't reintroducing biasness constitute vandalism?

<dd>I took up your lead on making the statement <i>it should be noted that celebrities of Alizée's status normally don't give interviews without being paid and/or having a signed contract saying it will be published</i> less assertive and slightly reworded it to say that <i>it's not very plausible that an artist would do an interview with such information if it is not to be published</i>. I am convinced such a statement is justified enough. Also, I removed the word <i>Technically</i>, with which you started the section. I felt its not needed. And I apologize for misinterpreting your (earlier) statement to be as if making a claim. Well, if it was me, it could have been anyone else.

But I am not sure if I should use <b>is</b>. I used present tense because I feel if a person ever does something charitable, she will always be a supporter of charity works. Even if the person doesn't do anything notable, it doesn't mean she is not doing something minor. Still, if somebody feels this is not correct, please go ahead and edit it into past tense. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoumyasch_cb30.html" title="User:Soumyasch">Soumyasch</a> 16:27, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of course! Because Alizée, like other performers, has donated many hours of her time and talent to such a worthy cause as helping feed the poor it should be noted. It shows that not only is she extremely beautiful, sexy, and charming but she also has a kind heart. So yes, indeed, I think her devotion to charity is well worth noting.
