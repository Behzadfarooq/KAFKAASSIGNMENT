<p>who says the allegations are false?</p>
<p>You wrote: "In recent years, there have been false allegations by the United States and Israel that he has been supporting a covert nuclear weapons development project in Iran as a response to the nuclear weapons possessed by Israel and the United States." The word "false" is not a fact and instead betrays the author's bias regarding the issue. Also, this page is extremely lacking for the leader of such a controversial government who has been in office since the 1980s. I'm wondering what was left out and why. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 147.129.20.101 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_147.129.20.101_d7c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/147.129.20.101">contribs</a>) 16:27, 3 February 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but this article is basically a bull-shit fluff piece on Khamenei. See the aforementioned nuclear claims. The previous paragraph in the article is blatantly POV. There is no criticism whatsoever of the leader of a nation which routinely persecutes its religious minorities (see Bahai for examples).

<p>My last revert was made in haste on my part. I misread it as though the article had been reverted to the previous "managed Iran's afairs with great skill" instead of to "Managed Irans affairs", which is certainly not POV. However, the current dispute between Khamanei's government and International community with respect to nuclear proliferation should be at least aknowledged. Having the section on his fatwa against nuvlear weapons and not the controversy is a complete non-sequitor. It should also be noted that the text of the fatwa has not been released. Someone reading the article without that paragraph would go away believing Khamanei was a completely uncontroversial ruler of Iran. That is far from the truth. It would be like an article on Bush's presidency without mention of the Iraq War. Clearly absurd. Thus the omision is POV 129.116.28.180 23:44, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I looked at the article, and there's already some material about his connection to the nuclear issue (without sources). I'm not sure if more could be said. There's very little known about the inside politics of Iran. There's also no evidence that Khamenei is behind the nuclear program. Most believe it's former president <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafsanjani.html" title="Rafsanjani">Rafsanjani</a>. But if you want to add new information to the article, you can do that - just cite your sources. Otherwise I'd have to take down the POV tag. <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>Aucaman</b></a><sup><a href="../../../a/u/c/User_talk%7EAucaman_2cc1.html" title="User talk:Aucaman">Talk</a></sup> 01:21, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&gt;&gt; AucamanTalk; What the hell? "You" have been vandalizing Wikipedia not me. Block me i don't care but before that i need to know what part of my article was wrong or better say "You" didn't like? You obviously have no clue whatsoever about what is going on inside Iran or who is in charge of nuclear research. How many articles do i have to show you in which, clearly indicate the Real hands behind the nuclear project in Iran? Beside, what is said about Khamenei is pure propaganda (even a kid can understand that)</p>
<p>also it seems you don't care if fake Information is replaced with real one here in WikiPedia.</p>
<p>One more question and i know it will definitely make problems for me but i have to know, Does "Somebody" pay you to keep that specific article nice and clean?

<p>i am taking out the part that says he was an ethnic azeri. although it is true, it is uneccessary, because at the end of the day he is iranian. mossadegh and others are also listed as iranians. their ethnic background means nothing, both in history and in reality. khamenei has pointed out many times that he is iranian and iranian only. if someone were to write my biography, i would also want it to be iranian, and not persian, because i am iranian and only iranian. i am not doing this for political reasons, i am doing this because i feel that his nationality is the only thing that matters and same goes for all other people in modern times.</p>

<p>Though I don't necessarily doubt what is claimed, there is no conclusive source behind the claim: "On the 2000 al-Quds Day Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for the destruction of Israel, as Khomeini had done before.[1]:</p>
<p>The note leads to a CNN article on New Years' celebrations. For such serious claims against two high-ranking leaders, I would hope that someone could at least come up with a decent source. If I find one, I'll edit.</p>

<p>In the first paragraph: <i>He is part of the United States target for Terrorists. He is now largely hated by his own people.</i> I understand that many people feel this way, in Iran and throughout the world, and I'm not questioning anyone's beliefs/motives, but this is still an encyclopedia, and should therefore function and be worded as such. The sentences quoted above should be placed in areas of the article that deal with those issues, and sources need to be cited. I realize that this is largely common knowledge, but it is still an encyclopedia regardless. And no matter what the opinion/situation is, everything in an encyclopedia should be phrased with a neutral point of view, as encyclopedias function to state factual information. Just my $0.02.

<dd>True. It can be used, but with proper weight and presentation. We aren't aimed at convincing the reader that the academic is correct or incorrect, just what his opinion is. This of course assumes he is significant enough to receive mention. I am just worried about weight. For example, adding that "nickname" thing to the Iran article was a serious undue weight issue, and was presented in a much too factual manner. Though I found it provocative, I will assume good faith this time. Let's avoid undue weight issues here too. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 01:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These kind of strong POV-revealing statements on the article talk page, in addition to your contribs, are the kind of things that make me worry you may not be seeking to present topics neutrally in the articles.

<dd>lol, you <i>are</i> 'entitled' to use a <i>wide</i> range of vocabulary, like "stooges", which has a very negative connotation. At least here on the talk page, where you have let your strong POV run wild. Anyway, while you don't have link every 'word', you do have to link assertions. Your link didn't blame Khamanei at all, much less call him the main individual. Even if you find somebody who says that, it ain't gonna receive undue weight and be presented as some fact even though it is opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 02:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 2007 <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Khamenei_23dc.html" title="Ali Khamenei">Ali Khamenei</a> addressed the government and officials to speed up moves to cut the state's economic role in the latest bid to revive a struggling <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privatisation.html" title="Privatisation">privatisation</a> programme. Iran tried to shake up its lumbering economy in 2004 by overturning Article 44 of the constitution which decreed core infrastructure should remain state-run. But private business has shown little appetite to invest in privatisations since then. Khamenei also urged the Justice Ministry to set up courts to defend ownership rights to encourage private investment.<a href="http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=49852&amp;NewsKind=Current%20Affairs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=49852&amp;NewsKind=Current%20Affairs" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/1254.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/1254.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/Description.asp?Da=2/20/2007&amp;Cat=2&amp;Num=019" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tehrantimes.com/Description.asp?Da=2/20/2007&amp;Cat=2&amp;Num=019" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
