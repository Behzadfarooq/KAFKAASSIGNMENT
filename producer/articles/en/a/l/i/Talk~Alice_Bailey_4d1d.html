<p>I am currently attempting to develop a coherent statement of the Tibetan's ideas expressed in AAB's books. Obviously this could be approached from many angles, but I believe the most representative is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The belief of man that he is separate from and independent of his fellow man is an <i>illusion</i> (<i>maya</i>).</li>
<li>When this illusion has been conquered among humans, the current 'evils of society' will all disappear.</li>
<li>Life is a reincarnational series of lessons that inevitably overcome this illusion of separateness, leading to an eventual 'at-one-ment' of the entire planet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Purists may argue, but I feel that the elimination of maya &amp; glamour (aka <i>at-one-ment</i>) was the primary goal of DK's publicly disseminated writings. However, this is just a formulation, and leaves out quite a bit of interesting ideas, such as the unique formulations of the planes and rays, the 12 'departments' of the Heirarchy, and in fact, the particular characterization of the Heirarchy as an 'invisible brotherhood' of ascended masters. In fact, I'm not even sure this belongs here under AAB, but I'm not convinced DK deserves a separate page (some will argue there is/was no such person), and putting it under 'neo-theosophy' or (my preference) 'trans-Himalayan' would both be neologisms, afaik. Any comments from interested parties will be welcomed. <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 17:06, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have read 50-75% of her work, I would not characterize mention of Jews as 'constant', nor as 'anti-', but that is my opinion. This section's criticims are valid, but I do wish to reword them slighty. I have added a rebuttal of sorts, and removed the sentence referencing a "solution" to the "problem", as this formulation deliberately flirts at triggering <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a>.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 18:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>She was not anti-semitic! This is a slander. I have studied her books extensively over a period of more than forty years. She has said that the Jews are 'agents of karma.' That puts them in an interesting position which makes a lot of sense to me. Taking America alone, what would our political life be without the Jewish contributors, or what would Hollywood, or American literature, be? Her criticisms of what the Jewish people have done at some points in their history exactly parallel what their own prophets have said. Was Jeremiah anti-Semitic? Hardly! His writings are enshrined in the Tenach, Jewish scriptures, or 'old Testament' as the Christians call it. Yet he continually leveled even worse accusations at them than Alice Bailey did! They had departed from God's plan, they had totally lost their way, and on and on. This is superficial thinking, the accusation of anti-Semitism. It is thoroughly discredited by the fact that her writings, or those of "The Tibetan," were totally anti-Nazi during World War II. Read The Externalization of the Hierarchy. It consists largely of her wartime messages to her students. From the beginning she insisted that the war against Germany must be fought in order to root out a deep evil. She suggested that her students visualize light and harmony between the Germans and the Jews. But she did not compromise on the war and contradicted the pacifists in her group, at great length. She mentioned Gandhi directly, and disagreed with him about the war; he did not want India to get involved, while she thought that the war was a worldwide Kurukshetra parallel to the fight of Arjuna and Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. --VividHugh 07:59, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The quotes supporting AAB's anti-semitism are so far from accurate that I have to wonder if they were put there to encourage a negative view. It is entirely irresponsible to post quotes without references, without verification, that antagonize those already sensitive to the issue and deceive those who are trying to understand such important writings.</p>
<p>The first quote, "The Jewish race, who loved the possessions of the world more than they loved the service of Light, joined ranks with the rebels against God" is an incorrect re-structure of the following text from from Esoteric Psychology I, p. 397, which itself is a quote from an ancient teaching: "The Masters met in conclave and decided what should be the fate of those who, having reached the Gates of Light, loved the possessions of the world more than they loved the service of the light." It needs to be read in context to see who it is really about, which is not the "Jewish race".</p>
<p>The second quote, "... the law of racial karma is working and the Jews are paying the price, factually and symbolically, for all they have done in the past." is incorrect. It should be "Today the law is working, and the Jews are paying the price, factually and symbolically, for all they have done in the past.", Esoteric Healing, p 264.</p>
<p>The next quote: "the Jews are the reincarnation of spiritual failures or residues from another planet..." does not exist in AAB's writings. It should be removed immediately. I can't believe anyone would blindly publish such a quote.</p>
<p>The next quote is entirely incorrect and inflammatory, and should also be removed immediately: "the word 'love' for others is lacking in Judaism... The Jew has never grasped the love of God." It looks like a twisted paraphrase of the following: "In this solar system, the created world is intended to be the expression of the second aspect, of the love of God. This the Jew has never grasped, for the love expressed in the Old Testament is the separative, possessive love of Jehovah for a distinct unit within the fourth or human kingdom." Esoteric Healing, p 268.</p>
<p>The quote starting with "when selfishness..." is correct, but needs the reference. It is Esoteric Healing, p 267.</p>
<p>The last quote is p. 267 of Esoteric Healing, not p. 263. The reference link there points to something only vaguely related to the quotes, and should be removed.</p>
<p>I appeal to the author to fix these immediately. I will replace them myself and re-write the section if they are not fixed within a week. Rbridge 17:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have some thoughts on Alice Bailey's anti-Judaism that I put on the discussion page yesterday. You might want to read that. I think that what I wrote indicates her anti-Jewish views pretty clearly. (Some of the quotes I used were taken from a paper intended to defend her against claims of being anti-Jewish.)</p>
<p>I am rather concerned about UTC's claims of inaccurate quoting of Bailey. I have heard that the publisher, Lucus Trust, has in recent years removed, or changed, the most offensive statements about Jews from the Bailey books. If that is correct, establishing what Alice Bailey actually wrote about the Jews could now only be established by a very time consuming process of comparing with earlier editions of her books.</p>
<p>To me it seems clear that the two sides in this dispute will never agree. The books are considered by her followers to be written by Alice Bailey as dictated to her by a Master of the Ancient Wisdom, DK. Since Masters are considered to be super-human, and to have knowledge and wisdom far beyond the human; followers of the Bailey teaching regard the books as perfect, and they are disinclined to question any content of the books. That includes statements about Jews that can be proved wrong. For instance, Bailey in one of her books indicated what she considered the vengeful spirit of Judaism with the well know quote, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." What Baily did not know (proving a less than perfect source for her books) is that the rabbis always understood this to as need for restitution, and so the punishment for assault never involved any physical punishment. The punishment given by a Beit Din would always be a monetary settlement....which to me does not seem vengeful. I have tried to convince Bailey followers that most of what is said about the Jews is wrong, and given examples; but they always believed the books over factual information. They continue to believe that Jews are vengeful, that Jews have a special relationship with money (if so why am I always broke?), that the continuation of Judaism is a mistake because the Jews should have converted to Christianity, and many other mistaken ideas Alice Bailey included in her books.</p>

<p>Alice Bailey's original followers, particularly those who had extended personal contact with her and were trained by her, understood that what she said about Jews did make a problem; and they seldom put much emphasis on that aspect of her books. The current followers of Bailey's teaching tend to be much more rigid in their views, they insist that her, provably wrong, views about Jews should be accepted as central parts of her teaching; and these current teachers seem genuinely surprised that anyone would object to anything ever written by her. This is based on many conversations I had with Baily's students (who were my teachers), that I had from 1968 to 1976; and as compared with conversations on list serves in recent years. She seems to have been somewhat obsessed with the subject of Judaism, and there is so many comments on the Jews in her many books that they could be collected into an entire separate book, and such a book would not make pretty reading.</p>
<p>(Fine but you must source the criticism section. It is unsourced and thus unacceptable. Do not restore unsopurced amterial without sourcing it, there is no excuse for putting unsourced material into a biography, ie source it or leave it be. The areticle made serious and probably untrue allegations against her and this will not stand unless properly sourced, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:08, 7 April 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>(::I have no intention of putting this into the article at this time, in this form. This is the discussion page, and I am trying to discuss some things about Alice Bailey that I consider important to understand. The sources for the above information are private conversations with Roberto Assagioli MD (one of Bailey's closest co-workers, who I studied with for over five years), Frank Hilton (a student of AAB, and later director of the School for Esoteric Studies), and Lee Wells (who was my mentor at the SES until his death. You seem to be assuming that I am an enemy of the Alice Bailey teaching. Not so. I do deeply regret that in recent years the current leaders of this spiritual movement have become so rigid in their views that any expression of doubts, much less exceptions, is not possible. I know this is so because I have lived it. That is not documentation, but I have no intention of ever putting the above section in the article. Nevertheless, for discussion and understanding of the subject, it is important.)</p>
<p>Alice Baily considered the Jewish people a race. As a typical example: "The outstanding evidence of the Law of Cause and Effect is the Jewish race" Esoteric Healing, p.263. But Judaism NOT a race, it is a religion and it comprises many different racial groups. A trip to Israel is all that is needed to confirm this because there one will see Jews who look Polish and Russian who come from Russia and Poland, Jews who look Italian who come from Italy, Jews who look Ethiopian who come from Ethiopia, Jews who look Moroccan who come from Morocco, Jews who look Indian who come from India, etc.</p>
<p>On that non-existent foundation, of what she calls the Jewish race, Alice Bailey builds an esoteric history of Jews that goes back millions of years. Much of that history, as she imagines it, goes back to a time before Jews arrived on this planet!</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&lt;You have often been told how, at the close of this solar system, a certain percentage of the human fmily will fail to make the grade and will then be held in pralaya, or in solution, until the time for the manifestation of the next and third solar system comes around.....The same thing occurred in the system before this one, and those whom we now call the Jews......are the descendants of that earlier group that was held in pralaya between the first and second solar systems.&gt;</p>
<p>The Externalization of the Hierarchy, p.71.</p>
<p>Obviously, no human could possibly verify such statements. I have had some of Alice Bailey's current followers tell me that such statements do not have anything to do with what is now called Judaism. Perhaps, but if that is so why did she choose to call not-Jews Jews? Bailey seems to have been a very intelligent person, and I think it is safe to assume if she said "Jews" she really meant Jews.</p>
<p>A lot of what Alice Bailey discusses as Jews, and which her followers insist is all true, is contrary to what Jews know as their own story. Jews regard Abraham as the first Jew. Baily can discuss, if she so chooses, an imaginary history of Jews going back millions of years before Abraham; but this is a flight of imagination that distorts Judaism beyond recognition. In itself, that does not disqualify what she wrote. But a lot of those of statements of supposed Jewish history are then used to support demeaning stereotypes about Jews that are all too present in the modern world. As a result it is difficult not to see it all as Jew-hating in esoteric garb.</p>
<p>This brings us, first of all, to the question of Jews and money, as Baily presents this very old, and insulting cliche about the supposed Jewish special relationship with money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;It is an interesting fact that the Jews are found in every land without exception, that their influence is potent and widespread (far more so than they themselves are willing to recognize), and that they wield most potently that peculiar concretization of energy that we call money.&gt;</p>
<p>Externalisation of the Hierarchy, p.76 (1939)</p>
<p>To give an idea how horrific this stereotype was playing out at the very time Alice Bailey wrote these words, how ingrained it was (and remains) in the very worst of European hate of its Jewish minority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;Yes, my child, that's the Jew! The God of the Jews is gold. There is no crime he would not commit to get it. He has no rest till he can sit on the top of a gold-sack. He has no rest till he has become King Money. And with this money he would make us all into slaves and destroy us. With this money he seeks to dominate the whole world.&gt;</p>
<p>This is from Der Giftpilz, an anti-Semitic children's book published by Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der Stürmer (1938)</p>
<p>There is no point in being subtle about this: Alice Bailey's equating of Jews and money, and their use of money to secretly control the world, is an integral part of both her thought, and also is integral to traditional European anti-Judaism. I think this makes clear both her anti-Jewish bias, and how her thought ties in with traditional anti-Judaism.</p>
<p>Another view held by Alice Baily's, and common in traditional European anti-Jewish belief is that Jews are now condemned as a group because of their refusal to convert to Christianity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;More I will not say; the symbolic nature of this basic world problem and its dynamic importance to humanity have led me thus to enlarge. The decision anent the Jews is one of hierarchical importance, owing to the karmic relation of the Christ to the Jewish race, to the fact that they repudiated Him as the Messiah and are still doing so, [Page 637] and of the interpretive nature of the Jewish problem as far as the whole of humanity is concerned.&gt;</p>
<p>The Rays and the Initiations, p.636</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;Let me point out also that just as the Kabbalah and the Talmud are secondary lines of esoteric approach to truth, and materialistic in their technique (embodying much of the magical work of relating one grade of matter to the substance of another grade), so the Old Testament is emphatically a secondary Scripture, and spiritually does not rank [Page 268] with the Bhagavad-Gita, the ancient Scriptures of the East and the New Testament……The general theme of the Old Testament is the recovery of the highest expression of the divine wisdom in the first solar system; ……..The evil karma of the Jew today is intended to end his isolation, to bring him to the point of relinquishing material goals, of renouncing a nationality that has a tendency to be somewhat parasitic within the boundaries of other nations, and to express inclusive love, instead of separative unhappiness.&gt;</p>
<p>Esoteric Healing, p267-8</p>
<p><br />
Baily's language makes much use of her particular form of New Age and esoteric terminology; but, in essence, what she is saying in these quotes is that God has abandoned the Jews because of their refusal to become Christian, and they must either convert or be eliminated as a religious group, and as a people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I brief, dear princes and lords, those of you who have Jews under your rule-- if my counsel does not please your, find better advice, so that you and we all can be rid of the unbearable, devilish burden of the Jews, lest we become guilty sharers before God in the lies, blasphemy, the defamation, and the curses which the mad Jews indulge in so freely and wantonly against the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, this dear mother, all Christians, all authority, and ourselves. Do not grant them protection, safe-conduct, or communion with us.... .With this faithful counsel and warning I wish to cleanse and exonerate my conscience.&gt;</p>
<p>1543 letter of Martin Luther</p>
<p><br />
<i>Still another theme of Alice Bailey, is that the Jews are separative:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;The Jew, down the ages, has insisted upon being separated from all other races but he brought over from the previous system the knowledge (necessary then but obsolete now) that his race was the "chosen people." The "Wandering Jew" has wandered from System One to this where he must learn the lesson of absorption and cease his wandering. He has insisted upon racial purity, for that was his major problem in early Lemurian times when the race came into a world that had in it no human beings, for it was before the coming of the Lords of Flame; this insistence has been carried down the ages and has governed the rules of marriage...&gt;</p>
<p>Externalisation of the Hierarchy, p77</p>
<p>The mistake in this is that, in their years of exile, the Christian communities in which Jews lived, forced Jews to live separate. It was called ghettos. Any attempts at teaching the Jewish philosophy and religion to the Christians around them would have resulted in rioting against them or banishment. As for the accusation that Jews wanted to maintain racial purity: there is no Jewish race, and the Jews never taught racial purity. When the forced separation ended, Jews quickly integrated into the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>I could go on a lot further to make my point, and will if the discussion requires it. It is possible that Alice Bailey, and her present followers, mean no harm. But the words carry the potential for harm. Perhaps they just fail to understand how painful such statements are to Jews, and how much damage has been caused to Jews. If that is so, or not, the books factually wrong time and again in the statements made about Jews, and they present falsehoods about Jews as truth.</p>

<p>(:There are reference sources for every Alice Bailey quote, and they are correct. Anyhow, this is the discussion page, and I have no intention of adding any this to the article; although something on the subject is needed there. Most likely an entirely new, and separate, article on New Age and Esoteric Antisemitism might be the best solution. But there is no doubt that Alice Bailey would be a major topic in such an article. Not that I think she was actually more antisemitic than many other New Age leaders, such as Rudolf Steiner; she just wrote more about the Jews, while others understood that it is not necessary to write everything you think, nor to publish everything you write. kwork)</p>
<p>Without sources this is so much original research by you. Please desist. Yopu must add reliabnle sources whereas what you are doing is drawing your own conclusions based on what she wrote and this is not acceptable in this encyclopedia. Go and publish your original research in a blog or something but dont do it here. What we would need is some established reliable 3rd party source that claims she is anti-semitic, you doing so is unacceptable, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:31, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me quote from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>: "Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a source, as do quotations, and the responsibility for finding a source lies with the person who adds or restores the material. Unsourced or poorly sourced edits may be challenged and removed at any time. Sometimes it is better to have no information at all than to have information without a source." Thus its your responsibility to provide the sources and my right to remove your unsourced material at any time, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:36, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>(::Well, give me the challenge you want to make, and we will see if I can answer you. So far you have said nothing beyond that you don't like what I say. That's a challenge? Also, I have some doubts about your statements of the Criticism section, that you say are not from Bailey. I will do some of my own checking on that when I get a chance. In any case, that Wikipedia:Reliable Sources quote you give refers to articles, and NOT to the talk page. Your distorting of that quote does not seem truthful. NB: There are items on this talk page that say nothing more than that the writer feels insulted over Alice Bailey getting accused of antisemitism. Where is the documentation and factual support in that? Its just emotion. But certainly you have said nothing about removing that, or about removing anything that defends Bailey against charges of antisemitism, no matter how absent of content. kwork)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes but the argument is over the article page, we are not talking about the talk page where, of course, none of your comments have been reverted. In order to add material to the article that material must be properly sourced, ie not just your idea. Failure to source any added material means the material may be deleted. If you can find a reputable author who accuses Bailey of anti-semitism we can add that material and if you are unable to provide such a source said material will be deleted. So your challenge is to find some reputable sources for any criticism section. I hope this is clear, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:46, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(:: But I have not added any material to the article page. I only returned material that you removed; but that was not written by me. In any case, I have noticed that in the article itself, the "Nature of Works" section has no sourcing, and I will remove it if that is not corrected. kwork)</p>
<p><br />
Its fine to remove any unsourced material. And whether you actually added it yourself or merely reverted to it makes no difference, unsourced material should be removed. I dont remove any unsourced material from wikipedia, just that which I believe is inaccurate and the criticisms was somebody's original research, IMO; sorry if I implied it was your original research, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:29, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Block quote</p>

<p>I have been officially on Hitler's "blacklist" because of my defence of the Jews whilst lecturing up and down western Europe. In spite, however, of knowing full well the wonderful qualities of the Jew, his contribution to western culture and learning and his wonderful assets and gifts along the line of the creative arts I still fail to see any immediate solution of their crucial and appalling problem.”</p>
<p>[from the Unfinished Autobiography, Alice A. Bailey.pp.119]</p>
<p><br />
Since this quote is included in the article about Alice Bailey, I would like to know if her claim to have been placed "offically on Hitler's blacklist" can be documented. I have read the Unfinished Autobiography several times and there is no documentation of this there.</p>
