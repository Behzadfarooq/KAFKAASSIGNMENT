<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Faye_1dc2.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, she was the daughter of a New York police officer of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_people.html" title="German people">German</a> descent and his <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish-American_7a25.html" title="Irish-American">Irish-American</a> wife, Charley and Alice Leppert. Faye's entertainment career began in <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaudeville.html" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> as a chorus girl, before she moved to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> and <i><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_White%27s_Scandals_054c.html" title="George White's Scandals">George White's Scandals</a></i> in 1931. By this time, she had adopted her stage name and first reached a radio audience on <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudy_Vallee_cd47.html" title="Rudy Vallee">Rudy Vallee</a>'s hit, <i>The Fleischmann Hour</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>), where she may have met her future husband and comedy partner Harris for the first time.</p>
<p><a name="Film_career" id="Film_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Faye_1dc2.html" title="Edit section: Film career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Film career</span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, she got her first major film break in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, when <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilian_Harvey_31e4.html" title="Lilian Harvey">Lilian Harvey</a> abandoned the lead role in a film version of <i>George White's Scandals</i>, in which Vallee was also to appear. Hired first to perform a musical number with Vallee, Faye ended up as the female lead. And she became a hit with film audiences of the 1930s, particularly when Fox mastermind producer <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darryl_F._Zanuck_96c2.html" title="Darryl F. Zanuck">Darryl F. Zanuck</a> made her his protege. He softened Faye from a wisecracking show girl to the youthful but somewhat motherly figure she played in a few of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_Temple_f4b9.html" title="Shirley Temple">Shirley Temple</a>'s hit films.</p>
<p>Faye also received a physical makeover, from being something of a singing version of <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Harlow_b04c.html" title="Jean Harlow">Jean Harlow</a> to sporting a softer look with a more natural tone to her blonde hair and more mature makeup. This transition was practically a plot point of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander%27s_Ragtime_Band_%28film%29_206e.html" title="Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)">Alexander's Ragtime Band</a></i>, in which Faye's ascent (she plays a singer who moves from barrooms to fame) is dramatized by her increasingly elegant grooming.</p>
<p>Cast in musicals most of all, Faye introduced many popular songs to the hit parade. Considered less than serious as an actress and more than serious as a singer, Faye nailed what many critics consider her best acting performance in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937_in_film.html" title="1937 in film">1937</a>'s <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Old_Chicago_a77c.html" title="In Old Chicago">In Old Chicago</a></i>. She more than held her own---in spite of a mild speech impediment softening her "r"s---with co-stars such as Vallee, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jolson_c543.html" title="Al Jolson">Al Jolson</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Greenwood_516b.html" title="Charlotte Greenwood">Charlotte Greenwood</a>, and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Everett_Horton_7556.html" title="Edward Everett Horton">Edward Everett Horton</a>, as well as leading men such as <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Ameche_c40e.html" title="Don Ameche">Don Ameche</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrone_Power_79df.html" title="Tyrone Power">Tyrone Power</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Payne_5093.html" title="John Payne">John Payne</a>.</p>
<p>Color film flattered Faye enormously, and she shone in the splashy musical features that were a Fox trademark in the 1940s. She frequently played a performer, often one moving up in society, allowing for situations that ranged from the poignant to the comic. <i>Weekend in Havana</i> and <i>That Night in Rio</i> (atypically, as a Brazilian aristocrat) made good use of Faye's husky singing voice, flair for carrying off the era's exaggerated fashions, and solid comic and romantic timing. <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943_in_film.html" title="1943 in film">1943</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gang%27s_All_Here_%28film%29_8bfa.html" title="The Gang's All Here (film)">The Gang's All Here</a></i> is perhaps the epitome of these films, with lavish production values and a range of supporting players (including the memorable <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen_Miranda_f0d9.html" title="Carmen Miranda">Carmen Miranda</a> in the indescribable "Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat" number) that camouflage the film's trivial plot and leisurely pacing.</p>
<p>Faye's career continued until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> when she was cast in <i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallen_Angel_%281945_movie%29_851a.html" title="Fallen Angel (1945 movie)">Fallen Angel</a></i>---whose title became only too telling, as circumstances turned out. Designed ostensibly as Faye's vehicle, the film all but became her celluloid epitaph when Zanuck---trying to build his new protege, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Darnell_351a.html" title="Linda Darnell">Linda Darnell</a>---ordered many Faye scenes cut and Darnell bumped up. When Faye saw a screening of the final product, she drove away from the Fox studio refusing to return, feeling she had been undercut deliberately by Zanuck.</p>
<p>Zanuck hit back, it is said, by having Faye <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackball.html" title="Blackball">blackballed</a> for <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breach_of_contract.html" title="Breach of contract">breach of contract</a>, effectively ending her film career. Released in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_film.html" title="1945 in film">1945</a>, <i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallen_Angel_%281945_movie%29_851a.html" title="Fallen Angel (1945 movie)">Fallen Angel</a></i> was Faye's final film as a major <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> star.</p>
<p>Gossip magazines of the time speculated that Faye was fired over a reputed rivalry with <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Grable_3266.html" title="Betty Grable">Betty Grable</a>, a claim that both women---who remained friends until Grable's death---disputed hotly enough. But seventeen years after the <i>Fallen Angel</i> debacle, Faye went before the cameras again, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_in_film.html" title="1962 in film">1962</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Fair_fe58.html" title="State Fair">State Fair</a></i>. While Faye received good reviews, the film was not a great success, and she made infrequent cameo appearances thereafter.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Faye_1dc2.html" title="Edit section: Marriage and radio career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage and radio career</span></h2>
<p>Faye's first marriage, to <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Martin_%28entertainer%29_2ee2.html" title="Tony Martin (entertainer)">Tony Martin</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, ended in divorce in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. A year later, however, she married <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Harris_d499.html" title="Phil Harris">Phil Harris</a>---the marriage became a plotline on an episode of the hit radio show hosted by Harris's then-employer, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Benny_3ec2.html" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a>---and struck platinum in both her personal and her professional life.</p>
<p>The couple had two daughters, Alice (b. <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>) and Phyllis (b. <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>), and began working in radio together as Faye's film career collapsed. First, they teamed to host a variety show on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <i>The Fitch Bandwagon</i>, in 1946. Originally conceived as a music showcase as well as a haven for Harris and Faye's tart comic style, the show came to center more on the couple and, by <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, Fitch bowed away as sponsor in favour of <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rexall.html" title="Rexall">Rexall</a>, the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical.html" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> giant, and the show was revamped entirely into a <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html" title="Situation comedy">situation comedy</a> called <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phil_Harris-Alice_Faye_Show_09da.html" title="The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show">The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show</a></i>.</p>
<p>Harris's comic talent was already familiar through his long tenure on the Benny show, where he played Benny's wisecracking, jive talking hipster bandleader. Now, with their own show revamped to a sitcom, bandleader Harris and singer-actress Faye played themselves, raising two precocious children in and out of slightly zany situations, mostly involving Harris's bandmate Frank Remley (Elliott Lewis), obnoxious delivery boy Julius Abruzzio (Walter Tetley, familiar as nephew Leroy on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gildersleeve_36d9.html" title="The Great Gildersleeve">The Great Gildersleeve</a></i>), Robert North as Faye's fictitious deadbeat brother, Willie, and sponsor's representative Mr. Scott (<a href="../../../g/a/l/Gale_Gordon_375f.html" title="Gale Gordon">Gale Gordon</a>), and usually involving bumbling, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropping</a> Harris needing rescue from acidly loving Faye---the show was an <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> radio fixture until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. The Harris's two daughters were played on radio by Jeanine Roos and Anne Whitfield.</p>
<p>Faye singing ballads and swing numbers in her honey <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contralto.html" title="Contralto">contralto</a> voice was a regular highlight of the show, as was a knack for tart one-liners equal to her husband's. The show's running gags also included portraying Faye as something close to an heiress ("I'm only trying to protect the wife of the money I love" was a typical Harris gag) and occasional barbs by Faye aimed at her rift with Zanuck, usually referencing <i>Fallen Angel</i> in one or another way.</p>

<p>Faye and Harris continued various projects, individually and together, for the rest of their lives. Faye made a return to Broadway after forty-three years in a revival of <i>Good News!</i>, opposite her old Fox partner <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Payne_5093.html" title="John Payne">John Payne</a> (who was replaced by <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Nelson_bb22.html" title="Gene Nelson">Gene Nelson</a>). In later years, Faye became a spokeswoman for <a href="../../../p/f/i/Pfizer.html" title="Pfizer">Pfizer</a> Pharmaceuticals, promoting the virtues of an active senior lifestyle. The Faye-Harris marriage endured until Harris's death in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>; before that, the couple donated a large volume of their entertainment memorabilia to Harris's hometown <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linton%2C_Indiana_2484.html" title="Linton, Indiana">Linton</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>.</p>
<p>Three years after her husband's death, Alice Faye died in <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rancho_Mirage%2C_California_94b9.html" title="Rancho Mirage, California">Rancho Mirage, California</a> from <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stomach_cancer.html" title="Stomach cancer">stomach cancer</a> at the age of 83. She was buried with her husband at the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Lawn_Cemetery_%28Cathedral_City%29_bcad.html" title="Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City)">Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City)</a> near Palm Springs, California.
