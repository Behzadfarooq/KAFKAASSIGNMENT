<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_MacCallum_9bdc.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>When she arrived on the music scene all successful Australian female solo singers (ie Judy Stone, Allison Durbin, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Pattie_12f4.html" title="Little Pattie">Little Pattie</a> etc) wore pretty, usually short dresses or long gowns. They were also expected to be girl next door types &amp; sing pretty pop songs or Cabaret show tunes. Dinah Lee, originally from New Zealand anyway, may be a a minor exception, belting out her great mid 1960's <a href="../../../s/k/a/Ska.html" title="Ska">ska</a>/rock hits but "Little Miss Mod' was known as much for her oufits as her records. Others like Marcie Jones who also performed with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcie_%26_The_Cookies_40e6.html" title="Marcie &amp; The Cookies">Marcie &amp; The Cookies</a>, built their careers in Australia singing with lots of grunt, but she sang in the then only marginally popular <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown.html" title="Motown">Motown</a>/<a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Music_4ae9.html" title="Soul Music">Soul</a> style. Marcie's success was also confined more to live performance rather than chart success which didn't really arrive for her until 1973. And she still wore the gowns and mini skirts like all the others anyway.</p>
<p>But this wasn't for Alison who bolted out of the blocks screaming her straight up hard rock &amp; &amp; howling her blues, more often than not dressed in jeans &amp; T-Shirt. With her raucous rock vocals which deservedly won comparison with <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Turner_899c.html" title="Tina Turner">Tina Turner</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janis_Joplin_70f1.html" title="Janis Joplin">Janis Joplin</a> &amp; <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_Bell_0b20.html" title="Maggie Bell">Maggie Bell</a> who were blazing a similar trail overseas, she was in every way one of a kind in Australia. And she did it alone, without any of the shared decisions, work load and support that comes with being part of a band.</p>
<p>There were other girls singing rock at the time in Australia mindyou. Sharon Sims comes to mind in terms of success but she was part of a band, in her case Flake. Wendy Saddington would be the other obvious comparison but she was more your traditional blues belter rather than than a rock singer. There were other girls in rock bands who didn't have any commercial success. So Alison flew the flag alone as being the first and only female soloist until that time who sang pure rock, and gained sustained commercial success over a 5 year period doing it.</p>
<p>Alison began her career in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> singing with a succession of bands starting with Jeff Bulls Jazz Band. She soon moved on to Big Apple Union, singing Blues and Motown material. By the end of the year Alison started forging her reputation when Gulliver Smith joined the band. Gulliver who found lasting cult status as leader of his next band <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_Caine_b321.html" title="Company Caine">Company Caine</a>, joined her, bass player Arthur Eizenberg &amp; drummer Dave McKenzie to become the now almost legendary Dr. Kandy's Third Eye. Reputely Australia's first Psychedelic band, they sadly never recorded but they were a breeding ground for some of our best musos over the ensuing years. Apart from Alison and Gulliver, bassist Arthur Eizenberg and Sax/keyboard player Mal Capewell also went along for the Co.Caine ride with Mal going onto <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson.html" title="Carson">Carson</a>, Healing Force and Oz blues legends <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain.html" title="Chain">Chain</a>. Dave initially joined <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Hannaford_acd9.html" title="Ross Hannaford">Ross Hannaford</a> in Quill, then played with <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeannie_Lewis_6641.html" title="Jeannie Lewis">Jeannie Lewis</a> and a string of bands over the next 20 years and Dave Ovendon was an integral member of the fondly recalled 69ers. Finally there was Ian (aka Bob) Walsh who played with the Levi Smiths Clefs and <a href="../../../p/y/t/Python_Lee_Jackson_3b2f.html" title="Python Lee Jackson">Python Lee Jackson</a>. So much talent couldn't be contained in one band and they broke up in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>.</p>
<p>Alison spent 1969 singing with soul band This Hallelujah Chorus however in June that year she made her first recording with progressive band Tully. It was a great version of The <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee_Gees_290f.html" title="Bee Gees">Bee Gees</a> "To Love Somebody" and featured on the band's ABC-TV series "Fusions". However it did not become commercially available until the Glenn A. Baker compiled "Albert Archives" some 10 years later. It featured many rarities of the era and is now highly collectible</p>
<p>By 1970 she had joined the band that would provide her springboard to success, Freshwater . Freshwater were originally a New Zealand blues band who like many more before and since, crossed the Tasman in the late '60's. Following a few line-up changes they releasd a couple of pop singles without success until the release of the notorious Satan/Satan's Woman in 1970. By this stage they had adopted a more progressive direction. Alison joined the band as featured vocalist just after it's release.</p>
<p>In November of 1971 Alison sang out front on the band's next single "I Ain't Got The Time". It was credited to Freshwater featuring Alison MacCallum and this, her first recording also became her first hit, becoming a top 20 hit in her home town and Top 30 Nationally. Alison left Freshwater to pursue a solo career following this initial success though she did spend a short period with Ray Brown's One Ton Gypsy first. RCA, who had released the Freshwater single, then offered her a solo contract. Alison was still only 21, though she'd had a long apprenticeship but finally she was on her way and was ready to break down some boundaries doing it too.</p>
<p><a name="Solo_career" id="Solo_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_MacCallum_9bdc.html" title="Edit section: Solo career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Solo career</span></h2>
<p>To launch her solo career, RCA spared no expense, utilising the services of famed English producer/manager <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Napier-Bell_d23c.html" title="Simon Napier-Bell">Simon Napier-Bell</a> (<a href="../../../y/a/r/Yardbirds.html" title="Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Bolan_e2fa.html" title="Marc Bolan">Marc Bolan</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Sarstedt_7481.html" title="Peter Sarstedt">Peter Sarstedt</a>) to man the desk for Alison's debut album Fresh Water. For her first single from the album and her first solo single, Alison arrived with a bang when Superman / Take Me Back became a double sided National Top 10 smash in February 1972. The A Side, was a hard rocker penned by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Vanda_e227.html" title="Harry Vanda">Harry Vanda</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Young_%28rock_musician%29_6c4f.html" title="George Young (rock musician)">George Young</a> who had only recently left Australia's most successful 60's band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Easybeats_827d.html" title="The Easybeats">The Easybeats</a>. The flip, a more laid back country rock tune was penned by a then up and coming new tunesmith <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Mulry_8ddc.html" title="Ted Mulry">Ted Mulry</a>.</p>
<p>Fresh Water, which followed a month after the double sided hit, was an excellent album which included both sides of the single, several good rockers including the funk-rock title track and a nice take on the Rolling Stones The Last Time. There was also a magnificent slow blues reworking of the 1920s chestnut Organ Grinder Blues (aka Swing) and another Mean Woman Blues both of which featured outstanding guitar work. Big band, chugging jazz-rock was in order on Ain't Eatin' Dinner Tonight and the great rock ballad Any Way You Want Me (also the albums re-issue title) allowed Alison to move from a smokey lower register at the start then lifting the song a full octave to showcase her beautiful howl. It was a perfect showcase in which to highlight Alison's vocal mastery, as she effortlessly changed from spitting out the lyrics with abandon on the rockers, interspersing them with piercing screams and shrieks, to grunts and howls as she wailed dem blues and then showing a warm lower register when required. The album was greeted with much unanimous acclaim and featured many of our best musicians including master axeman Phil Manning who plays some fine guitar throughout. While not as successful as the single and nowhere near as successful as it should have been, this album (and Alison) still has the distinction of being the first by an Australian female artist to make the album charts. Another unsung credit for the pint sized fiery red-head.</p>
<p>Having already had 2 hits on the one single, rather than release another track from the album, Alison's next release in June featured 2 new tracks and it was one of her very best singles, Ol' Rock 'n' Roll Boogie Woogie Blues / Have You Seen Your Mother Baby (Standing In The Shadows). The A side was a rollicking rock boogie while the flip was a big band, brassy rock reworking of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> classic. It's lowly national chart peak was an insult though it did manage 2 months in the chart and went as high as #24 in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>.</p>
<p>The follow up It's Time / Hippy Gumbo (October 1972)is quite possibly the song that Alison is best remembered for these days and yet incongruously it's the one RCA single that did not chart anywhere in the country. <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_Time_90d7.html" title="It's Time">It's Time</a>, was the infamous <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a> call to voters for a change of government after they had spent 23 years in opposition. The song received saturation airplay on radio and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a>. In the TV advertisement Alison was joined in the chorus by a who's who of entertainment and sport personalities and the campaign was a resounding success, which makes the songs lack of chart success even more perplexing. Still as a direct result of this now historical campaign, Labor regained government for the first time since 1949.</p>
<p>Things improved chart wise with the next 2 singles both reaching various state listings. The first Would You Believe / Lonely, was a change of pace for Alison as both were big rock ballads, in the best sense of the word. However the follow up, Fire / Teach Me How To Fly saw a return to familiar territory and featured 2 slabs of hard rock with Alison at her considerable best. The latter song, originally recorded by US band, the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_Connection_0841.html" title="Rotary Connection">Rotary Connection</a> was much recorded in Australia at the time with versions by Jeff St. John, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flake.html" title="Flake">Flake</a>, Erl Dalby plus Alison's all released on singles within a space of just 2 years. Jeff enjoyed the chart success, and Alison's was confined to the B side, but the tougher guitar arrangement and vocal couldn't have been more different to Jeff's and compares more than favourably compared to the other 2.</p>
<p>After a hectic few years Alison then took a well deserved break and travelled overseas to follow up on interest from various countries.</p>
<p>Upon returning in 1974 Alison signed with a new record label <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Productions_1710.html" title="Albert Productions">Albert Productions</a> and the first recording Alison did for the label was a single by the then mysterious Hooter Sisters. It was later revealed that the Hooters were in fact Alison and two of Australia's finest female vocalists who also happened to be best friends, Bobbi Marchini and Janice Slater. The A side was a 3 way vocal workout on Phil Spector's To Know Him Is To Love Him while the B side was a more exprimental/progressive rock track co-written by Janice. Despite the combined tonsil power of these 3 fine ladies, the single sank without a trace, probably due to their individual commitments</p>
<p>Having got this out of the way, Alison set about recording her 2nd album 'Alison' (aka Excuse Me), again with Napier-Bell at the helm. Her new label was a large independent company and Alberts Australian roster over a 30 year period is second to none, featuring a who's who of Oz Rock. So expectations must have been high as it would seem to have been the ideal home for Alison. Yet for reasons unknown, they softened Alison's image by having her apply more makeup, put on shimmering, glittery dresses and had her record in a more mellow pop/soul vein despite her previous success in rock.</p>
<p>The first result of this change of image was the soulful ballad Excuse Me which in fact became Alison's 2nd biggest hit, so the change must have seemed like a good move at the time. Although it only went as high as #29 Nationally, it's chart life spanned nearly a full year. This was due to each state picking it up for airplay at different times. Adelaide led the way in October 1974 where it peaked in the Top 5 at #4, by January 1975 it was #12 in Sydney and Brisbane sent it all the way to #1 in May '75. Victoria was the only state not to pick the single up but it was nonethless a promising new start for Alison.</p>
<p>However when the album came out in June 1975, it only managed 2 solitary weeks at the bottom of the Top 100 and Alison never made the charts again. There was a 2nd single from the album, a fine reworking of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gram_Parson_95bc.html" title="Gram Parson">Gram Parson</a>'s Hot Burrito, retitled Her Kind Of Guy for single release but it went nowhere. It was one of the few highlights of an otherwise lacklustre album, which completely lacked any sign of the fiery rock vocals with which Alison had made her name. Only 2 tracks, the Vanda/Young ballad "Things To Do", previously a minor hit for <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Farnham_c922.html" title="Johnny Farnham">Johnny Farnham</a> and the soulful blues of Cry For Me hinted at the vocal power that was being harnessed and were all the better for it. There was one final, newly recorded single for Alberts Love Grows Cold / Lunatic Love in February 1976 but it too missed the charts completely and, as absurd as it sounds, that was the end of this rock pioneer's recording career.</p>
<p><a name="LIFE_AFTER_CHART_SUCCESS" id="LIFE_AFTER_CHART_SUCCESS"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_MacCallum_9bdc.html" title="Edit section: LIFE AFTER CHART SUCCESS">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>LIFE AFTER CHART SUCCESS</b></span></h2>
<p>Following her years as a hit maker, Alison began a second successful period as one of Australia's most in-demand <a href="../../../s/e/s/Session_singers.html" title="Session singers">session singers</a>. Some of the many recordings she appeared on includes those by artists as diverse as <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Parkinson_b609.html" title="Doug Parkinson">Doug Parkinson</a>, Ross Ryan, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Thorpe_cf4f.html" title="Billy Thorpe">Billy Thorpe</a>, Jeff St. John, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Holden_cae0.html" title="Mark Holden">Mark Holden</a> (tragic isn't it!!), Marty Rhone and <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slim_Dusty_53e0.html" title="Slim Dusty">Slim Dusty</a>'s daughter, Anne Kirkpatrick.</p>
<p>Then an unexpected event thrust Alison back in the limelight again in 1979. <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281978_film%29.html" title="Superman (1978 film)">Superman</a>, the film that re-introduced the man of steel to a new generation and launched the career of blue eyed heartthrob <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Reeve_86c6.html" title="Christopher Reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>, was the unexpected blockbuster hit of the year. In an effort to gain extra mileage out of Alison's old hit, RCA re-issued Alison's original smash hit single of the same name from 1972. The record was also released as a 12" single to further boost sales. She appeared on a few shows to promote the record and Alison's stalled career was given extra impetus when RCA released a 'Best Of" album, also called Superman. It compiled highlights from her 1st long player plus many of her non-album singles tracks, thus making it quite a desirable package for fans who had worn out the old singles. Still it was pointed out by contemporary reviewers that the release was missing several single tracks, inluding the infamous "It's Time" and her hit she had when she fronted Freshwater. Considering the album had only 10 tracks and it's relatively short running time, all of these could have been included thus completing a very impressive profile of Alison's early career.</p>
<p>The bottom line is though, that despite the rejuvenation it brought to her career, it proved to be only temporary as being the era of disco and punk/new wave, the single and album, being re-issues of old school rock, were not as successful as hoped. So again Alison went back to her session work which kept her busy until the mid 1980's. Since that time she seems to have slipped completely from view.</p>
<p>So where is Alison MacCallum? Her friend Bobbi Marchini tells me that if you were to put a mic in front of her, she'd be up on any nearby stage, wailing away before you could say Excuse Me. I'm also led to believe that without being in the slightest bit conceited, she has a healthy regard for her position at the forefront of female rock performers in Australia.</p>
<p>A re-evaluation of Alison's groundbreaking role in Oz Rock and her contributions to the development and acceptance of women in the rock industry is long overdue. As has been shown, Alison broke quite a few rules for women, set several precedents and enjoyed success on her own terms, though not as much as she deserved. Above all, there was THAT joyous, howling, shrieking, gutsy, reckless, warm voice, second only to Renee Geyer in my opinion, though their styles are quite different. Hopefully a re-issue of her RCA material in particular will lead to her being rediscovered and restore Alison MacCallum to her rightful place in Australian Music history.</p>
