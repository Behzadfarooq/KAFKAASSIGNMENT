<p>In your edit to the list of notable Brandeisians, you removed two people with the comment "... not notable, else would have own Wikipedia articles." I don't have an opinion about whether these two people are notable, but I did want to point out that many Wikipedia articles start as red links from elsewhere; in fact, many of the articles I've created started as this kind of link. In other words, your argument about notability doesn't follow how the Wikipedia works, and you ought to have other reasons for feeling that something is not notable before you remove it. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 04:00, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just saw this happen again. It seems to me, on the face of it, ridiculous to remove people solely on the grounds that they don't have wikipedia articles. Wikipedia is a work in progress and many things are missing. People sometimes find out what's missing, and contribute, due to redlinks. What sense does it possibly make to circularly claim that because they're not in wikipedia already, they're not notable?Cos 05:31, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want you to realize that when you remove notable people from the listing, and make statements like "cohen is not notable', you are both defaming an individual, and alienating that person as a donor to Brandeis University. Nathan Cohen is indeed listed in wikipedia, under 'fractal antennas'. If you use this false assertion again, it will likely create a formal dispute against you--formal as in legal. I urge you to correct your error less it be interpreted as being of 'intent'.</p>
<p>Note that one of the notables removed was quite notable (most economists would agree): <a href="http://www.iie.com/publications/author_bio.cfm?author_id=47" class="external free" title="http://www.iie.com/publications/author_bio.cfm?author_id=47" rel="nofollow">http://www.iie.com/publications/author_bio.cfm?author_id=47</a></p>

<p>The <i>quotation</i> from the reference, "Brandeis, a nonsectarian institution, was founded in 1948, by American Jews seeking to establish a university free from the quotas that Jews faced at elite colleges," is highly relevant and is needed to support the statement in the article. I agree that the article itself has a title that's irrelevant and might lead one to question my motives in citing it... but I couldn't figure out an appropriate or honest way to cite it without mentioning the title.</p>
<p>I'm going to try abbreviating the title to "Brandeis pulls artwork..."</p>
<p>I do plan to look for a less "incongruous" reference. But Brandeis' origins as a response to discrimination are important to mention, just as are <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a>'s origins as a response to anti-Catholic discrimination, and the Brandeis website tap-dances around this and, it seems, a number of other circumstances connected with Brandeis' founding (its connection with Albert Einstein, for example).</p>

<dd>Be advised, Matthew Fenton apparently has delusions of ownership of several Wikipedia articles. For some reason, he thinks he is the Be All and End All of any dispute over articles and entry editing, and has no problem trying to force his views down everyone's throat. If anyone's guilty of disrupting actions, it's Matthew. Stick to your guns, reverse any unwarranted, wanton edits he makes at least once a day, and eventually he'll get it through his head that he doesn't own Wikipedia. Not by a long shot. 66.90.151.114 07:47, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If they've released these images under a free license, I would be happy to remove the RFU notices and get these off the chopping block. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 23:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to nominate these for deletion again. This is getting ridiculous. Anyone could just go to the same spot and take new pictures, there's no reason why we have to wait for weeks to get permission to use these. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 01:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite you hostile accusations of vandalism, I have restored the image. Please add a copyright tag to it. Failure to do so will result in the image being deleted again.

<dd>1. I don't think you're being dishonest, but you may be mistaken. A lot of people get this stuff wrong. It's very confusing.</dd>
<dd>2. If you're claiming an image that doesn't belong to you is GFDL, you have to present evidence it's so. That's not just to please me, it's standard practice.</dd>
<dd>3. I don't. It only seems that way to you because you pay more attention to this image than to ones you didn't upload. Look at my history; I've nominated hundreds of photos for deletion.</dd>
<dd>4. Well, yeah. If I (or anybody) disputes something, doesn't that automatically mean it's in dispute?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why don't you just post the e-mail? If you have a note from the guy saying they release the image under the GFDL, I'll drop the whole thing. Wouldn't that be easier than spending all this time fighting with me?—<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 03:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please try to drop the hostility, it gets us nowhere. As I said before, I don't believe you're lying, but rather that you might be mistaken. When I post an image from Flickr to here or Commons, I have to point to its original source to show that it has truly been released under the license I said it was. I don't take having to do this as a personal affront or a reflection on my character; I simply understand that mistakes get made and its good to have more eyes on something. Please don't be offended that you're being held to the same standard that I or anyone else is. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 17:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry you're not willing to discuss this in a civil manner. Speculating about my motives and character is quite unseemly and hardly productive to our goal here. Please let me know if you change your mind later and are willing to limit our conversation to the issues at hand. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 18:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't once called you a liar, in fact I've said the opposite repeatedly. I don't think your e-mail counts as a "private" correspondence when you made it clear that you were writing on behalf of Wikipedia. And there are other reasons why we'd want to have the e-mail. Suppose somebody else from Brandeis says "No, we own the copyright on this and it's not GFDL". If we have the correspondence available, we can point them to that.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Anyway, if you're still nervous about posting the e-mail publicly, how about this for a compromise: forward it to &lt;permissions@wikimedia.org&gt;. That way, it won't be available to everybody, but Wikipedia administrators will still be able to refer to it in case of a dispute. How does that sound? —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 18:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you try to post to my talk page at least once without accusing me of something? You never told me you had forwarded the e-mail to permissions. That's fine then, I'll see if I can get somebody to follow up on that. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 20:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
