<dd>You sir are a jobsworth idiot. The big version is licensed one way. The small version is edited and licensed another way. Both licenses are within the ethos of "sharing".

<dd>Well, Mr. Alii h, are you always so unfriendly? If the license used here at Wikipedia is ok in the eyes of the author, all right, then the image should noe be deleted. It would have been easier if you said so at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2006_May_10_b812.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 May 10">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 May 10</a> instead of calling me an idiot here.</dd>

<dd>I can see that you have uploaded many images of Liverpool players, and this problem applies to all of them. The page here at Wikipedia says one license, but the link to flickr says something different. You should specify that these images are licensed under a different license at Wikipedia, so that other contributors do not think they are nc-only and then listing them for deletion. <a href="../../../k/j/e/User%7EKjetil_r_d175.html" title="User:Kjetil r">kjetil_r</a> 21:55, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am unfriendly because I'm annoyed that the Peter Crouch photo was deleted without any notification. I hadn't saved a copy of the edit, and still haven't gotten around to redoing it. <b>If you had honestly doubted the author's consent you could have mailed him via Flickr</b>. Personally I think you just like deleting photos that people have put time and effort into uploading. I will at least credit you with notifying me this time. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 22:01, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>p.s. there are MANY photos of footballers that are MUCH more deserving of deletion. I suggest that in future you concentrate your efforts on the multitude that are stolen from comercial websites rather than photos taken by the public, but using two slightly non-matching licenses on different sites <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 22:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe you are right, maybe I should have mailed the author. I often do so in case of doubt, but for some reason I did not this time.</dd>
<dd>I am not sure why you think this is "anti-Liverpool vandalism", I have (of course) no interest in removing content from Wikipedia unless the content is a copyright violation.</dd>
<dd>If this licensing issue is solved, I will copy the images to the Wikimedia Commons, so they can be used in other Wikipedias. They are nice images, your friend is a very good photographer.</dd>
<dd>The uploader should according to the rules of Wikipedia always be notified when an image is considered for deletion. You should tell this to the person whom deleted it, beeing an admin he should know this. <a href="../../../k/j/e/User%7EKjetil_r_d175.html" title="User:Kjetil r">kjetil_r</a> 22:14, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your friend's image was deleted by <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungfuadam_b5d5.html" title="User:Kungfuadam">User:Kungfuadam</a>, with the cryptic reason "csd i3". I am not sure what is the maning of "csd i3", you should ask User:Kungfuadam.</dd>
<dd>The current image of Crouch is tagged as a promotional photo. This is most likely not correct, and I will thus list if for deletion as a (possible) copyright violation. I agree that there are MANY other photos of footballers which are more deserving of deletion than your friend's. <a href="../../../k/j/e/User%7EKjetil_r_d175.html" title="User:Kjetil r">kjetil_r</a> 22:39, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The copyright patrollers tend to be a bit cryptic at times! "CSD I3" means "Criteria for Speedy Deletion: Image 3" - the third image criterion reads: 'Improper license. Images licensed as "for non-commercial use only" or "used with permission" that were uploaded on or after 19 May 2005, and for which no assertion of fair use is provided.'. See <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>.

<dd>The point is not whether you think it is dumb or stupid. The point is to write articles to a high standard within Wikipedia's guidelines. By formatting dates that contain days, months and years, we enable the program's software to sort the dates according to a user's preferences.

Please see <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Liverpool_FC" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Liverpool_FC">Category:Liverpool FC</a>. Now the images can be used in all the different Wikipedias.

<p>Wikpedia style is very clearly not to link the same words repeatedly, especially when they're close together. please don't return to that style again. It's not a good defence to say that other articles commit the same error. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:08, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see from other comments here that you are either unaware of or don't care about Wikipedia style. I strongly suggest that you remedy that. I more strongly suggest that you don't revert editors who are correcting articles in line with Wikipedia style; that behaviour is likely to get you blocked from editing. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:49, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you want to continue editing here, you should learn to care about Wikipedia (not my) style.</li>
<li>If you had changed the mistake rather merely mass-reverting everything, I might have known what you were talking about. Calm explanations are generally more informative and productive than tantrums.</li>
<li>You may disagree, but should be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>; you may not, however, insist on reverting good-faith edits that bring articles into line with the Wikipedia MoS. That is disruptive. Conformity with policies and guidelines isn't a matter for consensus.</li>
<li>I'm not threatening but warning. The pattern of your behaviour is familiar: aggressive bluster, refusal to reflect on your position, open contempt for community standards, etc. There are two ways it always goes: either you'll realise that your approach is counterproductive, change your ways, and become a productive member of the editing community, or you'll settle into a stubborn rut of reverting, waving your arms about, and making juvenile attacks on other editors — in which case you'll eventually find yourself facing a series of blocks and other sanctions. I'd rather that you went the former route, but it's your choice. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 20:29, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes and perhaps you should apologise for your inconsiderate editing of pages that I've put a lot of work into? Your edit changed what I thought was a good format. Yes I know about overlinking, but whether something is truely overlinked or not is reasonably subjective. You didn't leave any kind of decent explanation for me until after we'd both reverted each other's edits a number of times.
<ul>
<li>My edit had 3 links in close proximity. I had left them in the infobox for consistency of style, i.e. dates in black, teams in blue. There was nothing overly offensive about it. The article itself had no such overlinking.</li>
<li>Your edit had a careless typo and some information removed. I saw it as careless, unnecessary and rude, and so I reverted you. You reverted me without correcting your mistakes, and so I simply reverted you again as you were being continually rude.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I may have come across as confrontational, but your continual "No, I <i>am</i> correct" revisions came across to me as confrontational. You started this. You are still being rude with your refusal to take any blame. As I read through your talk pages I see a lot of this arrogant "I know best" behaviour. Sure you contribute a lot, and probably do know the correct style better than the average contributor, but can you not accept that your behaviour in this case was far from ideal? I can accept that mine was, but as I have pointed out a number of times already <i>you</i> started this and I felt the need to defend my position. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 10:15, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see your point of view, but I want to include the "tidbit" because I do find the fact itself very interesting. As Riise was one of the main involved, I believe it qualifies to be included in the article about him. Also, as Wikipedia is not paper we can afford to keep it there. The article is so well structured, that it doesn't ruin the readability. When it comes to your point about the info being more about the crowd response and rivalry, well that is down to the way it is written. Either way, I don't think it should qualify a removal!&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearFunk_3f01.html" title="User:NuclearFunk">NuclearFunk</a> 16:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> before putting all those lists on afd, and I did so again after seeing your comment on my talk page. I still think that these particular lists violate policy. Our disagreement is based on our differing interpretations of WP:NOT: you seem to be focusing on the numbered lists while I believe that the introductory paragraphs for each subheading hold more weight. I say this because on my talk page you cited #1 and #2 under "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" while ignoring the paragraph above it which states the following: "<b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia.</b> While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not:...". The bold part shows the reason why I put all those lists up for deletion. The unbolded part shows that the numbered points are merely cases where consensus was already reached ("current consenses is that Wikipedia is not"), and that anything else is still an issue ("there is a continuing depate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries"). Look at the afd voting on these lists and you can see that the consensus is that these particular lists need to be deleted. I hope this reply is satisfactory. -<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl">EdGl</a> 21:50, 1 June 2006 (UTC) (P.S.

<p>I don't see what the problem is. This "stupidity and politics", as you call it, is called <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">consensus</a>. Without this fundamental Wikipedia guideline, the processes that go on at Wikipedia would be a disaster. I went through the correct process (<a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a>) and allowed the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedian.html" title="Wikipedian">Wikipedian</a> community to reach a consensus. Is there anything wrong with that? You're just an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Inclusionism">inclusionist</a>, that's all. You just need to accept and live with the fact that a lot of Wikipedians are <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionist" class="extiw" title="meta:deletionist">deletionists</a>, whether you like it or not. I am not the worst of them; I don't know if I would even consider myself a deletionist. Nominating a mere 3 lists does not make me "nomination happy" as you call it. Don't call my actions "sad" just because you have different viewpoints. I respect your opinions; respect mine. In the end, our individual opinions don't matter, its the general consensus that pretty much governs Wikipedia. AFD is as fair as it gets, and there's no politics involved. -<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl">EdGl</a> 00:11, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Fan sites, other than the main official site, and fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included. My view is that this should also apply to forums. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> gives more details on this.

<p>Apologies Ali, it appears that I was inadvertently edit warring with you on the Pelé article. Whenever I made edits it came up with edit conflict page but I thought this was because I had two edit windows open. Apologies.</p>
<p>We do, however, seem to be disagreeing as to just how many goals Pelé should be credited with in the infobox at the top right of the page (as the infobox says, this should only be league goals). Which competitions do you reckon we should count? Do Soccer Europe follow an accepted norm when they calculate Pelé's league goals? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kemp_db60.html" title="User:James Kemp">Jim</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Kemp_4cf0.html" title="User talk:James Kemp">Talk</a>) 10:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the message. I see your point regarding these other competitions. However, since rsssf.com implicitly define them as competitive (i.e., by not listing them beneath their list of friendly tournments), do you not think we should actually list the goals and appearances Pele recorded in these competitions? To add an extra column to the main table for each comeptition would soon get unwieldy, but a column for "other" competitions, with a full break down in a seperate, small table underneath, might be a good idea. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kemp_db60.html" title="User:James Kemp">Jim</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Kemp_4cf0.html" title="User talk:James Kemp">Talk</a>) 12:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you know who Tommy Adams is? If not you might google him and/or the " Adams family Islington." It was not alleged during the 2004 'Wayne Rooney' trial that Dalglish brought Tommy Adams to a meeting. It was accepted by both the prosecution and defence. Normal people do not associate with the likes of Tommy Adams. Those in the public eye, no matter how good a footballer they were, have to be described in a comprehensive way. Dalglish has associated with a number of criminals and it is appropriate to comment on this. To selectively edit comments to paint Dalglish in the best light is inappropriate. The bona fides or otherwise of John Stretford evidence on other matters do not change the fact that Dalglish attended a meeting re Rooney and brought a convicted drug dealer with him. The police accepted it, the prosecution and defence lawyers accepted. If it were some how a gross libel, which it was not, why did Dalglish not turn up with his lawyer at a police station and defend his good name. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.156.33.151 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.156.33.151.html" title="User talk:82.156.33.151">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.156.33.151_4c2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.156.33.151">contribs</a>) 20:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>I assume you read the above but you then proceded to change the aricle back to reflect your prejudices. It is easier for you to ignore all of the above. You are very quick to point be they real, or imagined, comments buy others that you assert do not confirm with Wikipedia's house style. That said you do not follow the rules yourself. For instance at the start of the article when you eulogise Dalglish the player as ' the greatest' etc where is your citation? It is not my problem that you did not watch the news or read a newspaper in 2004 when this trial was on. Nor do I accept your implicit contention that the fact Dalglish brought Adams to a meeting should be buried at the bottom of the article. That is even more offensive when you proceed to write a self-serving account of the trial. Yes-Stretford was found to be an unreliable witness but this was on the basis of his evidence over what point in time a contract started. There was no dispute that Dalglish brought Tommy Adams to a meeting in 2002. It was accepted as fact in court. Again I repeat- if he had some how been brought in to something that didn't happen by others with their own agenda- why did he refuse the chance to place the record state when the police wanted to interview him. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.156.33.151 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.156.33.151.html" title="User talk:82.156.33.151">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.156.33.151_4c2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.156.33.151">contribs</a>) 11:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Hi alii. the edits you were reverting were not vandalism in any way shape or form; what you were engaged in was a content dispute, so you can't quite take the position that you were "protecting" the page. (sorry, but i think this is clear if you look at the diffs.) You may not think that the content should be there, but the insertion of it isn't vandalism. second, for future reference--3rr has nothing to do with days, but rather 24 hour periods; its 4 reverts in 24 hours, and midnight doesn't change anything. I think that's pretty clear from the wording of the policy.</dd>
<dd>anyways. your block will be up tomorrow. it's not that big a deal.</dd>

<p>Hi there Alii</p>
<p>As well as placing a paragraph on the article's talk page, I have also amended the disputed paragraph to reflect the report more accurately. Whilst I am still not perfectly happy with the weight of this section in relation to the overall size of the article, it would appear to be a solution. I have agreed to the use of the word "refused" as this is a direct quote from the newspaper article and could, in fact, be used as an inline citation. I hope that you will be satisfied with the compromise. Regards -- <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlias_Flood_895d.html" title="User:Alias Flood">Alias Flood</a> 17:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Odd. I had the same problem, also with an 86.x.x.x address (I'm 86.129.77.199 at the moment). I didn't note the exact IP address the block was reporting, but it was also 66.x.x.x. I wonder if something somewhere blocked the wrong address range... That'll have caused a few comments, as the 86.128.0.0 - 86.135.255.255 range is allocated to BT so covers quite a lot of Brit editors&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 14:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Alii, thanks for your picture of Anfield. I am an Italian Liverpool FC fan and built the article "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it:Anfield" class="extiw" title="w:it:Anfield">Anfield</a>" in my language, wish you have a look.

<p>Hey there. The <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._Reserves_2fca.html" title="Liverpool F.C. Reserves">Liverpool F.C. Reserves</a> article has been nominated for deletion. I really think that the information is useful and notable, but there's no way it could all be merged back into the LFC main article, which is already too long. I am so far the only person who has voted for keeping the article, and would appreciate your support in the afd. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 18:30, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Reserves article should be kept. I would be grateful if you could take a look at say if there is anything more to add, as you have been making some pretty good arguments, and seem to have persuaded a fair few people of the mertis of an Academy article as well. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 17:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't think I've suddenly started to ignore you if you reply but its getting late so I'm going to bed! Seriously though there is nothing vindictive about my nomination...I actually cheered Liverpool winning the Champions League final. You'll notice I have made suggestions in Liverpool F.C. talk about getting it a featured article and I genuinely feel from experience getting <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everton_F.C._db0c.html" title="Everton F.C.">Everton F.C.</a> featured that these reserves won't help matters. Its good that you seem to be arguing for the right reasons though unlike others in the discussion. As for my category suggestion if it appeals I'm willing to help. All the best. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenorKristobbal_a2de.html" title="User:SenorKristobbal">SenorKristobbal</a> 00:12, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I appreciate where you are coming from and hope you are right about the article being reprieved. I am just trying to make a point. It should never have been nominated for deletion in the first place and the fact that it was nominated by a self-confessed Evertonian is just a joke. While I agree that an article on every Premiership reserve team would be excessive, I think articles on some of the bigger teams reserve teams would be appropriate. I am actually quiet surprised that Man U one has'nt been. <a href="../../../d/j/l/User%7EDjln_4f4c.html" title="User:Djln">Djln</a>--<a href="../../../d/j/l/User%7EDjln_4f4c.html" title="User:Djln">Djln</a> 14:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that the FC article is large. That's the main reason I didn't just merge it myself. I'm not convinced of the notability of the song standing on its own merits. It's not a notable song in and of itself so far as I can determine. I thought perhaps that as a part of the rewriting process on the FC article, important parts that are notable in and of themselves might get their own articles and the chant might come inside the FC article in a way reflective of its notability. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 18:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eh, it's just that that option effectively excluded Pluto from renaming, whilst the other option didn't. And there were a lot of people going around talking about how the vote wasn't really valid, and my attempts to check there really was consensus and all options were considered were getting mockery and so on. I just wanted to make sure there was consensus.</p>
<p>Still don't like the inconsistancy with the trest of the asteroifd chain, but I'll give it a few months then re-raise the issue if it still seems important. Probably best to standardise now, deal with quibbles over how to standardise later - the other option is stress all around.</p>
<p>Still annoyed that my vote was closed only a couple hours after it started with no attempts to get an consensus to close, just people doing it, though. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 19:01, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"revert ridiculous revision to awful old version" is a rather uncivil edit summary. I really appreciate the time and effort you have put into improving the article, but remember this is a team effort and major changes to an article may cause trouble.

By discuss, I don't mean telling us what you have done or what you are going to do, but an actual discussion. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 21:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Feel free to revert to the version you prefer, it was just an accidental removal from User:ChinsuH, while dealing with vandalism. Keep up the good work! - <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyanw_4457.html" title="User:Myanw">Myanw</a> 11:52, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is in reply to your message to me</p>
<p>Sorry for not knowing exactly where to put my message to you. I apologize for not keeping it in the correct format and after reading my message feel free to revert to the previous edit.</p>
<p>About the Pele revert that I did ... I accidentally chose an edit to revert to that was apparently done earlier than MyanW's revert of the vandalism. I never added or subtracted anything; I just accidentally chose the wrong edit to use and I'll be more careful in the future. What I should have done is revert to his revert; I'll know to do that in the future should I do it at the same time as someone else who is patrolling for vandalism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by ChinsuH (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChinsuH_e338.html" title="User talk:ChinsuH">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChinsuH_02da.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChinsuH">contribs</a>) 11:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>(edit conflict) As I explained above, the removal was accidental, I reinserted "He is of African descent", it should be okay now. Cheers. - <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyanw_4457.html" title="User:Myanw">Myanw</a> 12:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To tell the truth, I think it's a bit awkward, IMO, it's pretty clear that he is indeed of African descent. Do as it pleases you the most. Happy editing. - <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyanw_4457.html" title="User:Myanw">Myanw</a> 12:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great effort. Please don't revert the article again though.

<p>Hi, seeing you have been involved in previous Afd debates on the subject I invite you to contribute to this discussion to clarify certain issues about football player notability. I think clearer guidelines are needed to avoid repeated inappropriate nominations for deletion and time consuming discussions.
