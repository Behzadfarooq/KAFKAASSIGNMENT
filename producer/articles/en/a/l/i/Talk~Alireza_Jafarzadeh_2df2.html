<p>Alireza Jafarzadeh is the leading voice in Washington on Iran's nuclear threat, terrorism, and Islamic extremism. Jafarzadeh is the rising star in foreign policy circles, who is considered as the ultimate authority on Iran.</p>
<p>Jafarzadeh was the whistleblower that drew a worldwide attention on Iran's nuclear weapons program, when he first revealed on August 14, 2002 that Iran is actually running a secret nuclear facility in Natanz, and a heavy water facility in Arak.</p>

<p>Actually, Iran was under no obligation to disclose the construction of the nuclear sites that the terrorist MEK "revealed" so dramatically, and in fact the IAEA knew about Iran's plans to enrich uranium, since the IAEA had been cooperating with Iran on the program in 1983 and IAEA inspectors had visited Iran's uranium mines in 1992 according to Melissa Fleming, the IAEA spokesperson. This makes Jafarzadeh nothing more than an opportunist.</p>
<p>SOURCES:</p>
<p>"Although Iran is a party to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, it has not concluded an Additional Protocol to its agreement. The Additional Protocol would provide for more rigorous inspections, including inspections of undeclared nuclear facilities. On December 13, ElBaradei called upon Iran to conclude such a protocol. Iran, however, is not required to allow visits to the Arak and Natanz sites under its current agreements with the IAEA.</p>

<p>"Iran did not have to declare that it was building a pilot plant until 180 days before it expected to introduce nuclear material into the plant."</p>
<p>Furor over fuel; Iran. Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists May 1, 2003 Albright, David; Hinderstein, Corey</p>
<p><br />
and</p>
<p>"A spokesman for the U.S. Department of State asserted in a press briefing last week that Iran was out of compliance with its IAEA obligations because it had failed to notify the IAEA of its intent to build the facilities 180 days prior to construction.</p>
<p>IAEA officials told NuclearFuel Dec. 18 that was not the case. Rumyantsev's assertion that Iran did not violate its commitments <i>was correct,</i> one official said.</p>
<p>In 1992, after the Gulf War, the IAEA Board of Governors recommended by consensus that member states provide design information to the IAEA 180 days in advance of construction. Iran, however, singularly raised objections to that. Compliance with the board's recommendation, an IAEA official said, has since been <i>voluntary.</i> A similar provision is contained in the Additional Protocol for integrated IAEA safeguards, which thus far Iran has refused to join and which so far is not binding.</p>
<p>Infcirc-153, the model safeguards protocol for member states of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), including Iran, discusses facility design information in Articles 42-47. But any specific requirement on a member state for reporting design information and notification to the IAEA of an intention to construct a nuclear facility subject to safeguards is handled in confidential Subsidiary Arrangements, which are annexed to the safeguards agreement and are country-specific.</p>
<p>In the case of Iran, the Subsidiary Arrangements for Infcirc-214 -- Iran's safeguards agreement with the IAEA -- require Iran to notify the IAEA of any new nuclear facility and to provide information on the design no later than 60 days prior to the introduction of nuclear material into the facility.</p>
<p>In early safeguards agreements such as Iran's -- it dates from 1974 -- member states were allowed considerable freedom in notifying the IAEA of new nuclear facility construction, said one former U.S. official, <i>practically right up until they loaded</i> fuel. <i>More recent agreements require notification in</i> advance. For example, the Subsidiary Arrangements for Argentina and Brazil under the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting &amp; Control of Nuclear Material (Abacc) regime, dating from 1994, specified that the two countries must give notification <i>at the time the</i> decision is made to construct an installation, <i>he</i> said."</p>

<p>Jafarzadeh is a very important figure who revealed major nuclear sites of Iran, and therefore is very much liked by the free world and democratic elements of Iran, and hated by the Iranian regime. That is where the dispute is eminating from. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.58.7.159 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.58.7.159.html" title="User talk:208.58.7.159">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.58.7.159_d8a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.58.7.159">contribs</a>) 19 March 2006.</small> Jafarzadeh was also (until recently) the spokesperson for an organisation known as NCRI (National Council of Resistance in Iran). Whilst they openly claim to be democratic and secular, some people have drawn links with NCRI and the Baathist regime in Iraq, and there are numerous reports on the internet of Jafarzadehs involvement in the massacre of Iraqi Kurds under the sanction of Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time researching Alireza Jafarzadeh today so that I could supply fully referenced factual material for the page. Someone called Middle East Editor reverted the lot without comment. I call that vandalism. There is no excuse for deleting well referenced factual content.

<p>Zionist-run (<a href="http://judicial-inc.biz/wikipedia.htm" class="external free" title="http://judicial-inc.biz/wikipedia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://judicial-inc.biz/wikipedia.htm</a>) and Sayanim-controlled (aka the Hebrew Battalion) <i>Wikipedia</i> (encyclopedia??? Mossad-encyclopedia is more appropriate) insist that the well known anti-Iran terrorist <b>Alireza Jafarzadeh</b>, a member of British-Israeli-American-funded and armed terrorist group the Mojahedin-e-Khalgh (MEK, MKO) also known as the National Council of Resistance (NCR) is an <b>Iranian dissident</b> (thus, <b>Osama bin Laden</b> is also a dissident by Zionist-Wikipedia's definition! that's what you get when a porn-peddling Zionist and Mossad asset like Jimmy Wales is behind such an INTEL OP).</p>
<p>The history of the terrorist Mojahedin-e-Khalgh is well known to those who have studied and know about MEK/MKO/NCR, and its leaders (Massoud Rajavi and Maryam Ghajar-Azadanloo-Rajavi). These two terrorists, sorry <b>dissidents</b> (just so the Hebrew Battalion monitors are happy) have committed horrific acts in Iran, Iraq and elsewhere. But since they and Alireza Jafarzadeh are working for Israel/West, they are called dissidents! and that's the agenda of porn-peddling Zionist-Wikipedia. But for the rest of us, they are monsters, and war criminals, so is Mossad, MI6, and CIA who create, finance, and arm these monsters.</p>
<p>To learn about these criminals, and their atrocities, you will need to take a look at <b>Hebrew-Free</b> sites: <a href="http://www.iran-interlink.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.iran-interlink.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iran-interlink.org/</a> , <a href="http://www.irandidban.com/index-e.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.irandidban.com/index-e.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.irandidban.com/index-e.asp</a></p>

<p>AS per very clear and specific WP/BLP guidelines, Iran-interlink should not be used as a reputable and authorized source on Jafarzadeh. This site is mainly a compilation of defamatory lies and half-lies about Jafarzadeh and numerous other Iranian opposition activists. Jafarzadeh, as per his own web pages, has been the spokesman for the representative office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). If any one believes that this statement is not correct or know any thing beyond that, must say so in a none defamatory fashion and ONLY based on well documented references and sources.</p>

<p>revert again. David Moss obviously has a personal agenda against Jafarzadeh. Nevertheless, I suggest a process of building consensus.</p>
<p>Instead of keep reverting, lets start with a version with no defamatory content and then start adding content as Dave suggests only after its accuracy is supported from reliable sources. For example, the following paragraph. What is the source for it?</p>
<p>Jafarzadeh married Robabeh Sadeghi of Babol, Iran, in 1986 and the couple were divorced four years later. Both the marriage and the divorce were allegedly performed under orders from Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK)[6]. Sima-azad 17:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)Sima</p>

<dd>The only agenda I have is to make sure properly referenced information is not replaced by vanity material. This article has an unfortunate history of having good work by many editors overwritten by poorly referenced material that is more flattering to the subject. A biography is not a <a href="../../../e/u/l/Eulogy.html" title="Eulogy">eulogy</a>. It should contain all known information about the subject, not just favourable information. I would suggest that we start a consensus building process using the <b>existing article</b> as a basis. Any suggestions should be about <i>improving</i> or <i>expanding</i> the article, not about suppressing information Mr Jafarzadeh would find unflattering. Any attempt to remove properly referenced existing information will be considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDALISM_fbc5.html" title="WP:VANDALISM">vandalism</a> and appropriate action taken against repeat offenders. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 02:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Revert again until we identify what the source of defamatory allegations are. See talk. To begin with, where does the information of your assertions on Jafarzadeh’s marriage and divorce come from. What is your source of research?</p>
<p>Jafarzadeh married Robabeh Sadeghi of Babol, Iran, in 1986 and the couple were divorced four years later. Both the marriage and the divorce were allegedly performed under orders from Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK)[6].</p>
<p>Let's identify the source of this information. David has complained about "poorly referenced" information. David also claims that his additions are the result of his hard work and diligent research. May be it is about time he shares with us what are the references he uses in his research before assassinating a reputable character. I beg him to read guidelines on WP:BLP.</p>

<dd>If you look at the end of the paragraph you cut and pasted you will see a number in square brackets (for example [6]). If you look at this position within the article itself you will see a superscripted number (for example<sup>6</sup>). If you click on the number you will be taken to the references section of the article. The reference with the matching number describes the source of the information for the paragraph. Often these references have a URL included that hyperlinks directly to the source material. Every single contribution I make to Wikipedia is as well referenced as I can make it. In fact I am so keen on referencing that I wrote program called <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_Wikicite_9973.html" title="User:Dmoss/Wikicite">Wikicite</a> to assist with the effort.

<p>Quoting “iran-inerlink.org” or quoting a secondary source that quotes “iran-interlink.org” is not acceptable practice. Iran-interlink is a disguise site by the Iranian intelligence ministry with the mission of character assassination of the opposition figures. See discussion in the talk page (here) on interlink.</p>
<p>Let me remind you of some of the WP:BLP policies:</p>
<p>[edit] Remove unsourced or poorly sourced controversial material Editors should remove any controversial material about living persons that is either unsourced, relies upon sources that do not meet standards specified in Wikipedia:Reliable sources, or is a conjectural interpretation of a source. In cases where the information is derogatory and poorly sourced or unsourced, this kind of edit is an exception to the three-revert rule. These principles apply to biographical material about living persons found anywhere in Wikipedia, including user and talk pages. Administrators may enforce the removal of such material with page protection and blocks, even if they have been editing the article themselves. Editors who re-insert the material may be warned and blocked. See the blocking policy and Wikipedia:Libel.</p>
<p>Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see WP:CSD criterion G10 for more details).</p>
<p>Jimmy Wales has said:</p>
<p>"I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons." [2] He considers "no" information to be better than "speculative" information and reemphasizes the need for sensitivity:</p>
<p>"Real people are involved, and they can be hurt by your words. We are not tabloid journalism, we are an encyclopedia." [3]</p>
<p>[edit] Reliable sources Any assertion in a biography of a living person that might be defamatory if untrue must be sourced. Without reliable third-party sources, a biography will violate No original research and Verifiability, and could lead to libel claims.</p>
<p>Information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers should be handled with caution, and, if derogatory, should not be used at all. Information found in self-published books, newspapers, or websites/blogs should never be used, unless written by the subject (see below).</p>
<p>Not all widely read newspapers and magazines are equally reliable. There are some magazines and newspapers that print gossip much of which is false. While such information may be titillating, that does not mean it has a place here. Before repeating such gossip, ask yourself if the information is presented as being true, if the source is reliable, and if the information, even if true, is relevant to an encyclopaedic article on that subject. When these magazines print information they suspect is untrue, they often include weasel phrases. Look out for these. If the magazine doesn't think the story is true, then why should we?</p>
<p>Biased or malicious content Editors should be on the lookout for biased or malicious content in biographies or biographical information. If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability.</p>
<p>The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material. Be careful not to give a disproportionate amount of space to critics, to avoid the effect of representing a minority view as if it were the majority one. If the criticism represents the views of a tiny minority, it has no place in the article.</p>
<p>Content should be sourced to reliable sources and should be about the subject of the article specifically. Beware of positive or negative claims that rely on association.</p>

<p>WP: BLP:</p>
<p>Biographies of living persons should be sourced with particular care, for legal and ethical reasons. All negative material about living persons must be sourced to a reliable source. Do not wait for another editor to request a source. If you find unsourced or poorly sourced negative material about a living person — whether in an article or on a talk page — remove it immediately!. Do not leave it in the article and ask for a source. Do not move it to the talk page. This applies whether the material is in a biography or any other article.</p>

<p>Once again,</p>
<p>How do you know whom Mr. Jafarzadeh married, when he married, when he divorced and why? Citing an article that in turn cites inter-link.org, a partisan web site that is notorious for pro Iranian government activities and against Iranian opposition members, and is the subject of several litigations for forging documents and propagating false accusations, is not acceptable practice.</p>

<p>David Moss continues to add false / unsourced or poorly sourced material that is defamatory and falls under character assassination. I have recently registered and I am not very familiar with the customary processes in WI. My sole reason was to prevent false slanderous information that is potentially very harmful to the reputation of a very respected opposition member to the Iranian regime. Out of fear of reprisal from Iranian regime I have not given my real name but if it is needed, I will do so. My only request from Davis Moss is to use ONLY material that is reliably sourced. Sources that are very partisan, involved in several law suits against them for fabricating, falsifying and forging information against Iranian opposition members and have conspicuous relations with the Iranian ministry of intelligence must not be used.

<p>David has mentioned that I (Iraneditor) have been banned from editing the article. This is NOT true. I strongly urge him to place more value on being accurate and truthful. I also kindly ask him to think hard before recklessly accusing others of being involved in terrorism. He should know the consequences of such accusations and hopefully be more careful in choosing sources in doing so.Iraneditor 23:27, 11 December 2006 (UTC)Iraneditor</p>
<p>David, You are right that I am not using my real name. I have explained that in a prior talk (see below). You are also right that my main focus right now is to prevent cavalier slander against Jafarzadeh, an important opposition figure to the Iranian regime, who, specially after his revealing the Iran’s secret attempts, has been the target of all sorts of attack from the Iranian regime – if you are not part of this orchestrated effort, then it is a freak coincidence. Nevertheless, I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt. So here is what I suggest:</p>
<p>1- If there is any piece of information in the current version that you think is not accurate, let us know (be very specific) so we can discuss it.</p>
<p>2- There is no attempt to hide the relation that Jafarzadeh has had with NCRI. The current version clearly states that he has been NCRI’s spokesperson for about 12 year. Do you think this is inaccurate?</p>
<p>3- As far as I have seen in the reliable sources, Jafarzadeh’s association with MEK has been through NCRI’s relation with MEK. Do you have other reliable sources that indicate otherwise (again do not bring up Iran-interlink.org enough said about them).</p>
<p>4- What does Jafarzadeh’s private life has to do with this? And again do you have any reliable sources on this? If not- for god’s sake leave this behind.</p>
<p>5- Your language and choice of words in this article is obviously partisan. Do not insult our intelligence by pretending you are this fair unbiased researcher who just happens to be interested in promoting accuracy please.</p>
<p>6- WI: 3RR clearly excludes removing unsourced/poorly sourced defamatory material from an article.</p>

<li>You are the one deleting referenced material. The onus is on you to justify deleting the referenced work of others by proving it to be factually incorrect, not the other way around. The accepted way to deal with disputed content is to add text, not to delete text. Deleting well referenced text because you do not like its content is vandalism</li>
<li>You are correct, you are not trying to hide Jafarzadeh’s association with the NCRI, you are attempting to hide his association with the MEK. I would prefer that all his associations are described, not just the ones you and he find flattering.</li>
<li>Jafarzadeh has a long history of association with the MEK. One of the paragraphs you are trying to suppress cites a Houston Chronicle article where Jafarzadeh claims to be a spokesperson for the MEK. The association is therefore independently documented.</li>
<li>Are you serious? This is a <i>biography</i> for goodness sake! All aspects of the subjects life are open to scrutiny in a comprehensive biography, not just the aspects he or she likes people to know about.</li>
<li>I am Australian with no association whatsoever to Iran. This is quite easy to check, I write extensively on USENET under my real name. I am one of the most open and transparent people on the Internet. You, on the other hand, clearly do have a barrow to push within this article. You also appear to be part of a sockpuppet/meatpuppet network that edits only this article, and does so in suspiciously similar ways. Even the username you have chosen is a dead giveaway to your agenda.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is one of the fundamental planks of Wikipedia policy, along with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. There is no excuse for reverting well referenced content more than 3 times in 24 hours just because you don't personally like the material, or its supporting references. Wikipedia policy is clear on this, you are lucky not to have been banned.</li>
</ol>
<p>You claim your "<i>main focus right now is to prevent cavalier slander against Jafarzadeh, an important opposition figure to the Iranian regime</i>". Editing in this way violates <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in the worst way possible. An article on Wikipedia is expected to be comprehensive. An encyclopedic article is expected to contain all available information about its subject, not just the positive information.

<p>I note the article had nine hard references included before the recent vandal attack. Today it has 3. One of them is out of context, left over from a clumsy deletion. The other two are pointing to self promotional material written by Jafarzadeh himself. The article, in its current form, is nothing but a vanity piece.

<p>Dave,</p>
<p>I am trying so hard in getting you engaged in a dialogue. I will continue to do so. I also urge you to put aside your threatening and putting down tone and start discussing this as a non biased researcher you say you are.</p>
<p>See my points in prior yalk. Let’s discuss your references. Besides, which one of the current information you think is questionable?</p>

<dd>My issue is not with the information you provided, although I would be happier if it was properly referenced. My issue is with the information you deleted. In my opinion it is up to you to justify the deletion, it is not up to me to justify why properly referenced biographical material should stay. Even if you show the material is inaccurate, you should still not delete properly referenced material. The accepted protocol for conflicting claims is to include the balancing material, with references, alongside the disputed material and leave it up to the reader to make up his or her own mind. So, where is the evidence upon which you believe Mr Jafarzadeh is not associated with the MEK? That will do for a starting point. The material you deleted has well referenced information that states he is associated with the MEK. Even if you discount the Iran Interlink material, you still have the Houston Chronicle article where Mr Jafarzadeh himself claimed to be a representative of the MEK. We then have the FBI claiming the NCRI, which Mr Jafarzadeh claims to have represented for many years, is just an alias for the MEK. This view was upheld on appeal in the US court system. It will be interesting to see how you justify deleting Mr Jafarzadeh's association with the MEK in the face of this evidence. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 13:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very good. This is the start of a dialogue. Lets start picking items in your “well referenced version”. Convince me and we will move on.</p>
<p>For example, the following paragraph. What is the source for it?</p>
<p>Jafarzadeh married Robabeh Sadeghi of Babol, Iran, in 1986 and the couple were divorced four years later. Both the marriage and the divorce were allegedly performed under orders from Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK)[6]. Sima-azad 17:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)Sima</p>
<p>In your opinion (as an unbiased researcher), is iran-interlink.org a reliable source that could be used to tarnish some one’s reputation? What are WI guidelines on this?</p>

<p>Notability and saliency Wikipedia's policy on verifiability prohibits the inclusion of material not already published by a reliable source.</p>
<p>Importance of civility Avoid using the word "vanity" in a deletion discussion — such an accusation may be defamatory. Please assume good faith, and don't bite the newcomers.</p>
<p>Conflict of interest in point of view disputes Another case is within disputes relating to non-neutral points of view, where underlying conflicts of interest may aggravate editorial disagreements. In this scenario, it may be easy to make claims about conflict of interest. Don't do it. The existence of conflicts of interest does not mean that assume good faith is forgotten. Quite the opposite. Remember the basic rule: discuss the article, not the editor.</p>
<p>Defending interests In a few cases, outside interests coincide with Wikipedia’s interests. An important example is that unsupported defamatory material appearing in articles may be removed at once. Anyone may do this, and should do this, and this guideline applies widely to any unsourced or poorly sourced potentially libelous postings. In this case it is unproblematic to defend the interest of the person or institution involved. An entire article that presents as an attack piece or hostile journalism can be nominated for speedy deletion and will be removed promptly from the site. Those who post here in this fashion will be subject to administrative sanction. Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons gives details on how biographical articles on living persons should be written.</p>

<p>You keep repeating that “Mr Jafarzadeh has a well documented association with MEK that goes back many years.” As a “good and unbiased researcher” your only reference for this “well documented” (other than iran-interlink.org) "cites a Houston Chronicle article where Jafarzadeh claims to be a spokesperson for the MEK.</p>
<p>Your well” researched and referenced” article had: Jafarzadeh's name first appears in the media in a Houston Chronicle article dated December 24, 1986, where he is described as a spokesman for the MEK. In the article he denied US State Department claims the MEK was a terrorist organization responsible for the assassination of at least six Americans in Iran[7].</p>
<p>First of all you had previously mentioned that "he was describe to be spokesman for the MEK". Now you claim : "Jafarzadeh claims to be a spokesperson for the MEK". As a "good and unbiased researcher" you are certainly aware of the difference.</p>
<p>secondly, you mention "the association is therefore independently documented.” You also chose to completely ignore Iraneditors Dec. 7th d talk in which he/she mentioned about this article: “The paragraph is totally incorrect. MEK was listed in 1997. How could Jafarzadeh deny the US State Dept claims in 1986 (11 years earlier!!)??)” .</p>
<p>Thirdly, I could not find this article in Houston Chronicle archives. furthermore, your sentence is copied "verbatum" from iran-inerlink.org. Have you seen the article yourself? can you please post more of the article in the talk section so we can see what the Houston Chronicle actually had?</p>

<dd>Sima, you have admitted you are new to Wikipedia so I am showing considerable leniency. Wikipedia is copied and mirrored into thousands of places around the world. I wrote the paragraph you refer to myself on 1 May 2006. I did so after conducting a comprehensive search of the media using the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> system. When challenging referenced information the onus is on the person challenging to show the information is incorrect. In other words it is up you to find a copy of the Houston Chronicle from 24 December 1986, locate the article by Rebecca Trounson, titled "<i>Iranian torture victims denounce arms sales</i>" and see if Mr Jafarzadeh put himself forward as a representative of the MEK and made a statement denying the MEK was a terrorist organization responsible for the assassination of at least six Americans in Iran. I have done that hard work, as the superscripted <sup>[7]</sup> within the Wikipedia article indicates. I would expect you to take advantage of my work and check the reference <u>before</u> making allegations of dishonesty. I expect an apology. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 23:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the credibility of iran-interlink.org is questioned, Mr. Moss references his statement on the private life of Jafarzadeh (marriage and divorce) as:</p>
<p>“Jafarzadeh married Robabeh Sadeghi of Babol, Iran, in 1986 and the couple were divorced four years later. Both the marriage and the divorce were allegedly performed under orders from Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK)[6].”</p>
<p>6- ^ van Engelen, Angelique (2005). Exiled Iranian Resistance Could Help Pressure Tehran. Global Politician. Retrieved on 2006-05-01.</p>
<p>While this reference it self has:</p>
<p>“Iran Interlink, an organization that claims to reveal the MeK's true face to the world, runs a website that claims that Jafarzade married his wife, Robabeh Sadeghi of Babol, in 1986 on Massoud Rajavi's orders. Four years later, the couple divorced after Rajavi told all the group's members to do so for ideological reasons.”</p>
<p>This is yet another example of “non-biased “ “neutral”, and “non-partisan” point of view.</p>
<p>Does this style of including damaging material to a person’s reputation justifies taking action as WI suggests : “Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous. If such material is repeatedly inserted or there are other concerns relative to this policy, report it on the living persons biographies noticeboard.”</p>

<p>And as far as Mr. David Moss’ innocent claim of having a neutral point of view is concerned, we may want to look at the history of his edits in the WI article “Iran and weapons of mass destruction” to see his very very strong bias towards removing all material that shows Iran is attempting to develop WMDs and Iran is known to be sponsor of terrorism. In the history of that article he suddenly takes cautious to the other extreme and starts questioning the reliability of what ever reference other editors are adding on the subject.  :</p>
<p>“On the contrary, I believe articles about the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) status of many countries are worthwhile and useful. Its just that Iran doesn't have any nuclear weapons, something everyone in the International community agrees on. If we are going to include speculation that a country <i>might</i> develop nuclear weapons in an article <i>about</i> WMD to avoid bias we would have to list every developed country in the world. Any country <i>might</i> develop nuclear weapons. Do you advocate we do that, or do you single out Iran for special treatment? I believe the expanded section on chemical weapons is relevant because Iran is one of the few countries that has actually suffered chemical attacks. <i>Where</i> the chemicals used were sourced is not particularly relevant to an article on WMD however. WMD is a highly politicised topic so it is very difficult to write objectively about it. The only way to achieve objecdtivity is to stick closely to the topic and record only known facts. That is what I suggest.” (DMoss Revision as of 00:25, 14 April 2006 )</p>
<p>“The title of this article is <i>Iran and weapons of mass destruction</i>. They don't have any. Thats the end of the known facts and where the article should end. Leave the speculation to the popular press.” <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 16:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC) (DMoss Revision as of 00:25, 14 April 2006)</p>
<p>And many many more. See the history.</p>
<p>Remember that Jafarzadeh was the whistle blower on Iran’s WMD’s. So does David Moss have a PV on the subject or not?</p>

<p>Working through the differences, here is my view:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biographical information of the place of his birth together with the references seem both relevant and based on reliable sources. They should stay.</li>
<li>It is not immediately obvious that a press-release intended to advertise a conference/summit is a reliable source. The statement attributed to that press release ("Alireza Jafarzadeh is a well-known and credible authority on terrorism") makes it sound like advertising, not analysis. Mr. Jafarzadeh's credentials as a terrorism-expert need a better source or should be removed.</li>
<li>The ex-wife's name should under no circumstances be included. Don't forget that she has the right to privacy. I'm dubious as to the relevance of the marriage at all, so even if www.globalpolitician.com is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, I think this should be dropped.</li>
<li>The association with the MEK is well-established and must be included: a quick lexis-nexis search of "Jafarzadeh" and "Mujahedeen" produces 70 articles from the mid-80s to the present.</li>
<li>I doubt whether the word whistle-blower is appropriate in this case. A whistle-blower is by definition an insider; Jafarzadeh has been outside of Iran since before the revolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please do not attempt to delete or hide Alireza Jafarzadeh's association with the <a href="../../../m/u/j/Mujahedin-e_Khalq_7ef2.html" title="Mujahedin-e Khalq">Mujahedin-e Khalq</a>. It is not possible to plausibly deny the association, and the association is essential to understanding the subject of the article. I would also advise caution on writing POV statements about Iran Interlink within this article. If an editor believes people will be interested in detailed information about Iran Interlink, it is better to start a separate article about it and place a wikilink in an appropriate place. Editors will then have greater scope to detail the structure and activities of Iran Interlink and avoid cluttering the Alireza Jafarzadeh biography unnecessarily. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 13:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just reverted the article <b>again</b> as User:Sima-azad again attempted to remove the association between the subject and the MEK. I also removed some POV argument from the text. A biography is not the place to argue ideological differences. ie it is a fact Alireza Jafarzadeh first appeared in the media as a spokesman for the MEK, and what he had to say in that first appearence is also relevant. A further statement by the MEK denying terrorism allegations by the State Department is not relevant. Likewise the ideological dispute between the allegedly Iranian controlled <i>Iran Interlink</i> website and the allegedly MEK controlled <i>Iran Focus</i> website does not have a place in this biography. Of course if Iran Focus publishes an article about Alireza Jafarzadeh, facts about Jafarzadeh from that article may be included. One political website casting doubt on the integrity of a rival is probably not relevant in a biography however. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 14:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have not attempted to remove association with MEK out. I have agreed to leaving the association in. However, either all material that are about MEK should be left out (MEK has its own pages) or it should be balanced by opposing materia.</dd>

<dd>The stuff on Iran-interlink.org is not only from Iran Focus (allegedly associated with MEK) but from 5 different sources.

The stuff on the marriage and divorce is defamatory, and poorly sourced. Can't have this one both ways again.

<p>Quoting from the reference:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"2101 CRYSTAL OLAZA ARCADE #164 ARLINGTON, VA 22202 4600This is probably a typo, however, as there IS a 2101 CRYSTAL PLAZA ARCADE in Arlington, VA.Actually, it is the address of a mailbox rental firm; Plaza Mailboxes ( phone: 703-415-0400 ).Searching the address "2101 Crystal Plaza Arcade, Arlington, VA" turns up dozens of different organizations. Similarly for "1101 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. Suite 600". Presumably that also is a mailbox rental facility."</dd>
</dl>
<p>When I researched 1101 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. Suite 600 I found it to be on the 6th floor of the Evening Star Building, and that the Regus Group use the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of that building as part of their "<i>virtual office</i>" product. Mail forwarding is indeed one of the base services offered from that location. Higher level services include telephone answering in the name of the client company, limited use of meeting rooms and even a lobby plaque for the client company for those willing to pay more.</p>

<p>1- If assertions on the activities on MEK is to be included, it is just fair journalism practice to refer to their denial of it. Reference added again. Just notice how many times and how much emphasis on MEK being on the Terrorist List in David Moss version.</p>
<p>2- If Assertion ( which is very defamatory)of Jafarzadeh's marrige and divorce are to be included, from a very questionable source (i.e. iran-interlink.org), then references that discuss.</p>

<dd>1- Please try to understand this is a biography about Alireza Jafarzadeh. It is a place to describe things Alireza Jafarzadeh has said and done, not what the MEK has said and done. The MEK has its own article for that. See my comments above about the ideological dispute between Iran Interlink and Iran Focus, and how I suggest it should be dealt with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2- I personally don't think Jafarzadeh's marriage and divorce are defamatory at all. They are simply events in his life. If you are keen on removing references to marriage and divorce, head over to the article about <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Taylor_fff3.html" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>. The alleged circumstances of the marriage and divorce demonstrate a very strong ideological committment. Understanding the strength of this committment is very important if the reader is to understand Jafarzadeh at all. --<a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoss_e6b9.html" title="User:Dmoss">Dave</a> 15:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1-If this is about Jafarzadeh and not MEK then we MUST leave association with NCRI and MEK in and leave all additional stuff about MEK out. We can’t be selective on this and only use the stuff that supports your POV – you can’t have it both ways.</p>
<p>2- I do believe that your additions on Jafarzadeh's marriage and divorce are defamatory - your assertion is that he was ordered to marry and get divorced. For all we know – we are do sure if has ever been married. Nevertheless, I did not remove it. I just added explanations on the nature of the source you have used (i.e. Iran-interlink.org)</p>

<dd>On the marriage and divorce, I'm inclined against inclusion, but am open to an explanation from David (or anyone else) as to why it is relevant. On the MEK/MKO/NRCI, there has to be enough here that a reader can know what the issues are in so far as they relate to Jafarzadeh. Obviously full exploration should be left to the articles on these organization, but unless you provide the reader with some context, Jafarzadeh's career and significance will be unintelligible. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 00:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>On the issue of marriage, I agree with you but I will not have strong opposition if we find a reliable source (other than iran-interlink.org that in turn is quoted by some one else.) For all we are concerned, this might be bogus and he may have not married ever.</p>
<p>On the Issue of MEK and NCRI, the reference to these being included in the terrorist list is a very complex and controversial one. Either we need to give a balanced version of this or we should refer the reader to their respective pages. (even David has said: (above) “Please try to understand this is a biography about Alireza Jafarzadeh. It is a place to describe things Alireza Jafarzadeh has said and done, not what the MEK has said and done. The MEK has its own article for that.”) We need to provide enough for the reader to explain why Mr. Jafarzadeh is living and working in Washington DC instead of spending time in Guantanamo !) Don’t you think so?</p>

<p>The two issues of 1) jaffarzadeh assosiation with NCRI and MEK and 2)the discussion and inclusion of what the State Department has said and done about these organizations, reasons for it, their legal and political status and what what their response to this is are two different issues. As David has suggested both MEK and NCRI have their own pages and all discussions about them (including their inclusion in the list) should be eliminated from Jafarzadeh's biography.</p>
<p>I also agree with the Bucketsofg that 1) info on marriage and wedding is not relevent and 2) The article is very Chaotic.</p>
<p>Despite what David has declared (to scare off others) I have not been banned from edditing- but I want to give these discussions a chance before I attempt edditing it my way.</p>

<p>It seems Iraneditor and Sima Azad are members of the MEK (an armed group agreed upon by EU and US as a terrorist organization). As spokesman for this organization, Jafarzadeh's biography deserves some mention of this fact rather than the effusive praise which this article seems to lay upon him. The level of compliments given to Jafarzadeh in this article begs the question whether Iraneditor is Jafarzadeh himself. Sima Azad and Iraneditor have combined to present this ridiculously one sided biography by systematically removing all possible negative references. Any accusation leveled by Jafarzadeh is "revealing" something in this article and unverifiable references to testimonies etc. which are not available on internet are made to make him out to be a hero. No mention is made that MEK (and Jaffarzadeh) fought Iran under the command of Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war. etc. etc.</p>
<p><br />
Without accusing people of being members of what and what I kindly request Amirb to suggest what he would like to add to the article. Please keep idealogies out of this and only limit the article to thinks that are based on credible references. Sima-azad 15:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC) sima</p>
<p>Sima how come you removed the request to have the one sidedness of the article checked. That goes along with the initial allegation that you and Iraneditor are censoring this piece to make it as flattering as possible to Jaffarzadeh. Also, are you saying that being a member of NCRI or MKO is an insult (you are being accused?). I would like to revert all the changes that you and your buddy Iraneditor have systematically removed over the last few years and replaced with profuse praise. The tone of the article glorifies the grandeur of this Jaffarzadeh guy and is just too much. Let's start by some reference that the world (including EU and U.S.) consider the MKO a terrorist organization which deserves some mention on Jaffarzadeh's page (since he is a spokesman). Also, how com you judge all that is disagreeable to you as not credible. I don't find vague references to offline court proceedings and newspapers as credible wheras you and your colleague (Iraneditor) have removed many newspaper references that didn't agree with your point of view.</p>
<p>Amir, This article is not about MKO (as the Iran's Ayatollahs call it) or MEK or NCRI. This article is about what Jafarzadeh has said and done. To the degree that it relates to him, you can add related info on Him. 69.183.77.160 Iraneditor</p>
<p>I can't edit anything neither can anyone else because you and Sima have made it a point to remove all edits and make this article the ridiculous piece that it is. Also this is the second time that you two have removed my request for someone (other than the two of you) too look at what a ludicrous piece this is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again Amirb, This article is about who Jafarzadeh is and what he has done. He has been associated with MEK and NCRI. The article makes it very clear. MEK and NCRI are on the terror list of the State Department. The article makes it very clear. MEK and NCRI might be controversial but that is discussion is left up to their respective articles. Is there any thing in Jafarzadeh's bio that you dispute? Is there any thing you wish to add? You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you know any thing about Jafarzadeh, share it with us. The fact that you do not like what he is doing is not enough to question that fact that he is doing it! Sima-azad 13:26, 26 March 2007 (UTC) Sima</dd>
