<p><b>Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends</b> was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of <a href="../../../b/k/n/BKN_cfdf.html" title="BKN">BKN</a>, the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_syndication.html" title="Television syndication">syndicated</a>'s cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of <a href="../../../b/k/n/BKN_cfdf.html" title="BKN">BKN</a>'s drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Roswell_Conspiracies%7E_Aliens%2C_Myths_and_Legends_e51a.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>The truth is <i>not</i> "out there". The truth is among us.</b></p>
<p>On the show, the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roswell_UFO_Incident_5c6c.html" title="Roswell UFO Incident">Roswell UFO Incident</a> which is part of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race.</p>
<p>These known incidents could be found in legend, myth and folklore of beings so strange and alien that they became the fabric of what human beings thought of when they thought of being frightened; vampires, werewolves, banshees, manitou, evil spirits...etc. As human beings progressed into the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Age_39a0.html" title="Industrial Age">Industrial Age</a> the attacks seemed to lessen, but recently they'd begun to go on the rise.</p>
<p>The story begins as Nick Logan, a <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounty_hunter.html" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a>, gets tapped to hunt down what he thinks is a regular bounty, but things don't stay regular for long. When his next bounty turns out to be a very unusual girl, he soon finds himself involved in something both incredibly outrageous but also potentially satisfying. There are aliens among us and he can possibly play a part in helping to protect the earth. His new circumstances could also help him discover the truth behind his biological father's disappearance. Raised and trained by a step-father in the know, Nick is one of a few human beings born with an innate sense of seeing through alien deceptions; most of the aliens can morph into human form at will. This ability gives him a unique advantage. In time he discovers his father and grandfather shared this advantage too.</p>
<p>Nick ends up teaming with Sh'lainn Blaze, a rogue <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banshee.html" title="Banshee">Banshee</a> who wants to be the bridge that helps humans and her species co-exist on the planet together. The Banshee haven't fared well in an age of cold iron and Sh'lainn seems aware that they are plotting some form of 'final' solution. Together they become agents under James Rinaker the current Executive Officer of The Global Alliance, an international agency responsible for keeping the secret from the public and keeping the aliens in check by preventing the more aggressive and volatile ones from hunting human beings.</p>
<p>Without revealing much of what happens in the rest of the story, this series is definately not your standard north american made cartoon. For one thing, the series is only slightly episodic. Not only do later episodes build apon the events of previous episodes, but seemingly minor elements in early episodes are later shown to be fairly important.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Aesiri (aka <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking_gods.html" title="Viking gods">Viking gods</a>)&#160;</dt>
<dd>Norse deities such as Loki and Odin are Aesiri aliens. The Aesiri come from a gravity-heavy planet, and as a result their bodies can withstand much more punishment than any other species. The Aesiri are notoriously sadistic, enjoying causing both physical and psychological torture. While the Aesiri cannot shapeshift, they can project mental holograms into the minds of others, and seemingly take others’ forms. Currently, two Aesiri are being held in the Alliance maximum security containment facility in the Bikini Atoll.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Banshee&#160;</dt>
<dd>A race of teleporters who live in harmony with the earth, but are poisoned by humanity’s growing dependence on electronics. Banshee can predict when someone will die, and can fire energy bursts or fly. They also have lifespans ranging for hundreds or thousands of years, and have been on Earth since they landed in Ireland around 527 BC. This race is in constant warfare with the Vampire Empire.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerberus.html" title="Cerberus">Cerberus</a></dt>
<dd>A three headed parahound that can track a target anywhere in the world. The Minotauri use Cereberus to hunt their prey.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Conduit&#160;</dt>
<dd>The Conduit is a confederation of members from many different alien races. Its main purpose is to safely move aliens throughout the planet and relocate survivors of the inter-species wars. Colonel Walter Logan was an influential force in negotiations with the Conduit, until he apparently set off a bomb at a Conduit safehouse, killing dozens of aliens. The Conduit is considered an enemy of the Global Alliance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Cyclops&#160;</dt>
<dd>Mechanical giants constructed by the Titani, and sent to Earth to protect the planet from the Shadoens. The Cyclops successfully defended the planet in the 15th century BC, but wiped out the Aegean civilization (the most prosperous human culture at the time) in the process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Golem&#160;</dt>
<dd>Creatures of living stone. The Conduit alien resistance is led by a Golem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Lycanthrope (aka <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werewolves.html" title="Werewolves">Werewolves</a>)&#160;</dt>
<dd>Sentient, humanoid wolves that have the biological ability to change their appearance into human form. The Lyncathrope used one of two EMP charges to reverse the magnetic polarity of the Yeti homeworld. They are the slave masters of both the Sasquatch and the Yeti. Lyncathrope have a ten year life span, because this they grow at an incredible accelerate level compared with humans. They are very close to their father or paternal figure treating to look like him whem they are growing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Minotauri (aka <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minotaur.html" title="Minotaur">Minotaur</a>)&#160;</dt>
<dd>Armored warriors with the body of a man and the head of a bull. Apparently, one of these is the Minotaur of Greek legend. The Minotauri lost a war with the Banshee, and as a result, all of the surviving Minotauri were frozen in stasis.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Oni&#160;</dt>
<dd>In their natural form, they are regarded by the Japanese as demons. Oni have biological shapeshifting abilities, and the majority of the Oni race play a large part in Japanese organized crime. Most <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakuza.html" title="Yakuza">Yakuza</a> operations are directed by the Oni.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Sasquatch&#160;</dt>
<dd>A race similar to the Yeti, although they dislike the cold climates the Yeti find comfortable. The Sasquatch were slaves along with the Yeti, but were regarded as inferior by them. During an escape attempt from the Lyncathrope slave ships, almost all of the Sasquatch were massacred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Shadoen&#160;</dt>
<dd>All information available on the species was classified level Omega and unavailable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Titani (aka <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titans.html" title="Titans">Titans</a>)&#160;</dt>
<dd>A peaceful race, which constructed the Cyclops and sent them to protect Earth from the Shadoen Multitude.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Vampire&#160;</dt>
<dd>The Dark Empire of the vampires is broken into families, each acting with a certain level of autonomy. True to legend, <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires.html" title="Vampires">vampires</a> can be killed by direct exposure to sunlight. However, wooden stakes do no more harm to a vampire than to anyone else. Several major vampire families, headed by Hanek, created the multi-national corporation Intracom, which they use to fund their wars against the Banshee and the Alliance. Vampires possess basic shapeshifting technology. Like the Lycanthropes they have the abiliy to change their appearance into human form. A vampire's <i>real</i> form is a large, yellow snake with arms, and a round, human-like, hooded head. Vampires possess a venom that allow them to enslave other races for short periods. If a vampires drains a victim of blood, the two will transform into hybrids</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Vodun (aka <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombies.html" title="Zombies">Zombies</a>)&#160;</dt>
<dd>Slug-like parasites that can only live within the bodies of the dead. Vodun hosts are able to see in the dark and regenerate flesh. Vodun have been on this planet for approximately three hundred years. When the Vodun try to possess a living person, the two minds merge and drive each other insane, rendering the host and Vodun useless. Alliance Detection teams report that the Vodun may be trying to create the technology needed for their race to inhabit living beings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Yeti&#160;</dt>
<dd>Often referred to as an “<a href="../../../a/b/o/Abominable_snowman.html" title="Abominable snowman">abominable snowman</a>”, the Yeti live high in the mountains of the Himalayas. The Lyncathrope destroyed the magnetic polarity of the planet, and took them as slaves. When the Lycanthrope neared Earth, the Yeti overpowered their captors and escaped. Agent Ti-yet is a member of the Yeti race, and his status in the Alliance is necessary due only to the knowledge he has of a Lycanthrope secret weapon.</dd>

<p>Co-created by Kaaren Lee Brown, the show's pilot episode and bible were written by <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Forward_5947.html" title="Bob Forward">Bob Forward</a> and Greg Johnston, Story Editors. Some sources say it was set up to be shown as either 20 one hour long episodes or for each episode to be split in half to equal 40 thirty minute episodes. Aside from a few dual part episodes, however, the storytelling reads better as 40 separate episodes. There was a production budget from Bohbot of U.S.; $500,000 per episode with a blend of cel animation and special effects at Epoch Ink in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica%2C_California_281b.html" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica, California</a>, with the talents of Joe Pearson Tom Tataranowitz, Chuck Patten, Brad Coombs, Young Yoon, Harry Warner Rick Ungar, Brad Rader and Gregg Davidson. Stephanie Graziano produced.</p>
