<hr />
<p>The relationship between us and our creator is dependent on communication. Your relationship with the magnificent or with anyone as a matter of fact, will never grow develop without communication. Muslims non-Muslims do not merely pray to ask for things but rather to give thanks and remember <i><b>Allah</b></i>, the most High. Hence prayer to the believer is remembrance and communication with <i><b>God</b></i>.</p>
<p>Dear readers, our prayers express our dependence on <i><b>Allah</b></i>. Prayers help us remember that we can do nothing of significant without Him. as a matter a fact, the <i><b>Holy Quran</b></i> outline the reality of our nature and our dependence on our creator,” <i>It is</i> <b>Allah</b> <i>who had created you in the state of weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave you weakness and a hoary head; He created what He wills, and He is All-knowing , the All-powerful,</i>”[Quran 30:54]</p>
<p>Weakness in the beginning and weakness in the end: This is the essence of man. He is so weak and helpless at birth that his entire existence depends on his parents and his family. If he were to by abandon in these first crucial years, he could not survive on his own. He needs a gentle and loving hand, not only in his infancy, but in his childhood and even in his teenage years. As this child reaches the age of youth and independence, he began to take control of his own life. He looks at pride in his strong physique, his handsome features and his talented abilities, even scorning his parents, who exhausted their own health to nourish him.</p>
<p>He becomes unjust and vigor in other to dominate others, the thinks he is master, free to acts as he wills, but does these youth, these good looks last forever? In only a few decade he begins to lose his strength, his youth is replaced by old age; Weakness in the beginning; weakness in the end. The message is clear: The Real Master is <i><b>Allah</b></i>, The Creator, the Most High. He alone is the Mighty. He alone is the Great. He alone is never tired, never needs rest, never dependent upon anyone. Allah is the Greatest! Everyday we say a warm thank you for small acts of kindness which others do for us. So how about thanking Allah, who, in His infinite mercy, has provided for every single one of our needs?</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons as to why we pray to <i><b>Allah</b></i>. Our relationship to <i><b>God</b></i> forces us to honestly face our situations and represents the only means of humbling ourselves in front of <i><b>Allah</b></i>, all the time reminding us of our humble beginning and end.</p>
<p>Yet today, many Muslims and non-Muslim on the daily basis fail to communicate with <i><b>God</b></i> and hence recognize their Creator. Times flies and the following verses reflects their life: “ <i>Then there has succeeded them a generation which has given up prayers( i.e. made their prayers to be lost, either by not offering them at all or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in there proper fixed times, etc.) and has followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell, except those who repent and believe in the oneness of Allah and His Messenger (P.B.U.H) and act righteously</i>.” [Quran 19:59-60]</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding those who have abandoned their prayers, the Qurans states: “<i>woe unto those performers of prayers (hypocrite) who are unmindful of their prayers (i.e., delay their prayers from its stipulated time)</i>.” [Quran, 107:4-5]</p>
<p>And:” <i>O you who believe! Let not your properties on your children divert you from the remembrance of <b>Allah</b>. And whosoever does that, and then they are the losers</i>.” [Quran, 63:9]</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) warned his Ummah saying, “What lies between man and disbelief is the abandonment of prayers.” [Muslim, Abu Dawood, Nasa’i]</p>
<p>Dear readers, we are not as strong as our egos tell us. We should ponder over the relationship with our Lord and hasten to thank and fulfill our duty toward our Creator. Communicating and remembrance are the vital element of our daily life. Without reflecting and praying our life loses focus and power. Now can this be a greater lose than a life without purpose?</p>
