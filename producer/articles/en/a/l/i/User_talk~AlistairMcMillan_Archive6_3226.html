While appearing as link spam, the site these link to appears to offer some redeeming value, and is not a corporate/ad-based site. More importantly, it is a resource similar to the GUIdebook, which is linked among all these pages as well. Speaking for myself (yes, just an unregistered IP, I know), I think this was actually a valid contribution to these articles, perhaps one that should stay. Do consider it.</p>

<p>I thought your name sounded familiar and in reviewing things here and there discovered that you and I had gone around this same DRM=&#160;?? Maypole late in June. As we reached a mutually satisfactory compromise then, I'm not at all sure what the problem is this time. I'd appreciate a note explaining, without rancor (just as it was handled last time) what is different now.</p>
<p>On another topic, your edit comment suggests something about if you're going to do this add names to the blocks. If you were referring to me, which seems likely as no one else had edited before your comment (save the archive by Warren), the point is opaque. I had indeed done so, having learned rather long ago how irritating it can be to try to follow who said what in an interleaved comment block. Please provide some enlightenment on this point as well, if possible.</p>
<p>And, finally, did you know a fellow Galwegian (sp?) has become quite the cat's meow on US late night television? I refer to Craig Ferguson and the Late Night show on the CBS network. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 18:15, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can we then settle on the variant you had? It was fine with me, and apparetnly acceptable to you. Perhaps it will be with Warren as well? Something like also termed D Res Mgt by such critics as Stallman? As for the interleaved stuff, I'd relied on the intdenting to keep things straight for those coming by at some later time. Guess you'd not think that enough.</dd>
<dd>Second rate comic?? By the quite general standard here (low to be sure), he's rather better than that. And the burr gives an exotic touch. But our high point of comedy seems to have come in the 30s and 40s with such as W C Fields. The Firesign Theatre and some work by Leaming and Sullivan are about the only thing that comes close to the Goon Show, My Word, No Honestly, or the Pythons in the years since. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 19:41, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, how about this? De-bold the second mention, so as not to unduly stress it, and use something like "...or <b>DRM</b> (also termed <b>Dig Res Mgmnt</b> by a considerable number...".

<dd>Of course they're weasel words. I'm trying to thread a needle here and trying to find something that fits in the joint between objections. I don't think the text is can another be found like this, but whether in the context of this mess, something can be found. Something of a red herring, that. This article should early and prominently note the strength of the opposing views (and attempted poson terminology) so as to pull either effort's biasing teeth. The objectors are not lunatics or out of reason (I certainly don't belog to FSF or agree with RMS on many topics), just as the proponents can make something of an arguement for their position. It's the intensity on both sides which makes it something WP should recognize. pride of place in attempts to distort the debate should not accrue to any side, certainly not with WP support.</dd>
<dd>Just as you did, I'm feeling my gas tank go dry on this one, so if something can't be worked out between us inthe next exchange or two, I'll drop out for the moment. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 20:33, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, it comes down to the stylistic point. I think that position conceeds too much POV to the copyright holders' groups like RIAA or MPAA or the British equivalent whose name excapes, but which has been making threatening noises against users of late. Follwoing the absurdist Big Brother example here of suing 13-year olds for $x00,000, putting their elderly guardian grandmothers in fear of lost homes and heart attacks. I think it would be wrong for WP to concede pride of place to this distortion of the terms of discussion. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 20:58, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;---</p>
<p>Bad phrase on my part. I meant how to handle, in words and article structure, the POV in the favored name by the various sides in this issue. If we could merely substitute the first metasyntactic variable as the word to be used to describe the thing(s) the article is about, I'd have no trouble. But I, and others, have taken the position that it is POV to favor either one of these loaded phrases. To pull their mutual POV fangs, it had developed that the article would deal with both as alternates, early on, favoring neither. Foo is this, and foo is that, and foo has this effect but not that hasn't the loaded quality of either of these phrases. Adn I'd happily settle, but I'm really opposed to the POV inherent in both phrases. But I'm tapped out, so I'll let it ride for the moment. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 21:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AM, I'm back for a bit. (I do not have a Wiki jones, I do not have a Wiki jones, ....) The DM article is one of those which has a long history, some of which is contentious. Among the things which are happening, more slowly than ideally would be the case, is the addition of refs to the DM article, per the new WP style. There was also a recent refactoring into more specific articles, type 1 type 2, etc etc The MDs who do the most authoritative editing from a clinical perspective have only a certain amount of time to put in. We're getting there, if less than snappily. Oh, and do beware the DKA article, it's in need of work rather badly. At least as to biochemical origins... <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 02:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to point out that I have written most of the article <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laihia.html" title="Laihia">Laihia</a> (so as the corresponding Finnish version too). I have made also the map shown on the page.</p>
<p>Further, I happen to know better Laihia than ever you because I'm born there and was living there nine years!</p>
<p>Would you kindly clarify, what did you exactly mean by saying that you have removed vandalism by me, <b>Polarit</b>&#160;?</p>

Thank you Alistair for your reply. Yes the right word should have been <b>stinginess</b> (opposite of generous) I think. Note this, you can see on the history logs, it was not me who added that sentence on January 6 but a <b>Spanish vandalist</b> at IP 85.49.224.46 = 85-49-224-46.mad2.adsl.uni2.es. If you look at my user page, I'm sure no Spaniard. I'm sorry I didn't check the meaning of the word minginess first. Otherwise I would have fixed it. However, because the removed text was anyway added by a vandalist, it may stay off for my sake. --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolarit_dd71.html" title="User:Polarit">Polarit</a> 06:28, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Evangelist is a specific job title at Apple, and it belongs to the people in the group that Guy Kawasaki started. This is within Apple's World Wide Developer Relations, not product marketing. Sal Segohian's business card says "technology manager", not "evangelist".</p>
<p>Alistair,</p>
<p>My source w/r/t Sal, is direct personal knowledge. I have one of his business cards in front of me on my desk, and it says "Product Manager", not "Evangelist". The Evangelists at Apple work for John Geleynse (software) or David Harrington (hardware.) You don't have to take my word for it, you can call Sal and ask him yourself. Apple's main switch board number is +1 408 996-1010. Just ask the operator for Sal Seghoian, and they'll put you through. Also, watch any of the various podcasts he's appeared in; he's always introduced as Apple's product manager (not evangelist) for AppleScript and Automator.</p>

<p>Alistaire,</p>
<p>I am quite new to Wikipedia. The reason why I joined is that I think it's a really cool tool and I wanted to contribute to it. I saw that you undid most of the changes that I had made, noting that it was spaming. At first I didn't really understand why. Then I read through the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> page and now I understand better. I'm sorry, I was a bit overmotivated on creating links (it was partly also because I was frustrated that on google you don't find the right page when you look for Terminal Server). Anyway it won't happen again. Sorry for the inconvenience. Spamming was defenetly not my intention.</p>
<p>Next time you might want to suggest to a user to read the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> page before just deleting his links. Just like me he might not have been aware of what he was doing. And if you would have suggested me to read the page I would most likely have deleted the links myself... By the way I also think that some of the links you deleted were actually quite useful to a reader and definitely not spamming, but I'll leave it up to you if you want to add them back in or not. Sorry again for the inconvinience created. --Lukas Karrer 20:02, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, some parts of the article may be incoherent, but they can be easily fixed: as they are just incomplete thoughts that may have been interrupted and not revamped. As for the NPOV, no there will never be complete neutrality; but I wrote this article being as un-biased as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, though, cannot always be quite as reliable as Mac OS X. &lt;-- Stating that Windows users have more issues with running mutltiple programs smoothely, while Mac OS X usually has simpler ways of avoiding/fixing these problems</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Apple's Mac OS X makes instant messaging even simpler than Windows with iChat. &lt;-- with iChat, one does not need AIM, ICQ, and other messangers running separately: because they can all be put on one buddy list and function in form.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Windows-based computers commonly freeze when heavily multi-tasking &lt;-- It was explained that this was many times because a virus/worm has infected the computer.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Also, Windows will not recognize a device such as a mouse, keyboard, or camera until restarted: showing that the kernel does not check ports regularly. <b>With Mac OS X, the motherboard will recognize a peripheral device once connected: windows machines need to restart and therefore only check for new devices (besides USB) at startup</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When dealing with uptime, Microsoft is a much more secure OS. <b>Average uptime for Windows without instability: 32 days. Mac OS X: 22-24</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unlike Mac OS X, installing a new version of Windows relies on the old version, or will not complete correctly. <b>When upgrading Windows 98 or ME to XP, the old system files are implicated in the New OS, while Mac OS X deletes/overwrites these for new ones</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X has custom pre-made configurations on installation CD's. <b>Configurations on how to install: as shown in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:MacOSX_Installer.gif" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:MacOSX_Installer.gif" rel="nofollow">this image</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the Windows command prompt is more commonly used to see the status of things and the Mac OS X terminal is used for alterations to the system. <b>This may be too incoherent: it is supposed to explain the main differences in common functionality of the Terminal and Command Prompt</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Most sources came from Wikipedia or 1st person experience with the two operating systems.</b></p>

<dd>While the judgement, or rather the practice of valuing verifiability over truth (which is understandably easier to do) is certainly within Wikipedia's rights as an organization, I then find myself questioning the value of such a website. Also, you once again referenced me as a known vandal on the history edit page for Eliezer Alfonzo, which in the context of this argument (given that you seemed willing to accept my statement that the paragraph was true) is irrelevant, and one might say implies a bias that an organization like Wikipedia must remain utterly without, lest it lose any high ground to stand on. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.5.62.241 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.5.62.241.html" title="User talk:24.5.62.241">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.5.62.241_c1d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.5.62.241">contribs</a>) 00:05, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I noticed that you removed some links because you see them as advertising without any interest for the reader. My opinion is, however, that those offer commercial <i>solutions</i> to problems that may have caused the reader to consult the wiki article. Sure, some people might just want to consult this HFS article for getting technical information (but why don't they then just go to Apple's developer page right away?) What can wikipedia offer that Apple's info can't? One of these are _help_ that Apple would not offer, and this should include, IMO, any help, no matter if it's commercial or not.</p>
<p>Is there a general rule from the wikipedia org that suggests or prohibits references to commercial products in general? I see that others have contacted you about similar removals and you did refer to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files</a> in the last case. Yet, I cannot find a reason in there nor in the other "what wikipedia is not" topics that would clearly justify your removal of the links to software that helps in dealing with HFS x-platform-wise.</p>

<p>Hi Alistair, I am familiar with the guidelines. The long standing insolvency strategy links are an invaluable resource and are exactly inline with the wikipedia project; i.e. good relevant content. Please take some time to peruse the history off the categories that I have started and you will quickly see that the relevence and usefulness of this not for profit resource. Brookie has assisted me in the past when commercial spammers have deleted and challenged etc. Best regards - Sean</p>

<p>Hi Alistair, I think we may be throwing the baby out with the bath water here? Yes I am a senior advisor with Myvesta - a not for profit debthelp organisation. There is no conspiracy in that. The reason why the multi-media links should stay is because they are an excellent resource that many people benefit from. This is irrespective of whether I am an advsior with the orgaisation Alistair so I do not see the issue. Other Wikipedians have been perfectly happy with this so why do you feel the need to take exception? Kind regards Sean</p>
<p>Hi Alistair, on balance I can see how me deleting various links over the last year would appear. It is just that the links that I have deleted were to commercial companies some of whom charge hard up debtors thousands of pounds to assist with debt problems. The links that I have deleted have also been of low technical relevence also.</p>
<p>I take your point however as there are indeed some other good non profit based resources out there too. I will hunt arround and enhance the category resources to reflect this accordingly. Thanks for your insight on this matter Alistair! Regards Sean</p>

<p>Not sure how you overwrote it either, it should have said something when you tried to save.</p>
<p>Okay, it just seemed like most articles were referencing that the NYT was the one who broke the news about the book after getting a full copy of it. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/09/29/BL2006092900305.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/09/29/BL2006092900305.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It might be nice to cite the NYT article just because they got the scoop? (and does WP have full access to Woodward's book, or just excerpts, even if he works there?) Anyhow, I'm done with the article, I was just doing janitorial stuff, so I'll leave it in your capable hands. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 02:12, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The merge of VNC Loop into Optical feedback is unacceptable to me, because it is not an optical pheneomenon at all. It is a digital phenonomenon, with no lenses involved. Please revert changes. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> 00:27, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I found the 'VNC Loop' interesting. I took the liberty of copying to a separate article linked under ==See also== in <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_feedback.html" title="Optical feedback">Optical feedback</a>?

<dd>You linked me to <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Abelani</a>'s 'lobby-list', and he posted a denial of trying to influence anyone in either direction. However, I wanted to learn more of what is frowned upon and why, etc., but find it difficult to find topics on the help page. (Why isn't there a search engine for only help-related words? Do you know of a method? Why isn't the whole darn help-section split off into a separate site, and just as easily searchable as Wiki itself? Where should these questions really best be posted?) Well, all this has most probably been discussed before, and I hope I’m not too much of a bother.
