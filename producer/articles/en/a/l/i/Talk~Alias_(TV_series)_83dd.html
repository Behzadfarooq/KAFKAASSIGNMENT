<p>Should there be a spoiler warning for the plot summary? Granted, it doesn't reveal that much, but it does spoil parts of the first episode.

<p>What is the general consensus about this article? Having procreated a separate article for each episode of the television series, each article looks slightly peculiar.<br />
There have been three seasons so far, each season having 22 episodes and each episode has a separate article in Wikipedia, with a premise which gives a resume of the action, as well as the cast of guest actors and their characters, director and writers. Not being seemingly very worldly-wise, am I being paranoic about this? Or am I being a spoilsport if I imagine this being slightly exagerated as a treatment for a television series? Or is it so super a programme that it is absolutely necessary to go into detail with a separated article like that? Am I wrong? <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 01:02, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A common thing newcomers seem to like to do is to "make structure" first, in the hope that it can be filled out later. But really wiki grows by refactoring, not by "fleshing out". So I'd say put everything in the series article, including characters, metaplot, actors, and individual episodes in one big article. If the article grows so much (by dint of there being a comitted userbase who have put in the effort of writing decent content for it) then split it into three our four articles (say one main one, and one per season). Only when <i>that</i> solution has outgrown convenience do we really need one article per episode. It's not that more episodes take up more room (they do, but that's trivial), it's that information chopped up into such little bits is too hard for the reader to find. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 01:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remember asking myself the same question a few months ago. I noticed that the body of the episode articles seemed to be a copyright violation, but I wasn't sure. Can you check into this? If it is, then the articles on individual episodes should probably be deleted, which would solve your problem. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcegikmo1_4637.html" title="User:Acegikmo1">Acegikmo1</a> 01:38, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If they were just the paragraph plot summaries, I'd agree merge, but since they have so many other details that are episode-specific (director, writer, guest cast, notes), it would end up being about 130K, which does qualify for breakouts. Even doing one article per season would be over 40K, still well over the recommended 30K limit. For the record, in general, given a choice I would rather have breakout articles for episodes, rather than for every regular and recurring <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> and object, as I think the episode articles are more encyclopedic, expandable, and comprehensive--they can not only include the things these are starting with, but also ratings, controversies or other notable response to the episode, etc. That being said, <a href="../../../u/n/v/Unveiled_%28Alias_episode%29_0f2f.html" title="Unveiled (Alias episode)">Unveiled (Alias episode)</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almost_30_Years_%28Alias_episode%29_d02b.html" title="Almost 30 Years (Alias episode)">Almost 30 Years (Alias episode)</a> may be copyvios, as they appear to use the same text as several other sites, perhaps from tvtome.com or www.episodelist.com. On the other hand, since tvtome is using it, it may be from a press release, which, by definition, doesn't seem like it could be protected by copyright. If they are copyvios, it gets worse, because <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_be_Told_%28Alias_episode%29_bcd3.html" title="Truth be Told (Alias episode)">Truth be Told (Alias episode)</a> does NOT appear to be a copyvio, so each one would have to be evaluated separately.

<dd>I think we should merge all the episodes for Season 4 into a single article with their plots and basic crew. It just seems ridiculous to devote an entire page to small paragraph. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 05:21, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I concur, since there doesn't seem to be much work being done on expanding them into full articles. I don't think the episodes should be listed as tv stubs either since IIRC that category is reserved for TV series articles. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:29, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Done. I merged all of Season 4 into the article <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alias_episodes_%28Season_4%29_9a3c.html" title="Alias episodes (Season 4)">Alias episodes (Season 4)</a>. I'm probably going to do this to Seasons 1-3 too if no one objects. The original articles have been made into redirects, which I'll probably throw up on RFD sometime in the near future <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 21:29, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oops, I never noticed this talk page before. I already did these merges for you — I hope no one objects. I thought having an article per episode was pretty ludicrous, especially considering the amount of redundant contextual information in each one.

<p>The episode information appears rather brief, like teasers in a TV Guide. I was wondering if it would be worthwhile fleshing out the episode descriptions to include more reminders of what happened in the episode? This would, of course, introduce spoilers but they seem to already be listed in the Character descriptions. Personally, I'm currently watching Series 3 so would be willing to update description as I watch, but I didn't want to change the content without discussing with you folks, since you have created the pages. to date. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Rotenstein_2f14.html" title="User:John Rotenstein">John Rotenstein</a> 10:11, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well they're really only big during Season 3 and even then, not really. I don't know if it really deserves its own page. I'd rather see a page similar in style to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Lost_234d.html" title="Characters of Lost">Characters of Lost</a> which gives basic info for each faction and etc instead of their own page. Perhaps a "Characters of Alias" or "Characters and organizations from Alias" is needed with links to the already established main characters and factions of the show.

<p>I reverted an edit by Postdif that removed Alias from categories involving networks that air the show but did not produce it. I disagree with Postdif's rationale that only production networks should be listed, as there are many examples besides Alias of shows being categorized by broadcast networks (examples include <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Danger_Man_1a0f.html" title="Danger Man">Danger Man</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Avengers_81f8.html" title="The Avengers">The Avengers</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prisoner_016e.html" title="The Prisoner">The Prisoner</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saint_%28TV_series%29_d841.html" title="The Saint (TV series)">The Saint (TV series)</a></i> and others. To my knowledge there is no policy restricting these network categories and to delete them from this article would require corrections to many others. If someone can identify a Wikipedia policy that supports the removal of the categories, then please revert my revert. Otherwise I think we should have a few votes for or against before this change is made.

<dd>Honestly, I agree with Postdlf here. It's logical to me that only ABC should really be used as a category because it is produced for ABC. The problem with your side of the argument here is that if you're going to list CTV and Seven, you should also categorize all the others and there are literally dozens of networks to list. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 05:25, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's fair. I'm just trying to gauge whether or not there is an actual Wikipolicy about this, because if it is considered incorrect to do this, then there are a number of other articles that need to be corrected -- or else someone could just plop the two categories back here again later on. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:34, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to better explain my rationale for removing the May 2006 date from the infobox: Alias is <i>scheduled</i> to end in May 2006, however until May 2006 arrives it's premature to list it as a certainty. For all we know other factors may come into play. There could be a successful "save our show" effort, a cable network could pick it up, its ratings could skyrocket and ABC might change its mind ... or the ratings could bottom out and ABC might decide to pull the show sooner. Or ABC could decide to combine a few episodes and the show might air its last hour in April. It's fine to say ABC has scheduled the show to end in May, but to list it as if it has already happened is a bit too crystal ball. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:37, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't have time to rewatch the Season 5 eps and figure out the correct numbers, but the summary states that Sydney takes 18 months of maternity leave, and meets up with Rene Rienne "2 years later".

It's a downloadable game and is playable <i>offline</i>. No online gameplay is supported. It also said that it "<i>was</i>" available through ABC's site. I changed "<i>was</i>" to "<i>is</i>" because the game <b>is still</b> available through the official <i>Alias</i> ABC website). Also, I added the entire second paragraph of the "Links to <i>Lost</i>" division. If I made any grammatical errors, please do help me out and edit it.

<p>I read this article as a familiar to the show but unfamiliar to the article. And I think there are a couple things that deserve to be reworked:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the introduction text regarding the 5th season rescheduled should not be there&#160;! It is so specific&#160;!!! Why not having it in the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alias_%28TV_Series%29_6aae.html#Timeframes" title="Alias (TV Series)">Timeframes</a> sub-division&#160;?</li>

<p>As the above-recommended clean-up proceeds, I'd also like to suggest an "unresolved storylines" section be added, since there are so many plot threads that were left hanging by the finale (stuff like who the Cardinal was, why Sydney was able to break a so-called unbreakable prophecy, etc.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:58, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>maybe we should start listing the unresolved story lines then. I don't think the Cardinal was really suppose to be a big issue anyway as i think it was simply used to explain tom's distraught/depressed state.
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your comments. I disagree regarding the Cardinal. Although it was clearly a "make work" project for Thomas Grace and Rachel Nichols once it was realized the show was ending and the two wouldn't be replacing Vaughn and Sydney, there was still enough build up that I was very disappointed we did not get a resolution. As I mentioned in another forum, it's one thing for a 3-4 year old plot thread to be forgotten, but to skip over something that was introduced only 4-5 episodes ago is kinda sloppy, IMO. That said, I have never seen so many commercial breaks as I saw in the finale episode ... I bet there was one every 4 minutes or so. So to be fair to Abrams it's very possible such a resolution existed but was cut for time. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess we will have to wait for the season 5 dvd release to find out. It also important to note that up until i think the middle of the season there were plans for season 6... and as far as Abrams goes, even though he is the creator and exec producer I have doubts on just how much input he had on the finales. oh and sorry about the no signature. --Disembarkedone 15:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I read an interview with one of the cast members ... I think Greg Grunberg or possibly Mia Maestro ... that the cast and crew started season 5 assuming it was going to be the last. But the characters of Thomas and Rachel had "spin off" or "continuation" written all over them, so it's possible Abrams didn't expect things to wrap up so quickly. On top of that, as noted, ABC actually cut the final series down by about 5 episodes. That had to hurt the storytelling. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reportedly (according to Garner and others) everyone expected the 5th season to be the last one, although I don't think Abrams expected the season to be shortened by some 5 episodes which is IMO why a number of threads were left unresolved -- such as Thomas Grace and the Cardinal. What I had heard quite a few times was that the character of Rachel Gibson was introduced as an heir apparent for Sydney since there was some question as to whether Garner would continue with the show full-time after she gave birth. Similarly, Thomas Grace was introduced as a replacement for Michael Vaughn. Whether this was actually the case or not, obviously it became moot when the series was officially cancelled which is probably why Rachel (not so much Grace) really faded into the background at midseason. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:45, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>What part of that section is considered original research since it was tagged? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:19, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only real link to Lost is the use of Driveshaft music in one episode. That one or more actors who appeared in Alias also appear on Lost is not a "link." All it means is that the show's creator has worked with the actor before and, presumably, thought enough of them to cast the actor again. It's not at all unusual. Greg Grunberg was on Felicity too, because he's been friends with Abrams for decades. Do we need a "Links to Felicity" section too? The article itself already flatly states that most of the speculation about the connections is just that, speculation. The article is already bloated with actual factual information. This section needs to go. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i agree, it should go.. the only reason they try and link it to lost is cuz J.J. Abrams is a co-creator and that's wrong.. Merlin5793 00:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm unclear as to what this box is informing us of. What is its purpose? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:32, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's noting that in 2003 Alias followed the Super Bowl, and giving the shows that followed the previous and next Super Bowls.</p>
<p>Is that really interesting? Not to me, but maybe to somebody.</p>

<p>The article for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._97a9.html" title="The Man from U.N.C.L.E.">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></i> contained a statement (authored by me) that the two-dozen original novels based upon that series were the most ever published based on an American-produced TV series except for Star Trek. It appears <i>Alias</i> might now hold the record with the 25 novels listed. Does anyone know if any US-produced series (so Doctor Who doesn't count) other than Star Trek that has had more original novels? If not, this is a superlative that's worth noting. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:24, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm unclear as to why this sections exists. It does not appear to provide information about the show and other similar sections and articles have been removed. Why keep it? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
