<p>I spent 10 minutes searching, and there is no "Professional Performance Arts School" listed anywhere, except in hundreds of Alicia Keys biographies, all almost word-for-word the same. I don't know what else is made up about this pop singer.</p>
<p>Let's start over with the FACTS we know. Anything that just appears in a PR release, cite as "According to XYZ Record Company, she attended Columbia University ..."</p>
<p>The "Fame" school isn't called "Professional Performance Arts School", by the way, although it is indeed a <i>professional performing arts school</i>.</p>

<li>I wonder if I should call up the principal of the school and ask who was valedictorian in 1996? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a>
<ul>
<li>Somehow I doubt she attended Columbia U. at the age of sixteen. It takes a <i>lot</i> of work to prematurely graduate grades, especially two years' worth. I smell crap. -- <a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatasaur_0832.html" title="User:Goatasaur">goatasaur</a></li>

<dd>Who says she skipped two years? Many people who don't skip grades start college a few months before they turn eighteen, so if she started a few months before turning seventeen (her birthday is in January) she would only have skipped one year.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>

</dl>
<p>Yeah, the bio I found (instead of the CNN puff piece) makes it sound more like she <i>signed with Columbia Records</i> than <i>attended Columbia University</i> -- not that I'm saying she didn't, of course. I know people at LaGuardia High School -- if that's the "Fame" school her publicity keeps harping on -- and I guess I'll have to ask them if Alicia Keys ever attended or spoke there. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a></p>

<hr />
<p>alicia keys also sites a teacher at the Professional Performance Arts School in Manhattan who, while she was majoring in Choir, gave her valuable instruction on her voice. "This teacher spent so much time with me, she became the closest thing to vocal training I received," alicia keys recalls.</p>
<p>I found hundreds of articles all misspelling "cites" as "sites", as above. So I am, if not suspicious, at least incredulous. --Ed</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. That would be a well-known fact if it were true, I think (would have been drilled into every American's skull during the advertising blitzkrieg about her actually writing songs and playing on her own albums, as if that wasn't standard for the last thirty years or so). Her biography (at aliciakeys.net) says (or implies) that it is so, but I still have grave doubts. It also says she is influenced by Wu-Tang Clan, which is utterly incomprehensible to me (and one of my best friend's friend loves Keys, so I've heard her whole album). May as well say she's influenced by Pat Boone or Ali Farka Toure, so I certainly won't accept that as a source. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 04:34 Apr 3, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Geez, are we bitter much? This article seems unreasonably harsh. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>Yeah, I'm having second thoughts now. I finally found a website that got the high school's name right:</p>
<p>"By age nine, Alicia could paly sonatas by Mozart and Chopin. At 12, she got into New York City's High School for the performing Arts (which Fame made famous) she graduated as valedictorian in 1996. "</p>
<p>...although the spelling and capitalization is a little off. Maybe I'm placing too much emphasis on credentials, anyway. --Ed</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds better, but I think the&#160;:highly derivative" in the article still should go. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a>
<dl>
<dd>I just made a few changes -- does it seem better? (<i>highly derivative</i> is still there, though I could accept the removal of <i>highly</i> without much problem). It's hard to write about something so inherently POV as musical influences in a NPOV way, but there is a large faction of critics and listeners who think Keys and other label-hyped "original" artists don't do anything D'Angelo didn't do ten times better five years before. Feel free to revise as needed. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a>

<p>Sorry if I ask... I'm an Italian Alicia's fan. Does anybody know WHY she choose KEYS as artistic name? Please answer.... SMKL</p>
<p>Alicia has taken the last name: "Keys", because she thought it would be cool since she was able to play the piano. And still has since she was just a little girl! Wonderful, beautiful, sexy soul star that will always be top-charted! -Rodney</p>
<p>I read somewhere that had another middle name, "Joseph". Weird, I know. Can anyone else verify this info? <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamYum_ea70.html" title="User:TamYum">TamYum</a> 03:51, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Joseph? I see a <i>J</i> have ben added in the article. So, the info has been verified?</p>
<p>She attended P.S. 116 in Manhattan (K-6) and DID NOT grow up "in poverty."</p>

<p>UMMMM, QzDaddy, if her mother is white and her father is Jamaican, that doesn't make her African American because her black heritage isn't from America. And the term Mulatto is still in use because if someone, like me, is half black and half white, what are we if we aren't Mulatto? Plus census still refers to us as Mulattoes.</p>

<p>Unrelated, I know, but I'm not familiar with WP editing yet. I just happened to be here and noticed that the article claims Keys is a soon-to-be actress (implying she has never acted before), but further down in the page states that she has acted on The Cosby Show in 1985. Thus I removed the phrase "is a soon-to-be actress" from the section on what she is up to now.</p>

<dd>I'm going to go on a limb and guess that since the guest episode, she hasn't aced until recently, she doesn't consider herself a proven actress. In the cobsy episode, she had no speaking lines and basically had to be a cute girl. So, is she a veteran for it?</dd>

<p>Alicia Keys's birthday year is actually 1980. Record companies tend to thwart the minds of the consumer to make them think artists are younger than they really are. They use that to try and boost record sales and make the artist more appealing to a certain age group.</p>

<p>First off, on the Performance Arts high School: here is a link <a href="http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_school/ny/1916/" class="external free" title="http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_school/ny/1916/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_school/ny/1916/</a></p>
<p>Second, Alicia Keys is an contralto. This is evident by her deep speaking voice.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Alicia Keys signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and his So So Def label, then distributed to Columbia. However the deal didn't work out, but not before Clive Davis took notice and quickly signed her to Arista Records. Clive has a reputation for allowing artists to mature and is not strictly looking for dollar signs. BMG (Arista's parent had a rule that executives had to retire at 60). As part of Clive's severance package, he got $800 million and his own indpendent label (J), which is distributed by BMG. He was allowed to take some of the Arista roster with him including Deborah Cox and Alica Keys. This was the reason for some of the brief fallout between Davis and Whitney Houston, herself a former protegé)</p>
<p>Fourthly, its a misnomer she went to Columbia. She took classes, but under the school's gifted high school program (I took college classes myself while in high school). So she's an alumni, but not as its being reported.</p>
<p>Fifthly, she mentions the choir director spending a lot of time with her so it was like personal instruction. But her "major" was always piano performance, never voice. It just happened that because she was in choir and had this teacher's assistance that her voice would be "discovered". She mentioned this many times in early BET appearances.</p>
<p>Sixthly, it is 1981 (she was 21 when Fallin came out and she was 2001's) Which was 4 years ago. Right now alicia is 25 years old about to be 26 on january 25</p>

<p>What does her "deep speaking voice' have to do with her singing voice, Mariah Carey has a deep speaking voice but a high singing voice, Christina Aguilera has a deep singing voice and a high speakng voice, that is not proof that she is a contralto like Toni Braxton. 67.175.23.73 11:03, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because there couldn't be any more ambiguity surrounding Keys and the hype/fabrications she and her PR and label people have desseminated, the article currently states she wrote her first song "Butterflyz" at the age of 14; a google search comes up with a plethora of websites that say the same. However, below are two contradicting quotes from Keys, which in turn contradict what's currently written in the article and on those sites:</p>
<p>"I wrote my first song when I was <b>11</b>. And it was actually inspired by the movie Philadelphia. It was about a year after my grandfather had passed away and I was very close to him..." <a href="http://www.ascap.com/playback/2005/summer/features/keys.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ascap.com/playback/2005/summer/features/keys.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>In response to the question "What was the first song you ever wrote?":</p>
<p>"I was <b>14</b> and had just seen the movie Philadelphia. It was such a sad movie, and it was about a year after my grandfather passed and I wasn't really able to grieve. So I saw that movie, came home to my little player piano, sat down and took that whole night writing. The song was called "I'm All Alone." Through it, I was able to finally grieve for my grandfather." <a href="http://www.rd.com/content/openContent.do?contentId=19165&amp;pageIndex=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rd.com/content/openContent.do?contentId=19165&amp;pageIndex=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>For what it's worth, Philadelphia came out in 1993, which would have made Keys 13 at the time, so the ASCAP statement must be false. So which was the first song she wrote and when did she write it? I'll bow out and let someone else make the edit due to my bias. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User%7EHesperides_1ba1.html" title="User:Hesperides"><font color="#000077">Hesper</font><font color="#666699">ides</font></a> 20:36, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
