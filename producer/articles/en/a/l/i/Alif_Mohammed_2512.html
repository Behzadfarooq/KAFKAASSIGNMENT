<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>.

<p>Mohammed denied being a member of the Taliban. He denied having any contact with Wahid. He acknowledged that he had fought against the Russians during the communist regime. During that time he fought under a commander named Sahar Juhn.</p>
<p>He said that Wahid had killed his nephew and his pregnant wife.</p>
<p>He said that Wahid was not a local. He said he had been a powerful commander during the Communist regime. He said Wahid forced the local people to build his “castle”. But, when the Taliban were in power he was unimportant. He was afraid of the Taliban and had to hide out from them.</p>
<p>He denied owning a phone. He pointed out that he was illiterate.</p>
<p>He denied owning a rifle, or having any weapons or military material with him when he was captured. When he was captured he had a small pair of scissors, tobacco, matches and some hashish. He said that the American soldiers had found an AK-47 in the desert, and asked him if it were his. But he had denied it.</p>
<p>The local tribal leader <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullah.html" title="Mullah">Mullah</a> Abdul Lula had agreed that everyone should surrender their weapons, and he had surrendered his then. The Americans who collected the weapons had returned an old flintlock he had.</p>
<p>He acknowledged having a green jacket. He denied it was a military jacket. He said he bought it at the bazaar, that it was made locally, out of cashmere.</p>
<p>Like every other detainee from Lejay Mohammed said that the villagers had welcomed the Americans overthrowing the Taliban, and bringing stability toAfghanistan, and making efforts to rebuild Afghanistan. He said that every other time the Americans had come to their village the villagers had hosted a feast for them because they appreciated their efforts.</p>
<p>He said that he personally liked Americans because they believed in God, unlike the Russians.</p>

<p>Mohammed called one of his neighbors, <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushky_Yar_0e52.html" title="Kushky Yar">Kushky Yar</a>, to testify on his behalf.</p>
<p>Yar testified that Mohammed liked the American, did not own a gun, and that he was not a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Bagi_182a.html" title="Abdul Bagi">Abdul Bagi</a> requested as witnesses at his CSRT three fellow Lejay villagers who were detained at Guantanamo.<sup id="_ref-CsrtBagi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtBagi" title="">[5]</a></sup> One of them was Mohammed. Bagi asked his neighbors to testify that he was not a member of the Taliban; that he didn't own a weapon; that he was just a farmer, who was the sole support for his seven younger orphaned siblings.</p>
<p>After Bagi's questions Mohammed was asked how he came to be captured. Mohammed said he had been working late, in his fields, and got so tired he slept rough, without going home. He said he had woken up, and was washing himself, when an American soldier appeared, and told him to stick his hands up. However according to other accounts, the ambush occurred at around 10am.</p>
<p>During Bagi's ARB hearing it turned out that calling Mohammed as a witness was counted as a factor confirming that Bagi was involved in the ambush, because intelligence had already decided that Mohammed was one of the leaders of the ambush.<sup id="_ref-ArbBagi_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbBagi" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After this allegation was read to Bagi he disputed the idea tha anyone would trust Mohammed with a position of trust, because he was a drug addict, who couldn't feed his own children, and had to rely on the charity of his neighbors.</p>

I have great respect for [Americans]. They’re always welcome. We are happy for them that they came to Afghanistan. There is less violence. I will never fight against them. I have never fought in the past. I always support them. If anyone proves that I have worked...with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, you can cut my throat right here. Otherwise, let me go. I have 10 kids at home that are waiting for me. God is watching upon you. I am very happy for this tribunal. This tribunal will bring out the facts. I have never fought and I will never fight you guys…. How can I fight? I am just a tinsmith…. When you release me, I hope you give me some money. Americans are rich. They have more money. I have 10 people.</i></dd>
