	    <p>"The idea for such a cross-over is often thought to have originated from a supposed Xenomorph skull seen as a Predator's trophy in Predator 2, but Dark Horse Comics published their first Alien vs. Predator story in November 1989, a year before the November 1990 release of Predator 2."</p>
<p>Surely the making of Predator 2 took place before November 1989, if it was released in 1990.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, doesn't a comic take time to think up and draw, too? It's impossible to say when the idea of AvP was first <i>imagined</i> (unless the guy who thought of it tells us himself), so maybe identifying the first <i>released</i> product is the next best thing...

<p>Alien is designed by H.R.Giger (1979), Giger is one of the most famous artist who has a deep dark mind with very unusual skills of impressing his stylish artwork. Giger has very detailed documentation and sketches about Alien, subjecting from the birth to their morphing, including every little details about their brain, their bones, their living conditions, their unique senses and reactions... Predator fans should have been very jealous about Aliens' being the first and most horrible creature of its kind, so that they started a war with Aliens (and Alien fans) by inserting an Alien skull(?) into their skull collections in the Predator 2 movie; Even if that is not enough to throw mud at Aliens, they started a story claiming that Predators were collecting Aliens Eggs, carrying the eggs to remote planets waiting for the hunt pleasure to begin on their good.</p>
<p>Predator is a human-like good designed hunter(!) It has the advantage of having all the intellectual weapons it could carry, invisibility, many visioning opportunities. Simply designed to hunt any kind of prey.</p>
<p>Personal Comments: Aliens are very original creatures with unique abilities which are not amplified so much; Predators are war-machine-like snipers whom we hated enough from FPS games with the excuse of spoiling the games and making them boring.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Anon. Additional comment; Don't make the assumption that aliens are somehow a more developed concept than the predator, maybe a tad more original, but still firmly inspired by existing things. The behaviour of the alien is heavily based on wasp/other insect life cycles. Their imagary is a combination of Giger's artwork but also additions made by directors, scriptwriters, and even costume designers (an example would be the appendages on the Alien's back, which were put there so the actor could balance himself better...) Giger also did not design the creature's behaviours, which have been greatly expanded since his original involvement. His original designs started off as being very different (and more overtly sexual) than the Alien you see in the film.</p>
<p>To dismiss the Predator as an inferior creation is also rather naieve. The Predator is based off the concept of our human hunting behaviour taken to the very extreme - to the point where there is almost nothing else. The Predator too has been expanded by various projects that came after the initial film - the Yautja in Predator 2 displays more 'laws of the hunt' style behaviour, and the clues to the clan structure and extent of the sport are shown. The comics, books, and games involving the Predators kept to the ideas set out, so the race is just as developed, and there are no 'rivalries' between fans of the franchises, most love both... if they prefer one franchise over the other then they simply see them as entirely seperate works.</p>

You know, fictional science fiction is pretty redundant. There's a reason I took it out before.</p>
<p>I worked on a brief outline of a computer game aimed at the ST/Amiga market at the end of 89/beginning 90 which was based on the premise of Alien v Predator. It came to nothing however and can't remember who requested the design and if other developers were asked for submissions.</p>
