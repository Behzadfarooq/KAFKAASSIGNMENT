<p>How can ther be three and a haf that is funy maybe I shud put in joke page and fix this page to be corect</p>
<p>Maybe someone should mention: In original D&amp;D only the lawful vs chaotic axis was used. The good vs evil axis was added in an optional book (Eldritch Wizardry? an issue of Dragon magazine). This was incorporated fully into the advanced version of the game, but abandoned for the non-advanced version from the 1981 boxed set onwards.</p>
<p>The alignment system for Palladium has three overall classifications, Good, Selfish, and Evil, with each subdivided into two or three types.</p>
<p>At the moment, I don't have my original D&amp;D stuff with me, or any Palladium games.</p>
<p>Are there any other games that use "Alignment" that are different from D&amp;D?</p>
<p>And while we're at it, we should mention that non-D&amp;D games in general (E.g. GURPS, White Wolf's games, Champions, etc.) are unlikely to use alignment.</p>
<p>Chaotic neutral was also the alignment of madmen, according to my old AD&amp;D manual. Perhaps someone better than I at the typed word should note that. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Or just someone who is unpredictable, but not necessarily insane. Just self-serving...or out after cash, not caring for good nor evil but chaotically attacking people along a road, f.eg? I can't see, however, that on a "Good, Selfish, Evil"-division that SELFISH differs from EVIL. Same shit in my book, even 'tho Neutral's CAN be "Selfish"...they're not as solely selfish as EVIL one's are, if there's even a doubt. Neutral's can also be SELFLESS, yet we don't call them THAT, now do we? As if there's a "half-way's selfless" or "half-way's selfish"-bar&#160;;)--<a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleMaster_fbc4.html" title="User:OleMaster">OleMurder</a> 22:55, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that the descriptions for each alignment seemed to alternate between male and female pronouns, a confusing and clumsy system. As no female characters are mentioned explicitly, I have changed all the female pronouns to male ones. However, it still sounds somewhat old-fashioned ‚Äì if anyone wishes to reword it so tat it uses "they" or somesuch, please feel free to do so. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWereon_8361.html" title="User:Wereon">Wereon</a> 16:18, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's funny you did that, because Dungeons and Dragons has evolved exactly the opposite. In 2nd edition they had a pronoun disclaimer at the begining of the book, basically saying, <i>"We use him and his throughout the book, just because it's awkward to constantly use their or his/her. Hope no one gets offended."</i> Then in 3rd edition they had a new disclaimer that basically said, <i>"We were idiots the last time, it's ridiculous to exclusively use male pronouns and pretend that they're gender-neutral. We'll just switch back and forth this time."</i> - <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifefeed_b291.html" title="User:Lifefeed">Lifefeed</a> 15:43, Nov 5, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What's confusing or clumsy about it? The example for each alignment is a different person, so it can be argued that using different pronouns improves understanding. Certainly "they" is the worst alternative; however IMO references to people, be they concrete examples or not, is one of the few places where using both pronouns works. I've changed them back. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_5e64.html" title="User:Gracefool">¬∑¬∑gracefool</a> |<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracefool_8942.html" title="User talk:Gracefool">‚ò∫</a> 10:05, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, Wikipedia is far from the WWIV boards and high school hallways where that sort of pretentiousness went on. Nobody is out to prove anything against the bigger companies or chastise us that we're "roll playing" and not "role playing." I'm just glad I got to see the backlash happen. Hell, I even got to accept the Origins Game of the Year Award for <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hackmaster.html" title="Hackmaster">Hackmaster</a> back in 2002 for Kenzer Co. Go figure.</dd>
<dd>As for the article, it could be worth a mention, provided we rewrite it. "Some" as opposed to "many" for starters, along with the fact that not too many make these arguments anymore. A lot of it was just people trying to look cool and impress each other. If I had to write it, I'd say a lot of it was part of the trend towards more free-form story based games made by (then) smaller companies, which by now has seriously receded. I haven't seen anyone make these arguments (and be taken seriously) in years. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Soth_2546.html" title="User:Paul Soth">Paul Soth</a> 01:57, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a paragraph to the Lawful Good definition to stress that blind obedience to the law may fall outside the scope of the definition. In my experience as player and DM, and a regular reader of Internet resources committed to D&amp;D, I've seen that mistake too often.</p>
<p>To reiterate the example I put in the main article: it is perfectly permissible to break unjust laws, for example by fighting a usurper on behalf of the rightful king, without breaking the strictures of Lawful Good. In fact, in an Evil kingdom, it is possible to imagine the resistance being led by Paladins.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding of Lawful Good appears to be so common that I think the disclaimer belongs in the definition, even if the SRD doesn't state it explicitly.</p>

<p>I don't think this is right that neutral people are committed by personal relationships in the AD&amp;D game. I think this is the definition of Chaotic. Lawful characters tend to put their code ahead of personal relationships.</p>

<p>Gracefool, I respect much of your good work here, and have accepted your other revert of one of my contributions. The claim that 'Lawful-Evil are devoted to selfishness' however, I can't let stand. A Lawful-Evil creature is no more selfish than a neutral animal.

<p>That is interesting, and what a strange thing to say! Objectivism is about disbanding the lion's share of the federal government. Hard drugs, prostitution and all other victimless activity <b>legalized</b>. FCC, FAA, FTC, DEA, FDA, HUD, etc. <b>dismantled</b>. Objectivism is about erasing laws, not creating them. Not very LN, if you ask me. Rearden Metal 01:57, 10 January 2006 (UTC) (Chaotic Neutral)</p>

<dd>If a creature has an alignment (Neutral = no alignment), that means it has some dedication to morals (whether good or not). Traditionally, evil has been called selfish in D&amp;D, while good means putting others first sometimes. In the Player's Handbook, all the evil alignments are described as being motivated (solely) by personal gain/advancement etc. That is another way of saying "selfish" - at least, according to the dictionary. If you have a different concept of selfishness, that's fine, but that is the way the word is most commonly used. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_5e64.html" title="User:Gracefool">¬∑¬∑gracefool</a> |<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracefool_8942.html" title="User talk:Gracefool">‚ò∫</a> 00:54, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The primary problem with comparing D&amp;D alignments to Objectivism comes in that the Alignment system uses the Standard English definition of selfish, with its usual connotations, while Objectivism uses a definition of selfish that has very little to do with its usual meaning. Selfish in the context of an evil character means someone who pursues self-interest and self-gratification without regard to the rights of others. Selfish in the context of Objectivism means someone who pursues self-interest and self-gratification while being careful to respect the rights of others to do the same, something, in my opinion, much closer to chaotic neutral or to simple neutrality. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReveilled_3c6d.html" title="User:Reveilled">Reveilled</a> 13:54, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Polls are evil and I am just going to be bold and remove them, but I'll add my thoughts here. The fictional examples constitute original research and are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Alignments are a roleplaying game mechanic which does not apply all that well to real life. I took three different "alignment tests", one said that I was "Lawful Good", another said that I was "Neutral Good". The Wizards alignment test said I was "Lawful Neutral" (which is the one I trust most), so it is hardly a precise science but rather one person's opinion. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> is listed as "Neutral Evil", yet I could argue that his extremely strict control over his <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Eater_263c.html" title="Death Eater">Death Eater</a> supporters and meticulous and usually quite patient planning makes him "Lawful Evil". There is no real objective standard we can apply to characters that way. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Giving examples will be a matter of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. For example, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> is not "Chaotic Good", though most would agree that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Punisher_158f.html" title="The Punisher">The Punisher</a> is. But even listing The Punisher as Chaotic Good is unofficial and original research. One can perhaps say that there are some fictional characters who behave in the manner of Chaotic Good, etc., but unless they are AD&amp;D you can't say they "are" of this or that alignment. Alexander 007 13:28, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems to me that this would be an easy fix. Instead of saying that these characters -are- of one of the alignments without direct source proof, stick with the initial point in describing them as appropriate -examples- of a given alignment. This way we are not saying that they are in fact assigned to one alignment, but rather staying in keeping with the fact that they are characteristically descriptive of one of these dispositions on a definitive basis. In other words, keep the descriptive analogy without officially labeling them. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEreinion_4e78.html" title="User:Ereinion"><font color="#6B6E85">Ereinion</font></a> 03:49, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As the person who inadvertently got the ball rolling by adding the early examples, that was the idea I was originally going for. Not that they WERE those alignments, but that the characters would be good illustrations of what a person of that alignment might be like. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 19:59, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reluctantly changed my vote after seeing a recent change to the article. The examples are of increasingly poor quality - someone has just added some obscure video-game characters, and deleted some of the better examples (Jack the Ripper and Hermione Granger are known to just about the entire English-speaking world, but who the hell is Kefka Palozzo?). As it's impossible to prevent the junk from creeping back in, it's best to dispense with the examples alltogether. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthucke_6219.html" title="User:Matthucke">Matthucke</a></p>

<dd>Kefka Palazzo is the main villain in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VI_262d.html" title="Final Fantasy VI">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Even though he is a little obscure to some, many videogamers are familiar with him.</dd>
<dd>But I don't think he is that well known, a better example from <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> would be <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephiroth_%28video_game_character%29.html" title="Sephiroth (video game character)">Sephiroth</a>, as people other than just gamers are familiar with him. In regards to his aligment, I'd say he fits the profile of Neutral Evil, though that's not fully certain, but he fits it a little better than Lawful or Chaotic Evil. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatanael_e681.html" title="User:Satanael">Satanael</a> 16:39, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mighty Veil -- As much as I like examples. It's doubtful to get an accurate for every example out there since no one really agrees with what the meaning of each alignment actually is. Batman sounds like CG, but if really, I would argue NG. He's about liberty and helping the city. The city is Law. He acts above the Law but he's not trying to undermine it (Chaos). He works with the police (Law).</p>
<p>Mighty Veil -- I thought examples had been removed already, but noticed them. Oh wow. These should be removed ASAP. I'd love to point out how wrong the alignment guesses are but I know that'd start up an argument. As I said above, everyone has their own idea of alignment. I'm old school, so I like the original 1e simplified view of it. But lots of people use 2e's (LG is the crusader, etc), or agree with the more "progressive" point of view of 3e (Is hunting a rabbit for food immoral because it involves murdering a life?). But I have to say it! Ra Gul, the bad guy who wanted to destroy a city and by doing so, accepted many would die. But that's okay since it's his want. Is not, is so not LN. That's CE right there. But heck, I'd argue it's possible to play a CE rogue in a group of good characters easily, without it turning into a mess.</p>
<p>I no longer oppose removing <b>all</b> the examples. Their quality is deteriorating, and some of the assigned alignments are certainly debatable. Ra's Al Ghul as CE makes no sense whatsoever, BTW. His terror group was too well organized &amp; disciplined for such a label. Rearden Metal 21:12, 1 January 2006 (UTC) '</p>

<p>(December 31, 2005; Mighty Veil) Something to consider on this. In the forum thread with Gygax (link below). He briefly gets into a political discussion with someone. In Gygax's view, US/Canada political parties are all LG. They all want to create laws (Lawful), which they believe will create a good result (Good). In a follow up email I asked him to expand:</p>
<p>EGG:"First remember that law is FORCE. Thus all political parties advocating strong government advocate strong laws and force to back them up. Libertarians are the least lawful of the American political parties. In general, the AD&amp;D alignments do not mesh well with political parties, as the alignments are too absolute. I believe that the Natural rights of man--life, liberty, and property--are in the neutral good to neutral position in regards alignment."</p>
<ul>
<li>To try and avoid those NPOV problems, I keyed the alignments to specific characters in fiction, to describe to the layman what a given alingment may be like. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 22:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Recent discussions with game creator <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Gygax_b6d5.html" title="Gary Gygax">Gary Gygax</a>, done on the forum of Gaming web site EN World, has shed new light on Dungeons and Dragons' alignment and the misconceptions about it. The idea for alignments came from the Poul Anderson book, "Three Hearts and Three Lions". In the book, the forces of Law, represented by the Paladins of Charlemange, were at war with the forces of Chaos, the Faerie kingdom. This is why paladins were initially lawful and elves were chaotic.</p>
<p>Other misconceptions on alignment include the use of them in the game. Common belief makes alignments an element of concern for the player. In fact, they were more for the Dungeon Master's use. Players only need to be concerned if their class could be lost due to a change in alignment. The idea that lawful good was presented as the "best" good is pure myth. As <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Gygax_b6d5.html" title="Gary Gygax">Gygax</a> suggested, the purest good was neutral good, as lawful and chaotic meant the player was expected to follow the views that governed them. Another alignment myth is that 'true' neutral means a character is continually balancing morals, in a <a href="../../../y/i/n/Yin_yang.html" title="Yin yang">yin yang</a> or fanatical fashion.</p>
<p>As basically described, lawful means a character believes in laws. A good character will usually promote law, while an evil character may use them to its advantage (e.g. The Chicago mob of the 20s required the law to outlaw liquor to operate, they could be seen as an example of lawful evil). Chaotic meant an either an opposing view to the common lawful view (e.g. 1960s America's "chaotic" characters were those espousing the hippie counterculture) or no rule of law at all (the common view of chaotic today). Neutral was about freedom and liberty, with good characters promoting it, and evil characters repressing it.</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Neutrality isn't so much about freedom and liberty as abstentation from siding with law or chaos, good or evil, as any neutral character might view unaligned mores or ethoi as inaccurate or eventually harmful. A Lawful Neutral character does not verbotim consider Evil or Good as tyranny, but rather as unnecessary and perhaps degrading the essence of Universal Law. As long as we're on th' subject, a Chaotic Neutral character isn't crazy or wild by default, but rather can be very devoted to supporting Chaotic universal forces, and the frequent reaction to predictability and homogenity as dangerous to their equilibrium and hazardous to any eventual situation of Chaotic substantiation within social and physical kingdoms.</dd>
<dd>Since there is no *real* designation between philosophy and habit within D&amp;D alignment, a character is considered to prefer their alignment outlook in dealing with all situations, be they ideatic, potential, or manifest and actual. Alignment is hard to explain in some ways, as it denotes complex underlying reasons for all events in a game where all events are usually quite simple and even without rationale (such as a dragon turtle guarding a mimic or "casting magic missile at the darkness").</dd>
<dd>For all that, alignment can be understood as being a natural force, so powerful that even the deific powers in D&amp;D worlds hold to it, and yet it can be changed by any character with wit to change their innate outlook.</dd>
