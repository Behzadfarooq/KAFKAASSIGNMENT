<p><b>Ali Afshari</b> (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>: علی افشاری; born <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>) has become one of the most recognizable faces within Iran’s reform movement.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> For ten years Afshari has campaigned for reform-minded leaders and change within the Islamic Republic. His posts have included membership on the Central Council of <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_for_Strengthening_Unity_e212.html" title="Office for Strengthening Unity">Office for Strengthening Unity</a> and membership on the Central Council of the Islamic Student Association at <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amirkabir_University_of_Technology_59a9.html" title="Amirkabir University of Technology">Amirkabir University of Technology</a>, where he served as the secretary of the association for three years.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2003, Afshari was imprisoned by the Islamic Republic on charges that he was threatening the national security of the country though his active role in pro-democracy programs on college campuses. During those years, he was placed in solitary confinement for 400 days, including 328 days consecutively. Following days of abuse, Mr. Afshari was tortured into providing a false confession in which he admitted to the crimes with which he was charged. This confession was broadcast across Iran and garnered considerable attention from the public. Despite the human rights abuses which were carried out against Mr. Afshari, he has been even more vigorous in his pursuit of bringing democracy and human rights standards to Iran since his release. After completing his Masters of Science in Industrial Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology(Tehran Poly Technique), Mr. Afshari has traveled to Ireland and the United States in an effort to bring the injustices of the Islamic Regime to light.</p>
<p>Mr. Afshari has published his views in over forty essays and papers including roozonline, gooya news, and has been profiled by the BBC, Agence France Presse and The Irish Times.</p>
<p>On March 2,2006 He and <a href="../../../a/k/b/Akbar_Atri_2717.html" title="Akbar Atri">Akbar Atri</a> gave talks on human right and democracy in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> at a panel discussion organized by Senator <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a> and Senator <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lieberman_34c5.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> at the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Capitol_9d8c.html" title="U.S. Capitol">U.S. Capitol</a>. The event was sponsored by The Foundation for Defense of Democracies and the Iranian Students for Democracy and Human Rights. Their talk provided updated information on human rights abuses in Iran and detailed the progress of Iran ’s pro-democracy movement as well as the hurdles confronting it.</p>
