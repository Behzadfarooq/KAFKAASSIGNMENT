<dd>I recommend that the user Aucaman read my two new postings about Aryan and either withdraw his comments or respond. I will copy &amp; paste my arguments (and they were written by me personally) again. As per the Pan-Kurdists I have left them a message on the "Persian" people article, and I hope it will be sufficient for them to remove all their nonsense.</dd>

Message 1:</p>
<p>Zora is completely wrong here because the exact opposite case is true. Aryan is used in the Academic sense. See the Encyclopedia Iranica enteries on Aryan and Arya. (Articles 1631 and 1637) by two of them most eminent Iranian linguists of all times (Sir Harold Baily and Rudiger Schmitt). But as per the word Aryan, I urge people to read the articles by the eminent scholar Asko Parapola<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~aparpola/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helsinki.fi/~aparpola/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I have written on this issue of Aryans in the previous page. The fact of the matter is that Emil Beneviste considers this term to purely ethnic in the Old-Iranian sense. Furthemore the Greek inscription of Shapur clearly calls him the King of the Arya Ethnos. See the article on Eran Shahr in the Encyclopedia Iranica: "<a href="http://www.iranica.com/articles/v8f5/v8f545.html" class="external free" title="http://www.iranica.com/articles/v8f5/v8f545.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iranica.com/articles/v8f5/v8f545.html</a>" as well. All this is sufficient proof enough that the Aryans were an ethnic group who are the linguistic and cultural ancestors of modern Iranians (speakers). Also racially, the arab and turkic invasion did not have much effect on Iranians and so we can assume that Iranians are mainly of Aryan+pre-Aryan stock. There is no way anyone can deny the high academic standard of Encyclopedia Iranica and eminent scholars like Asko Parapola and Gerhad Gnoli (see the book 'the idea of Iran'). For example look at this recent article (Parpola, Asko, 1988. The coming of the Aryans to Iran and India and the cultural and ethnic identity of the Dasas. Studia Orientalia 64: 195-302. Helsinki: The Finnish Oriental Society.). And as per the comment of Zora, Professor Parpola is not just a linguist. His work encompasses "archaeology, historical linguistics, history, cultural anthropology, and historical population genetics." and he is a major Academic with many refrenced articles. In fact it is safe to say that he is the top researcher in topics dealing with Aryans. When you have published a single article like that of Prof. Parpola, then please argue that Aryans were not a group of people. But today Aryans are the primarily linguistic/cultural/racial ancestors of modern Iranians. Here is another recent article by Professor Gerhad Gnoli of Italy that uses the term Aryan clearly in the Academic sense: <a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Aryan/aryanlanguagegnoli.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Aryan/aryanlanguagegnoli.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> . I request all debates about the historical validity of Aryans be removed since it is used frequently in Academia to refer to the ancient Iranian Persians and Medes.</p>
<p><br />
Message 2:</p>
<p>The term Aryan is an ethnic term in the Iranian languages.</p>
<p><br />
According to the The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition:</p>
<p><i>It is one of the ironies of history that Aryan, a word nowadays referring to the blond-haired, blue-eyed physical ideal of Nazi Germany, originally referred to a people who looked vastly different. Its history starts with the ancient Indo-Iranians, Indo-European peoples who inhabited parts of what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and India. Their tribal self-designation was a word reconstructed as *arya- or * rya-. The first of these is the form found in Iranian, as ultimately in the name of Iran itself (from Middle Persian r n ( ahr), “(Land) of the Iranians,” from the genitive plural of r, “Iranian”). The variant * rya- is found unchanged in Sanskrit, where it referred to the upper crust of ancient Indian society. These words became known to European scholars in the 18th century.</i></p>
<p>As the dictionary correctly asserts Aryans means the Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-Europeans. Let us review some of the old sources that explicitly establish why Iran (the land of Arya) and Iranians are Aryans (Iranians) and why the Academia still uses this terms for the Indo-Iranians. Herodotus in his Histories remarks that: “These Medes were called anciently by all people Arians; “ (7.62). So here we have a foreign source that refers to part of the Iranians as Arya.</p>
<p>Native sources also describe Iranians by this ethnonym. Old Persian which is a testament to the antiquity of the Persian language and which is related to most of the languages/dialects spoken in Iran including modern Persian, Kurdish, Gilaki and Baluchi makes it clear that Iranians referred to themselves as Arya.</p>
<p>The term "Ariya" appears in the royal inscriptions in three different context: As the name of the language of the Old Persian version of the inscription of Darius the Great in Behistun; as the ethnic background of Darius in inscriptions at Naqsh-e-Rostam and Susa (Dna, Dse) and Xerxes in the inscription from Persepolis (Xph) and as the definition of the God of Arya people, Ahuramazda, in the Elamite version of the Behistun inscription. For example in the Dna and Dse Darius and Xerxes describe themselves as “An Achaemenian, A Persian son of a Persian and an Aryan, of Aryan stock”.</p>
<p>Note that first they describe their clan (Achaemenid) and then tribe/group (Persian) and then their ethnicity Arya. So here we have good references that both the Medes and Persians referred to themselves as Aryans. The Medes and Persians were people of western Iranian stock. Western Iranian languages and dialects including Kurdish, Persian, Baluchi have their roots in the Old Persian and Median languages and are prevalent languages of Iran today. The OP inscriptions date back approximately to 400-500 B.C. Concurrently, or even prior to Old Persian, the word Airya is abundant used in the Avesta and related Zoroastrian literature whose origin lies with the eastern Iranian people.</p>
<p>The Avestan airya always has an ethnic value. It appears in Yasht literature and in the Wideewdaad. The land of Aryans is described as Airyana Vaejah in Avesta and in the Pahlavi inscription as Eran-wez. The Avesta archer Arash (Arash-e-Kamangir) is called the hero of Airya people. Zoroaster himself is described from the Airya people. The examples of the ethnic name of Airya in Avesta are too many to enumerate here and the interested reader is referred to the following site: Avesta.org.</p>
<p>Let us now briefly touch upon some more pre-Islamic evidence. The ostraca (an inscribed potsherd) from Parthian Nisa time period (approx. 2100 years ago) provides us with numerous Parthian names related. Parthian, like Persian, is a Western Iranian language. Some of the names of the people at that time that begin with prefix Arya are given by:</p>
<p>Aryabaam-Aryabaanuk, Aryabarzan- Aryabozhan- Aryaxshahrak- Aryanistak- Aryafriyaanak- Aryasaaxt- Aryazan</p>
<p>The etymology of such names is fairly known. The documents from Nisa as well as other Parthian documents prove that the Parthians employed the Zoroastrian calendar. The names of the months back then is exactly what we use today with a slight modification in pronounciation:</p>
<p>Farwartin- Artewahisht- Harwataat- Tir- Hamuraat- Xshahrewar- Mihr- Aapaaxwini- Aatar- Dathush- Wahman - Sapndaarmard</p>
<p>Strabo, the Greek geographer and traveler of the Parthian times also mentions the unity of the various Iranian tribes and dialects:</p>
<p>...and the name of <b>Ariana</b> is further extended to a part of Persia and of Media, as also to the Bactrians and Sogdians on the north; for these speak approximately the same language, with but slight variations.</p>
<p>Moses of Khorenat’si the Armenian historian of 5th century A.D. also denotes the Parthians, Medes and Persians collectively as Aryans. So ancient neighboring people have consistently referred to Iranians as Aryans. Both Armenian and Greeks are Indo-Europeans but only Indo-Iranians have been known as Aryans throughout history. This is a clear evidence that Aryan was not just some religious title in the Iranian world, but it actually referred to an ethnic group.</p>
<p>From the Parthian epoch we transition into the Sassanid era. Ardeshir the first, the founder of the Sassanid dynasty, on the coins minted during his era describes himself as "Shahan shah Aryan" (Iran). Where Aryan exactly means the “land of the Arya” which is synonymous with land of Iranians. His son Shapur, whose triumphs over his enemies are the stuff of legends minted coins with the inscription: “Shahan shah aryan ud anaryan” (The king of Kings of Iran and Non-Iran). The reason for anaryan is that he expanded the empire beyond the Aryan lands.</p>
<p>The trilingual inscription erected by his command gives us a more clear description. The languages used are Parthian, Middle Persian and Greek. In Greek the inscription says: “ego ... tou Arianon ethnous despotes eimi” which translates to “I am the king of the Aryans”. In the Middle Persian Shapour says: “I am the Lord of the EranShahr” and in Parthian he says: “I am the Lord of AryanShahr”. Both AryanShahr/EranShahr here denote the country of Iran.</p>
<p>The name IranShahr has been widely referenced after the Arab conquest by many authors including Tabari the great historian and Abu Rayhan Biruni the great scholar. So the word Eran actually is derived from Arayanam of the Avesta and it means the place Ary/Er (Parthian and Middle Persian respectively). As the suffix “an” denotes a place holding for example Gil+an means the land of the Gil (Gilak) who are an Aryan ethnic group of modern Iran. It was mentioned that Darius the Great referred to his language as Aryan.</p>
<p>The Bactrian inscription of Kanishka the founder of the Kushan empire at Rabatak, which was discovered in 1993 in an unexcavated site in the Afghanistan province of Baghlan clearly refers to this Eastern Iranian language as Arya. Interestingly enough, Bactrian (Bakhtari) was written using Greek alphabets.In the post-Islamic era one can see a clear usage of the term Aryan (Iran) in the work of the 10th century historian Hamzeh Esfahani. In his famous book “the history of Prophets and Kings” he writes: “Aryan which is also called Pars is in the middle of these countries and these six countries surround it because the South East is in the hands China, the North of the Turks, the middle South is India, the middle North is Rome, and the South West and the North West is the Sudan and Berber lands”.</p>
<p>What has been touched upon so far is just some of the evidence that clearly establishes that Iran and Aryan are the same and furthermore that Iranians have always referred to themselves as Arya in history. The term "Arya" has never been applied to other branches of Indo-European people. This term exclusively denotes the Iranians and Indians. <b>The eminent linguist Emile Benviste asserts that the Old Iranian Arya is documented solely as an ethnic name.</b> Aryan denotes a cultural-linguistic community. Racial anthropology on the other hand points to the fact that Iranians as well as many other Aryan speakers like Kurds and Afghans are part of Caucasoid Mediterranean subtype commonly referred to as Irano-Afghan. So the title "Aryan" is perfectly fine to use by Iranian speakers and the word Iran and Aryan are just pronounciation of the same word. The abuse and crimes of the Nazis has nothing to do with the historical name of the Iranian people since the Germanic people are not Aryans. This term is still widely used and accepted in the Academia as mention by the articles above.</p>

<dd>I have no problem with the use of the word Aryan if there's enough context for it. The term has been used by ancient Iranians. In the future you might want to refrain from posting long messages because (1) they take too much space (2) people are less likely to read long arguments. <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>Aucaman</b></a><sup><a href="../../../a/u/c/User_talk%7EAucaman_2cc1.html" title="User talk:Aucaman">Talk</a></sup> 08:31, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>well this is a heavy topic and so it will be long and tedious. In fact there is more evidence from ancient time that I have not put in here. Do a google site search for example in www.avesta.org under the word "aryan" and you can see numerous uses in Zoroastrian literatue. The Europeans were looking for some identity outside of the Judeo-Christianic civilization and thus they tried to claim the historical legacy of Aryans(Indo-Iranians, and modern Indians and Iranians). So I am not sure why that article on Persian origin is full of disagreements about this term! --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 08:42, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ali doostzadeh.</p>
<p>Do you have some historic sources in regards to <a href="../../../a/l/h/Alhazen.html" title="Alhazen">Alhazen</a>'s ethnicity? --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 07:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem with Al-hazen is that we have no source on his ethnicity. He probably was born in Basra, which means it could go either way. Since there was a lot of Persian christians and jews and Zoroastrians in Basra during the Islamic era. I will do more research but I doubt either side can come up with something definitive. Just like on Geber there is nothing that is definitive. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 06:51, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Diyako has created an article on a Turkic-Nowruz without mention of its Iranian history and roots. Soon we will here Nowruz has nothing to do with Iran too. His article is <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevruz.html" title="Nevruz">Nevruz</a>. This should be merged or edited properly. He has gone on the Turkish discussions to promote it.</p>
<p>Here is what user:Diyako has written;</p>
<p><b>Nevruz is the spring festival among Turkic-speaking nations, from Turkey to Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan etc. It is very similar to the Iranian festival of Norouz.</b></p>
<p><b>According to Turkish legends Nevruz dates back to era of Gökturks.</b></p>
<p>Th user Diyako is definnityl anti-Iranian and has an anti-Iranian agenda.</p>
<p>Nevruz is not very similar to the Irnian festival of Norouz it is Norouz!</p>
<p>He has claimed the Kurdish flag has nothing to do with Iran and is a crime to fly in Iran. The Kurdish flag is based on the Iranian flag it is even in the memories of the founders of the Mehbad Republic who wanted to showcase their Aryan and Mede heritage. Back then Kurds only had a oral history about their only know ancestors the Mede and Mede heritage, before other ancestors were accepted. The Sun is also very significant element of ancient Iranian and Zorasatrianism. Diyako is misleading everyone. Go to Kurdistan 20 years ago let alone 50 they will say we are Aryans and our own blood relatives are the Persians. The Kurdish flag is not banned in Iran and is based on Iranian colours. This user also claims the Iranians are only a lingustic group after he saw that the tide was against him that Kurds are in definition an Iranian people so he worked to undermine the definition of Iranian people and even Persians with user:Acuman.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that user, khoikhoi (MOD) keeps including the very offensive term, "south azerbaijan" on the Iranian Azerbaijan page. We should not let him post this propoganda and false information. That term has no place in an encycolpedia article. It is not relevent to the content. What a few seperatists call that region should not be shown here. If we dont stop this, people will start including the "a#abian gulf" as an alternate name on the Persian gulf page.</p>

You can see even here, in the consideration of articles, Iranian Azarbaijan and Azarbaijanians. Some Iranian participants insist on saying Azaris are an Iranian ethnicity, although it is widely-known that Azaris are Turkic. This is what is being represented or occuring in Iran itself.

<p>Ahwaz keeps reverting me on <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Iranian_Arabs_f9c0.html" title="Famous Iranian Arabs">Famous Iranian Arabs</a> saying that Khazal was ruler of the whole province, which is not true, and that he was governor of the province, which I also know is not true. There was always a Persian governor in Shushtar. No book I have ever read called any of the Kaabis "governor". I think this person has a serious anti-Iranian POV with his own fantasy history because he keeps calling Khazal the "ruler of Arabistan" which is nonsense. Arabistan (Khuzestan) was/is an Iranian province under control of central government. Only Mohammereh and surrounding towns were controlled by Khazal.

<p>Yeah I'm trying to keep an eye on the additions, but people just keep adding stuff to the article for reasons I can't fathom.

<dd>Okay, I can use another genetic study if that's the case. Is it on the Azeris in Iran (I hope) and what language are you translating it from? I'll try to squeeze it in as that is, at least, more relevant than details about the newspaper's editor which is another superfluous addition. Really tiresome to deal with this. Plus the references added weren't properly formatted even. Geez.

<dd>Problem with the study. I'm not sure how readers will take a study that can't be read in English, although I don't doubt the veracity of the claims or anything.

<p>Hi Ali. I came across the information about Iranian general Ahmad Khan Nakhjavan in the Internet: <a href="http://www.iiaf.net/archive/personnel/nakhjavan.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iiaf.net/archive/personnel/nakhjavan.jpg" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://www.iiaf.net/history/iiaf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iiaf.net/history/iiaf.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>I would like you to ask you as a person with a great knowledge of history of Iran do you have any idea if general Ahmad Khan Nakhjavan has anything to do with Nakhchivan? It says that he was the first commander of Iranian air forces. I know that khans of Nakhchivan served both in Russian and Iranian armies and some of them were high-ranked commanders. I wrote an article about <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussein_Khan_Nakhichevanski_5f0f.html" title="Hussein Khan Nakhichevanski">Hussein Khan Nakhichevanski</a>, who was the adjutant-general of the Russian emperor. So it is interesting for me to know if this person is related to the khans of Nakhchivan or not. Also I noted that the name and surname Nakhjavan are very popular in Iran. Does the word Nakhjavan mean anything in Farsi? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:27, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. To add a ref, here's an example.</p>
<p>I like cats.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Britannica, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>It then automatically shows up at the bottom. However, to add a ref for something that you'll use mutliple times throughout the article, the first time it would look like this:</p>
<p>My grandma hates cats.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Thomas. Columbia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>And then the second time (and third, forth, etc.) that you want to use that in an article, use this:</p>
<p>My grandma also hates dogs.&lt;ref name="johnson" /&gt;</p>
<p>Hope that helped. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 16:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I think you should start a new article called <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khusraw_and_Shirin_489e.html" title="Khusraw and Shirin">Khusraw and Shirin</a>, and then have it just as a summary in the <a href="../../../n/e/z/Nezami.html" title="Nezami">Nezami</a> article, linking to it.

<p>Khaseh nabashi! I have read with great interest many of your recent comments and regretfully I havent had any time for WP lately but I am glad there are people like you who are more interested in fact than politics! Especially the Kurd and Khuzestan issues (its true many of the claims about the last one have no statistics!) have been headache for everyone.

<p>Although I am concerned and upset about both Azari and Armenia refugees and beleive they are essentially the same people, on an academic basis I question this picture being posted on this article. It seems to be POV, and once again the article seems to be getting a non-neutral, biased Republic of Azarbaijan tilt to it again. I object to the posting of this picture and I also ask all editors to consider the changes being made recently. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.196.164.190.html" title="User:69.196.164.190">69.196.164.190</a></p>

<p>They are claiming a lot bullshit about our people, we should manifest some facts.</p>
<p>1) Kurds are an Iranic people, thus they are Aryans 2) Kurds are the decentens of Medes (Gorani/Zazaki speakers instead of Parthians, look the similary between Gorani and Pahlavi) 3) Kurds history/culture/language is rooted in the Iranic history/culture/language</p>
<p><br />
We should point this out and proof it by scientifcal sources! If we have done this, we should show rebut every point, which is wrong. After this we can begin to change the whole article. We should make a proto Version and, when it is finish we are going to replace the old version by our own.</p>
<p>I will later also do this on Wikipedia Germany based on the fact we got by the English version.</p>
<p>I think it will be a lot work, but we can be strong and do the job, if we work together.</p>

<dd>As a note I must also say that this behaviour is not needed, but can be corrected and hopefully in a positive way and through positive methods. It is the behaviour that is bad, as for the editors we do not know them outside of their editing or Wiki-characters and it can be safe for me to stress an anology through the age old maxim, "hate the sin and not the sinner." You can make your own conclusions from reading this material, and hopefully it will also formulative effective behaviour and edits from yourself in the near or distant future. Once, again I apprecite your conduct and editing as I do many other good editors who contribute to such a positive and stimulating, prodocutive environment on WIkipedia.</dd>

<dd>You are certainly most welcome. Although the NK issue diverges from the area you prefer to edit it; it does illustrate the behaviour and edit waring you have seen first hand. It might not come as a suprise if you recognize anyone or any particular formats of argument that seem to have been used against you. I thought letting you observe and note this argument would strengthen your hand the next time such tactics were used against you while editing. In continuation of this nexus, I would monitor the section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_literature" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_literature" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_literature</a> because the sma bevaviour is being exhibited. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.196.164.190.html" title="User:69.196.164.190">69.196.164.190</a></dd>

<dd>Thanks for the headsup. We have some aggressive POV pushers with regards to some Azerbaijani related issues. Although this could be the case for other issues as well. On the issue of Azerbaijani literature, the neutral POV which is actually our POV as well has standard Academic backing. Literature means contributions of that language. Persian or Kurdish or Arabic literature can not be considered part of Azerbaijani Turkish literature. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 22:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ali, let them bark, as it says in Farsi مه نور فشاند و سگ عو عو کند The perfection of a language is not in the number of characters or verbs but how you can express different ideas in that language easily and how flexible and adaptable it is.

<p>I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that maybe you haven't been here long enough to see how things work... But if you absolutely must blank out entire paragraphs from an article that have been there for years, it is customary and courteous to paste them onto the talk page for discussion - no matter how ludicrous you personally feel them to be. If you simply hide or censor stuff where no one can see it, it is playing with the records and may be considered vandalism . <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have a good point. But actually relating the Medes (the three wise men) (Magians) to Hungarian Magyar is on the border of real insanity. And by the way the information goes against Wikipedia's policy of NOR.

Actually the definition is wider. NOR also means that you can't make your website (specially a non-specialist) and then cut &amp; paste information from that website and then claim it is a reliable reference. Else every topic in Wikipedia could be in chaos. As you can see the portion I blanked out was a word for word cut &amp; paste (and I might without reference) article by a Hungarian nationalists: <a href="http://users.cwnet.com/millenia/medescyth.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.cwnet.com/millenia/medescyth.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Please read that article as you can see it goes against all scholarly opinion. And by scholarly I do not mean my opinion, but opinion of current scholars in the field. I can assure you that the ancient Medes were not related to Hungarian Magyar.

<p>Please keep an eye on this article. I had put an "accuracy" tag on top pf the "Medieval period" section where it is claimed that "Turkification of Azerbaijan began with the Seljuqs". I've shown on the talk page that authoritative sources - most of all Iranica and Britannica - do NOT support this claim and - in fact - contradict it. It is a known fact that the Seljuqs were Persian-speaking and considered themselvs Persians. The Turkification of Azerbaijan and Anatolia began AFTER the fall of the Seljuqs, NOT with their advent. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 20:51, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You might wish to check Britannica again:</dd>

<dd>Linguistic dominance could mean ruling elite. A better and more specialized source is the book from Peter Golden. Although the Seljuq period was the start of Turkification, nevertheless, prior to the mongol era, the area was definitely predominantely non-Turkic. Probably Turkic took majority during the rule of Aq-Qoynlu dynasty. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 14:24, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree. Turkification did start in the Seljuq era or I would say a good influx of Turkomens came to the area (as some books mention and even differentiate between Turkomens and the Tatars, Turkomens being Muslim Oghuz tribes and Tatars being Turkic/Mongolic tribes that were pagans). Culturally though the Seljuqs supported Persian culture, probably due to the fact that there wasn't an equivalent Turkic culture at the time, since Turkic culture was mainly nomadic and over several centuries, nomadic Turkic tribes settled down slowly and mixed with the locals..--<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 22:28, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Only in eleventh century, with the influx of the Oghuz Turkic tribes under the Seljuk dynasty, did the country acquire a significant proportion of Turkic-speaking inhabitants. The original population began to be fused with the immigrants, and gradually the Persian language was replaced by a Turkic dialect that evolved into a distinct Azeri Turkish language. Turkification was slow and complex, sustained by successive waves of incoming nomads from Central Asia</i>.</dd>

<dd>Speaking of the 3 theories, in my personal opinion all 3 are accurate, but none has prevalence. The Azerbaijanis are a mixture of those 3 elements, i.e. ancient Turkic, Caucasian and Iranian people. It is hard or maybe even impossible to precisely establish the proportion of each element, but all three are important parts of Azerbaijani mentality. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, Ali, I understand that you initiated renaming the Scytho-Iranian Theory into Ethicity of the Scythians. This renaming is incorrect, because the Scytho-Iranian Theory article's subject is not a discussion of the Ethicity of the Scythians, but of the hypothesis itself, its history, contents, premises and structure. In this aspect the renaming is a deletion of the subject by surrogate excision, and should be against Wikipedia rules. I understand that your suggestion was a good-heart attempt to compromize with ardent opponents, but the end result is not a compromize, but a substantially deletion of the subject.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Ethicity of the Scythians is a separate subject that can be treated in light of the Scytho-Iranian and non-Scytho-Iranian theories, and which addresses the subject of ethicity without detailing the substances, history, and structure of the competing theories.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please educate me on the restoration procedures. Khosrow II, with a mobilized cohort, vandalized the article a dozen of times, received the last vandalizm warning, and switched tactics from brute force to undermining by deception. First attempt to use copyright label failed, and now it is a subject substitute, which is a straightforward deception for an article that does not address the ethicity subject. You can notice that all the objections are not constructive and rest entirely on ideological beliefs, while the objection methods are solely distructive.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please help me to reverse the renaming, or better do it yourself.</dd>

<dd>Hi. Actually I did not change it and it was an administrator who changed it and it is not against Wikipedia rules. Again Wikipedia is not a place for debates. There is a universal acceptance of Scythians as Iranians by all scholars and Encyclopedia 2006. Nationalistic theories which go against universal scholarly knowledge are considered original research in wikipedia and should be deleted in my opinion. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 18:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should I understand your reply as you distancing yourself from the change, and pointing to the administrator as the initiator? Should I understand your reply as supporting the reversal of the change? I would be very grateful for your consent. You understand that the subject of the Scytho-Iranian Theory article's is not a discussion of the Ethicity of the Scythians, and these subjects are not intercheangeable. Would you advise me on the proper procedure to make this reversal?</dd>

Here are some sites:<a href="http://66.1911encyclopedia.org/A/AZ/AZERBAIJAN.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.1911encyclopedia.org/A/AZ/AZERBAIJAN.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Note the 1911 Encyclopedia only refers to the historical Azerbaijan. Shaikh Mahmud Khiyabani changed the name of the Iranian Azerbaijan province he ran to Azadestan, this change was adopted because the Caucasian Azerbaijanis declared their republic to be the republic of Azerbaijan, and the sheikh was thereby repudiating their northern neighbor’s invitation to join them. ( `Ali Azari, Qiyam-e Sheikh Mohammad Khiabani (Marvi: Tehran (?), 1362=1983), p. 300.) I would also do a search for world map. I would also look at this: <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/history_asia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/history_asia.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/asia_1892_amer_ency_brit.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/asia_1892_amer_ency_brit.jpg" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://www.payvand.com/news/06/mar/1212.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.payvand.com/news/06/mar/1212.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Also I would read this: <a href="http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/Geography/arran_or_azerbaijan.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/Geography/arran_or_azerbaijan.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Also the quote by Barthold is very good since he was a major scholar. From the last site: <i>Barthold disclosed the reason for choosing to apply such a name. In page 782 of the second volume of his Collected Works, he noted: "The name 'Azerbaijan' was adopted because it was presumed that through the establishment of the Azerbaijan Republic, the Iranian Azarbaijan and the Azerbaijan Republic will eventually become one." As can be seen, the name 'Azerbaijan' was used with a specific goal that became manifest at a later period. Somewhere else in this same volume, Barthold wrote: "Wherever and whenever a name should be required with which one can refer to the whole region of the Azerbaijan Republic, one can use Aran" (page 703)</i>.</dd>

<dd>There is a controversy, because the people to the north of Iran's border are not Azeri's. the name change was politically motivated by pan turks in 1918. Thank you alot, how did you find these? i've been searching for a long time. what key words do you use when you search?<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 16:34, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem.. It is true that the people of caucus are not "Azerbaijanis" in the historic sense, but they are now called Azerbaijanis due to Rasulzade's mistake. Although very few sources do mention modern Arran (Azerbaijan) as part of Armenia or Georgia or Azerbaijan, due to having the same ruler or governor. Still historically Arran and Shirvan have been separate from Azerbaijan. Send me an email and I'll send you some sources from Dr. Touraj Atabaki's book where Rasulzadeh even admitted this mistake. alidoostzadeh@yahoo.com</dd>

For now that embassy link from the republic of Azerbaijan makes it seem like it is a state policy to distort historical facts and even call Zoroastrianism as a Turkish religion!

<p>I would start a subpage at your userpage (like I did for the Ossetic grammar) and start documenting any disruptions and abuse on his part. I would then talk to an administrator --- I've gotten in a few tussles on here, but nothing that wasn't eventually smoothed out, so I don't know anything about banning people.</p>
<p>The most egregious action on Barefact's part --- that I have seen, anyway --- were his false accusations of sock-puppetry against you and your friend, for which he had no evidence. I would consider that an attempt to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wp%7Edisrupt.html#Gaming_the_system" title="Wp:disrupt">game the system</a>.</p>
<p>Get some thing together and then notify an admin --- he should be able to tell you what your options are. Good luck!</p>

<dd>I don't think there is any academic dispute. To claim that Ossetic is non-Iranian is really a one man show vs all scholars... He even disfigures Abaev's quote in English which is available online! I am going to bring the compendium article on Ossetic from 1989 and then keep going at it with this user until everyone realizes that he just won't quit until he is banned. I have even brought a statement from a great scholar from University of Chicago. He also abused the Scythian article and tried to remove the reference to their Iranic hertiage which is again verified by Britannica 2006 and every modern source.. Its not about a dispute but about someone wanting to push wrong information from his site: www.turkicworld.org on specific Iranian enteries such as Scythians, Alans, Ossetic.. He even claimed 1/3 of Persian is Turkish (which is laughable). I am against POV (even see the former article on controversy of name of Azerbaijan republic where I reasonably compromised with Grandmaster) and have asked Khosrow to do the same. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 00:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that there is no academic dispute, but there is definately a dispute between Barefact, you, and the rest of the Iranian editors. If you really want to keep going at it with him like you claim, you might also try to think of <i>some</i> ideas for compromise. Perhaps a section in the article called "fringe theories"? :-p But seriously, maybe an section called "alternate theories" and then start it as, "while virtually all linguists classify Ossetian as an Iranian language...". As for the <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a> article, I agree Wikipedia articles are not debate arenas.

<dd>I am not sure if fringe idea is good.. because barefact has shown that he disfigures quotes. Also I do not see the dispute as Iranian editors vs barefact, but as all scholars who have labored years in philology vs barefact. I am not a political person but I am more interested in history/culture and that is why accuracy is important. There is no way one should give credibility to any sort of view that is against 100% of what all scholars say. Even the Abaev he keeps claiming actually has stated clearly that Ossetic is an Iranian language. I think the RFC idea is good, but for now I am awaiting to show the compendium article on Ossetic which is impressive and a friend of mine should have it available on the internet soon. It is very complete article and once I get my hand on it, then barefact will look more ridicolous than he is now.. Although I already have th upperhand, that article is very complete on all aspects of Ossetic grammer. Some articles are not worth compromising on when 100% of scholars say something else. Too bad I do not know any Ossetic Wikipedians and it seems I have to stand up for the truth here which I will..--<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 06:53, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to stop this insane war, and have proposed a number of compromises, to no avail. I already stated that I accept the arbitration by a scolar already selected by Ali doostzadeh, and would accept any neutral arbitration. I agree with Ali doostzadeh that fringe idea is not good, but for a totally different reason. For the critics of the Scytho-Iranian theory, the Iranian theory is a fringe accepted only in some corners of our large world. But to dismiss offhand the Iranian theory as a fringe would be a non-encyclopedic biaced position, unfair to its creators. It should be given a place under the sun, since it is a phenomena of our reality. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 15:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But my friend Khodadad who is an expert on this matter will come to join that entery soon. You are not a scholar and do not have the credibility to criticize any theory. Actually your comments like 1/3 of Persian is Turkic shows that you are just pan-turkist ultranationalist agitator. And also Wikipedia as you said is an Encyclopedia and will reflect the viewpoints of academics and not crackpot theories who claim every from Arabic to Zulu as Turkish. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 15:59, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Salam,</p>
<p>The situation (tafraqeh afkani) has long been going on on WP. That's why I stopped contributing to WP. WP is basically a platform for posting every stupid anti-Iranian propaganda on the internet. And if that's not enough, you get stalked by some users and admins just for trying to fix the inaccuracies.</p>
<p>My solution was to help upstart and start contributing to <a href="http://www.wikiran.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikiran.org" rel="nofollow">WikIran</a>, a specialized encyclopedia and an alternative to Wikipedia, where all admins are Iranian, and none of this <i>agenda editing</i> is tolerated.</p>
<p>I tried fighting this biased and unfair system on WP for 2 years. When even the admins take sides in editorial disputes and help suppress Iranian editors and the facts about Iran with the most ridiculous pretexts, you know then that WP has failed.</p>

<p>My father was a diplomat, and I go on roadtrips overseas annualy. I've been to Iran three times and each time was great. To be honest most of the things I heard about Iran before my first visit from "dissidents" were not true, although in fairness that's maybe because i'm Armenian and a tourist. Everyone treated me with great respect. I saw Tabriz, Isfahan and Tehran. In Tehran I even went to metal concert. In the future I intend to visit Persepolis and Pasargadae.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 17:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hi guys,</p>
<p>I wonder if his real name is Chehregani. didn't he change it to the turkish sounding Chohreganli to distinguish himself from persians?</p>

<dd>try it, but be carefull that they consider any thing more than 2 sentences about his (intentional?) goof about prediction of nuclear attach on isreal by iran as "undue weight"! and they threatened me to be blocked for ever.

<p>The name of the medes in Kurdish isnot correctly displayed at the beginning of the article. Their name is not written like that in Kurdish (Mad). I included a reference from wikitionary, but it was reverted. Anyway, I restored the reference about the language.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please take a look at the population table again. I am not disputing the table itself, but <b>if you add up the numbers as given in the current table, you can not get 54 million</b>. I think this should be clear enough and there is no need to get into lengthy discussions about definition of ethnicity etc. The current situation just undermines the credibility of the article itself.<a href="../../../h/e/j/User%7EHeja_helweda_5867.html" title="User:Heja helweda">Heja Helweda</a> 19:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ali, As you seem to know well Iranian history and literature, just wanted to let you know that the user khoikhoi and some other gay lobbyist users insist to have "Pederasty Poet" tag with some pictures supposedly from Jami books (I doute that the caption is from the book...). Can you confirm or infirm such things about jami. thanks. F_mir 74.57.251.217 02:43, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ali, I do not understand how you can square your ethical stance against the intellectual dishonesty of an Ahmadinejad (which I find admirable) with your persistent imposition of your personal notions of what is and what is not Sufist practice, despite the conclusions of genuine scholars. Until I took a look at your edits on other articles I thought you were some kind of a nut. I see that you are not, yet your constant ignoring of Wikipedia rules, and your constant injection of homophobic comments in the discussion on Nazar do you no honor.</p>
<p>Stop messing around with properly sourced material and bring in opposing points of view if you like, and if you can find them. But <i><b>not your own</b></i> because you are a nobody and not notable, just like me. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 13:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually all your quotes are from some British Gay scholar of the 19th century who is beeing requoted. That's it. I have quoted Rumi who is the most popular sufi known throughout the ages. He is the ideal model of every sufi and yet you people have the audacity to quote a 19th century British scholar instead of Rumi. As per homophobic comments you need to understand homosexuality is wrong in Sufism as it is in Islam(which true sufism is the mystical dimensions of like Kabbalism is to Judaism and is not its own religion) as it is in Zoroastrianism. Any attempt to distort these facts and try to have a homosexual interpretation on these religions is academic dishonesty. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 17:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Hi Ali. It's me again, F_Mir. I've just discovered another bullshit (sorry for the word) in Saadi page of wikipedia. I quote :</p>
<p>"Saadi has been translated by a number of major Western poets, most of whom were not deterred by the "transparently homoerotic" [1] tone of much of his work. According to Wayne Dynes, "English translators even in the tamer episodes of the Gulistan turn boys into girls and change anecdotes about pederasty into tales of heterosexual Iove." (Asian Homosexuality p.66)".</p>
<p>These guys use homosexual sources or homosexual "so called-Persian poetry scholars" as a source for prouving what they wrongfully call the "homoerotic" nature of persian poetry. How honest is that? They even try to speard the rumor that Edward Fitzgerald (Khayam poem translator) was gay. that's outrageous. What is this wikipedia thing? Is it the the website of British Gay Association, which want to justify their way of living, by spreading rumors on dead poets ???????</p>
<p>Please make aware everybody you know, to make a large scale intervention. We can not allow the spread of lies through the internet. Thanks. F_mir74.57.251.174 20:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again I checked Edward Fitzgerald article. Here I quote :</p>
<p>"Persian literature scholar Dick Davis, in a 1989 introduction to the poem, strongly suggests that FitzGerald was gay (describing his marriages as "disastrous.") He points out suggestions of homoeroticism in the poem. "The sáki—the cup-bearer of Persian poetry may be of either sex... [but] is more often conceived of as a young man than as a girl—as a Ganymede figure, in fact." The line "this delightful Herb whose tender Green/Fledges the River's Lip on which we lean" suggests to Davis a reference to an adolescent boy's moustache; while the stanza</p>
<p>None answer'd this; but after Silence spake A Vessel of a more ungainly Make: “They sneer at me for leaning all awry; “What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?” is read by Davis as FitzGerald's protest of the stigmatization of his sexuality."</p>
<p>taking into account that Dick Davis is a no one (probably gay himself), how is it possible to write such things about Fitzgerald because one gay guy thought he was gay, and now he is gay in the face of the world. What kind of reference is that? And then as a consequence distorting the truth about the persian poetry. I tell you these guys are infiltrating like a virus, a little bit here, a little bit there, to make their point and fullfil their agenda. They don't care about the truth. Is this wikipedia, or wikipederasty?!!!! F_mir74.57.251.174 22:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>HI the Saghi is not sexual symbol .. It just means wine bearer. Just like the Motreb (minsterl) sings and is used a lot. The term Saghi actually could go all the way to Sumerian. Also we have sources on our side from the most prominent Persian literature scholars alive like Franklin. Their sources do not hold weight against Franklin and other scholars of Persian literature. Also if you can please send me an email and I will ask you for you help in sending me some sources perhaps from your own library. thanks. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 00:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During last month I worked on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_fundamentalist_Islam_in_Iran_6067.html" title="History of fundamentalist Islam in Iran">this article</a>. I would like to invite you and other Iranian wikipedians to see the article and help in improving it. I would like to invite you to see the parts on Iranian culture in particular.

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I enabled my email. Also I agree with you about the point you raised. I am very suspecious about these people. They look like spies than anything else. I am not sure whether Iranians should ignore these guys or not: Gary Legenhausen, Ramin, Hamid Mowlana and even Fardid! All these guys have a very strange background.

<p>There are two entries at Wikipedia, which have falsely created -- they are <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turco-Persian_3a45.html" title="Turco-Persian">Turco-Persian</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Persian_Tradition_42f7.html" title="Turko-Persian Tradition">Turko-Persian Tradition</a>. Both entries are factitious. I have requested the entries to be deleted. My reasons are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term <b>Turko-Persian Tradition</b> (or <b>Turco-Persian</b>) does not exists academically and it is a factitious entry! Check the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> to confirm -- The correct name for that culture is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate.html" title="Persianate">Persianate</a> culture not the "Turko-Persian". Turkophones (mostly of mixed race and Persianized in culture) only spoke in Turkic dialects and were in the military. That is not enough participation in creating and forming the culture to deserve the name "Turko-Persian Tradition" – This is misinformation. All the elements in that area, which have to do with tradition and culture, were drawn from the Iranian culture and the Islamic faith, not much Turkic elements (like shamanism, yurts etc.) were incorporated in. That is what makes the name "Turko-Persian" an imaginary one and therefore the entry should be deleted.</i></dd>

<p>Write it clear. Khuzestan used in Ka'aba Zardusht. Few texts that have sinus arabicus map also have Persian Gulf , but use Persian Gulf in their text. 80% were from Hondius which later on was revealed that he corrected it. The rest of the politics is not related as this is not a chat room. Also Ahwaz is not an Arabic word, it comes originally for Khuz (Elamite).--<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 15:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salam Ali</p>
<p>Would you please do me a favor? Apparently no member of Persian cinema wiki project is active. Then I would like to ask you to take a look at the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbas_Kiarostami_1c17.html" title="Abbas Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a>, an article that I am currently working on. I would like to have your comments to improve the article. Any helps will be very much appreciated. I have been really disappointed of so many negative feedbacks I recieved on my work on this page. Thanks a lot for your time. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 19:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You've just reverted a lot of work improving the English of the article, correcting links, bringing it into line with the manual of style, etc. It seems clear that you didn't look at what was happening before reverting, and that you've done so because asked to by <tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Surena</tt> (<span class="plainlinks">talk <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Surena_0541.html" title="Special:Contributions/Surena">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Surena_93e4.html" title="Special:Blockip/Surena">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>).

<p>Many thanks. (Re your edit summary, I have explained at the Talk page, though simple copy-editing doesn't normally require Talk-page notification.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 15:26, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your attempts to defend the article against the reverting.

<p>Hi Ali!</p>
<p>We need an article on <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavid_art.html" title="Safavid art">Safavid art</a>. Are you familiar with French? The French article is now a FA. I posted a translation request for that. In any case it would be good if you could either help in writing it or check it once in a while. Take care. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 18:17, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We need to have a proper template for history of art (perhaps similar to greater Iran template). I made some thing but obviously needs to be improved. What do you think about it? Do you know of a nicer photo? How should we make the list? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 18:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
