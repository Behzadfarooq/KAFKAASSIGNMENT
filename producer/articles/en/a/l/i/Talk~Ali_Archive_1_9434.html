<dd>Anon editor didn't explain, or sign, but I'm guessing that he/she feels that it's wrong to put up images as if they're to be worshipped. Is this another difference between Sunni and Shi'a? I know that many Muslims feel that ANY realistic art is wrong, but I didn't think that there were sectarian differences in the matter. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:40, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll butt in here again, if I may. I suspect that there might be some Shi'as as well that may feel uncomfortable with images of Ali or Mohammad or what have you. But the majority of the Shi'a have no problem with it. In fact, you can find typical paintings of Ali (like the one on our page) posing with his sword Zolfaqar while sitting next to a Lion, in almost every traditional home in Iran and Pakistan (if Shi'a). The Sunni however hold a different view on the matter. As you may have noticed and wondered, Mohammad, in fact has no tomb or shrine like we see for Ali or Husayn. He has that green domed mosque named after him in Medina. But that's not where he's buried. His grave is almost anonymous, whereas in Iran, you run into a highly adorned truquoise domed "Imam-zadeh" (son/daugther or grandson/granddaghter of one of the 12 Imams) almost every other mile. Sectarian differences I'd say. But then again, cultural aspects have an influence too.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 13:03, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recommend moving the picture down to the legacy section since... that is a modern rendition and definitely reflects how he is seen recently...

<p>I would like to say that I feel the comment about "almost every traditional home in Iran and Pakistan (if Shi'a)" has a painting of Ali in it is an incorrect generalization. I have never seen a painting or representation of Ali in any of the shia Pakistani or shia Iranian homes I've visited. I think it would be advisable to remove the picture or atleast move it doen to the legacy section. I don't think though that it should be included as many people feel it is disrespectful to show representations of Ali which may be historically inaccurate.--Zee 16:06 15 Jul 2005</p>
<p>Some people believe that showing pictures of Islamic figures is not right. So the picture might be offending those peoples and therefore it should be removed. For the same reason the holy Prophet Mohammad and Imam Ali were not shown by an actor in the film: 'The Message'. And like Zee said i my self have never seen a picture of any Imam or Prophet in a Shia home (except the ones in which the face is covered or light ('noor') is coming out of the face). --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhalid%21_ab0a.html" title="User:Khalid!">Khalid!</a> 19:35, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that there is no controversy. Al Sideeq (Abu Bakr) was the first male convert, it's quite famous. Also, Muawiyah I is the universally accepted fifth Caliph of Islam, not Hassan (by any stretch of the imagination). Rival claimants, like anti-popes, are not universally accepted. Such is the case of Hassan, who did not even seek the office, but is termed Caliph or Imaam by some Shi'a devotees. Similarly, from 929 onwards, the Umayyad Caliphs of Cordoba were not as accepted as the Abbasids of Baghdad, though claiming the title. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 19:27, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I seriously doubt this claim that Abu Bakr was first or second male convert to Islam. According to Ibn Ishaq, Abu Bakr was around 20th person to accept Islam. Were all previous 20 converts women? I suggest we remove that claim of being first convert. It's clearly disputed in some sources <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 19:36, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First Converts to Islam (consensus knowledge among both Sunni &amp; Shia scholars): 1) First women convert = Khadija w/o Prophet. Then the only wife of Prophet. 2) First child convert = Ali ibn Abi Talib. He lived under Prophet's guardianship. 3) First male adult convert = Abu Bakr Al Sideeq. Prophet's closest friend. These converts were also in the order as mentioned above. I am not sure if these were the first 3 converts.</p>

<p><a name="The_Sayyed_debate" id="The_Sayyed_debate"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Sayyed debate</span></h2>
<p>That sentence doesnt belong here. Based on the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Irrelevancy. Just because the word "Sunni" is mentioned in the article doesnt make Sunni opinions about Shias relevant inthis article. This page is about the Biography of Ali. Your claim should go on the "Sunni vs. Shia differences" page.</li>
<li>It is baised: The sentence is clearly promoting Sunnism by its "Not so in Sunni Islam" reference. If you insist it belongs here, then you must change its pro-Sunni tone.</li>
<li>It is inaccurate: If you still insist on keeping that, then you must also add the Shi'a answer to your claim. In the Shi'a view, as far as ordinary people, the "Sayyed" is only a nominal designation. Very similar to the British title of "Knighthood": It is only a title. Shias do not "enjoy special privileges" as you say, in their societies. It is only a designation for respect.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 23:11, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>It may well also apply to the Sunni Vs Shiaa page, but it is also an important distinction here. The readers will see that Shiaas use the Sayyed title, and they will wonder why not Sunnis, since the article states that Ali is a revered figure in both traditions. Nevertheless possible concern for promoting one way or the other is valid, and I rephrased accordingly. The nominal nature of the title is already evident, as I clearly used the wording <b>an honorary designation</b> form the outset. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:39, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Major revision</span></h2>
<p>This page has been through some severe upheavals -- I haven't even tracked them all, and I suspect that some useful material has been lost. In any case, I deleted a long duplicate para, broke huge swathes of text into more readable short paras, and re-organized into sections.</p>
<p>Someone added "info" that Sunnis don't honor descendents of Muhammad and don't recognize sayeds/sayyids. I suspect that this is wrong, but I'll hold judgement until I hear from the Muslim editors. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:53, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is correct. I have been in several Sunni Muslim countries; they do not recognize <i>sayeds</i>. The only exception, or sort of exception, it the <i>Sharif</i> title used by the Hashemite kings, as described in the article..</dd>
<dd>I just did a small revision, and I wanted to mention in Talk that I deleted the following sentence about caliph Uthman: "Most historical accounts agree that the aging and ailing Uthman had placed a great deal of trust in his kin and that they had used their positions of power to enrich themselves." I have never come across anything like this, but if I am wrong, please cite these several "historical accounts," and then return the sentence. It sounds very intruiging. Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 20:29, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word "Sayyed" <i>is</i> however used in Sunni countries as well to address dignitaries and royalties. For example, I remember seeing a mural in Damascus which read:</p>
<p>Gha'idina ilal abad, <b>Sayyid</b>ina Hafez Asad.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 20:38, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The word Sayyed was around before it was applied to the descendants of Ali. It means means Sir, Master, Lord, etc. So use for dignitaries is perfectly normal and completely unrelated to the Shiite title. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:09, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Exactly. That's why I said that Shi'as consider no "special privilidges" for Sayyeds like you claim. It is only a normal honorary title.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 17:28, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Sayyid as an <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjective.html" title="Adjective">adjective</a> is very different from the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorific.html" title="Honorific">Honorific</a> title, which may not entail tangible privileges, still is a distinction above other people. My point was that the word was available in the Arabic language before Islam, as an adjective. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 10:55, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sayyed though just an <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorific.html" title="Honorific">Honorific</a> title before Muhammad, henceforth, has invariably been used to refer to the lineage. The amount of reverence given to Sayyeds varies among Sunnis (i donot have any first hand knowledge about Shias), according to their cultures, from using names of Hasan &amp; Hussain in the Friday sermons, to celebrating birthdays of their progeny. --Syed.Atif.Hussain</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Respect due sharifs/sayyids</span></h2>
<p>After a great deal of fruitless googling, I found a source that stated that sharif and sayyid were simply two words for the same thing, in Arabic and Farsi respectively. Because Shiism is strongest in Iran, Shi'a naturally tend to use the Farsi word. Given that many Arabic rulers boast of being sharifs, I really can't agree that Sunni Muslims reject distinctions based on descent. The section on Muhammad's descendents in the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> article conflates sharifs and sayyids, and no one has objected. Therefore I changed this section of the article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:21, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I'm certainly open to correction on this, as an ignorant foreigner &lt;g&gt;. However, I think I can recognize sectarian wrangling when I see it. I didn't want to keep anything that overstated differences between Sunni and Shi'a. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:34, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the one lone link is testament enough that this is not reliable information. While Sharrif are somewhat of synonyms, they are not the same. Also, Sayyed is an <b>Arabic</b> word which made its way into Farsi and Urdu due to Quranic influence. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:13, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)and Sayeed</dd>

<p>I would like to correct Zora, Shiism is not strongest in Iran, correct it is around the area, but I need not remind you that Shiism is even stronger in Iraq, a arabic speaking nation. Secondly a Sayyed according to shia terminology if you will, is a title that implies direct relation to one of the 12 imams and consequently Ali ibn Abe Talib. You people need to wake up, with all due respect, many Sunnies to this day have issues with someone saying they're a sayyid, its like wow oh my no way, while they have no problem with calling King Hussein and his Son Sayyeeds... hmm I think we need to open our eyes a little wider, as far as AladdinSE, I'd like to ask you are you a linguest? Because you seem to like to talk as though you are, the pharasee word for sayyid is Agha.</p>
<hr />
<p>Given that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the statement that sayyid and sharif are synonyms has been included in the Muhammad article for months</li>
<li>ditto, statements re Muslims as a whole respecting descendents of Muhammad (which is not to say that they all share Shi'a beliefs)</li>
</ul>
<p>and that none of the Sunni editors have complained, I'm not sure that I understand your objections. Exactly HOW are sharif and sayyed different? I'm not an Arabic speaker -- are you? Is there anyone else here who is?</p>
<p>As for all your other reverts -- you seem to be really really attached to your prose, Aladdin, even when it's not the best English. For example -- your insistence on using the word "convoy" for the pilgrims. Convoy is usually used for vehicles, like trucks or ships travelling together, or for the physical act of protecting a gaggle of travellers and their vehicles ("We convoyed the trucks across the pass."). Using it for a party or band of pilgrims on foot, camels, or horses just plain gives the wrong image. Ditto for other constructions you've used -- they're verbose, circuitous, or misleading. Am I going to have to fight to modify each one, as you defend your ego and your prose to the death?</p>
<p>I don't think my prose is always perfect, and I've often been corrected by other editors. Usually I look at it and recognize that they've made the original wording clearer, simpler, or more precise. That's what we want in Wikipedia. Clear, simple, and precise. You don't get that by blindly reverting to your own version when anyone else makes an edit. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:35, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>This is not the Muhammad article, it's the Ali article.</li>
<li>Sunis respect respect Hasan and Huseyn, but I would not go so far as to say they respect all Sayyids to this day, certainly not in a religious sense. Sunni Sharifs on the other hand are not nearly as widespread as shia Sayyids, and are almost exclusively limited to royal dynasties. The respect they command is mostly political and regal. Also, you are mistaken in supposing there to be only Sunni and Shia editors. Some of us actually do strive for neutrality, and for all you know are not even Muslims. It's safer, not to mention much less presumptuous, not to make assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the second time where you have suspected that I am reverting some text because of some childish attachment to my own prose. Your example about the Pilgrim's convoy was not even mine, it was someone else's either in this article or copy-pasted from another Islam article, I forget. I simply judged it to be less cumbersome then its replacement. And no, convoy is not just for vehicles and trucks, you're thinking of <b>motorcade</b>. Convoy is any procession of traveling modes of transportation, be it camels or Benzes.</p>
<p>I have already responded some weeks or months ago to this rather condescending lecture about what is wanted in Wikipedia. If I was anything like you described, you many edits to my work would not have survived. I read it carefully, and some of your formulations were really cumbersome and confusing. Most importantly, I have <b>not</b> made any blind revert, that's a bit insulting. Please check the edit history. Several of your changes which I considered either superior or was ambivalent about, remain. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 06:36, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A new version of descendents section</span></h2>
<p>I rewrote the descendents section again. I hope this one will do. As to sharif/sayyid:</p>
<p>An official website for the kingdom of Jordon says:</p>
<p>Ali and Fatima had two sons: Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein. The direct descendants of their eldest son, Hassan, are known as “Sharifs” (nobles), while the descendants of Hussein are called “Sayyids” (lords). The royal family of Jordan, the Hashemites, is descended through the Sharifian branch of lineage.</p>
<p>Also that:</p>
<p>King Hussein’s branch of the Hashemite family ruled the holy city of Mecca from 1201 CE until 1925 CE.</p>
<p>The purpose here seems to be rank sharifs over sayyids. The Shi'a websites I've seen use sayyid or sayyed exclusively, not sharif. Did only the Sunni descendents use sharif?</p>
<p>It seems that there's some conflict over usage within the Muslim world, which is making it difficult to write a coherent account in this section. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:59, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Saudi royal family is Sunni, but they discourage the use of Sharifs because it is the title claimed by the Hashemits, the family the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Saud_0ea7.html" title="House of Saud">House of Saud</a> displaced in <a href="../../../n/a/j/Najd.html" title="Najd">Najd</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/j/Hejaz.html" title="Hejaz">Hejaz</a>. The version stated by the Jordanian website is technichally true though presented in a way most likely to enhance their claim to the old "Sherif of Mecaa" title that chagrins the Saudis so much. Also, in Sunni Arab countries, non-royal members of the population who claim some decent from Muhammad or Ali rarely go around inserting either of the honorific titles into their family names. Unlike Iran where notoriously many do, far more than is genealogically feasible, especially since Iranian stock is predominantly <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a> while Muhammad and Ali came from <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> Arab stock. In any case I made some slight modifications, mostly about Arabic meanings. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 05:30, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Mr./Ms. AlladinSE, I find it very intriguing that not only are you a linguist but apparently a geneticist. I need not remind AlladinSE that Islam has found its way to the FAR EAST primarily through marriage by Arab-Muslim Merchants. Food for thought my obviously hungry friend.</p>
<p>I'd like to say also that it's not only Royal families of the east who can claim descent from the family from Muhammad. Many average muslims, both Shia and Sunni, are descendents of Muhammad. Last names like Rizvi, Jaffary, Abedi, Mehdi, etc... indicate Seyyeds/descent from the Muhammed. --Zee 16:24, 16 Jul 2005</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed a section added by Zereshk</span></h2>
<p>While I've felt that the Islamic sections were sometimes too Sunni in emphasis, I don't think that going into the details of Sunni-Shi'a polemics in a <i>biographical</i> article is the right way to get this information into Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Zereshk (I hope that I've remembered your username correctly), how about we start an article called Creation of the caliphate -- or some such title, if you can think of a better one that is NPOV, do -- that is specifically focussed on the events surrounding the death of Muhammad and the elevation of the first caliph. That will give us space to really lay out all the arguments, for all sides. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:53, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dont think one paragraph would cause such an overflow. But if you insist on this, then you must take out other un-necessary details as well. The article is pro-Sunni as it is. Perhaps we should have a History of Shia vs. Sunni article as a title, and take everything there? Ive seen this topic on several pages, all with half-way and incomplete discussions. None of them, as you, are willing to give a full 50-50 treatment of the subject.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 21:20, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I'm not sure that the article is pro-Sunni (speaking as someone who is neither Sunni nor Shi'a). It seems to me that for every Sunni argument, there's a Shi'a one as well. Could you expand on why you think the article is biased?</p>
<p>As for the other articles -- yes, I agree, there is a whole <i>constellation</i> of biographical articles re well-known figures of early Islamic history in which the Shi'a point of view is represented only fitfully. The problem is that we are visiting the same events, over and over, and not doing so consistently. That is why it makes sense to have one article on the subject of the succession to the caliphate, which can then be linked to all the articles.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that it would make sense to have an article devoted entirely to Shi'a versus Sunni -- it would range widely and be extremely contentious -- but if you want to start it, we could see what happens. Perhaps it could then be broken up into separate articles, re separate points of disagreement. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:42, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The way this article is structured now, it first gives a Shi'a perspective, then gives a Sunni view <i>in reply to that Shi'a view</i>, and then moves on to something else. That's not very balanced, because it gives the impression of Sunni beliefs having an upperhand. An example was the recent <b>Sayyed</b> thing that Aladdin had going on. I had to step in to make him change the word "...Not so in Sunni Islam...", which is clearly promotionary. If youre going to mention the history at all, then you should do it in a fair satisfactory manner to both sides. Otherwise, I dont think the history of how the Caliphate was created should be mentioned at all. I'm not happy about this matter, considering that I provided solid documentation for the paragraph I put in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree we should create a specific page about this, but the title Creation of the caliphate seems a bit lacking. The viewer will be asking: "...which Caliphate?...Buwayhid?...Abbasid?....The Caliphate of Adam on Earth?...The Caliphate as Man as vice-regent of God?" The word "Caliphate" is just too general a thing. A more specific title would be suiting perhaps? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 22:01, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Ah, the old "last word" problem. If we give one para to the Sunni and one to the Shi'a, someone has to come first. Zereshk thinks that the Shi'a have too many firsts. That may be so. Perhaps we need to go over the article and make sure that the firsts are evenly split between Sunni and Shi'a.</p>
<p>It was solid documentation, but it unbalanced the article, making it somewhat pro-Shi'a and putting the emphasis less on Ali, the subject of the article, than on later disputes. That's why I think it deserves its own space.</p>
<p>For an article title, how about <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a>? That's a steal, actually, from a book by the scholar Wilferd Madelung. I just ordered the book and I'm looking forward to reading it; it's supposed to be a well-documented work that gives more space to Shi'a views than is usual in Western scholarship (which has relied heavily on Sunni sources). <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:32, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="POV" id="POV"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV</span></h2>
<p>Zora,</p>
<p>The title <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> is a good one. However, before we can transfer the discussion to there, this article has biases in favor of Sunnism, and therefore needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>I put the <b>POV</b> sign up to address the following specifics of the article. This list is in response to your request from me to point out the Sunni biases. They are:</p>
<p>1. The article keeps objectively using the word "Shura" to describe the decision of first caliphate. The Shi'as use the word "ijma" instead. The article makes no mention of this. There's a slight difference. Shura is a Quranic word. It therefore brings favoritism to the Sunni view, if used without its Shi'a counter equivalent.</p>
<p>2. The existence of a section on "Election of the Caliph" is problematic. It is written in a Sunni promotional way. Its treatment of the subject is inadequate. The Sunni argument has the upper hand, the way it is written: it apprears <i>after</i> the Shi'a argument, and in reply to it, and then moves on to something else, without any counter argument. If this is a biographical page, this section shouldnt even be here.</p>
<p>3. The article claims Qadir i Khumm as the only event Shi'as use to back themselves with. This is not true. Nothing is mentioned about Shi'a fundamental claims such as Hadith-i Thaqalayn or other similar hadith and events.</p>
<p>4. The statement "<i>These caliphs were elected by the elders of the Muslim community, some of the closest companions of the Prophet</i>" is portraying a Sunni perspective as fact. Shia's dont exactly believe the view presented by this statement. "elders"? Says who? "closest companions"? By whos standards? Many of the closest companions in fact were not there. "election"? Shi'as believe this "election" was not free and fair, even it was to be the basis of designating the Caliph.</p>
<p>5. The statement: "<i>All the surviving historical accounts were written long after the event, when the divisions between Sunni and Shi'a were already well-developed</i>." is cleverly POV, if not ambiguous and confusing in intention. There are entire schools of people devoted to studying the authenticity of hadiths. The timing of them is not an issue as long as the chain of transmission is illustared as sufficiently authentic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's POV -- it's the Western academic consensus. Hadith are not reliable as history. See Herbert Berg's <i>The Development of Exegesis in Early Islam</i> and Fred Donner's <i>Narratives of Islamic Origins</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statement is confusing because there is no clear conclusion drawn from it. e.g. Are you (in the article) implying that these sources were devoid of accuracy because of their timing? And if so, what would that matter, since it would apply to both Sunnis and Shia historians. What's the point?--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 15:27, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not that hadith are totally inaccurate, it's that they have to be used with extreme caution. They were fabricated for purposes of argumentation and isnads were inflated. Muslim and Bukhari cleaned out the worst, but Western historians don't even trust the sahih ones. Also, hadith, even when relatively sound, are an accumulation of the POVs of everyone through whom they passed. At least when you have a dated manuscript, or an archaelogical dig, you have evidence that someone, at a certain date, wrote X, or did Y, or made Z. X may be biased, but you DO know that X was believed by someone at that time. That's a fact. Something solid to hold onto. Whereas when you have A reporting that B said that C said that D said that X, you don't REALLY know that D said X.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The Berg book is interesting because he did an experiment. He assembled all the hadith supposed to come from Muhammad's uncle mumble-mumble-Abbas, the progenitor of the Abbasids, to see if they presented a clear picture of what Abbas knew and believed. Nope. The hadith were all over the place. Berg concluded that controversialists of the time when the hadith were first written down had manufactured hadith to support their positions, and had sourced them to Abbas because as the "founder" of the new line of caliphs, he was considered an exceptionally reliable source. From a historical POV, hadith evidence is suspect until it's written down, in a manuscript we can date, at which point there's something firm.</dd>

<dd>Your point is duly noted. However:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We are not here to judge what people believe in. We are only here to report them. Whether or not you think Ahadith are fabrications is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Like I said, there are entire schools and universities and thousands of scholars and historians that spend their entire resources on verifying the authenticity of Ahadith. It's an entire field of Islamic study. You and I are absolutely in no position to call Ahadith "fabrication"s.</li>
<li>Besides, the way you have that sentence in the text going, it works in favor of Sunnis, because it implies that Hadiths like Qadir Khumm (central to Shi'a belief) are questionable. Which is why I put it on my POV list in the first place.</li>
<li><i><b>My solution to item 5</b></i>: Clarify that statement. But make sure it stays impartial, by clearly mentioning your intention of making that statement.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 18:59, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Shi'a polemicists in fact rely extensively on numerous Sunni documentation in their arguments. Tabari may have lived long after these events, but he was a Sunni. Ghadir i Khumm, for example, has been transmitted by more than 100 of the companions of the prophet, and has been recounted by numerous chains of transmission, <i>both Sunni and Shia</i>.</p>
<p>6. The statement: "<i>They agree in saying that...there was much debate as to the proper way to proceed</i>". In fact, Shi'as contend that there was no real debate at all, and that the elections were in fact fait accompli.</p>
<p>7. The statement: "Hasan is said to have renounced any claim to the caliphate to prevent further bloodshed among Muslims. Muawiyah I thus became the undisputed caliph and established the Umayyad dynasty of caliphs." Not exactly the Shi'a version.</p>

<p>Zereshk, I just noticed and deleted your "sources used" section. It is completely useless to 99.99% of the Wikipedia users, who speak English and not Arabic. I agree that the article could use some links to solid academic web pages (not Shi'a or Sunni proselytizing sites, I should hope) and a list of books to read.

In the academic works I read, hadith is usually singular plus plural. Ahadith is never used. You really can't lay down the law and insist that English follow Arabic rules. English has, I believe, the largest vocabulary of any language and much of that vocabulary is <i>pilfered</i> from other languages. Once pilfered, it generally follows English grammatical rules. Note that I wasn't the one who decided the way it would work in this case -- it's the general English usage.</dd>

<p>Um, as to questioning the hadith being directed at Shi'a -- I don't think so. It affects the Sunni case as much as it does the Shi'a. Speaking as an outsider, <b>I don't think any of the Qur'an verses cited by either side decide the matter.</b> It's a matter of interpretation, or a tradition about the occasion of the revelation, which have the same problems as the hadith. I believe that reliably dated documents from the very early Islamic period are few and far between, and don't touch on these issues. So it really comes down to a question of weighing oral traditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Zora, please understand. YOU are not in a position to arbitrate or decide whether or not Shi'as or Sunnis are correct in using what Quranic verses they use. You dont even know what they mean, the stories behind them, and why are they used: As you said yourself, you are an outsider. I, on the other hand, am merely reporting on what Shi'as declare to believe. Not on what I believe what they should believe. Judging the fidelity and veracity of their documents is not my concern.</li>
<li>You say: "I believe that reliably dated documents from the very early Islamic period are few and far between, and don't touch on these issues." I can confidently inform you that both Sunnis and Shi'as would strongly disagree, in fact ignore you on this matter. Hadith is a <b>fundamental</b> pillar used in Islam. That you think it isnt academic or not worthy of using is your personal opinion (right or wrong) that doesnt matter here. It's like me telling someone to ignore The Gospels in writing about Christianity, because it was probably largely fabricated. Now how silly is that? I hope you see that you are clearly trying to impose your views here. You are totally ignoring what Shia's believe, and instead referring to some western research and author to discuss Shi'as top Imam.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 01:07, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Donner talks about this in his book. I need to look at the book again, but if I recall correctly, Donner points out that historians can use even biased, polemic, conflicting oral traditions if they ask themselves "How would I go about fabricating a tradition that people would believe?" You make it convincing by mixing "what everyone knows" with the point you want to make. Then the historian can look at the conflicting traditions and try to figure out what they have in common, and that will be the "what everyone knows" that is the start of the argument. This may not be what REALLY happened (what we could see if we could use a time machine to go back and observe and tape events), but it might move historians closer to it. If everyone, Sunni and Shi'a, agrees that Muhammad had a wife named Aisha, whatever else they say about Aisha, it is indeed very likely that he had a wife named Aisha.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK. Heres a solution. In different sections:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Report what Shia's say (impartially and despite YOUR and Donner's beliefs).</li>
<li>Report what Sunnis say (impartially and despite YOUR and Donner's beliefs).</li>
<li>Report what some westerner like Donner thinks about Ali without making any judgements on the beliefs of Shias and Sunnis.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 01:07, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>So I'm not saying that hadith can't be used, I'm saying that they have to be used with caution. Myself, I don't know who they support, Sunni or Shi'a. Perhaps I'll have a better idea when I get and read Madelung's book.

<p>We're moving far afield, but ... the fact that people have invested lots of time and effort in something doesn't mean that it's true. Vide alchemy, or phrenology. Simply saying, "You aren't Muslim, you wouldn't understand", isn't a sufficient refutation. Complete infidels ought to be able to look at the "evidence" and draw the same <i>historical</i> conclusions. Scientists have to be able to demonstrate cold fusion outside one laboratory. The proponents didn't get to say, "You don't believe in cold fusion, that's why your experiments failed".</p>
<dl>
<dd>When you write an article on <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> in an encyclopedia, you dont write about whether you think Alchemy is acceptable or dismissable. You write about what it was about, what were its goals, and who studied it and when. You simply <i><b>report</b></i> it. Now u can also say that it isnt practiced as a science anymore. But you cannot judge it subjectively. And there is good reason for that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Look, it seems I am unable to get through to you. You seem unable to accept what muslims say about their own religion Islam. (!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me re-iterate on more time: In studying Islam, the history of Islam, the philosophy of Islam, and its protagonists,,, studying Hadith is an extremely well established method. Ignoring hadith in an article like this only academically discredits it, because many of the <i><b>fundamentals</b></i> of Shi'a and Sunni thought are derived from Hadith.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no room for debate here. There are literally hundreds of books that rank hadiths according to strength of chains of transmission. And when I mention Hadith-i Thaqalayn or Hadith-i Qadir-i Khumm or some other Hadith, it is accepted beyond doubt, by both communities. You are not in a position to declare whether <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabari.html" title="Tabari">Tabari</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Jahiz_12e9.html" title="Al-Jahiz">Al-Jahiz</a> or whoever else is an accredited historian or not.</dd>

<dd>Zereshk, I'm NOT saying that I've got the final word on whether or not a certain hadith is trustworthy -- I'm saying that you can't just trot one out and I'll agree that that's what happened. I've read some hadith, I've read lots of books about hadith, and I regard them as slippery material. Perhaps part of the problem is that you're used to a particularily Muslim style of argumentation, in which you heap hadith on the head of an opponent; both you and the opponent are operating with certain shared assumptions about the value of the hadith, which hadith are better than others, etc. Like fundamentalist Christians arguing about something by hurling Bible quotations at each other. But if you're talking to someone who doesn't share the same assumptions -- a non-Muslim, or a non-Christian -- an appeal to hadith, Qur'an, the Bible, whatever, is a failed argumentative ploy. The response is "so what?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>I probably know more about Islam than most Western non-Muslims, thanks to all the reading I've been doing for the last few years, but my hadith knowledge is limited to browsing in Bukhari, and knowing that Bukhari and Muslim are considered sahih by the Sunni.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, Shahih-i Bukhari is just one of 150 or so major writers of that period. "Hadith"-ologists study the authenticity of a Hadith based on many factors.</dd>
<dd>Second, I also think Sahih Bukhari is weak in its authnticity. But I dont care. Because if that's what the Sunni think, then that's what they think. And I will merely report that.</dd>
<dd>Thrid, to ignore hadiths is to ignore the history altogether; almost everything we know from that period comes from people who also wrote these Hadiths. For example, Tabari was a historian, and Hadiths are merely extracted from what he recounts from early Islam. There were no western historians in Hijaz or Mesopotamia at the time.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 20:36, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So when you triumphantly quote something and add an Arabic title I don't know, I can't really evaluate your quote. Is this a Sunni source? Some collection of Shi'a hadith? If I don't get it, consider how opaque it is to the average reader who is using Wikipedia to learn more about Islam.</p>

<dd>True. But deleting and not mentioning Hadiths from the ignorant will actually keep the ignorant, more ignorant about islam, because muslims extensively use hadith in their arguments whether you like it or not. Without Hadith, Shi'a or Sunnis dont have ANY justification and basis in their arguments. How are you going to justify or explain that Mohammad went up to Heaven from Jerusalem, or that he was visited in a cave by Gabriel, or that he performed miracles? By scientific justification? Or maybe by Donner's writings? Please. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 20:33, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This has nothing to do with the <i>spiritual</i> efficacy or relevance of a belief. As a Buddhist, I'm aware that most of the stories about the Sixth Patriarch are pious fabrications.

<p>Zereshk says he (I'm assuming "he" -- tell me if I'm wrong) doesn't care what I think, the reader will go his/her library, read the quoted works, make up his/her own mind. Zereshk, the quoted works probably don't exist in libraries in most Western cities and schools. They haven't been translated, or if they've been translated, they aren't part of the library collection. Telling people to go to the websites and explore is not all that helpful. I have no particular reason to trust any of the websites to which you link. They all seem to be Iranian Shi'a sites in Qom, right?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Qom is clearly the center of Shi'a religious studies at the present time. Traditionally Najaf is #1, making Qom #2, but the current political situation has made Qom the #1 center of Shi'a scholarship during the past 20 years. Besides, anything that is published in Najaf, makes its way to Qom anyway. There is total consensus between Qom, Mash-had, and Najaf on these issues. So if you care what Shi'as have to say about <b>their</b> leader, you will listen to them.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 23:48, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not ignoring it, dang it, I'm saying that if you insist that all discussion and presentation be on YOUR terms, you're failing to communicate. If you're going to cite references, you need to link to them, or cite them Western academic style. Information about their significance helps. Frex, I have a copy of the Sirat Rasulallah translated into English, and when I cite something from Ibn Ishaq, I'll usually say something like "earliest surviving biography of Muhammad, as translated by Guillaume". If I'm careful, I'll put the book with the ISBN number in a references section. That way, anyone who doubts me can buy the book and check out the citation. There's a 20-volume translation of Tabari, too, though it's not in any local libraries and I can't afford a copy. But at least it exists. Bukhari and Muslim are available on the net in English translation. But you're not telling us anything about all the Shi'a material you're citing. Where is it? Is it translated? When was it written?

<li>Just FYI, Actually if you look at the page <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a>, the word ahadith is used further down in the article again. In English text. Lets just agree to disagree here. At least now you know what ahadith means anyway.</li>
<li>The documentation thingy applies to Ali's article as well, because it expalins why Shi'as think Ali (their Imam) was not the fourth caliph, but was in fact the first one.</li>
<li><i><b>All</b></i> the documentation, ideas, and claims I cited thus far has been quoted, used, and mentioned from American textbooks in fact: Most come from "Shi'te Islam" by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allameh_Tabatabaei_b459.html" title="Allameh Tabatabaei">Allameh Tabatabaei</a>, edited and forward by <a href="../../../s/e/y/Seyyed_Hossein_Nasr_134c.html" title="Seyyed Hossein Nasr">Seyyed Hossein Nasr</a>, PhD Harvard, published by <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_University_of_New_York_41c3.html" title="State University of New York">State University of New York</a> Press, 1979.

<li>For the nth time, this article is not about whether Hadiths are academically acceptable or not. I suggest you write that stuff on a page called Why Islam is full of nonesense based on the FACT that there's no scientific evidence to back up anything it claims, including Mohammad's Miraj, his visit by Gabriel, and the Shi'a claim that Ali is their Imam and first caliph. Heck, even God's existence is as much proven as Cold Fusion.</li>

<p>Yes. You <i><b>are</b></i> simply preventing and withholding info about why and on what basis Shi'as beleive in what they beleive about ALI. merely because they dont have any <i>western</i> academic backing.</p>

But I did my best to remove things to which Shi'a would object, <i>without</i> putting in their place anything to which I, as a non-Muslim and a non-Shi'a, would object. You just reverted, without engaging any of the changes. OK, to take just one change. The old article had "Election of the Caliph". After reading Madelung, I no longer believe that Saqifah was an election -- it was a muddle, which ended up with some of the men on Abu Bakr's side beating up one of the Ansar. The ummah as a whole was not consulted, there was no council of elders, there was simply ... a shouting match. So putting "Election" in the heading is a Sunni POV in itself. I'm not sure that the title I put in its place was the best -- I really agonized over it -- but at least it didn't take sides. And so on. I made the changes I made with the intent of being neutral, based on Zereshk's input and the reading that I've been doing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:41, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora, please remember that one book does not an international consensus make. The contested American election in 2000 was a HUGE shouting match and had accusations of misconduct that makes the Caliphal election look like a walk in the park, that doesn't mean we can go around declaring that it wasn't really an election. International consensus clearly describes the first four caliphs as elected. You can certainly include a caveat that so and so scholar(s) think this and that, but not change the fundamental nature of accepted history because you read a book. I think your concerns are often a boon to NPOV and neutrality, but I am concerned that you are allowing yourself to be bullied by certain editors. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 07:48, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the Madelung book is highly regarded, even by academics of different views. I've been printing out course outlines and bibliographies for college Islamic history courses and Madelung shows up on all of them. Of course I'm just full of enthusiasm for it right now, and I'll probably cool down later, but -- I'd trust him when he says that Saqifah was nothing like an "election". Abu Bakr and his friends heard that the Ansar were discussing setting up their own ruler, rushed over the meeting, and proposed Abu Bakr as the new leader. Ali wasn't there; most of the companions weren't there; it wasn't planned or announced. It was a rowdy back-room deal, and it wasn't accepted immediately. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:32, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's one version, but most important of all, <b>Ali himself</b> accepted it, and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, and the next two elected caliphs. He then used the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shura.html" title="Shura">Shura</a> system to assume office himself, based on election and never once advancing any divine right to rule. These facts clearly legitimize the succession of the first four caliphs. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 14:49, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ali took six months to "accept" the outcome, and that was only after all sorts of pressure (short of actual violence) had been brought to bear on the Rafidi. As for the "election" of Umar -- Abu Bakr selected him, he wasn't elected. Umar did set up an election to pick his successor, but he himself selected the electors. As for the "election" of Ali -- that was a mob, which had just killed the previous caliph, forcing the office upon him. Only the choice of Uthman could be described as anything even like an election, and it's a sad excuse for an election when the electors are chosen by fiat. As Madelung points out, it's interesting that Uthman seems to have taken the comparative regularity of his election as a justification for assuming all the prerogatives of a "king", which drove his "subjects" into revolt. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 17:45, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora, we're talking the seventh century here. Of course there was violence and mayhem. In some respects I've seen worse during <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2000_85ca.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2000">Bush V. Gore</a>. That Ali was quite anxious to rule is evident. 6 months or 6 years, he still accepted and swore allegiance. Also, Abu Bak did <i>not</i> appoint <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar_ibn_al-Khattab_e197.html" title="Umar ibn al-Khattab">Umar</a>, he nominated him. He was elected thereafter by the elders and sahaba. Abu Bakr was revered and his nomination carries enormous weight. That does not mean Abu Bakr appointed Umar. Also, please remember that you are reading one book, do not accept it as gospel, and remember that it is what is internationally regarded as scholarly consensus which has to guide us. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 22:55, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ive read the "revision". These problems still need to be addressed:</p>
<p>1. The article still uses the pro-Sunni word "Shura" to describe the decision of first caliphate, without ever mentioning the equivalent Shi'a word of "ijma" anywhere. There's a slight but crucial difference.</p>
<p>2. The word "Election" is still used objectively in the article to describe the first Caliph's coming to power. It titles a section.</p>
<p>3. The article claims Qadir i Khumm as the only event Shi'as use to back themselves with. This is not true. Nothing is mentioned about Shi'a fundamental claims such as Hadith-i Thaqalayn or other similar hadith and events.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another attempt</span></h2>
<p>I haven't completely de-Sunnified the article, or so it seems to me, but I have changed a few things. Instead of referring to Abu Bakr's election, I've referred to his succession. I've changed wording that suggested that Hassan ibn Ali <i>renounced</i> the caliphate and said that he refrained from publicly advancing his claims to it. I don't think Shi'a would agree that he did renounce it, or that he could have renounced it, since in their opinion, he was imam by God's will. I've removed a bit re Ali being Abu Bakr's closest advisor -- Madelung says that this is Sunni propaganda. Abu Bakr distrusted him to an extent, and kept him at arm's length. Ali, however, did not intrigue against Abu Bakr. All this could be argued at length, but it seems easiest to delete the questionable claim.</p>
<p>Someone changed the bit re the Hashemites to include other "royal families". I tweaked that a bit and removed the "praise be upon him".

<p>It was abvious that with that Nahj al-balagha referens you wanted to covertly claim that Ali does not like shias. That is not the case. I do agree with the statement you quoted, and in my POV it is obviously talking about people that deidyfie Ali, like the alawis.</p>
<p>If you insist in qouting that part of Nahj al-Balagha, then also quote this part to balance the POV:</p>
<p>Beware! By Allah the son of Abu Quhafah (Abu Bakr)[2] dressed himself with it (the caliphate) and <b>he <i>certainly</i> knew</b> that my position in relation to it was the same as the position of the axis in relation to the hand-mill. The flood water flows down from me and <b>the bird <i>cannot</i> fly upto me</b>. I put a curtain against the caliphate and kept myself detached from it.</p>
<p>Then I began to think whether <b>I should <i>assault</i> or endure</b> calmly the blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the grown up are made feeble and the young grow old and the true believer acts under strain till he meets Allah (on his death). I found that endurance thereon was wiser. So I adopted patience <b>although there was pricking in the eye and suffocation (of mortification) in the throat</b>. <b>I watched the <i>plundering</i> of my inheritance till the first one went his way <i>but</i> handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after himself</b>.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://al-islam.org/nahj/default.asp?url=3.htm" class="external text" title="http://al-islam.org/nahj/default.asp?url=3.htm" rel="nofollow">ref</a>)</p>
<p>Here is the rest, i add it for your education:</p>
<p><br />
It is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from the caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death. No doubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves. This one put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty and the touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and so also the excuses therefore. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel. If he pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let it loose he would be thrown. Consequently, by Allah people got involved in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I remained patient despite length of period and stiffness of trial, till when he went his way (of death) he put the matter (of Caliphate) in a group[4] and regarded me to be one of them. But good Heavens! what had I to do with this "consultation"? Where was any doubt about me with regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin to these ones? But I remained low when they were low and flew high when they flew high. One of them turned against me because of his hatred and the other got inclined the other way due to his in-law relationship and this thing and that thing, till the third man of these people stood up with heaving breasts between his dung and fodder. With him his children of his grand-father, (Umayyah) also stood up swallowing up Allah's wealth[5] like a camel devouring the foliage of spring, till his rope broke down, his actions finished him and his gluttony brought him down prostrate.</p>
<p>At that moment, nothing took me by surprise, but the crowd of people rushing to me. It advanced towards me from every side like the mane of the hyena so much so that Hasan and Husayn were getting crushed and both the ends of my shoulder garment were torn. They collected around me like the herd of sheep and goats. When I took up the reins of government one party broke away and another turned disobedient while the rest began acting wrongfully as if they had not heard the word of Allah saying:</p>
<p>That abode in the hereafter, We assign it for those who intend not to exult themselves in the earth, nor (to make) mischief (therein); and the end is (best) for the pious ones.</p>
<p>(Qur'an, 28:83)</p>
<p>Yes, by Allah, they had heard it and understood it but the world appeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them. Behold, by Him who split the grain (to grow) and created living beings, if people had not come to me and supporters had not exhausted the argument and if there had been no pledge of Allah with the learned to the effect that they should not acquiesce in the gluttony of the oppressor and the hunger of the oppressed I would have cast the rope of Caliphate on its own shoulders, and would have given the last one the same treatment as to the first one. Then you would have seen that in my view this world of yours is no better than the sneezing of a goat.</p>
<p>(It is said that when Amir al-mu'minin reached here in his sermon a man of Iraq stood up and handed him over a writing. Amir al-mu'minin began looking at it, when Ibn `Abbas said, "O' Amir al-mu'minin, I wish you resumed your Sermon from where you broke it." Thereupon he replied, "O' Ibn `Abbas it was like the foam of a Camel which gushed out but subsided." Ibn `Abbas says that he never grieved over any utterance as he did over this one because Amir al-mu'minin could not finish it as he wished to.)</p>
<p><br />
So, if you want to give some sunni POV ref from Nahj, then dont forget to bring this one to.</p>

<dd>I added that list, (hey what's with the anon title!&#160;;-) ) but unfortunately I have not been able to find a list that names all his children. It was, more than anything, a stub. What I'd liked to have happen was that each child could be listed (birth info if available) and to which mother s/he belonged to. I like the idea of listing all his descendants to his grand children.

<p>No, Striver, you did more than that. You tried to Shi'a-fy the article again. I tried to keep the writeup neutral and refer readers to the whole dang article created for the controversy, and you split the article into a Sunni version (a few sentences) and a Shi'a version (paragraphs and paragraphs). The imbalance is highly POV. You added incoherent prose glorifying Ali as a warrior. This is not your vanity page! This is not a Shi'a sermon! You are creating hours and hours of extra work for people who have to follow behind you and clean up your excrable prose. Yes, I'm being harsh, but nothing else seems to penetrate. You cannot write grammatical English and you have no concept of NPOV. This does not reflect well on the Shi'a!

<dd>No, it is not better. Moving all the stuff I wrote into the "Sunni" section is simply wrong. I'm not a Sunni. I am trying hard not to take a Sunni POV. I do not represent Sunnis.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversies in biography articles</span></h2>
<p>Striver, a biography of Ali is not the right place to rehearse all the grievances of the Shi'a. You keep repeating the same litany of accusation and spite in dozens of early Islamic biographical articles. This is excessive. All we need is ONE article on the disputed succession, where all the minutest details can be discussed, and then we can link to it from all the articles to which it is relevant. Work on the Succession article, don't attack all the bios. The Succession article needs work, I know. I need to pull out my Madelung and get to work.</p>
<p>I think you'd like the Madelung book if you read it. The author is a non-Muslim academic, and he tended to accept the Sunni account of things when he started working on his book on the disputed succession. By the end of the book, he's come down basically on the Shi'a side. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 5 July 2005 15:25 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, i acctaly hoped that you would say that. I dont know i you remeber, but a while ago i did a "Muhammds inheritance and the land of fadak" and a "Ali opposed Abu Bakr", but they became deleted. Seems like its time to do something like that again, give all disputed issues that involve several people their own articl, insted of repeating it all over the place. Note that i dont intent do use those article names again.</p>

<dd>It's special pleading. Those of us who are not Muslims regard a career of theft and conquest as repugnant. If you want to try to make a case that theft is OK, I'll argue against it. Otherwise we can just leave it as stated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you've been raised as a Muslim, reading all the triumphant accounts of conquest, then it all seems natural and right. Those of us who weren't so raised will think of the feelings of those whose caravans were robbed, whose families were killed, who were sold into slavery, etc. I'm willing to leave all that aside for the purposes of the biography, but I'm not going to let it be excused and glorified.</dd>

<p>But had Mecca declared war on the Muslims? The Muslims were now hundreds of miles away. They could have just left the Meccans alone, and then the Meccans would have left them alone. As for "it's OK to raid commerce" -- why? You think it's OK to steal from someone you don't like? You think that a "cause" justifies stealing? Radical groups in the US, like the SLA, robbed banks, saying that it was part of their <i>war</i> against the system. The IRA robs banks. The Chinese Triads said that they were warring against the Manchus, and turned into nothing more than gangsters. Look, I'm not trying to drag this into the article. I'm not accusing Ali of banditry. I understand that by the standards of his time, caravan raiding was no big deal. Wars of conquest and slavery were no big deal. I'm not going to try to indict him by the standards of later times -- but I'm not going to try to whitewash things so that they look <i>nice</i> by later standards either. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 6 July 2005 01:05 (UTC)</p>

As for Meccan declaring war on the muslim, they did that when they sent a assassination squad on their leader. Of course they did not send a formal declaration of war, with a timestamp from the mail.</p>

<p>Further, your examples are not valid, since its not equated with what muslims whent thrue.</p>
<ul>
<li>SLA did not have their leader undergo a conspiracy of death through a group of assassins. Further, they did not have any political aim, rather just a lame excuse to behave badly:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>In reality, however, the SLA was nothing more or less than a criminal gang. Its principal activities were murder, bank robbery and kidnapping. It never had more than a dozen members, and is not known to have participated in any political activity. (<a href="http://presslord.com/kclowns.htm" class="external text" title="http://presslord.com/kclowns.htm" rel="nofollow">ref</a>)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>the IRA robbing banks is not endorsable, since their counterparts where intrested in a peace proces. Mecca never even implied that Muhammad was entitled to peace. Unless you have a source that says otherwise. They rather kept going with a culture that endorsed the killing of daghters.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The IRA is facing fresh questions about its commitment to the peace process after an official report said that it was still involved in paramilitary and criminal activity, including the recruitment and training of new members. ([The IRA is facing fresh questions about its commitment to the peace process after an official report said that it was still involved in paramilitary and criminal activity, including the recruitment and training of new members. ref])</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The triad indulged in "Such activities include drug trafficking, money laundering, illegal gambling, prostitution, car theft and other forms of racketeering. " which makes it obvious that they where not intrested in a legitimal and uppright goals. Did Muhmmad (as) endorse such things? no, he reveled the prohibition of alcohol, banning of money interest, sever punishment for fornification and stealing.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yabbut, the Triads <i>originally</i> started as resistance groups to the Manchu invasion, just as the IRA was a protest against the English conquest and occupation of Ireland.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Born in the Kaaba</span></h2>
<p>Shaneabbas added a sentence to the effect that Ali was born inside the Kaaba. I seen this story elsewhere, but I have never read it in any reliable source. It seems to be a pious folktale.</p>
<p>I recently set up an article called <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_veneration_for_Muhammad_273c.html" title="Islam and veneration for Muhammad">Islam and veneration for Muhammad</a> to hold such material for Muhammad -- there's a great deal of pious folklore about Muhammad, or folk practices venerating Muhammad. Since this is also true of Ali, how about setting up an article called Shi'a Islam and veneration for Ali? That could be linked to both this article and the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> article. The "born in the Kaaba" story would be relevant there. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 6 July 2005 23:51 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, sunnis also claim that somebody was born in the kaba, but they cant agree on whom:</p>
<p>You can read a bit more about it here:</p>
<p><i>Fatimah bint Asad was circumbulating the Ka'ba when she was carrying Ali (a.s.). The wall of Ka'ba cracked to create an opening and she entered it to give birth to Ali (a.s.). Al-Mustadrak 3:483.</i></p>
<p><i>no when they put the cloth up, u can still see the crack. I have seen it, its on the opposite side of hajr-e-asvad, you can see it when we are doing tawaf,</i></p>
<p><i>apparently the wahabis try to fill the crack up but it no matter what they do the crack still shows up! if abu bakr or umar were born there they would have put a sign post there!!</i></p>
<p><i>Well I am a Sunni and u said that our Imam Ali as.gif and our HAzrat Ali ra.gif born in holy Kaba... It is right and it shows the dignity of Ali ra.gif</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>Maybe you have never been there. Ask anybody who has been there. And the crack is still very visible.</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>Does it really matter if the crack was there or not? I personally spoke to many Saudi Shias who say that the Wahabi establishment used zinc to cover up the crack since that area keeps on breaking mysteriously - so some are claiming that Allah wants this miracle to live on even if the actual building was destroyed twice in history (after the birth of Imam Ali). Be this a miracle or not is a matter of personal opinion unless some photographs can be presented.</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>fortunately it is still there. When they put the covers up, and you are doing tawaf, many people go and do masah of it. and lukily for me, out of the 100 times i went 50% of the covers were up</i></p>
<p><i>^ ok guys I remember once getting an email which had pictures of the crack, i would see if i still have the email saved I would put the pictures here ( but dont count on that though)</i></p>
<p><i>Hazrat Ali razialahutalaanho He is the personality who given the name sherekhudafrom ALLAH.And he is the personality who won the battel of khaiber,and took the roots off that door called darekhaibar.And he has one more speciality that is he accept islaam in his childhood. He was born in the KABA&gt; (<a href="http://madeena.s5.com/custom.html" class="external text" title="http://madeena.s5.com/custom.html" rel="nofollow">sunni site</a>)</i></p>
<p><i>History has recorded that he is the only person who was born inside the Kabah itself.: HAKIM IBN HAZM</i></p>

Zora, both Shia and Sunnis agree that somebody was born in the Ka'bah. Nobody says that nobody was ever born in the Ka'ba. Remmeber the number of Sahaba thing?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aladdin's edits</span></h2>
<p>Aladdin, some of your edits reverse the Shi'a bias that Striver has been trying to enforce. However, you are pushing hard to introduce Sunni bias. You want to state as fact some matters that Shi'a dispute. You relly need to step back and allow different views to be stated.</p>
<p>As to Saqifah, shura, all that -- I strongly recommend that you read Wilferd Madelung's book, <i>The Succession to Muhammad</i>. The author is apparently not a Muslim, is a Professor at Oxford, and knows the primary sources inside out. He says that Saqifah was not a meeting that had been properly announced, to which the whole community had been invited. It was an impromptu matter. Someone came to Abu Bakr and Umar, and announced that the Ansar were already meeting, without any Muhajirun present, to decide whom they would support as the new leader of the community. It seemed that the whole community might fall apart if the Ansar were allowed to elect a leader without any Muhajirun input. Abu Bakr and Umar rushed off to prevent any decision, and apparently made an impromptu move, entirely on their own initiative, to advance Abu Bakr as the new leader. Was this fair? Ali and all the Banu Hashim were still preparing Muhammad's body for burial and were effectively shut out of the decision. However, Madelung says, an ugly and contentious several months followed, during which Abu Bakr and Umar campaigned to line up support from the Muslim community, and Ali and his Rafidi held out against the pressure -- which was sometimes violent. That is, Abu Bakr apparently didn't feel that he could truly be leader without consensus and allegiance from <i>everyone</i>, including Ali. So it could be said that shura was followed, in a rough way that wouldn't meet current UN guidelines for fair elections &lt;g&gt;. It could also be argued that if Abu Bakr hadn't done what he did, the community might have dissolved right then and there.</p>
<p>Madelung is not necessarily the TRUTH -- though every historian I've read speaks highly of the work -- but I think he's reconstructed what might have happened in a fairly NPOV way. You can use Madelung to make an argument that Abu Bakr did the right thing -- but it's going to be a more complex and sophisticated Sunni argument than just saying that Abu Bakr was elected by shura and anyone who objected was a bad loser.</p>
<p>Statements that Ali fully supported the first three caliphs are also highly POV. Shi'a say that he kept his distance from the caliphs, and simply refrained from publicly challenging them. Madelung tends to support the latter version (p. 54 of his book). Insisting on Ali's willing and enthusiastic support is Sunni POV.</p>
<p>I have been doing LOTS of reading since I first started working on these issues. I think I have a better grasp on the Shi'a viewpoint and the complexities of the primary sources. Let's try to present an account that respects the complexity. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 8 July 2005 09:33 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aladdin, are you saying that Ali was there at the gathering at Saqifah? If not, what do you make of all the evidence that the decision was made there? See Guillaume's translation of Ibn Ishaq, p. 683.</p>
<p>Why do you insist on saying that Ali supported the previous caliphs when the Shi'a deny it, and when reputable academic sources say that there was considerable distrust between Ali and the other leaders? They didn't forget that he had opposed Abu Bakr for a long time.</p>

<dd>Only <i>abi</i> is correct in his name. <i>Abu</i> is the nominative form before a noun; <i>abi</i> the genitive form. In this case the name is <i>ibn Abi Talib</i>, hence <i>ab</i> is in the genitive. <i>Abu</i> would be quite wrong here. In the case of names like Abu Ammar, Abu Jihad, Abu Leila, there is nothing before them to put them in the genitive.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Titles</span></h2>
<p>Sunni's accepts the titles of Amir-ul-Momineen given to the 'Khalifa-ur-Rashidin'. They also accepts that Ali was 'Lion of God' + Abu Turab: from suuni website: The Prophet (peace be on him) loved Ali dearly and called him by many fond names. Once the Prophet found him sleeping in the dust. He brushed off Ali's clothes and said fondly, "Wake up, Abu Turab (Father of Dust)." The Prophet also gave him the title of 'Asadullah' ('Lion of God'). ([www.muslimaccess.com/sunnah/sahabah/Ali.htm])</p>
<dl>
<dd>Leader of the Faithful really shouldn't be in the list, as it was born by all the caliphs. In fact, it was used in preference to caliph until the Umayyads, or so I gather. The Abu Turab story is also found in Ibn Ishaq, but with a different emphasis -- Muhammad is supposed to have said that when he saw Ali with dust in his hair, he knew he'd been quarreling with Fatima, and putting dust on his head to show his repentance. The Lion of God title is used by Sunnis, that's a good cite -- but what about the other, untranslated titles? They should really be translated and cited if Sunni. I strongly suspect that there are titles that the Shi'a use that the Sunni don't, but I'm not sure. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:48, 20 July</dd>

<dd>AladdinSE removed As-Sadique from the titles saying the title is associated with the 1st caliph. If the title is used by some muslims for the 1st caliph, it does not meen that no else had the title.</dd>

<p>We know that people that had accompanied Mohammad to 'Mubahila' where all sidique, as only people who never lied accompanied him. Plus i dont think there will be any sunni who would say that any of the 4 rightly guided caliphs were not sadique.

<dd>Just because they were all honest does not mean they were nicknamed As Siddique; I've heard of Abu Bakr being referred to as Abu Bakr <i>As Siddique</i> but never heard of Ali <i>As Siddique</i> , or anyone else for that matter. --<a href="../../../g/n/u/User%7EGNU4eva_d511.html" title="User:GNU4eva"><font color="red">GNU</font><b>4</b><font color="blue">Eva</font></a> 12:54, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's correct. I've never heard of <i>Ali As-Sadique</i> either. Even if it was used as a minor title, when it is so famously and widely associated with Abu Bakr, it ought not to be included here. Merely removing the title does not in any way mean that we are implying the fourth Caliph was not truthful. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 19:27, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Furthermore, when Striver put back the As-Siddiq title for Ali, he remarks, "In my view, Abu Bakr was from from that..." It's not your <b>view</b> that matters; WP should not be used as a message board forum but rather to report the facts. As-Siddiq is a <i>nickname</i> that is associated with Abu Bakr, and no one else.

<dd>I'm not sure that "nickname" really captures the phenomenon. Various Muslim editors have been adding "titles" to various biographical articles, notably Muhammad and Ali. I think this is more the impulse towards veneration. If God cannot be depicted, but must be known by the canonical 99 names, then Muhammad and Ali are also venerated with lists of official titles. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:07, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When people speak, do they append these pious interjections in Quranic Arabic, or in the local dialect or language? What do these interjections sound like in Quranic or classical Arabic? Do Muslims use the acronyms (like PBUH and SAW) when speaking? Or is that only in writing? What are the acronyms used specifically for Ali? Do Sunnis say "Honored be his face" -- or whatever it is -- or is that only a Shi'a practice? Finally, there are some websites that do the PBUHs and SAWs in beautiful, teeny-tiny Arabic calligraphy, so that the interjection looks like a smudge.

<dd>Zora, in no way is inclusion of that information render the article unredable. Further, the facts are not "shiny thing" that "magpie editors" (i take that as a personal insult) include for personal resons. That is facts that are very relant to Shias, Shia do not hesitate to mention that Ali and Umar had a became what my edits show. Books are writen about Ali and Abu Bakr and the Inheritance, articles in the net has been writen about it. You know it. You try to remove it since you know that it will make Sunni feel bad, but since they can not refute it or say they dont belive in it, you simply try to marginalize it and try to claim it is uninportant or not relevant. It is very relevant. And it will remain there. Persist in removing it by no other motivation that you think it to be irrelevant and i will be forced to seek other meand to have it included, beggining with a RFC. Here you have a example of a article DEDICATED to represent Ali, Abu Bakr and the inheritance <sup><a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/en/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/en/index.php" rel="nofollow">answering-ansar.org</a></sup>, writen in a very prominent Shia site, and here you have a the same topic given a whole chapter in a very prominent Shia Book <sup><a href="http://www.al-islam.org/guided/22.html#2" class="external text" title="http://www.al-islam.org/guided/22.html#2" rel="nofollow">And then i was guided</a></sup>.

So dont claim its uninportant, you KNOW its not since you have been a editor of Islam related articles for a long time. It is Factual. It is Relevant. It is NPOV. It is Well sourced.

<dd><i>Muhammad had a reflective turn of mind and routinely spent nights in a cave (Hira) near Mecca in meditation and thought. Around the year 610, while meditating, Muhammad had a vision of the Angel Gabriel and heard a voice saying to him in rough translation "Read in the name of your Lord the Creator. He created man from something which clings. Read and your Lord is the Most Honored. He taught man with the pen; taught him all that he knew not." (See surat Al-Alaq for a fuller account.)</i></dd>

<dd>In the same manner, you can not remove the parts you removed from the inheritance article and just briefly state that Shias dont like Abu Bakr!

<dd>The facts of the matter must be reported, you can not simply present the Abu Bakr argument that he heard prophets (plural) did not inherit, but not present that Ali countered that the Quran refutes that! That is not a neutral point of view, both arguments must be presented. Further, it is inacurate to claim that Shia <b>POINT</b> to that event as <b>A</b> example of persecution, even if you said that shia CLAIM that Ali BELIVED that Umar and Abu Bakr was a lier, treacherous, sinner and so on, it would STILL be inacurate, since it is regarded as AUTHENTIC by SAHIH MUSLIM! <b>NO ONE</b> disputes the authenticity of that part of the hadith, Umar himself said that those two belive them to be low-lifes, Shia belive it and the second most authentic Sunni source around reports it as AUTHENTIC! I will not settle with NOT presenting Alis view, not even presenting that Shia belived that Ali belived that, no, you just want to replace that with some general line about Shia not liking it!</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zora does not motivate</span></h2>
<p>Zora delets iformation regarding what Alis thought of Umar and Abu Bakr, as reported in Sunni sources that classified the narration as authentic, and also in prominent Shia collections. Alis oppinion are regarding the subject that the section is about, and his oppinion are further also highly relevant to the biography of Ali. Zora gives the following motivations for doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"you're acting like a conspiracy theorist"</i></li>
<li><i>"we (dont) include every "shiny thing" that magpie editors try to jam into an article"</i></li>
<li><i>"We are trying to create READABLE articles"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>As can easly been seen, the first point ignores that i am citing the most prominent mainstream sources of both Shia and Sunni. That does not make a conspiracy, that makes reporting acknowledged and authenticated facts.</p>
<p>The second point is a pure personal assualt on me, calling me a magpie editors trying to insert non-sense in the article. As is evident, Alis oppinion regarding a pivital event in his life according to the most prominent sources around does not qualifie as legitimate information in Zoras eyes.</p>
<p>The third point... i dont event get what it supposed to mean. Maybe that she does not like me sourcing the informatino in <sup>this</sup> format?</p>
<p><br />
And here is her forth argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Striver, please stop mangling the article"</i></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Dont you love how well she articulates her arguments?</p>
<p><br />
What she <b>DOES NOT</b> manage to do, is to either disprove one of my arguments for insertnig it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a fact that is not disputed</li>
<li>Is is reported in the most prominent books around</li>
<li>Its is NPOV</li>
<li>It is relevant</li>
<li>It needs to be sourced</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Zora, if you delet my editions one more time, without properly addresing my arguments and insiting on giving oppions regarding my person as the only motivatin for deleting Alis oppinions and the sources given, i will take it to the next step, making a RFC.</p>
<p>You started by deleting the whole section. When i asked why, you claimed that my editinos did not have the right prose, they where "hadith dumps". I said ok and let you correct my prose. But you did not only correct my prose, you also deleted, and keep insinting on deleting the relevant and factual informatin that i demand to have represented. That is in violation of WP rules. Stop it.</p>

<p>Well, striver I can only hope that both Sunni and Shi'a point of view will be be reflected in the article. I would just like to point out though that the link ("answering-islam.org/Silas/rf1_mhd_wealth.htm") is from an anti-Islamic site that wants to create conflict between Muslims. The site is also plagued with lies and distortion of the Qur'an so it can make christianity look good. Yes, it is very pathetic and so, I would recommend that the link be deleted and a better one found from a Shi'a site. But remember the article can't simply be the Shi'a perspective - you have to reach middle ground with the Sunni POV.

<dd>Wa aleikom salam Anonymous editor! I dont know exactly who Sunni relate to this topic, they seem to admit the facts, but i dont know how they interpret it. So i just laid out the facts from Shia and Sunnis most prominent sources without commenting on them. However, Zora added a line regarding Shia pov and i did not delet it. I welcome a sunni to also add the sunni pov to that event, since it is lacking as it is. I recall reading a Sunni article basicly saying that "sure, they said harsh stuff, but it dosnt matter, friends say harsh stuff". In any case, my concern in this matter is not so much to have the Shia or Sunni pov included, rather the factual event it self, and having it well sourced.</dd>

<p>I'm not censoring a Shi'a view -- I think any reasonable Shi'a would conclude that I'm keeping Striver from depicting Ali as a mean-spirited, grasping monomaniac. Striver's quote re "Ali didn't give bay'ah" didn't prove what he thought it did. One quote is from an anti-Islamic site. The quote from Ali seems to refer to the caliphate rather than lands or goods. The hadith that Striver cites, so that he can enter a string of epithets directed at the non-Alid caliphs, is actually a Sunni hadith that depicts Ali and Abbas as squabbling over stuff and motivated by greed, and shamed by Umar who contrasts their behavior with that of Muhammad, who kept only what he needed for the bare essentials and gave the rest of his income to the community. The version of the article that I'm championing accurately summarizes the dispute, and is missing only the complaints and the epithets. Does Shi'ism consist of hatred and complaints of persecution? I refuse to believe that it does. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:02, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Bay'ah quote is not concerned in this dispute. The quote is from Tabari, that happens to be on a anti Islamic site. If you manage to find it somewhere else, you are welcomned to quote Tabari from there.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>"I'm keeping Striver from depicting Ali as a mean-spirited, grasping monomaniac" is your pov, not everyones. I for my self dont belive that persisting to receive ones inheritance makes one a "mean-spirited, grasping monomaniac"</i>. - Rather, whitholding somones inheritance might cause one to deserve those titles. However, its is totaly irrelevant, since i dont aim to represent pov of some group, rather the facts of what Ali thought.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The quote from Ali seems to refer to the caliphate rather than lands or goods."</i> must refer to the Nahj al-Balagha quote "I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one went his way but handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after himself." since its the only Ali quote in the section.

<dd>However, Abu Bakr claimed that he had heard Muhammad say that prophets do not leave an inheritance <sup><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/053.sbt.html#004.053.325" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/053.sbt.html#004.053.325" rel="nofollow">bukhari</a></sup>.

<p>Given that this is a historically contentious issue, doesn't a "group A holds that X was observed, while group B holds that Y was observed" seem more appropriate (and sensitive) than implying that Abu Bakr was simply ignoring the Qur'an? Also, is it possible that citing this reference here would sidetrack the article into a "can-you-top-this" series of comeuppance citations from people who will disagree with the implication here?</p>
<dl>

<dd>When Abu Bakr died, Ali and <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Abbas_d33f.html" title="Ibn Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a> both whent to <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> to demand their share of inheritance. On that event, Umar stated that he knew that Ibn Abbas and Ali thought Umar and Abu Bakr where <i>"liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest"</i> due to their actions, but would still not give Ali and Ibn Abbas their inheritance <sup><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4349" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4349" rel="nofollow">Muslim</a></sup>.</dd>

<p>Similarly, are there groups today who are likely to consider Abu Bakr's actions in this (historically contentious) case justified? Have we given their viewpoint fair exposure?

<p>Fatimah came to Abu Bakr and demanded her share in the inheritance. Al-Abbas came to him and demanded his share in the inheritance. Ali came with them. Thereupon Abu Bakr said, “The Apostle of Allah said, “We leave no inheritance, what we leave behind us is sadaqah.” I shall make provisions for those for whom the Prophet had made.” <b>On this Ali said, “Sulayman (Solomon) inherited Dawud (David), and Zakariya said, ‘He may be my heir and the heir of the children of Yaqab (Zachariah and John the Baptist)’”</b>.

<p>Shirk comes opposite to Tawheed. Nobody prays to Ali or the painting of Ali, be they in Iran or Pakistan. This is one of the misconceptions about The Shia that I tried to address in the article <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Bias_against_The_Shia_4e83.html" title="Academic Bias against The Shia">Academic Bias against The Shia</a> (which is about to be censored, as is the norm). Shias and Sunnis alike pray to the one God. Ali's picture is not God's replacement (na'udhu billah), as the caption implies. Therefore the comment about the painting being <i>shirk</i> is BS, because the imaging of Ali is merely analogous to keeping a picture of a loved one, like your mother or father. I suppose Sunnis do keep family photos? That caption needs to be changed.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 21:21, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the wording. "Stabbed in the head" suggests sudden death. When you STAB something, the blade penetrates a considerable distance. Mortal head wound is better phrasing, IMHO.</p>
<p>I also removed a para that someone snuck in there re some agency recommending that Muslims imitate Ali. It was in the wrong place and it's not especially encyclopedic. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:51, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term <i>Ithna Ashariya</i> ("twelvers") is used only to distinguish the sect from other Islamic sects. The "twelver" Shia belief is that God appoints a guide, or <i>hujja</i> (<i>"argument"</i>) for every single generation. Shi'ism cites the following Qur'anic verse as a reference:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"...for every generation there is a guide." (Qur'an, 13:7)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Shi'ism cites other verses and hadiths when explaining this belief. Some of these "guides" are appointed as:</dd>

<dd>

<dd>2) Messengers - one who receives revelations from God, and has the duty to teach the revelations to humankind.</dd>
<dd>3) Imams - one who is appointed to lead the believers in every single aspect of life.</dd>

<dd>Shi'ism teaches that <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> is God's greatest creation. As such, there is no human greater than him. With regards to his duties, Shi'ism teaches that Muhammad was a Prophet from birth. At the age of 40, Muhammad was given the duty to teach the revelations. This duty meant that he had become a Messenger. Shi'ism teaches that he was also an Imam.</dd>

<dd>Shi'ism does not teach that there have only ever been twelve Imams. Shi'ism teaches that there have been many Prophets, many Messengers and many Imams. However, since the final stage of God's religion was completed by <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, the only other Imams that are relevant to the practice of religion are the twelve Imams that were appointed after the prophet, Muhammad. This is the "Twelver" Shia belief: that in order to obey God, one must follow 2 sources; (i) the Qur'an, and (ii) the Prophet Muhammad and the 12 Imams. I apologise if I have been reiterating Shi'ism facts that you are already aware of, but I felt that it may explain the beliefs. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamcaliph_0603.html" title="User:Adamcaliph">Adamcaliph</a> 03:15, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ali - Allah?</span></h2>
<p>So far as I know, no Shi'a authorities have speculated that Ali's name reflects any particular closeness to Allah, God. Does this mean that anyone named Al is particularily holy? This is bizarre. If there are any Shi'a who do indulge in such speculations (which is far from demonstrated), I'm fairly sure that they would be regarded as mere coffee-house babblers. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:32, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The word <i>al-Ali</i> is believed by Muslims to be one of the 99 descriptions of Allah, provided by Allah Himself for our reference. The word means <i>the Most High</i> (sometimes trans. <i>Most Exalted</i>). Like many of these 99 descriptions, <i>Ali</i> is used by many people to name their children. Such words are considered by Muslims to be sacred. Zora is absolutely correct; the mere name of <i>Ali</i> does not render someone "holy" per se; however, the name is nonetheless considered by Muslims to be a holy name.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The hadith that Striver quoted is accepted by anyone who considers him or herself to be a Shia. In the Shia belief, Allah chose the names of the Prophets and Imams, as well as other infallibles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The phrase <i>muttaqīn</i>, as with many words, has to be explained beyond mere translation. This is possibly the reason why both words <i>assured</i> and <i>pious</i> have been included. The word actually means "<i>one who is certain</i>". In reference to Islam, it refers to someone who is so certain in Islamic beliefs that it translates through into practice. Therefore, one who is certain becomes pious. As such, in Islam, one who is <i>muttaqīn</i> is a very pious person. For the sake of this encyclopedia however, it is probably sufficient that either the word <i>assured</i> or <i>certain</i> is used. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamcaliph_0603.html" title="User:Adamcaliph">Adamcaliph</a> 20:29, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In that case "established in his faith" is a better English translation. "Assured" has no such connotations.</dd>

<p>Guys guys, your hopeless, Allah's name Al-3aleey ( the most high) is different from Ali, you silly people, the pronunciation of both names in arabic is so different. Ali is just a man, don't make Ali into a god, or the closet assosiate of god, thats shirk, Ali is a mere man, whom by the guidance of Allah and his last messenger was able to perform such feats in battle and knew the way of the heavens more than he knew the ways of the Earth. Don't be silly and post sources which may hint that Ali was divine. It is only considered to be a holy name due to Ali's (r.a) personality. Know your facts people holy moly</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Insertion of Shi'a traditions as fact</span></h2>
<p>Striver, no reputable historian of Islam accepts the stories that you are trying to insert. Those stories aren't in the earliest texts and they show every sign of being later fabrications. You are trying to insert them as if they were fact.</p>
<p>We give enough links to Shi'a sites that if a reader wanted to explore further, he/she would certainly read those stories and hear those claims.</p>
<p>It is not up to me to show that they are fables, it is up to you to show that they are not. Cites from Peshawar Nights are particularily problematic, since the text has been shown to be a Persian forgery. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:25, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
