<dd>LOL! As I've been around for a few years you've just made me feel young and n00b again! Basically I do my 'official' work under this, my real name, and the slight status change will improve my effectiveness while doing that work rather than have to 'call out' to someone else to part-assist. It is very much a "special case" though and you needn't worry about my socks, tights or any other clothing&#160;;-P --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 21:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, yeah, yeah... like we'll buy <i>that</i>. Lemme guess, TINC?&#160;;-) I just thought it was odd that the chair of the UK Chapter wasn't an admin. Just one of those things, I guess. And don't worry about feeling n00bish... Jimbo was just "officially welcomed" about a week ago. Thanks for all you do around here, by the way.

<p>I'm only removing them until someone finds a reliable source - a single one in the whole of the internet the article documents! - for them. It is not true that all 1.1million articles would be nothing but links off site; that would imply that none of them contained any other information whatsoever. It is not at all clear where the dividing line is. I mean, I found a source for LOL with a few seconds looking. I don't really want to go and find a source for ZOMGWTFBBQ, on the other hand. The relevant policies put the burden of proof firmly on the adding editor. If they can't, or won't, find any proof, then really that's just a bit tough. The article is a magnet for junk, cruft, things that aren't related to the internet, things that aren't slang, things that aren't internet slang and all sorts of other things. It's not just vandalism I'm removing: it's anything that doesn't belong. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 22:03, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apology accepted. I have always read that second listitem as referring to talkpages and not what a user writes about themselves (unless there exists a clear and immediate legal problem). If someone wishes to suggest that a change to a users own page would be appropriate then the talk page is there explicitly for the purpose. In this particular case the use of lower case and upper case in those places was specific and intentional. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 19:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I considered speedying this myself, but held off, because there is a <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Lovely_2c16.html" title="Kingdom of Lovely">Kingdom of Lovely</a>, it's a real thing (however <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">Micronation</a> and silly it may be). I added the hangon and told the user that notability and verifiability stuff needed adding. Please advise (I don't live in the UK so I don't know Lovely as well as UK people do) if you have a problem with my userifying this for the editor if he or she asks. You can reply here if you like. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:27, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This evening I have been patrolling calls for speedy and also doing the 'random page walk' too. I've usually tended towards the policy that if someone else has called for speedy, and I've looked at it and can't see any justification for it (a) remaining in place (ie meets speedy criterion/a quoted) and (b) doesn't justify itself that it could be a valid and effective article, then deletion is the right way to go. If the originator can come up with an improved article then I welcome it, if they are just doing the fan/advertising/self-promo/gaming thing though, then probably not. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 21:36, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The names seem to match names in the article, and the assertion of an electiom matches too. I'd suggest maybe it's AfD fodder rather than a speedy. The original assertion of "patent nonsense" was false. I'm not too sussed either way but did want you to be aware. If the originator cares, he'll let one of us know (I left him a message as I said above), presumably. If not, well... deletion was the right thing. PS I reverted a rather abusive comment here just now and warned that editor. He needs to be told that he should take the article to DRV now, I think. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>re Lovely Election Candidates 2006 when I first saw it (tagged speedy) it didn't make any clear assertion to be related to anything else; it read as vandalism/dangerous (naming "DAVID BLUNKETT" for instance). AIH I'd already opened the page and was reviewing it when you made your edit, so I failed to see your addition. Given there is so little content, and what is there could be misconstrued, I'd suggest that this information would be better served as a para in the article on the micronation concerned. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 22:16, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am well aware that it was extremly rude. I as trying to get your attention. Now listen up! Myspace.com is being used by millions of people. Escape the Fate has used this to their advantage to get millions of people to buy their first EP, just like that woman <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tila_Tequila_5ae2.html" title="Tila Tequila">Tila Tequila</a>. It doesnt matter that they dont have an album yet, what matters is that they are notable. I just went through a long and drawn out argument to keep the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_Bats_e3df.html" title="Cancer Bats">Cancer Bats</a> article I created so I understand what notable entails. Now please put back the Escape the Fate article. They are signed to Epitaph, have recived only the best of ratings for the EP on punk review websites and are on tour accross the US right now and this sumemr will playing the main stage on Warped Tour. Just because you have your own article doesn't give you a right to delete other articles especially when I put up a clear warning that the notability of the band would seem questionable at first. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenged_Evanfold_75be.html" title="User:Avenged Evanfold">Avenged Evanfold</a> 21:34, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I don't condone uncivility ever, how long was the speedy tag on the article for before deletion? I held off putting one on myself and was watching the page to see if the creator could pass notability criteria... and I didn't see a tag. Could be I took my eye off the ball, ot it could be the tag was on for a very short time indeed - too short to insert a hangon? <a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 21:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You appear to be missing the point here. WP is *not* the place you develop an article. Just as you wouldn't write and send an email ten words at a time, you write it offline/in one piece, and then send it off. Here, new articles - and tagged articles - need to have something in them that justifies their continued existence from the start. Yes, of course they will hopefully improve as time goes on, but readers who know nothing about the subject of an article deserve to be informed, not have to make guesses about what is going on. "Speedy" means exactly that, and there will usually be a number of editors watching the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> page, and reviewing for themselves what other people have tagged, and often they will concurr with the person who added the tag, sometimes they won't (and tonight I haven't always agreed with the tags I've found). As to the band, MySpace may be used by lots of people (including, as it happens, me) but that doesn't make them "notable". When they *are* notable they will be very welcome! --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 21:47, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Advertising generally falls under #7 <i>"Unremarkable people or groups/Vanity Pages. An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead."</i> and, in this case, the content was clearly a puff piece and totally POV. Looking at the 'article' I tried to see if something NPOV could be extricated from it, but frankly it seemed that the only thing left would be the name of the company! Once I saw that the creator had passed it by their boss at the company in the marketing department then it became a definite and clear deletion, similar to someone writing their own over-the-top biography on here. As I noted on the talkpages, if there is a good, sensible, NPOV article out there on this company I'm sure one will eventually appear.

<p>I will absolutely make the changes that you suggested. I actually was not attempting to make this article from a marketing point of view at all. The only reason that I thought my article was appropriate at the time was because I had not come up with the profile myself. I had used the wikipedia articles of other telecoms companies on your site to try and see what was allowed (i.e. products and services). I will make sure that the interoute article is "without puffery" in its next publicatoin. Thanks so much for your help (I had trouble decoding NPOV on my own)!!WhitneyEllis 08:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I deleted all of the products and services except for the section on Voice services and the introduction of iSip. I kept these because they definitely fit into the category of revolutionizing business and the entire way that business looks at voice over IP. (Although I did not use these words, no worries:)I think that I took out all of the puffery. What do you think? The only thing that I would still like to put in, if you think it would be alright is the map that I had on earlier. The reason is because it is an easy way to show the expanse of the network, and how it is different from other companies (namely the fact that the company has spread to Dubai (unheard of in telecoms) and that the company can be found in 24 of 25 countries in the EU). I tried to think of other ways to express this in words, but they all seemed to be too filled with puffery (sorry I really liked the word&#160;:) ) Any thoughts on this, or the article in general?

Can I move my in progress page to the real interoute page?WhitneyEllis 13:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC</p>
<p>Im sorry to hear that you were ill, hope all is well now. I included the James Kinsella section only because it links to a very succinct and clear explanation of how iSip...honestly, a really cool techinical revolution...works. I do agree that it is unfortunate that it is Jim Kinsella explaining it, but it is really interesting knowledge, especially for Skypers or anyone with any Skype experience.

I have great faith that we can arrive at a solution agreeable to all.

<p>Let's start over from the basics. How are the IP addresses that you seek to block different from all other IP addresses? What is peculiar to their situation that makes a permablock particularly appropriate? I think the community will be receptive to a narrowly drawn rule that ferrets out the particular problem here. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 22:10, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I too think sometime exceptions should be made, so a policy addition should be made to define when.

<dd>The primary difference for these IP addresses is that they are static IPs (not a dial-up general ISP) and that they are identifiable and confirmably primarily used by school children. Similarly, evidence on all the talkpages shows repeated warnings over vandalism and disruption to Wikipedia and <i>User contributions</i> is clear on showing the extreme scarcity of actual "contributions". We have to be realistic here in trying to find a way to Wikipedia work without encouraging vandalism and disruption. Blocking each of the 20 addresses once a month doesn't add anything to either the IP-user's experience or to our administrative capability. We have to recognise that when you have warned, warned and warned again then one day you have to carry out the threat and block. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 22:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The one month cap is for static IPs.

<p><font color="#000FF"><font color="#000FF">Hi, thanks for reporting back to me. I am not really too fussed witht he article, only I do know about the subject matter and was trying to put correct and ammend what Wikipediatrix was doing (the user who has been constantly tagging inaaporiately and manipulating the article to suit her POV). I was asked by another user to deal witht he problem of the article and having attempted to reason with Wikipediatrix she carelessly disregarded the arguments at hand and simply changes the article without any appropiation or valid reason, this in my eyes is careless POV vandalism. Wikipedia is not here to suit other people's requirements, but to share information on subjects which may not be globally recognised. In this case it is clear that Wikipediatrix who is American has no knowledge or any idea about the subject that this article entails. I having lived here in the UK understand and know that this subject has sparked huge controversy and interest in the media as is sourced byt he links other users have provided. The only reason I reverted the article from the previous tags is because Wikipediatrix has constantly tagged it with inapporpiate tags that bear no purpose i.e. Debating the Factuality of an article when it is clearly sourced and has an official statement from Kellogs and other newspapers, or tagging for POV, when the article is simply shedding light on the rumours and controversy of the lead actor playing the Frosties Kid. I made sure to make the article neutral and encyclopedic before she once again adapted it.

<p><font color="#000FF"><font color="#000FF">I was genuinely shocked when, out of curiousity, I had checked into Wikipedia and found that I was blocked for linkspamming? Forgive me if I don't understand Wiki as much as those who spend a great portion of their time here and who are really passionate about it but maybe I just missed a rule somewhere? Perhaps wrongly, I had assumed it was ok to write about myself with links to my various sites <b>within my user profile</b> .</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000FF"><font color="#000FF">That's all I can think of where someone who lives and breathes wiki might have found me in violation of linkspamming rules, but honestly, I just didn't know that was unacceptable. Now, when it comes to speeding, or being in possession of stolen goods, ignorance is no excuse, but can you just give me a break here?</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000FF"><font color="#000FF">I honestly don't even have a pressing need to be unblocked right now, but it's just a matter of principle. If that was the offense, it was an error sincerely made. For the record, though, I HAVE tried to contribute. I once tried to make mention, in the section titled MAGIC, of the world's longest running stage magic theater group (31years) which is in the Guiness book of World records and has played at the US White House on 8 occassions. Wiki says to edit aggressively and I didn't even think that was too aggressive but whoever was hanging out there thought it unimportant...guiness book of world records, and white house on 8 occasions = not important. ok...</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000FF"><font color="#000FF">Anyways, can you please unblock me and explain to me what the violation was. "Linkspamming" was the charge, but it was not specific. Was it my links to my sites in describing myself? Because this name is about to be branded. It's been around for 3 years and going strong. And I kept it to the user profile.</font></font></p>

I shall now comment elsewhere about the AFD, but my action was not predicated on the AFD itself. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 15:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

<dd>Yup, the user also direct mailed me. They'd posted a full-scale advert for (presumably their) travel company, with phone numbers, addresses, websites, and details of services offered. *Not* what WP is for. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 19:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi there; I happened to come across your page while chasing down a vandal, and noted your comment about not always agreeing with speedy tags. I have been a Wikipedian only for some five months; I recognise your greater experience. I spend a lot of time new page patrolling, hopefully reasonably efficiently. But it would be nice to get some feedback. I do not need pats on the back for doing things right, but I am certain that some articles I tag do not ultimately get deleted; the law of averages dictates this. I know that I can go through my "contributions" file, but this takes forever. Is there any way of notifying NP patrollers of inaccuracies? Doing so should, with luck, improve our performance. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 21:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alison, I know that you mean well, but you have botched a number of the facts that are in the public record within Wikipedia, regarding my business. Please see my comments at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:MyWikiBiz.com" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:MyWikiBiz.com" rel="nofollow">Talk:MyWikiBiz.com</a>. If you'd like to undo your errors, that would be appreciated; or, I hope that someone else will come along and correct the highly misleading interpretations of events that you've published. Thanks. --<a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">MyWikiBiz</a> 17:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
