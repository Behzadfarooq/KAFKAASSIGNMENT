<dd>The thing that troubles me about Wikipedia that - even though it may protect flame wars - the Neutral Point of View Policy is a bit ... strict. Yes, I know this is just like an encyclopedia on the computer (praise the heavens it has come) and I like Wikipedia a lot - it's my favorite website. But on articles like the Holocaust and stuff like that ( I have a connection to it because my grandmother is a survivor ), I really have trouble not giving non-biased facts, so I basically only look and not touch. Wikipedia is so limited to me, not in the humber of articles, but with what you can do.</dd>

<dd>Also, I am terribly sorry for the deliberate vandilism - and yes, I did do it intentionally - I caused on the RuneScape page several times. I did it because I wanted to see what messages would be sent to me as a result of what I did. I was only curious ( though it gives me no excuse ) and that's why we're all on Wikipedia, isn't it? Because we're a little curious on what the world is.</dd>

The thought of everyone giving knowledge freely from which everyone may benefit is a wonderful thing.

<p>The cyLEDGE article has now been edited to take into account justified criticisms by several users. Please accept our apologies for what may have seemed excessive or unclear marketing jargon (the jargon which, for better or worse, we are most familar with...), and have done our best to follow the Wiki Style manual. Though cyLEDGE contains the company site as an external link, it is not so much a marketing campaign than it is an attempt to communicate what we are doing and get reactions from other people working or interested in the field. Since there is a natural affinity to cyLEDGE's activities and open-platforms such as Wikipedia, it is important for us to be present there - an additional paragraph has been added to make as clear as possible what the issues at stake are, and which we are trying to come to terms with.

<dd>Hello <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> and thank you for your understanding. As with most things on Wikipedia, there are few set rules but one of the core policies is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verfiability</a> which links in closely with the guideline on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Reading these helps editors to understand that 'verifying sources' should have a degree of longevity and be held in high regard as being reputable. In the main, for Wikipedia, I tend to look for sources such as the BBC, The Times, The Guardian, The Independent, etcetera and shy away from the tabloids (unless the article is linked to tabloids). For football articles, the official website can also be a good source for announcements â€” whereas forums, blogs, fansites and unofficial sites tend not to be reliable. It is very important, in my opinion and that of many other editors, for Wikipedia not to reflect personal opinion or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and to that end Wikipedia, along with most reputable enclopaedias, acts as a tertiary source summarising the secondary sources of such well reputed publications. Other links which you may find useful, and generally acceptable for football articles, are those at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Football_Links_fc57.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Football/Links">Wikipedia:WikiProject Football/Links</a>. I hope that this information helps you in some way and, also, helps to make up for my earlier mistake. Please let me know if I may be of any further help to you in this or any matter here on Wikipedia.

<p>Hi, just wondering if you would give me some backing here. I've reverted 2 edits already from User:71.136.228.139 how keeps changing Carricks page to say he players with Manchester united. If he does again could you please give him a warning as my warnings so far don't seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<dd>Hi there and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your note about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. Please allow me to explain a little more. When I made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles&amp;diff=66790112&amp;oldid=66789624" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles&amp;diff=66790112&amp;oldid=66789624" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, I left you a note thanking you for experimenting with the page and I explained that your post had been <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">reverted</a>. I suggested that you make further tests in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">the sandbox</a> which many new users find useful as well as referring you to the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">welcome page</a>. Your edit claiming that "Thiers is huge amounts of evidence to suggest that the Beatles where are the greatest band of all time." did not <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cite sources</a> and was considered, therefore, not to conform to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. A <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> is required for all articles and the onus for providing sources lies with the editor making the claim. I notice that your edit was reverted also by <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">User:Akamad</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66790112" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66790112" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the same reasons.

<p>This warning you gave me was utter bullshit.

<dd>Hi there, Pkchan. I wanted to start another archive as the page had reached 93 kilobytes but as so many of the conversations are current or ongoing, I did not want to leave the main talk page without a history.

<p>I have nominated List of beat 'em ups to be undeleted, under the reasoning that it is not redundant to the category; it contains many games which are not covered by the category, and may never be able to be covered by it. In addition, the list can do more than the category. It can put date, developer, release date, system, et al., useful especially for articles that would be difficult to create an article for. I hope that you will vote on this and hopefully support its undeletion, on the basis that it does something that makes it not redundant to the category. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_26#List_of_beat_.27em_ups" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_26#List_of_beat_.27em_ups" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You've accused me of vandalising a site that I've never been to! I'm thinking some spammer has you believing I'm someone else.</p>

<p>Hi, seeing you are interested in football this is an invitation to contribute to this discussion to clarify certain issues about football player notability. I think clearer guidelines are needed to avoid repeated inappropriate nominations for deletion and time consuming discussions.
