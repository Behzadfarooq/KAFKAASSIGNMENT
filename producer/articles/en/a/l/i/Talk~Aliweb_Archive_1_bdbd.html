<p>Aliweb searched for idx files and those files could be changed by their owners. It did not spider html pages but did spider idx files but only after owners notified Aliweb of their presence.

<dd>As far as anyone can tell, you are an anonymous user of wikipedia. You don't need to sign in to make edits here, but they are prone to being edited. Perhaps some citations that can be referenced to back your statements would be helpful. The only statement that I see about ALIWEB is on the original developer's site which says that the present day pages are unrelated to the original site. As it stands now, this entry in the wikipedia is promotional rather than informational. Help it become something that won't be edited away. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 20:07, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Employee</span></h2>
<p>I really can't understand this logic. If I work for Aliweb then it should follow that I know a little about the subject. Can you point to anything that is NOT factual about the current article? Further - since the current site states it is the web's first search engine, and gives the date that it first started in the title, and has the same name, I think it would be quite obvious that the original Aliweb, and the current Aliweb are one in the same and of course have something more than just the name in common. Obviously Mr. Koster is no longer involved with the Aliweb project, and his personal web page is not very complimentary of the current web site or owners. He is certainly entitled to his opinion. I have no animosity towards Mr. Koster and have not deleted nor intend to delete any of the references to him or his achievements as they relate to Aliweb. His contributions to the web speak for themselves.</p>
<p>As for being promotional, nothing stated is not factual to my knowledge. It just seems rather odd to delete a url to a page that states to have substantial ties to the subject matter, I state otherwise and then when you are corrected, to then delete the url again. I would suspect that at least a negative disparaging factual statement that aliweb.com with a link is not related to the original aliweb would be in order if you believe that the current site is not related and certainly would be more accurate than simply deleting it entirely.</p>
<p>The bottom line is I am the lead programmer for Aliweb, and I have done extensive research into the history of Aliweb. I know this subject, backwards, forwards, inside out. So please, please, unless you have a real factual inaccurate mistake to fix or something factual to add to the article, stop deleting my additions to it (I'll just repost them anyway). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Aliweb (<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAliweb_9bac.html" title="User talk:Aliweb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aliweb_5059.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aliweb">contribs</a>) 10:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC).</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Aliweb&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58553374" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Aliweb&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58553374" rel="nofollow">(diff)</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Aliweb (<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAliweb_9bac.html" title="User talk:Aliweb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aliweb_5059.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aliweb">contribs</a>) 10:30, 14 June 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>It is unnecessary to link over and over again to the same site. One link in the most appropriate place in the text is the normal Wikipedia practice.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misinformation - Hidden Agenda - Going Backwards</span></h2>
<p>"Aliweb no longer seems to be a bona fide search engine" -- exactly what is a "bona fide search engine"? Apparently if you can type in a search box the word "wikipedia" and get wikipedia.org or type in "google" and get google.com then it is officially "bona fide" and a search engine.</p>
<p>These facts are self evident to anyone who has been involved with the internet and world wide web for any length of time:</p>
<p>1. Aliweb is the web's first search engine. It's in the text books. (what text books??? -- do some research and figure it out!) 2. Aliweb.com uses the same code (with some corrections due to the size of the database growing beyond what was orignally anticipated) as the aliweb seach service used originally and on a number of mirror sitss all over the internet. 3. Nexor no longer does anything with Aliweb because the lead programmer went somewhere else and the owners of Aliweb.com took over - thus the link for nexor's old aliweb service to aliweb.com when you search for the old site (which by the way was not aliweb.com - ".com" addresses at this time 1993 wasn't such a big deal) Obviously Nexor does other things (military messaging services) than advertising agencie services which is the major component of revenue for companies that run internet search engines.</p>
<p>So of course when I see comments such as Ed's or Bill's stating very negative things and giving unreasonable or untrue reasons that the article should be deleted or untrue facts be stated or that the facts as stated which are quite basic and widely known are incorrect and need to be changed -- I am very suspicious that there is some other agenda going on here by perhaps people that don't have the best interests of simply writing an article of facts that people can rely on as truth.</p>
<p>NONE of the results from the aliweb are paid advertising. The banners are largely from the parent company or affiliated companies. The link list has no paid entries. Basically it is largely as it was in the beginning except with an added link list that took about a year of research to get the format correct.</p>
<p>I don't think that the article as it is written is an advertisement for aliweb.com. It states clearly and correctly that the search results and the link list are outdated (thus the fact that google and wikipedia as well as many other existing websites do not appear in the results). I'm sure that would make lots of people want to click immediatly and see and use the service. As I have stated before, the original programmer has stated some negative things on his website, and he is entitled to his opinion which I do not agree with - but his contributions to the web are substantial and he deserves credit for those accomplishments (robots exclusion standard, etc.) and I have not deleted any references to him or his opinions. If this article was about advertising and putting a positive face forward, then perhaps mentioning him or his comments would not be in the Aliweb's best interest. However, this article is not supposed to be in anyone's best interest or slanted in any way other than to report the facts about the subject matter in a clear and concise way. I don't remember if I or someone else started this article, but that certainly is what I have tried to do here. Aliweb's historical significance to the web is substantial and laid the foundation for much of what followed and I believe that others can learn from that.</p>
<p>So if you are not with some competitor without some hidden agenda, then obviously I apologize. However, I think it would be far more helpful to try to add information that is relevant to the subject matter instead of trying to discredit the article and the information that is contained within which is obviously factual.</p>
<p>That's why I just deleted the information because it appeared to be more a "trolling" expedition rather than a sincere attempt to improve the article with factual and relevant information.</p>
<p>For instance, how about some links to the IAFA standard papers, and facts about who formulated them and whether they were accepted or not and by what organization? There is tons of information out there that IS relevant and would be factual, informative, and add greatly to this article. Where are the facts or references regarding the results being paid advertisements? Did you call the company and get rates as to how much those cost or find a web page with that information or find one person who has paid to be in those non-existant paid results? Aliweb might has sold their domain name to an american company . . . what domain name? Aliweb.com? How do you know that aliweb.com existed then? Who created it? When? Why does the site say "directory data supplied by Nexor . . ." so they could have changed their domain to a .com instead of co.uk? What is a mirror site? Why were they necessary? Instead of spouting a bunch of questions about the credibility of the article, uncover the facts and report them truthfully here. Again, I don't think your initial "observations" and comments are helpful, relevant, compelling, or necessary. They are easy and quick observations - not investigative facts.</p>
<p>I'm spending more time defending obvious facts than I am adding interesting facts and references to the article. aliweb 10:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)~~~~</p>

<p>Hello, Aliweb article editors!</p>
<p>For your reading pleasure, I am restoring my 25 November comment to the Talk page, which was just deleted by an anonymous contributor. Something could be in the air, because User:Aliweb deleted a similar comment of mine over at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_search_engines_7cb6.html" title="Talk:List of search engines">Talk:List of search engines</a>, leaving the history comment 'Misinformation deleted'.</p>
<p>Dear User Aliweb, please be patient with us and explain the nature of the misinformation so that it can be corrected. And don't delete other people's comments from article Talk pages, it can get you in trouble. It will also help us if you sign your comments using four tildes, like ~~~~, which makes it easier to follow discussions. You may also want to check WP:COI which cautions users about editing articles about their own businesses. See my closing comment below (after the restored item) which invites your response.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Aliweb no longer seems to be a bona fide search engine</span></h4>
<dl>
<dd>When I type 'wikipedia' or 'google' into the search box at www.aliweb.com, it can't find either one!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also the links one can find on the web that seem to associate Aliweb with the Nexor Co. in the UK are not working at this time. (web.nexor.co.uk is not operational). It seems possible that Aliweb might have sold their domain to an American company called Advertising Technologies Corporation, based in Lexington, Kentucky. The relevance of www.aliweb.com to Wikipedia's article on the original Aliweb project now seems questionable.</dd>

<dd>The situation appears to justify Bill Slawski's earlier comment (above):

<p>Your replies to my observations are invited. Does anyone have any data that suggests that www.aliweb.com is a bona fide search engine, that in any way reflects the original Archie developments of the early '90's? Please provide reliable sources, if any are available, per WP:RS. If there is no way of backing up the claims made in the article, I think that the WP:SPAM guidelines may apply to <a href="http://www.aliweb.com" class="external free" title="http://www.aliweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aliweb.com</a>, since at first glance it seems that the only search results it returns are paid placements. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 17:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Was vs is</span></h2>
<p>I am open to correction here, but why the consistent and insistent use of "is" rather than "was" in the first sentence? The statement refers to a point in time in the <b>past</b>, hence my preference for the use of "was", which is the <b>past</b> tense. Using "is" is unnatural in this instance and, as stated in the comments of one of my earlier edits, the use of "was" is not some sort of statement about the current incarnation of Aliweb or some sort of statement that they "lost" first place. (After all, if you were the first, you <s>are</s> were still the first.) I am neither involved in, interested in, or knowledgeable on the subject of the current Aliweb's connection to the original Aliweb. My beef is with grammar. For example, you can refer to a team in some sort of ongoing tournament or competition saying, "Team A <b>is</b> in first place." If you are referring to the same point in time in last year's competition, you would say, "Team A <b>was</b> in first place." The "competition" to be the first search engine is in the <b>past</b>. Get it? <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapsus_Linguae_0262.html" title="User:Lapsus Linguae">Craig</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/p/User_talk%7ELapsus_Linguae_47d7.html" title="User talk:Lapsus Linguae">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lapsus_Linguae_7f5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lapsus Linguae">c</a>) 21:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>the user named Aliweb changed my edits, but with no proof or sources showing that it is actually the first search engine... I am new so I will leave it to others to look into this, but I feel its a bit odd. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyRob926_6629.html" title="User:CrazyRob926">CrazyRob926</a> 12:14, 29 December 2006 (UTC)(<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyRob926_efc1.html" title="User talk:CrazyRob926">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyRob926_7d27.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyRob926">contribs</a>).</p>
<p>Since we are discussing a major internet event as the supposed FIRST web search engine i feel there should be more the one source, especially when the current source has HIGH potential to profit from the claim. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyRob926_6629.html" title="User:CrazyRob926">CrazyRob926</a> 12:14, 29 December 2006 (UTC) • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyRob926_7d27.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyRob926">contribs</a>). 28 December 2006.</p>
<p>This is completely idiotic. It is a known fact that Aliweb was the first search engine. Can't anyone find anything else relevant to add to the article other than discredit the fact that it is the first search engine (and then not back that claim up with any facts - like name just one search engine that is older). It doesn't matter if I profit from the claim or go to the poor house. Its not a "claim" its a widely known, accepted, and rarely disputed fact. Nothing I do is going to change history no more than I can make the world flat or make the sun orbit the earth.</p>
<p>Next thing we'll be debating is whether Al Gore invented the Internet. Give it a rest. Add something to the article or just leave it alone. Its a waste of time. aliweb 06:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Per WP:V, the person who wants to include a controversial statement in an article needs to provide a reference. <i>The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article</i>. If you're not able to provide a reference, the statement should be removed. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 17:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Controversial" . . . that's the key isn't it? So, if Aliweb was not the web's first search engine then provide some proof of what was the web's first search engine . . . there isnt' anything controversial about it. Its a known fact. You can spend about 2 minutes on any search engine that tries to index the entire web and figure this out. The next person who changes the article please at least have some fact/research/clue before changing it. Its as if this article is posted and checked hourly by the powers that be and as soon as it is fixed a new name pops up to change it. Again, nothing substantive has been added to the article. Nothing new. There are numerous references on the Internet about this search engine. I have a verifiable reference of November 1993 that also aludes to an earlier announcement (hint hint). Anyone care to actually do some research? aliweb 06:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And further . . . how do you know then it is "one of the first". Maybe it was the 100th. Perhaps the 1000th. Quantify "one of the first". So first 3? first 5? So I guess delete all that - its a "non bonafide" search engine. If you spent as much time actually doing some research instead of changing the article and citing whatever references -- now its the "its a controversial statement" argument -- to use as an excuse to vandalize the information perhaps the article would be longer than the discussion over this trivial and universally accepted fact. The only controversy about this has been generated by you. aliweb 06:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>So tomarrow I'll come here and it will again be "one of the first" instead of "the first" and there will not be one shred of evidence to the contrary given and we'll go back and forth as long as it takes for you to get tired or to finally get some energy to do some research. Unless -- again -- there is some "hidden agenda" as to why it is more important to discredit the fact than to do research to either confirm or discredit the fact. aliweb 06:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I spent the 20 or so minutes doing the research that nobody wanted to bother with. So this should put this "controversial" argument to rest. aliweb 07:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>None of the above hot air addresses the topic of this section, that being the <b>tense</b> used in the opening sentence.

<dd>"Subject is" meaning presently as in now. "Subject was" past tense in the past. Aliweb is the web's first and oldest search engine. Aliweb was the web's first and oldest search engine. How can it be "was"? Did the place in time change? So it was first, but now it is something else. Doesn't make sense to me. I obvioulsy want it to be proper and perhaps no one is wording this very well. Perhaps it doesnt' need "is" or "was" it needs to be reworded so that it indicates it "is" still in existence, and is the first search engine in some other way. It is written. It was written.

<dd>Hmm, yeah, OK, but I don't know where someone named Clinton comes into the picture. I see that the version that pre-dates this debacle has been restored and I like that wording even better: "ALIWEB ... can be considered the first Web search engine...." Then again, I suppose it could sound a little "<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasely</a>". That said, I still stand by my assertion that using the present tense with the previous wording is simply incorrect. You are mixing up two different things in your example above, which was not the wording used. Yes (assuming the fact itself is correct), ALIWEB <b>is</b> the oldest search engine, but that is the same as saying ALIWEB <b>was</b> the first search engine. And, for the record, I did try a couple of times (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliweb&amp;diff=92665995&amp;oldid=88978147" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliweb&amp;diff=92665995&amp;oldid=88978147" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliweb&amp;diff=95796926&amp;oldid=95290499" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliweb&amp;diff=95796926&amp;oldid=95290499" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) to qualify the wording as you suggest, but you chose to delete my efforts. --<a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapsus_Linguae_0262.html" title="User:Lapsus Linguae">Craig</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/p/User_talk%7ELapsus_Linguae_47d7.html" title="User talk:Lapsus Linguae">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lapsus_Linguae_7f5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lapsus Linguae">c</a>) 09:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not a Wikipedia expert. This is the first article, and the only article that I have submitted or edited (and through this experience I certainly won't be contributing or starting any new articles - this is just excruciatingly painful and a waste of time). I thought that this information would add to the body of information that is already here and I was a bit surprised that this subject matter had not been covered extensively and that it had not been even mentioned. I didn't start or contribute to this article for advertising purposes - and my prior comments show that actually its contridictory to that goal. This is important subject matter as to how the web developed and I am only interested in presenting facts here no matter who does the contributing/editing.</dd>

<dd>I simply copied the format of the previous reference which I did not submit (I didn't know how to do them). Many of the minor edits happen to be from formatting problems. I'm sure at some time I can find some actual physical in print references as I know I have seen them in the past. However, I believe the references I have provided are genuine and accurate. As I have stated earlier the existance of and the fact Aliweb is the first search engine for the web is widely known and I've never heard of it disputed except here. That's why my surpise at this whole discussion. I thought by now we would be discussing some sort of fine detail of some fact instead of debating something that with a few minutes research is so obvious and widely known to most people who know anything about Internet search engines.</dd>

<p>As I have said in the past, I don't mind the reference to Mr. Koster's website - but to escalate this quote to such prominance in the article just futher emphasizes that the goal here of discrediting the aliweb.com website and developers. Is every opinion that someone writes negative or positive going to be included in every article on wikipedia? Is this suddenly about critics and not facts? The aliweb.com website doesn't reference Mr. Koster at all, positively or negatively. It is true he has nothing to do with the current aliweb.com. That fact has nothing at all to do with the legitimacy of aliweb.com The rest is assumptions/opinions. Here's a quote for you - the current Aliweb developer says the current aliweb.com site is just wonderful. The quote is true - I just typed it - but it has no place in the article. In fact, I would personally delete that too (the so called conflicted of interest one).</p>
<p>You guys will stoop to any level - unbelievable. This article has to be watched EVERY hour of EVERY day for vandalism and negative non-factual and non-researched postings. If you can't discredit aliweb.com one way, you'll find another.</p>
<p>This article was started about one aliweb. The same one that has been around since the beginning of the web. The exact same one. Think people - where did aliweb.com get their database from? How was it compiled? They just get it out of the air somewhere? Of course not. Do some research. I've already pointed you in the right direction. Prove that you don't have a conflict of interest. Actually do some real research on the subject. These posts are so blatently negative and biased against the aliweb.com website that they don't pass the smell test. aliweb 08:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article was started and still is about "aliweb". Not a historicl Aliweb or a new Aliweb or one in another dimension. The attempts to discredit aliweb.com without any facts whatsoever (again I suggest you do some research instead of laborously spending time figureing out one way or another to discredit aliweb.com) Again, it doesn't pass the smell test aliweb 08:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improvement</span></h2>
<p>Athaenara, thanks for your recent improvement in the article, and the restoration of Martijn Koster's comments! With regard to capitalization of Aliweb, note that it is not an acronym (so far as we know), and thus <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSCL_8969.html#All_caps" title="WP:MOSCL">WP:MOSCL#All_caps</a> encourages us to avoid the use of all caps. Also, since Aliweb is not a currently-working search engine (the service is not available anywhere, according to the blog posting by Chris Sherman in the reference list), I don't think it is necessary to link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_search_engines.html" title="List of search engines">List of search engines</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aliweb is listed in a number of acronym databases on the web. I really don't have a preference as to whether it is capitolized or not - only that the captiolization or lack thereof is proper. Also a seperate section noting the use of it as an acronym might be a more structured and informative way of doing it with seperate references amd only having it with capitols in that small section. aliweb 08:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Capitalisation, feh, that was probably part of an allergic reaction to the lower-case website-pushing socks and, no, the article doesn't need to be moved merely to accomodate the all-caps version of the name as it appears in key publications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think linking the list is strictly necessary, either, but I do think it is <i>useful</i> for readers that it's there when they're exploring related subjects. Such an inclusion in a "See also" section does not endorse or define aliweb as an active search engine. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 12pt; margin-left: .05em">Athænara</span></a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/User_talk%7EAthaenara_36d9.html" title="User talk:Athaenara"><small><small>✉</small></small></a> 05:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of correctly-sourced information is vandalism</span></h2>
<p>Per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;diff=97110580&amp;oldid=97108155" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;diff=97110580&amp;oldid=97108155" rel="nofollow">this comment</a> by <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">User:MER-C</a> at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_Noticeboard_3209.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard</a>, if well-sourced information is removed from an article, it is appropriate to revert it and then leave the vandal warning {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1a_8a88.html" title="Template:Test1a">test1a</a>}}. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliweb&amp;diff=103350564&amp;oldid=101682541" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliweb&amp;diff=103350564&amp;oldid=101682541" rel="nofollow">recent removal</a> of a reference by User:203.94.240.90, with no edit summary or discussion on Talk, appears to fit this criterion. However this particular removal appears to be just nutty vandalism rather than POV vandalism. I had already left a conventional vandal warning. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 18:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
