<p>Alice Lee Roosevelt was born at the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt.html" title="Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> family home on 6 West 57th St. in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Two days after her birth, in the same house, both her mother, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Hathaway_Lee_Roosevelt_0586.html" title="Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt">Alice</a>, a <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> banking heiress, and her paternal grandmother, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martha_Bulloch_5245.html" title="Martha Bulloch">Martha</a>, died; the former of undiagnosed <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright%27s_disease.html" title="Bright's disease">Bright's disease</a>, the latter from <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhoid.html" title="Typhoid">typhoid</a>. Her father, then a New York state legislator, was so distraught with the loss that the only way he could deal with this tragedy was to try not to even think about his deceased spouse. While he wrote a short tribute to her in his diary and made a couple of references to her in the months after her death, from the next year on, Roosevelt tried never to speak of her again. He refused to have her name mentioned in his presence and even omitted her name from his autobiography. Even his daughter was seldom referred to by her name calling her "Baby Lee" (the use of any name other than Alice was a practice she continued late in life, preferring to be called "Mrs. L"). Grief-stricken, Roosevelt left his infant daughter Alice in the care of his sister <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bamie_Roosevelt_a0ea.html" title="Bamie Roosevelt">Bamie</a>, (also known as "Bye").</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Roosevelt_Longworth_8d69.html" title="Edit section: The influence of Theodore Roosevelt's sister, Bamie and the Lee grandparents">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The influence of Theodore Roosevelt's sister, Bamie and the Lee grandparents</span></h2>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt's sister, and the only aunt with whom she had a long-term relationship, <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bamie_Roosevelt_a0ea.html" title="Bamie Roosevelt">Bamie Roosevelt</a>, would be the one strong stabilizing influence on her. She would take Alice under her watchful care until TR married <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Roosevelt_3782.html" title="Edith Roosevelt">Edith Kermit Carow</a>, at which time she would come under her step-mother's wing and during much of Alice's childhood, Bamie would be a remote figure who eventually would marry and move to London for a time. Auntie "Bye", Bamie would provide the needed structure and stability, on and off again, as Alice became more and more independent, and her father and step-mother would come into conflict with that independent and rebellious nature. Late in life, when Alice spoke of her beloved Auntie Bye in a series of interviews lasting over five years with Michael Teague, she told him that, "There is always someone in every family who keeps it together. In ours, it was Auntie Bye."</p>
<p>Increasingly, Alice's parents would send her off to visit Bamie when they couldn't handle her. Likewise it would be Alice's Lee grandparents (on her mother's side) in Boston, with whom Alice would spend summers and holiday periods, including Thanksgiving, who would give her the undivided attention she could seldom find in her father's home to the point of spoiling her as only grandparents can. They would provide an unconditional love and constancy of affection that Alice would miss in her father's home with her step-mother Edith. In the weeks after his wife's death, her father embarked on a journey of personal discovery to the violent <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_West_9e02.html" title="Old West">Old West</a>, an experience that largely allowed him to rise above his childhood illnesses and physical limitations and so influenced his life that it would substantially contribute to the succession of personal accomplishments that led him to the White House in September 1901.</p>

<p>After returning east, and running for and losing the election to mayor of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Theodore Roosevelt went to London where he married a childhood friend, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Roosevelt_3782.html" title="Edith Roosevelt">Edith Kermit Carow</a>, by whom he would have five more children. There were strains in the relationship between <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">TR</a> and his daughter, and he had very little interaction with her during her earliest years, leaving the work to other people, such as his sister Bamie, Alice's maternal grandparents and even his second wife, Edith. Alice was continually shuffled about from one house to another, even as a teenager, and she later said she often felt like he loved her "one-sixth" as much as the other children. There were also tensions in the relationship between young Alice and her stepmother, who had known her husband's previous wife and made it clear that she regarded her predecessor as a beautiful but insipid, childlike fool. As Alice Longworth later recalled, her stepmother once angrily told her that if Alice's mother, Alice Lee Roosevelt had lived, she would have bored her father to death. Despite these strains, it would be Edith, the demanding step-mother, who would save Alice from a life possibly in a wheelchair or on crutches when Alice came down with a mild form of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio.html" title="Polio">polio</a> and one leg and its muscles grew shorter than the other. By Edith's uncompromising regimen of nightly forced wearing of torturous leg braces and shoes, even over Alice's sobs, Edith ensured that Alice would grow up with almost no trace of the disability. Alice was able to run up stairs and touch her nose with her toe well into her 80s because of a step-mother she didn't always appreciate and who didn't like her either. In later years, however, Alice expressed admiration for her stepmother's sense of humor and stated that they had shared similar literary tastes.</p>

<p>Alice, always spoiled with gifts, matured into young womanhood and, in the course, became known as a great beauty like her mother. However, continuing tension with her stepmother and prolonged separation and little attention from her father created a young woman who was as independent and outgoing as she was self-confident and calculating. When her father was governor of New York, Edith and her father proposed that Alice attend a quite conservative school for girls in New York City. Pulling out all the stops, Alice wrote, "If you send me I will humiliate you. I will do something that will shame you. I tell you I will."</p>

<p>When her father took office following the assassination of President <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McKinley_c296.html" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a> (an event that "filled (me) with an extreme rapture"), Alice became an instant celebrity and fashion icon. While proud of her father's accomplishment, she also was painfully aware that his new duties would afford her significantly less of his time even as she longed for more of his attention. She was known as a rule-breaker in an era when women were under great pressure to conform. The American public noticed many of her exploits. She smoked cigarettes in public, rode in cars with men, stayed out late partying, kept a pet snake named Emily Spinach (Emily as in her spinster aunt and Spinach as in garter snake green) in the White House, and was seen placing bets with a bookie. This was simply not the sort of demeanor expected of a turn-of-the-century American President's daughter.</p>

<p>Alice, along with her father's Secretary of War, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard_Taft_3129.html" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, led the a diplomatic mission to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, the largest in U.S. history up until that time, comprised 35 U.S. Congressmen (including her future husband <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Longworth_2314.html" title="Nicholas Longworth">Nicholas Longworth</a>) and other diplomats. She made headlines wherever she went, being photographed with the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_Japan_1c74.html" title="Emperor of Japan">Emperor of Japan</a> and the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Dowager_Cixi_46e1.html" title="Empress Dowager Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, as well as attending <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo.html" title="Sumo">sumo</a> wrestling matches. In the cruise to Japan, she made a splash by jumping into the ship's pool fully clothed, and coaxed a Congressman to join her in the water. (Years later Bobby Kennedy would chide Alice about the incident, saying it was outrageous for the time, to which the by then octogenarian Alice replied it would only have been outrageous had she removed her clothes! In her biography, Crowded Hours, Alice made note of the event, pointing out that there was little difference between the linen skirt and blouse she had been wearing and a ladies bathing suit of the period.) The press dubbed Alice's part in this government-sponsored trip to Asia "Alice in Plunder Land." She brought back enough silk from China for a lifetime of beautiful dresses and would wear a beautiful strand of costly pearls given to her by the Cuban government for the rest of her life. (See photos). This diplomatic junket, and Alice's ability to keep the press at bay by becoming the center of attention, contributed to her father's successful conclusion of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Portsmouth_a0b0.html" title="Treaty of Portsmouth">Treaty of Portsmouth</a> in 1905 that ended the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Japanese_War_956c.html" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, which eventually made her father the first-ever <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> winner in American history.</p>

<p>Once, a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> visitor commented on Alice's frequent interruptions to the <a href="../../../o/v/a/Oval_Office_5cb0.html" title="Oval Office">Oval Office</a>, often because of her political advice. The exhausted President commented to his friend, author <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Wister_7734.html" title="Owen Wister">Owen Wister</a>, after the third interruption to their conversation and after threatening to throw Alice 'out the window', "I can either run the country or I can attend to Alice, but I cannot possibly do both."</p>
<p>Alice was the center of attention in the social context of her father's presidency, especially at her wedding, but she had to be very competitive to get noticed when he was around. She said of his love of attention, that he "wants to be the bride at every wedding, the corpse at every funeral, and the baby at every christening."</p>

<p>For her husband, Alice chose <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Longworth_2314.html" title="Nicholas Longworth">Nicholas Longworth</a>, a Republican <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> member from <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, who ultimately would rise to become <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker_of_the_House_526c.html" title="Speaker of the House">Speaker of the House</a>. Their 1906 wedding was the social event of the season.</p>
<p>A scion of a socially prominent Ohio family, Nick had a reputation as a Washington, D.C. playboy. The two made an awkward couple. Alice publicly supported her father's 1912 <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull_Moose_b049.html" title="Bull Moose">Bull Moose</a> presidential candidacy, while Nick stayed loyal to his mentor, President Taft. During that election cycle, she appeared on stage with her father's vice presidential candidate, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Johnson_412c.html" title="Hiram Johnson">Hiram Johnson</a>, in Nick's own district. Nick later lost by about 105 votes, and she joked that she was worth at least 100 votes (meaning she was the reason he lost). However, he was elected again in 1914 and stayed in the House for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The Longworths lived at 2009 Massachusetts Avenue home in Washington, now the headquarters of the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Legal_Foundation_c06f.html" title="Washington Legal Foundation">Washington Legal Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>During their marriage, Longworth carried on numerous affairs. As reported in Carol Felsenthal's biography of Alice, and in Betty Boyd Caroli's <i>The Roosevelt Women</i>, as well by TIME journalist Rebecca Winters Keegan, it was generally accepted knowledge in DC that Alice also had a long, ongoing affair with Senator <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Borah_84f9.html" title="William Borah">William Borah</a>, and that he was in fact the father of Alice's daughter, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paulina_Longworth_83ba.html" title="Paulina Longworth">Paulina Longworth</a> (1925-1957).<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207827,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207827,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>When it came time for the Roosevelt family to move out of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>, Alice buried a <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo_doll.html" title="Voodoo doll">Voodoo doll</a> of the new First Lady, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Herron_Taft_6499.html" title="Helen Herron Taft">Nellie Taft</a> in the front yard.<a href="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/06/07/longworth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/06/07/longworth/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> At many White House social activities such as dinners, Alice frequently mocked the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lady_1ce9.html" title="First Lady">First Lady</a>, rendering Mrs. Taft rather uncomfortable in Alice's presence though she some twenty years her junior.

<p>Alice didn't like <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_G._Harding_03fa.html" title="Warren G. Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> any more than she had Taft or Wilson. Mrs. Longworth felt that Harding was a crass man, barely educated, and ill-suited for the job. She preferred his vice-president, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Coolidge_91e2.html" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>). Her feelings toward First Lady <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_Harding_3d70.html" title="Florence Harding">Florence Harding</a> grew more strained during the Hardings' years in Washington. Alice felt that she had lost her best friend, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evalyn_Walsh_McLean_414d.html" title="Evalyn Walsh McLean">Evalyn Walsh McLean</a>, to Florence, and the relationship between Alice -- the Speaker's wife -- and the President's wife grew bitter.</p>
<p>Following the death of her husband in 1931, Alice Longworth and her daughter continued to live near <a href="../../../d/u/p/Dupont_Circle_0b4a.html" title="Dupont Circle">Dupont Circle</a> on Massachusetts Avenue, Washington's <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embassy_Row_8f81.html" title="Embassy Row">Embassy Row</a>. When asked if she would run for her late husband's seat, she declined. She did not like public speaking, seldom spoke at public receptions, and abhorred physical contact with the public and the "press of the flesh" that came so easily to her father; in short, campaigning did not suit her. Her final visits to Cincinnati were in order to fulfill obligations, not for pleasure. One such trip was made for the burial of her husband, another for the social debut of her daughter. When asked if she would be buried in Cincinnati, Mrs. Longworth said that to do so "would be a fate worse than death itself."</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, when she like so many other Americans found her fortunes reversed, Mrs. L. appeared in <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> advertisements to raise money.

<p>The widow Longworth maintained her stature in the community, socially and politically, garnering her the nickname "the other Washington Monument". Mrs. Longworth served as a delegate to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_National_Convention_c1fb.html" title="Republican National Convention">Republican National Convention</a> on more than one occasion, declining to address the Convention.</p>
<p>Alice's wit was legendary in Washington, DC; and that wit could have a deadly political effect on friend and foe alike. When columnist and cousin <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Alsop_03bd.html" title="Joseph Alsop">Joseph Alsop</a> claimed that there was grass-roots support for Republican presidential candidate, <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendell_Willkie_3ec8.html" title="Wendell Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>, the Republican hope to defeat F.D.R. in 1940, Alice said yes, "the grass roots of 10,000 country clubs." <a href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,967243,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,967243,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>Alice demolished <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Dewey_6dcc.html" title="Thomas Dewey">Thomas Dewey</a>, the 1944 opponent of her cousin Franklin, by comparing the pencil-line mustached Republican to “the little man on the wedding cake.” The image stuck and helped Governor Dewey lose two consecutive presidential elections.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/a/u/Paulina_Longworth_83ba.html" title="Paulina Longworth">Paulina Longworth</a> married <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_McCormick_Sturm_b8d8.html" title="Alexander McCormick Sturm">Alexander McCormick Sturm</a>, with whom she had a daughter, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Sturm_55e3.html" title="Joanna Sturm">Joanna</a> (b.

Following the death of her daughter in 1957 (by an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, for many years suspected of being a suicide, although Alice never agreed with that assessment), Alice Longworth fought for and won the custody of her granddaughter <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Sturm_55e3.html" title="Joanna Sturm">Joanna Sturm</a>, whom she raised. Not very long before Paulina's death, she and Alice had discussed the care of Joanna in case of such an event. In an article in <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Heritage_%28magazine%29_0b1b.html" title="American Heritage (magazine)">American Heritage</a></i> in 1969, Joanna was described as a "highly attractive and intellectual twenty-two-year-old" and was called "a notable contributor to Mrs. Longworth’s youthfulness....The bonds between them are twin cables of devotion and a healthy respect for each other’s tongue.

<p>From an early age, Alice was interested in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. Alice strongly advised her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft on the Republican 1912 ticket. While her political instincts were highly developed, she was not at all accommodating. In fact, she took a hard line view of the Democrats and was on the decidedly conservative wing of the Republican party in her youth. She was active in supporting her half-brother, Ted Roosevelt in his attempt to become governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran for president in 1932, Alice took pains to publicly oppose his candidacy. Writing in the Ladies' Home Journal in October 1932, she said of FDR, "He is my father's fourth cousin once removed. . . . Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about all we have in common. . . . I am a Republican. . . . I am going to vote for Hoover. . . . If I were not a Republican, I would still vote for Mr. Hoover this time." <a href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,753436,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,753436,00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>Alice developed a genuine friendship with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> when he was vice-president, and when he returned to California after Eisenhower's 2nd term, Alice continued to maintain an active relationship with him and did not consider his political career to be over. She encouraged Nixon to re-enter politics and continued to invite him to her famous dinners. Not forgetting this kindness, when Nixon became President, he invited Alice to his first formal White House dinner. She was also invited to the wedding of his daughter <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricia_Nixon_096c.html" title="Tricia Nixon">Tricia Nixon</a> in 1971.</p>

<p>Alice was a lifelong <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a>, like her father. This changed when she became close to the Kennedy family and Lyndon Johnson, voting Democratic in 1964 and in the 1968 Democratic primary for Bobby Kennedy. After Bobby was murdered, she supported <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. Her friendship ended when Nixon quoted her father's diary at his resignation, saying "Only if you've been to the lowest valley can you know how great it is to be on the highest mountain top", and other things TR said when Alice's mother died. At this point, Nixon infuriated Alice, who literally spat curse words at her television screen as she watched him compare his loss - due to criminal behavior- to her young father's loss of her mother and grandmother on the same day due to illness.</p>
<p>She remained cordial with Nixon's successor, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, but a minor lack of social grace on the part of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> caused her to decline to ever meet the last sitting president in her lifetime.</p>

<p>In 1965, as her chauffeur and one of her best friends, Turner, was driving Mrs. L. to an appointment, he pulled out in front of a <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxicab.html" title="Taxicab">taxi</a> causing the driver to get out and ask the chauffeur, "What do you think you're doing you black bastard?" Although the driver took the insult calmly, Mrs. L. did not and told the taxi driver, "He's taking me to my destination, you white son of a bitch!"</p>
<p>In 1958, Mrs. L. was found to be suffering from <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a> and successfully underwent a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastectomy.html" title="Mastectomy">mastectomy</a> and was again later found to have cancer that required a second mastectomy. Taking the medical procedures in stride, she referred to herself as the only "topless octogenarian" in Washington. After these surgeries, Mrs. L.'s health was not as strong as it once had been but she continued a rigorous schedule and maintained her social rounds. After many years of ill health, Alice finally died in her Embassy Row home in 1980 of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emphysema.html" title="Emphysema">emphysema</a>, <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a> and a number of other extended illnesses at the age of 96.

<p>Of her quotable quotes, her most famous found its way to a pillow on her settee: "If you haven't anything nice to say, come sit by me." <a href="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/06/07/longworth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/06/07/longworth/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> To Senator <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> she stated that the garbage men, taxi drivers and street sweepers in her neighborhood could call her by her first name, but that he could not. She also informed President <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> that she wore wide brim hats so he couldn't kiss her. When a well-known Washington senator was discovered to have been having an affair with a young woman less than half his age, Mrs. Longworth quipped, "You can't make a soufflé rise twice."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Alice was Theodore's first-born child and the last to die, surviving each of his children from his second marriage.</p>
<p>Her last public appearance was televised nationwide on PBS. It was the 1976 Bicentennial of the United States, attended by Queen Elizabeth II of England. Joseph Alsop and other friends were taken aback when she came on the screen, escorted to the head of the receiving line by her granddaughter's close friend Robert Hellman. She had her own reception line later, greeting old friends of many years for the last time— including some old timers from the White House kitchen. An upcoming book by Stacy A. Cordery will provide more details on this and other events in the twilight years.</p>
