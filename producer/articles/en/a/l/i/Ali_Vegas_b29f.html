<p><b>Ali Vegas</b> has shared many beefs display on the mixtape circuit, mainly the one with <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Clue_2208.html" title="DJ Clue">DJ Clue</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabolous.html" title="Fabolous">Fabolous</a>. The beef with DJ Clue started after Clue tried to sign Vegas to <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Storm_Records_f5c5.html" title="Desert Storm Records">Desert Storm Records</a> but Vegas refused since he would have to drop after Fabolous, a rapper who Veg felt was not lyrically better than him. Problems arose after a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle.html" title="Freestyle">freestyle</a> on a DJ Absolut <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixtape.html" title="Mixtape">mixtape</a> which showcased Vegas, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shells.html" title="Shells">Shells</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Luck_%28rapper%29_56a6.html" title="Lady Luck (rapper)">Lady Luck</a> and Team Arliss rapper Trav, who at the time was feuding with <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Budden_f0e9.html" title="Joe Budden">Joe Budden</a> (an affiliate of DJ Clue's camp). Feeling like he was taking sides with Trav, Clue appeared on <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_97.html" title="Hot 97">Hot 97</a> and asked for Vegas to apologize or he would not play any more records from the young aspiring artist. Vegas responded with a record, noticeably known as, "The Apology", airing out DJ Clue, Fabolous and Duro, an engineer and co-owner of Desert Storm. The record picked up a heavy following due to the support from the likes of <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Kool_Kid_d8b6.html" title="DJ Kool Kid">DJ Kool Kid</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Williams_%28radio_host%29_56f7.html" title="Wendy Williams (radio host)">Wendy Williams (radio host)</a>, and <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Kay_Slay_4486.html" title="DJ Kay Slay">DJ Kay Slay</a>. Even though a response from Fab's lil brother Paul Cain was released, there were only subliminal responses back to Vegas from the Desert Storm camp. The beef was ultimately ended.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Vegas_b29f.html" title="Edit section: Beef With Stack Bundles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beef With Stack Bundles</span></h2>
<p><b>Ali Vegas</b> found himself back in beef with another rapper from the Desert Storm camp, Stack Bundles. Though there are many stories of why this beef started, Vegas claims it started over an ex-girlfriend of his, who happens to be the, at the time, girlfriend of the former Desert Storm signee/newly added member of Byrd Gang from <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_Rockaway_e564.html" title="Far Rockaway">Far Rockaway</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens%2C_New_York_7318.html" title="Queens, New York">Queens, New York</a>, in which Vegas claims Stack was mad because of her steadily calling him while being in a relationship with Bundles. Also, another part of their beef is because of the locations where the rappers are from, which are somewhat rivals, but Stack claims he has nothing but love for "Southside", the nickname for Vegas' neighborhood. At this point, the beef never hit wax but a studio session with Lamar Odom and Eyes Low proved to add fuel. Vegas claims Bundles, already mad about the girlfriend situation, tried to get at him in a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle.html" title="Freestyle">freestyle</a> session, but was quickly shut down by the "Prince of New York", one of the many nicknames Vegas uses. Vegas does a freestyle with neighboring friend/rapper Vic Damone, who at the time was beefing with Bundles over who created the "Squad Up" term (Gun Squad= Vic's former crew and Riot Squad= Stacks crew), throws a light jab at Stack Bundles:</p>
<p>"Them southside gunners is back/Ain't no silencers on em, so ain't no more mumbling raps/Told Vic don't go to war unless you got your money right/He said look Veg, nigga, all my bundles is stacked, Ha"</p>
<p>Enraged by this, Stack dropped a freestyle over <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludacris.html" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> "Blow It Out Your Ass" targeting the two rappers and even showcased the freestyle on Smack DVD. Seeing that he knows the history of Stack Bundles, Vegas dropped the damaging exposal record called "Rayquan aka Stack Bundles" featuring Pete Promise, a member of R.A.P. and one of Vegas' proteges. From the "get go", Vegas spares no time and exposes Stack Bundles' history of being a background dancer in the <a href="../../../7/0/2/702.html" title="702">702</a> video of the song "Where My Girls At" with the instrumental blazing as he speaks then lets Promise finish the job. After this record is released, the beef quietly dies out.</p>

<p>Some people may remember his face from various TV appearances. First, Vegas was the leading man in the video for <a href="../../../3/l/w/3LW_0216.html" title="3LW">3LW</a>'s <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_More_%28Baby_I%27ma_Do_Right%29_e526.html" title="No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)">No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)</a> as he was the boyfriend for <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiely_Williams_4522.html" title="Kiely Williams">Kiely Williams</a> who was unfaithful to her. Secondly, Vegas was on the The Blaze Battle, a freestyle competition held in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Vegas, a heavily favorite to win, lost in the first round to the winner <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyedea.html" title="Eyedea">Eyedea</a>. Thirdly, he was featured in a <a href="../../../t/h/e/TheTruth.com_8a7c.html" title="TheTruth.com">TheTruth.com</a> commercial. Lastly, Vegas on <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap_City_%28TV_series%29_db15.html" title="Rap City (TV series)">Rap City (TV series)</a> alongside Lamar Odom and Mad Linx and a judge on <a href="../../../1/0/6/106_%26_Park_0e8b.html" title="106 &amp; Park">106 &amp; Park</a>'s <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle_Friday_26f7.html" title="Freestyle Friday">Freestyle Friday</a> competition.</p>

<p>Vegas been through "two bad deals", as he professes on his record "By Your Side". First, Vegas signed to Jean-Claude "Poke" Olivier and Samuel "Tone" Barnes's <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trackmasters_Entertainment_0ad2.html" title="Trackmasters Entertainment">Trackmasters Entertainment</a> under <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a>. The record deal seemed perfect and the album, Generation Gap, was geared up to be released but once The Trackmasters (Olivier and Barnes) lost their distribution deal, Vegas opted out of the contract and scratched the whole project. While being hardily noticeable on the scene for 2 to 3 years, Vegas returned to sign with the newly retroed <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca_Records_d12d.html" title="Casablanca Records">Casablanca Records</a> with <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Mottola_1659.html" title="Tommy Mottola">Tommy Mottola</a>, who happen to be the same guy who signed Vegas over at Sony (with his previous deal with the Trackmasters). Vegas, feeling happy about his new home, hit the lab and constructed the new album, Who Needs A Pen. But as people say <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a> is a mother, Vegas found himself leaving that label after various delays on releasing his album. Seeing that he had bad experiences with labels, he decided to create his own, Council Recordings and Rich Soil Entertainment.</p>
