<p>Shaneabbas added a sentence to the effect that Ali was born inside the Kaaba. I seen this story elsewhere, but I have never read it in any reliable source. It seems to be a pious folktale.</p>
<p>I recently set up an article called <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_veneration_for_Muhammad_273c.html" title="Islam and veneration for Muhammad">Islam and veneration for Muhammad</a> to hold such material for Muhammad -- there's a great deal of pious folklore about Muhammad, or folk practices venerating Muhammad. Since this is also true of Ali, how about setting up an article called Shi'a Islam and veneration for Ali? That could be linked to both this article and the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> article. The "born in the Kaaba" story would be relevant there. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 6 July 2005 23:51 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, sunnis also claim that somebody was born in the kaba, but they cant agree on whom:</p>
<p>You can read a bit more about it here:</p>
<p><i>Fatimah bint Asad was circumbulating the Ka'ba when she was carrying Ali (a.s.). The wall of Ka'ba cracked to create an opening and she entered it to give birth to Ali (a.s.). Al-Mustadrak 3:483.</i></p>
<p><i>no when they put the cloth up, u can still see the crack. I have seen it, its on the opposite side of hajr-e-asvad, you can see it when we are doing tawaf,</i></p>
<p><i>apparently the wahabis try to fill the crack up but it no matter what they do the crack still shows up! if abu bakr or umar were born there they would have put a sign post there!!</i></p>
<p><i>Well I am a Sunni and u said that our Imam Ali as.gif and our HAzrat Ali ra.gif born in holy Kaba... It is right and it shows the dignity of Ali ra.gif</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>Maybe you have never been there. Ask anybody who has been there. And the crack is still very visible.</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>Does it really matter if the crack was there or not? I personally spoke to many Saudi Shias who say that the Wahabi establishment used zinc to cover up the crack since that area keeps on breaking mysteriously - so some are claiming that Allah wants this miracle to live on even if the actual building was destroyed twice in history (after the birth of Imam Ali). Be this a miracle or not is a matter of personal opinion unless some photographs can be presented.</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>fortunately it is still there. When they put the covers up, and you are doing tawaf, many people go and do masah of it. and lukily for me, out of the 100 times i went 50% of the covers were up</i></p>
<p><i>^ ok guys I remember once getting an email which had pictures of the crack, i would see if i still have the email saved I would put the pictures here ( but dont count on that though)</i></p>
<p><i>Hazrat Ali razialahutalaanho He is the personality who given the name sherekhudafrom ALLAH.And he is the personality who won the battel of khaiber,and took the roots off that door called darekhaibar.And he has one more speciality that is he accept islaam in his childhood. He was born in the KABA&gt; (<a href="http://madeena.s5.com/custom.html" class="external text" title="http://madeena.s5.com/custom.html" rel="nofollow">sunni site</a>)</i></p>
<p><i>History has recorded that he is the only person who was born inside the Kabah itself.: HAKIM IBN HAZM</i></p>
<p><br />
Zora, both Shia and Sunnis agree that somebody was born in the Ka'bah. Nobody says that nobody was ever born in the Ka'ba. Remmeber the number of Sahaba thing?

<dd>No offense but it seems like sockpuppets are in play on this page. <b>I am a Sunni and u said that our Imam Ali</b>. As far as I know, Sunnis refer to Ali as "caliph ali" and not imam ali, I could be wrong but since they hold him on the same level as Abu Bakr et al, I have never heard of imam Abu Bakr or imam Uthman. As for the crack in the kaaba being there or not, they kaaba's been destroyed many times since the birth of Ali so I don't know how relevant it is... --<a href="../../../g/n/u/User%7EGNU4eva_d511.html" title="User:GNU4eva"><font color="red">GNU</font><b>4</b><font color="blue">Eva</font></a> 7 July 2005 03:12 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both Shia and sunni agree that someone was born in the Kaba, but they dont agree on whom. To say nobody did it lacks sources and is personal pov, irrelvant for an npov encyclopedia. Saying that the crack is due to it being destroid is conjecture. It might be true, it might not. If it is, bring forth one source that claims such. Otherwise, keep personal pov out of the article.</dd>

<p>This is absurd. The entire Ka'ba was destroyed in the Qaramita's time. Any crack in the current Ka'ba has nothing to do with anything that happened before then.

<p>Striver, nooo reputable historian of Islam accepts the stories that you are trying to insert. Those stories aren't in the earliest texts and they show every sign of being later fabrications. You are trying to insert them as if they were fact.</p>
<p>We give enough links to Shi'a sites that if a reader wanted to explore further, he/she would certainly read those stories and hear those claims.</p>
<p>It is not up to me to show that they are fables, it is up to you to show that they are not. Cites from Peshawar Nights are particularily problematic, since the text has been shown to be a Persian forgery. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:25, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b><i>Statement of Ali being born in Kaaba being Shia only pov is made.</i></b></p>
<p>The born in the Kaaba part is not going anywhere, since both Shia and some Sunni belive in it, ie, its not a Shia only view.</p>
<p>I finaly found a source listing Sunnis beliving in it: <a href="http://al-islam.org/restatement/7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://al-islam.org/restatement/7.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<dd>Yes, he was born in the Kaaba. This should be mentioned at least as what Shias believe to be true. Furthermore, as far as Im concerned, the majority of western academia are ignorant about the Shia. Their view DOES NOT <i>always</i> equate to fact, as Zora is forcefully trying to impose. That's why I wrote <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misconceptions_about_The_Shia_2b28.html" title="Misconceptions about The Shia">Misconceptions about The Shia</a>, to point just that.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 02:57, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a Shi'a source claiming that various Sunni scholars believed that. Frankly, all such Shi'a claims are suspect. If the earliest sources we have don't make such a bizarre claim, then it's unlikely that later ones would be more reliable. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:21, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mas'udi does in fact say Ali was born in the Kaaba in his book مروج الذهب on page 2 of Vol 2. So does Sheikh Mofid in his ارشاد on page 2 Vol 1. The same is written in السيرة الحلبيه in Vol 1 page 139. The Diwan of سيد حميرى which has been edited by شاكر هادى شكر and printed in Beirut even says it where he says: ولدته في حرم الاله و امنه و البيت‏حيث فناؤه و المسجد on page155.

<p>Well, my work is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ali&amp;oldid=27830989" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ali&amp;oldid=27830989" rel="nofollow">here</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ali&amp;diff=27876837&amp;oldid=27830989" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ali&amp;diff=27876837&amp;oldid=27830989" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), and that is what complaints where made against and then was reverted (accutaly, before the complaints). The accuracy of the article was challenged, and in the above separate sections i defended the balance and accuracy of my article. Regarding the Kaaba, it says:</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now here's my question for you -- so many of these conflict-heavy discussions with other editors break down to this repetition of Shia vs. Sunni beliefs. Is that dichotomy absolutely essential?

<dd>So far as I know, there are no EARLY traditions claiming Ali's birth in the Kaaba. The earliest written texts we have re Islamic history say nothing about this. It seems to me that if it had happened, it would have been noted by authors such as Ibn Ishaq and Tabari. The tradition seems to be a late invention. Therefore I object strongly to BYT's proposed compromise. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, i take that back. First fo all, there are no traditions of him being born elsewhere, second, nobody refutes him being born there. "Some traditions relate" imply that others relate a alternative version and "this view is not unanimous" implies that somebody refutes it or does not accept it. I have not heard any scholar refuting it, all scholars i have heard of either accept or keep quite about it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:03, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Striver, they aren't keeping quiet about it. It's too silly to refute. Anyhow, here's one Sunni site that claims Ali was born in his father's house, as one might expect: <a href="http://www.yazehra.com/fatimabint.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yazehra.com/fatimabint.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>

Regarding:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Some medieval Muslim traditions relate that he was born inside the Kaaba, the most sacred site in Islam, although this is not accepted by any contemporary academic historians.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Some" is false, it "All".</li>
<li>"medieval" is missleading, as it gives the impression that earlier traditions do not. Zora claims no early traditions recount it, but its her oppinion and that has no weight in WP</li>
<li>"not accepted" is false, no one claims it to be false, we only know that those Zora read do not mention it. Nothing more, "Not accept" is Zora pov presented as facts.</li>
<li>"any" is false, she has not presented proof of that, not even proof of "manny". And we all know how accurate Zora can be, i can right away show tree occasions where where Zora has accused Sunni sites of being Shia sites.</li>
<li>Further, it is biased to Zora pov to not mention the one AND SINGLE quote we have from western scholars regarding the matter, the one explicitly saying he was born in it.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Zora, im starting to get enough of your non-sens. Persist and we will have someone someone decide whom of us is not using due prosses, logic and sourcing. I have warned you before, DO NOT PERSIST IN YOU UNSOURCED ZORA POV PUSHING!</p>

<p>I reply:</p>
<p><br />
<b>First</b> of all, al four are both POV and inaccurate, none of the have WP standard and would be slaped with a {{TotallyDisputed}} tag i no time and warrant a total and complete rewrite. None of them are acceptable ny any means:</p>
<p>This is POV:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>With the death of Muhammad in 632, the Muslim community was for a short period without a leader, and without clear indications on how to chose the new leader</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
And this is inaccurate:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 658, Ali gave in to Mu'awiyya's criticism, and established an investigation committee.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>More Inaccuracy:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For most groups of Shi'is, the hope of a just ruling elite inside Islam, i.e. a just Islam on earth, disappeared after this.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Read: <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahdi.html" title="Mahdi">Mahdi</a></p>
<p>And that is only found in <a href="http://i-cias.com/e.o/ali.htm" class="external text" title="http://i-cias.com/e.o/ali.htm" rel="nofollow">one</a> of the four articles.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Second</b>, they omitt information between themselves, they cant even agree as to what is relvant. Considering that, it is uterly non-sense to evalate if something is encyclopedic by seeing if they have included it or not.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Thirdly</b>, our article have already information not included in any of them:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ali was also prominent on the battlefield of Uhud. He is said to have received seventeen wounds in the battle.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Will you not be pleased that you will be to me like Aaron to Moses? But there will be no prophet after me."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>All Muslims, Sunni and Shi'a alike, agree that Ali deserves these titles:</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Now, after having <b>refuted</b> what you sugestion of consult those sources:</p>
<p><br />
I take your sugestion as a way of diverting the issue, something not very uppright. I now that you did not mean anything bad. You <b>know vey well</b> that a persons place of birth is relevant to a biography, specialy when he is reported to have been born in such a unusual place. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:41, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Then, as to <b>prove the contrary</b>, i quote witness-pioneer.org, a <i><b>100% sunni</b></i> site:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Birth of Ali</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ali was born under unusual circumstances. On the thirteenth of the holy month of "Rajab", Fatima, the mother of Ali, visited the Kaaba for performing the pilgrimage. During the course of the pilgrimage while circumambulating the Kaaba, Fatima felt the pangs of childbirth. She retired to a secluded place in the precincts of the Holy Kaaba, and there Ali was born. <b>Ali had thus the unique honor of being born in the House of God.</b> This unparalleled honor has endowed Ali with a halo of sanctity, which has become the subject of many legends. A hundred years later, Zain-ul-Abidin a grandson of Ali (son of Husain) met as Arab woman at Najaf who told him that her grandmother had helped on the occasion of the birth of Ali. She narrated that according to the account of her grandmother, the child was beautiful, a smile played on his lips, it did not cry like other children, and its birth did not cause any pain to his mother.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Name</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fatima wanted to name the child "Asad" after the name of her father. Abu Talib wanted to name him Zaid. When the mother and the child came home, the Holy Prophet, and Khadija came to see the newborn child. Since his birth, the child had not opened his eyes, and that worried Fatima and Abu Talib. As the Holy Prophet took the child in his lap he opened his eyes. The first person that Ali saw after his birth was the Holy Prophet. When the Holy Prophet was asked whether he approved of the child being named as Asad or Zaid, he said that <b>as the child was born in the House of God, he should be named Ali, the word Ali being a derivative of Allah.</b> Ali had thus the distinction of being named after Allah. No person before him had ever been so named. The name acquired further sanctity as it was proposed by the Holy Prophet.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
So, having that said: <b>i repeat my question</b>:</p>

<p>I believe this is a Sunni source, regarding the birth of Imam Ali in the Holy Ka'ba:</p>
<p>Hakim in his Mustadrak and nuru'd-din Bin Sabbagh maliki in his Fusulu'l-Muhimma, Fasl 1, p.14, say: "No one before Ali was born in the Ka'ba. This was a distinction given to Ali in order to enhance his honor, rank, and dignity."</p>

<hr />
<p>Ali is quoting from Peshawar Nights, Persian forgery, see this refutation <a href="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/beshawer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/cults/beshawer.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. A quote from this refutation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Books besides the Sahihayn are all subject to scrutiny of their isnads to determine to what extent they conform to the criteria of authenticity. There never has been a claim, neither by the authors of these works, nor by anyone else, that these works incorporate exclusively authentic material. Muhaddithin like al-Hakim, the author of al-Mustadrak, and Ibn Hibban, the author of at-Taqasim wal-Anwa‘ (commonly known as Sahih Ibn Hibban), have attempted to follow the example of al-Bukhari and Muslim by documenting only authentic ahadith, but their criteria, as well as the extent to which they abided by those criteria left a lot to be desired, and consequently came under censure from later muhaddithin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indiscriminate quoting from these works would therefore only occur if a person suffers from one of two defects: ignorance of the science of hadith; or a Machiavellian attitude of the end—-in this case the conversion of the Ahl as-Sunnah—-justifying the means. Either of these defects is sufficient to disqualify anyone as an objective polemicist."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not that I accept hadith, or the science of hadith, as authoritative unless accepted by those academic historians who study them (which is not all historians). Accepting 12th century evaluations of tradition is like accepting 12th century science or medicine: pointless and retrograde. Still, quoting da'eef hadith doesn't prove a thing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:50, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
