<h2><span class="mw-headline">Breakout article</span></h2>
<p>It's hard to step back and see it but ... usually when there's intense partisan skirmishing over the <i>exact</i> wording of a sentence or two, that means that the sentence is taking more weight than it should have to bear. Probably the topic deserves a breakout article, where both pro and con views get to have their full say, instead of having to compress everything into subtle nuances of word choice.</p>
<p>"The Shi'a view on Ali ibn Abi Talib" is a bad choice of title -- it screams POV fork, disallows criticism, and is ungrammatical to boot. But this article could be the place to have FULL discussion of Shi'a claims for Ali, with the Shi'a getting to put in all the hadith refs and the academic historians getting to say "medieval fable". <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:51, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zora, the "x view of" concept has precedens, you are not getting ridd of it. But suggestions are nice. Further, you have not presented one single academician saying "mediaval fable", we only have your personal view. If you manage to make any of the points contested with sourced and relevant information, i could consider not having it on the main page, however, you have not. <b>Zora pov is personal pov is irrelavant to WP</b> . --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:10, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Very impressed by these Shia hadiths</span></h2>
<p>Striver, I am astonished at the range of Shia hadiths that I have come across in the last few days. I have read what seems like only a drop in the ocean. As a historian, I regularly come across reports of various events, although mostly documenting events in ancient Mexico and Egypt. But I have never experienced such detail and such a volume of texts about almost every issue. Could you, or any other person for that matter, refer me to a few basic books on Shi'ism (not sure if I should call it that). I am also trying to make sense of this wikipedia article, which seems to neglect a whole bundle of information about Ali ibn Abu Talib. I understand that it is an encyclopedia, but surely someone of this importance deserves a more thorough account. I have recently read the Nahjul Balagha. It's quite incredible. In the meantime, good luck to you, Zeresk and Zora for your work. Richard-cambridge 20:24, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very very much for your encouraging words! Brother in humanity, what i have pasted is only Sunni hadith, i have not presented a single Shia hadith, since they do not have any value to the ongoing argumantation. Yes, Nahj al-Balagha i INCREDIBLE! OMG, did you read his letter to Malik ibn Ashter? The letter is wholy incredible and i am no surprised one bit that the United Nations where impressed by it. Even Christian or ateist would be blown away by the ideas in it, not even mentioning that it was written for 1400 years ago!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dear folks..Who ever put Ali;s picture should know that it is considred offensive in both Shia and Sunni Islam.If you ar still determined to put it,at least put up a warning at start of article like there is on the article about Bihais about their leader.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Shias have a incredible detailed account of their history, and the reason is simple: We did not give in to oppression. When the Umayyads where adamant in rewriting history by having having death sentence on pro-Ali hadith and having giant hadith burning, Shia kept the hadith with their life on stake. We did not give in to the mass brainwash of the Bannu Umayyad, when they for generations made it obligatory to curse Ali in the mosque speech of every Friday. That is the reason that we have 10 times more hadith than the Sunnis. I was writing a article about that, sourced, of cource, when Zora and BYT reverted my works so far and refuse me to give any valid reson for it. As soon as i have succeeded in re-introducing the facts you mentioned where missing, ill continue with that article.</dd>

<dd>There is also a downside to having such a wealth of <i>undiscovered</i> texts. Namely, western people like Zora, who (refering to their western sources), have never even heard or seen such sources, will claim them unreliable or un-academic. And that's a shame, because it will continue to keep them ignorant about the Shia. The amount of unpublished texts from Shia sources is staggering. Example: the treatise written by <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughatil_ibn_Bakri_fc36.html" title="Mughatil ibn Bakri">Mughatil ibn Bakri</a> has not even been published. I just happen to have a copy of a translation of it given to me by my uncle who is in contact with people at the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Library_of_Astan_Quds_Razavi_6523.html" title="Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi">Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi</a>, where a manuscript is kept. There is enough unpublished Shia material to easily become the topics of dozens of PhD dissertations for western students of islamic studies.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 05:19, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zereshk, please don't start copying Striver's idiosyncratic reference methods. Also, it would be good if you found some better references than URLs to "booksearch" results. Those are likely to be unstable.</p>
<p>I moved your arguments out of the main section and down to the Shi'a section. They're still there.

<dd>As for the instability: if the link ever breaks, I will replace it. I monitor the page and its refs. <b>Or...</b>, I can provide the link to an LOC entry, instead of BN and Amazon.

<p>Mir Seyyed Ali Hamadani Shafi'i, one of the eminent sunni scholars, in his Mawaddatu'l-Qurba, and the well known anti-Shia scholar, Ibn Hajar, in his Sawa'iq-e Muhriqa narrate from Ummu'l-Mu'minin Umme Salma, the wife of the Prophet, that the Holy Prophet said: "O Ali, you and your Shias will abide in Paradise; you and your Shias will abide in Paradise." The well known scholar of Khawarizm, Muwaffaq bin Ahmad, in his Manaqib, Chapter 19, relates on reliable authority that the Prophet said to Ali: "In my community you are like the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary." This statement implies that as the followers of the Prophet Jesus were divided into three groups: the true believers, known as hawari'in, the Jews, and the exaggerators, who associated him with Allah. In the same way Muslims would become divided into three groups. One of them would be the Shias, the true believers. The other group would be Ali's enemies, and the third group would be the exaggerators of his position.</p>
<p><br />
In addition, Mir Seyyed Ali Hamadani Faqih Shafi'i says in the second of the six Mawadda in his book Mawaddatu'l-Qurba, quoting a narration from Anas Bin Malik, that the Prophet said: "Verily, Allah made me superior to all the prophets, chose me for excellence, and made for me a successor, my cousin, Ali. Through him, He strengthened my shoulders, just as the shoulders of Moses were strengthened by Aaron. He, (Ali) is my vicegerent and assistant. If there were any prophet after me, it would have been Ali, but there will be no prophet after me."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The following sunni sources have narrated that the Prophet ordered that all the doors of the houses opening toward the mosque be closed except the door of Ali's house: Ahmad bin Hanbal in Musnad. Volume I, page 175, Volume II, page 26 and Volume IV, page 369; Imam Abu Abdu'r-Rahman Nisa'i in Sunan and in Khasa'isi'l-Alawi, pages 13-14; Hakim Nishapuri in Mustadrak, Volume III, pages 117-125 and Sibt Ibn Jauzi in Tadhkira, pages 24-25 have testified to the reliability of this hadith on the basis of chains of narrators of Tirmidhi and Ahmad. Again, Ibn Athir Jazri in Athna'l-Matalib, page 12, Ibn Hajar Makki in Sawa'iq Muhriqa, page 76, Ibn Hajar Asqalani in Fathu'l-Bari, Volume VII, page 12, Tibrani in Ausat, Khatib Baghdadi in his Ta'rikh (History), Volume VII, page, 205, ibn Kathir in Ta'rikh, Volume 7, page 342, Muttaqi Hindi in Kanzu'l-Ummal, Volume VI, page 408, Haithami in Majma'u'z-Zawa'id, Volume IX;, page 65, Muhibu'd-Din Tabari in Riyadh, Volume II, page 451, Hafiz Abu Nu'aim in Faza'ilu's-Sahaba and in Hilyatu'l-Auliya, Volume IV, page 183, Jalalu'd-Din Suyuti in Ta'rikhu'l-Khulafa', page 116, in Jamu'l-Jawami', in Khasa'isu'l-Kubra, and in La'aliu'l-Masnu'a, Volume I, page 181, Khatib Khawarizmi in Manaqib, Hamwaini in Fara'id, Ibn Maghazili in Manaqib, Munawi Misri in Kunuzu'd-Daqa'iq, Sulayman Balkhi Hanafi in Yanabiu'l-Mawadda, page 87, devoting the whole of Chapter 17 to this very issue, Shahabu'd-Din Qastalani in Irshad-e-Bari. Volume VI, page 81, Halabi in Siratu'l-Halabiyya, Volume III, page 374 and Muhammad bin Talha Shafi'i in Matalibu's-Su'ul and many others, particularly from among the prominent companions of the Holy Prophet, have narrated the same thing. For instance, Caliph Umar Bin Khattab, Abdullah Ibn Abbas, Abdullah Bin Umar, Zaid Bin Arqam, and Jabir Bin Abdullah Ansari have confirmed the reliability of this hadith. Some of your prominent ulema, in order to save the people from being misled by the Bani Umayya, have emphasized the truth of this hadith. Muhammad Bin Yusuf Ganji Shafi'i, in his book Kifayatu't-Talib, chapter 50, has dealt with this hadith under a special heading. Quoting from authentic sources, he says that since a number of doors of the companions of the Prophet opened towards the mosque, and since the Prophet had forbidden everyone to enter the mosque in the state of janaba or haiz (pollution making the ritual bath essential), he ordered that all doors of the houses be closed excepting the door of Hazrat Ali's house. He said, "Close all the doors; but let the door of Ali's house remain open." Muhammad Bin Yusuf Shafi'i says that it is peculiar to Ali that he was permitted to enter and stay in the mosque in the state of janaba. He goes on to say: "In short, the Holy Prophet's conferring this privilege exclusively on Ali was a great honor. It shows that the Prophet knew that Ali, Fatima, and their descendants were entirely free from impurity, as is clearly shown by the 'verse of purity' in the Holy Qur'an." These remarks of a Shafi'i scholar may be compared to the hadith mentioned by Hafiz Sahib. Leaving aside all the authentic sources we have quoted, if you have any proof of Abu Bakr's purity, please present it. The fact is that even Bukhari and Muslim in their collections of traditions have pointed out this fact that a polluted person cannot stay in the mosque. The Prophet said, "It is not permitted for anyone who is polluted to stay in the mosque except for me and Ali." Perhaps I may be allowed here to quote a hadith from the second Caliph, Umar Ibn Khattab, which has been reported by Hakim in Mustadrak, page 125, by Sulayman Balkhi in Yanabiu'l-Mawadda chapter 56, page 210, and by others, like Imam Ahmad Bin Hanbal, Khatib Khawarizmi, Ibn Hajar, Suyuti, and Ibn Athir Jazri. He said: "Verily, Ali Ibn Abi Talib possessed three outstanding merits. If I possessed any one of them, it would have been better for me than red-haired animals (camels): (1) The Prophet gave his daughter in marriage to him; (2) The Prophet ordered that all the doors of the houses opening towards the mosque be closed except the door of Ali's house; (3) The Prophet bestowed upon him the flag (of Islam) on the day of the Battle of Khaibar."</p>
<p>Mir Seyyed Ali Hamadani Shafi'i has recorded many hadith in his Mawaddatu'l-Qurba, which supported Ali's excellence. In the seventh Mawadda he quotes from Ibn Abbas that the Holy Prophet said, "The best of men of all the worlds in my period is Ali."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ali first to convert</span></h2>
<p>Some of the Shi'a editors revised the article to read that Ali <i>was</i> the first male to convert to Islam. A great many references were given, some of them popular rather than academic biographies, some of them late works, and some of them deceptive (Tabari quoted as supporting the claim, when in fact he relates stories supporting all three claims). That kind of thing really cannot stand. It is just not OK to state one side of a controversy as if it were the truth, and suppress any mention of other POVs. I have created a breakout article called <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_of_first_male_Muslim_361e.html" title="Identity of first male Muslim">Identity of first male Muslim</a> where the issue can be discussed at length, and removed the argumentation from the Ali article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:46, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you want to include alternative views, that's fine. I have no problem. My problem is with you putting that alternative view of yours as the main <i>fact</i> on the main page, and deleting and sending off the other views (which you cant accept) to a new separate page. That is unacceptable.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Zereshk, you reverted to a version in which it IS stated as fact that Ali was the first male convert, and which gives at least one cite that is actively deceptive, the Tabari cite. My version just says that the claim is controversial, and refers the reader to another page. This is absolutely NEUTRAL. It is not stating my view as fact.</dd>

<dd>Zereshk, it is simply NOT TRUE that a majority of scholars say Ali was the first. The majority of academic scholars don't care. That list of references you copied and pasted "proving" that Ali was the first is highly suspect. I don't think you've read all -- or perhaps even any -- of those sources. The only one that I can confirm is Ibn Ishaq. The Tabari cite is deceptive, as is the Karen Armstrong cite. (She just says Muhammad's whole household converted, and lists the members. Besides, it's a very weak cite -- she's a popularizer, not an Islamic scholar.) Don't list a reference you haven't read, or don't have! Don't claim a majority when you haven't even read much in the field. So far as I know the score card is: Shi'a believe that Ali was first; Sunni are split; academic scholars will sometimes say one or another of the three possibles is likely, but they are never all that sure, or all that interested in the question. Leave it at that. Readers can draw their own conclusions. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:58, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, but of the three quotes given by Zereshk that I can VERIFY with books in my possession, two are deceptive. They don't say what he says they do. Hence it's safest to assume that the rest of his quotes can't be trusted either. I don't think HE can verify them, as I suspect that he just copied them from somewhere. Nor is it particularly useful to draw conclusions based on the length of quote lists -- one strong early cite outweights a thousand late medieval fabulists. Look, I'm accepting that you guys can speak to the Shi'a POV on priority -- I haven't seen any Shi'a material that contradicts it. I don't think you two have read widely in Sunni sources, and you have certainly read next to nothing of the best-regarded academic authors. So any judgements you make re Sunni or academic views are not to be trusted. You can't speak for your opponents. You can't summarize the material as "most authorities agree that Ali was the first" because it simply IS NOT TRUE. As I said, most academics don't care about the question. Watt is one of the few academic authorities to even mention it, and he plumps for Zayd.</p>
<p>This is a question that makes sense in terms of a Shi'a-Sunni debate. It is completely beside the point for non-Muslims.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What's wrong with Zora?</span></h2>
<p>Zora is pissed off as heck by Striver's continual reverts to a version that is a LIE, dang it. That version says all Muslims agree that Ali was born in the Kaaba; that's a lie. I put up a link to a Sunni web page a while ago where it was said that he was born in his mother's house. I have never heard any Sunni making this claim for Ali, even if it can be found in a few hadith. Striver removes the link to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthplace_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_6654.html" title="Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> and adds his pet article, <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_born_in_the_Kaaba_26a7.html" title="People born in the Kaaba">People born in the Kaaba</a>, the very title of which assumes his point. Striver asserts that it is a majority belief that Ali was the first convert; this is a LIE. Striver is removing references given in the mode used by EVERY OTHER WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE AND EDITOR and putting them in his preferred format, in which all bibliographic data is hidden in a separate article. He's making it difficult for the reader just because he likes creating articles. Instead of being able to assess the dates and publishers of all the references in one glance, as is normal in scholarly bibliographies, the reader would have to click the link for every dang reference and then try to REMEMBER the data for comparison. That's a good way to hide dodgy references.</p>
<p>Is this what Shi'a Islam stands for? Lying? I find it hard to believe that any educated Shi'a of good character would approve of Striver's actions.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>

<p>The so called "Sunni web page" is Shia, and it explicitly and totaly refutes the notion of Ali being born anywhere outside of the Kaaba. Try to read what you link to.

<p>You are correct that <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_born_in_the_Kaaba_26a7.html" title="People born in the Kaaba">People born in the Kaaba</a> is a POV tittle, so i renamed it to <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_reported_to_be_born_in_the_Kaaba_82f7.html" title="People reported to be born in the Kaaba">People reported to be born in the Kaaba</a>.

<p>The reason i gave refereance in that way is just to be more clear, i figured it was better to see the name of the source right away, rather than a <sup>[1]</sup> linking to a note in the bottom of the article.

<p>FIRST MUSLIM: *ALL* Muslims agree that the very first MALE to have accepted Islam is Ali bin Abi Taleb. The Sunni-Muslims claim that the first MAN is Abu Bakr. The difference between the first MALE and first MAN is that Ali was only 10 years old when he accepted Islam. Nevertheless, Ali accepted Islam before any other MALE. You might disagree but are you the guardian of Islam or an Islamic scholar??</p>

<dd>Striver, even "all Muslims believe in God" is inappropriate. It is certainly possible (and possibly certain) that some people who identify themselves as Muslims do not believe in God. You can say, "ah, but then they are not Muslim", but this statement makes a number of assumptions about the nature of religious or communal identity, i.e. that a person cannot define their own religious identity for themselves, that they must accept certain fundamental tenets of the faith to claim the identity, that a person who suffers from a crisis of faith has temporarily ceased to be a member of that faith, and so on. Perhaps all these things are true, but they are not so clearly true that Wikipedia can state them and assume them as simple fact. I really find it very unencyclopedic. If someone said "All Christians believe Jesus was a good man" I wouldn't even accept that, either. Speaking about what "all" members of any group believe is not the language of an encyclopedia, because in reality we can never know what all members of any group feel about anything. To claim otherwise is a statement of faith, not fact. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:48, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But that is simply NOT TRUE. Ibn Ishaq doesn't tell this story. Tabari doesn't tell this story, so far as I know. Neither do Waqidi or Ibn Sa'd. None of the early sources tell it. It seems to me to be a later invention designed to exalt Ali. It's going to be an interesting search to find out the when and where and who of the first narration. Striver, you keep making claims for ALL Muslims, or ALL sources, or ALL traditions, when your Islamic knowledge seems to be limited to what you can find with Google.

<p>I again tried to strip out argument and exaggerated claims for Ali and keep the article as neutral as possible. This included removing material that I had previously let stand. Now that I have copies of Watt's books, it's easier to see what is from the earliest sources (Ibn Ishaq, Tabari, Ibn Sa'd, and Waqidi) and what is later hadith material. (Watt relies almost exclusively on the earliest sources he can find, and treats hadith as unreliable.) Ali's bravery at Uhud isn't found in the earlier sources, per Watt. Neither is Muhammad's declaration, said to have been made before the departure to Tabuk, that Ali is to him as Aaron was to Moses. That's hadith material, not repeated in Watt.</p>
<p>I had previously thought that the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia_view_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_1fae.html" title="Shia view of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Shia view of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> article was useless, but perhaps it might be the place to expand on some of these contentious matters. However, Striver and Zereshk are going to have to allow some critical views in that article too. Sunni Muslims criticize the Shi'a for ignoring Muhammad and treating Ali as the central figure in Islamic history. Those views should be there.</p>
<p>I understand that this is extremely painful for the Shi'a here. The more I delve into these matters, the more it seems to me that popular Shi'a Islam is based on the mythologizing of history. I'm not saying that this is ALL there is to Shi'a Islam -- if it were, Islamic scholars like Reza Aslan, who follows the Western academic tradition, would not still be Shi'a. Christianity survived its collision with higher criticism and I suspect that Shi'a Islam will survive its collision with modernity too.</p>

<p>Thank you Zora, this was a informative talk page contribution where you explain your motives. More of this!</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>

</dl>
<p>Sister in humanity, Watt is Watt. Watt is not a representative for the non-Muslim view, any more than that the Montgomery is a representative for the non-Muslim view (remeber the Umar quote?). in fact, Your previous oftern quoted wilfered madelung in the preface of his <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Succession_to_Muhammad_%28book%29_3e0d.html" title="The Succession to Muhammad (book)">The Succession to Muhammad (book)</a> refuted Watt:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"work with the narrative sources, both those that have been available to historians for a long time and others which have been published recently, made it plain that their wholesale rejection as late fiction is unjustified and that with [not without] a judicious use of them a much more reliable and accurate portrait of the period can be drawn than has so far been realized."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So this means that one scholar (Watt) not liking hadith, rather going for early sirats, does not warant to expunge all hadith material from all Islamic articles, in fact it does not warant more than mentioning just that and nothing more in the appropriate article.</p>
<p>If you relly want, we can start each article with:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Note: <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt.html" title="Watt">Watt</a> rejects <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a>, while <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilferd.html" title="Wilferd">Wilferd</a> refutes him.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And then continue the article with saying what comes from Haidh sources and what comes from sirat.</p>
<p>And you know what? Now that you have becom such a big fan of Watt and Tabari, i guess you will agree to include the tabari part where Aisha is quoted as saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Kill the old fool (Na'thal, ie Uthamn) for he is a unbeliver (kafir)!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Or does that not qualify? If not, how come?</p>
<p>Actually, what the "early" scholars did is nothing more than collect hadith. For some bizar reason, Watt belived that the less isnad they recorded, the more credible they where. He is entitile to that view, but that is not a representetive view.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ali's bravery at Uhud isn't found in the earlier sources, per Watt. Neither is Muhammad's declaration, said to have been made before the departure to Tabuk, that Ali is to him as Aaron was to Moses. That's hadith material, not repeated in Watt.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So what? Are you seriously proposing that we exclude everything Watt does not like? Wilfered uses Hadith literature, and so does '<i>all</i> Muslim scholars. And yes, they are scholars, they are not biased goofs only because they are Muslims.</p>
<p>This does not warant to expunge the hadith texts, only to be more carefull with sourcing it to hadith, and then in the Western view of Ali have a go at it and explain what Watt belives and why. In fact, ill do that right away.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I had previously thought that the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia_view_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_1fae.html" title="Shia view of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Shia view of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> article was useless, but perhaps it might be the place to expand on some of these contentious matters.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Its not a "contentious matter" that Muhammad said he was like Araon, neither is Alis bravery at Uhud. We only have Watt making sweeping alegations of fabrications against all hadith.</p>
<p>I really dont understand why you dismiss everything you dont like as Shia pov. It is beyound me. All Sunnis agree that the Aron quote is authentic, but you want to shuv it into the Shia view article. Well, that belongs to the Non-Muslim view article, in the same way that when the Shia reject some naration, they get to do it in the Shia view article.</p>
<p>This means nothing more than Watt can have a section in Western view of Ali where he can say he hates hadith and dosen't belive in any of them, and then repeat that those parts are in the hadith literature. That have nothing to do with either the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Ali_e6a0.html" title="Shi'a view of Ali">Shi'a view of Ali</a>, nor <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_view_of_Ali_a942.html" title="Sunni view of Ali">Sunni view of Ali</a>, since all Muslims and a portion of the non-Muslims dont rejet hadith. You can also have Qur'an only Muslims view of Ali, where they can explain that there is no reason to belive anything about Ali, no mater where it is narrated, sira or no sira. If we are going to follow your logic, then we should start by expunging everything "Qur'an only Muslims" muslims reject, since they are the most "strict"/"demnading" group.</p>
<p>It is enough that it is understood that Quran only Muslims dont follow Hadith &amp; and Sira, it does not need to be repreated in every article. Same with Watt, there is no need to repeat everywhere that Watt reject hadith, it is enough to state it in the "non-Muslim view of" article.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, Striver and Zereshk are going to have to allow some critical views in that article too. Sunni Muslims criticize the Shi'a for ignoring Muhammad and treating Ali as the central figure in Islamic history. Those views should be there.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, that is a part of the [Sunni view of Ali]] to explain in detail why we are mushriks for saying "Ya Ali", the Salafis can have a big section for making takfir on me. And of course, we can mention it breifly in the main article together with a link to the main article. And of course, also having a short section where Shia can refute the non-sense of holding Ali higher then Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I understand that this is extremely painful for the Shi'a here.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Not one bit. I love to have huge articles where we can expose the Salafi filth they spew, and also some of the normal clear headed arguments of good normal Sunnis like User:BYT. And the Shia answer to it.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The more I delve into these matters, the more it seems to me that popular Shi'a Islam is based on the mythologizing of history. I'm not saying that this is ALL there is to Shi'a Islam -- if it were, Islamic scholars like Reza Aslan, who follows the Western academic tradition, would not still be Shi'a.

<p>You are entitle to your pov, and there is no problem as long as you can remeber it is your pov.</p>

<p>Yes you are. You still reject "all Muslims agree that there is 100 000 Sahaba" to be Shia pov. That is laughable, enraging and incredible. After realising you look like a fool for that, you somehow came to the conclusion that Sunni also belive that since Shia belive that, as if Shia where in any possition to influense Sunni scholars... Totaly incredible... Then when i removed that piece of unsourcable original research, you reverted! Totaly surreal...</p>
<p><br />
Start by understanding that you cant remove entire sections of history only because Watt does not like hadith, or Watt prefers to belive Zaid was the first muslim, based on admited conjecture.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of hadith material</span></h2>
<p>I don't think that there's necessarily a contradiction between Watt's and Madelung's use of hadith, just a difference of emphasis. Watt doesn't want to use them if he can avoid it. Madelung is willing to use them AFTER he has made his own evaluation (based on many years of study) as to the usefulness of particular hadith. He is <i>re-doing</i> the work of Bukhari and Muslim, not just accepting it. The Shi'a approach to hadith is more on the order of combing the standard hadith collections for quotes they can use to support their position, and trumpeting them as proof that Sunnis believe this too, nyah nyah -- completely ignoring the fact that there are OTHER hadith that contradict them. That is why scholars are supposed to spend years studying hadith, so that they can make informed judgements as to what MIGHT have been Muhammad's opinion or practice, weighing and judging the various traditions. That's exactly what Madelung has done, but bringing to his task a great many more tools for scholarly thought, and a secular scholar's lack of pre-determined agenda. Shi'a seem to assume that all Sunni accept all hadith as 100% true -- which is not at all the case. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I should say, that's the use Shi'a make of hadith in Shi'a-Sunni debates (not in internal jurisprudence, presumably).

<dd>Seems to me that this is what you and Zereshk are trying to do with your reliance upon lists of hadith, as well as your arguments that if you can find one Sunni hadith that supports the Shi'a position, then of course Sunni and Shi'a, all Muslims in fact, agree on the point you're trying to make. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:01, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yes Zora, and that is the only correct way to act. There is no alternative way of doing it. If we can find sunni <b>scholars</b> that <b>authenticate</b> a hadith, and there is no Sunni scholar disputing that authentication, and Shia do the same, then it is safe to claim the Shia and Sunnis agree on the authenticity of that hadith. That is simple sourcing and stating facts, nothing to do with pov. It is you that do not accept that ridiculy simple line of understanding, and every time i prove that Sunni and Shia agree on somthing, you delet it while yelling "Shia pov" and any other non-sense excuse you can come up with.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strange perspective, Zora</span></h2>
<p>I have been reading the thread for the past few days, and I must say, as a non-Muslim, this is all a great read. People usually have to pay for this. I studied a Masters in History and Latin, and, being geeky historians, we had regular debate sessions of historiography. But I have never seen so much detail about documenting certain accounts of events as the Shia referencing and transmission reports. I actually do not understand what Zora is aiming at. If an incident is documented by reporters who are accepted by the Shia, and it is also documented by reporters who are accepted by the Sunni, yet Sunnis in general, disagree with the implications of the report, then certainly there is something going on with the motives of Sunni scholars. It seems as though many of these reports that I have come across seem to be rejected by Sunnis, not because they are unauthenticated, but because they do not sit comfortably with the Sunni perspective.</p>
<p>It is therefore slightly strange of Zora to claim that the Shia try to use reports to support their view. Rather it is clear, to me at least, that on many occasions, the Sunni have used reports that clearly contradict explicit verses of the Qur'an and have rejected reports used by their own scholars. It seems however that, on many occasions, the Shia believe in their beliefs <b>because</b> of the authenticated reports, not vice versa. For example, it seems clear to me that the biggest incident that defines the split is the day when Mohammed appointed Ali as his successor. I have never come across any reports about Abu Bakr being appointed. Now it seems odd to me that Mohammed, after all his trouble of trying to establish some kind of order, or his religion, that he would be so passive as to his legacy and succession.</p>
<p>And even stranger is the Sunni acceptance that Mohammed is their master yet rejecting that Ali does not have the same level of authority, even after Mohammed's speech. Surely Sunnis want to follow Mohammed, but scholars take a perspective that seems to go against him. This is a perspective of the type that I have been taught to question. A certain trend of bias towards the caliphs seems to occur in the Sunni quarter; something that I had never realised previously. Nevertheless, a good read. --- --- William Edmundson, 23:53, 6th December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you understand the historiography here, William. We are not talking about first-hand reports at all. We are talking about supposed oral traditions written down anywhere from 150 to 250 years later. If you've studied history at all, you understand that oral traditions can mutate tremendously during such a time period -- particularily when claims to wealth, power, and religious legitimacy are based on such claims, and numerous succession disputes and civil wars have intervened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The hadith collections recognized by the Sunnis were assembled by medieval scholars using medieval methods -- they are both biased and contradictory. Sometimes the scholars accepted a dicey hadith because it supported some interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and they were unwilling to abandon a legal principle, or question a supposed narrator in the chain of narrators. Some Western historians believe that hadith are ONLY useful as reflecting the circumstances of the time that they were recorded, not the time they supposedly narrate. Other Western historians are willing to use them if aforesaid historians have enough of a historical background in the various religious and political disputes involved, as well as in the biographies and genealogies of the narrators, to try to make some sense out of hadith. NO academic historians accept the views of the Sunni and Shi'a ulema as to the veracity of the hadith collections; the ulema accept them for religious reasons, and the academics doubt anything accepted for such reasons, unless it can be verified by historically sound methods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Sunni collections are highly diverse. Tradition-minded Islamic scholars believe that it takes a trained professional to read the hadith collections and come to an acceptable conclusion as to what the hadith say. That means accepting some hadith and rejecting others. There's NO account of events that will make sense of all the hadith. Well, I suppose there are Muslims who will dispute that. Some Salafis feel that laypeople can interpret hadith -- but usually they limit themselves to what are supposed to be the best collections, Bukhari and Muslim. Then they ignore contradictions &lt;g&gt;. Kinda like Protestants reading the Bible -- no interpretation needed, everything is perfectly plain. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're assuming that your ideas re dynastic succession were accepted by 7th century Arabs. There's much historical and ethnographic evidence to suggest that <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shura.html" title="Shura">shura</a>, choice of a new leader by the prominent men of the clan or tribe, was the standard practice in Muhammad's time. You're also assuming that Muhammad "knew" that his community would live on, hundreds of years past his death. However, the historian Fred Donner argues that the early Muslims expected an imminent Judgment Day, and that planning for the future when there might not be any may have seemed pointless. Of course, no Muslim writers take this point of view because that would mean admitting that Muhammad could not forsee the future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that Muhammad didn't appoint Ali his successor. Arabs at the time certainly knew that the Byzantine and Sassanid empires believed in dynastic succession (even though successions were often highly ... <i>irregular</i>). Muhammad MAY have felt that the Sassanid model was better for his community. I'm not sure that there's enough historical evidence to <b>prove</b> this one way or another, whatever the Shi'a or Sunni say. The evidence has been completely muddled by centuries of oral transmission and controversy. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora, William Edmundson gave his view of the Shia-Sunni debatte, and you came in and claimed both are wrong. What does that have to do with what he wrote?</p>
<p>He wrote that both Shia and Sunni agree that Muhammad said "homsoever im <a href="../../../m/a/w/Mawla.html" title="Mawla">Mawla</a> of, Ali is <a href="../../../m/a/w/Mawla.html" title="Mawla">Mawla</a> of", and the Sunni interpretaition of that is strnage - You answered that some Non-Muslim dont belive he said that. <b>SO?</b> What does the non-Muslim view have to do whith what he wrote, he wrote about things that Shia and Sunni belive are authentic and how they evaluate it, not a word about Non-Muslims.</p>
<p><br />

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I most certainly do understand the historiography concerned. I think that many people are unaware that much of the documented events in history are treated as accurate, even though the incidents were actually recorded any where between 50-200 years later. Had this not been the case, we would almost certainly have had no historical accounts of anything whatsoever. Another point that seems to confuse people is this idea of the unreliability of oral tradition. Actually, it is very much the <b>identity</b> of the narrators of an incident that is important, not the difference in time between its first-hand acknowledgement and its later record on paper. A historian who has studied the principles of historiography must consider not the time that has lapsed, but the nature of the chain of narration. It may well be the case that a liar has reported an incident that has never occurred, or a negligent person has reported an inaccurate account of events. Both may have done so from a first-hand perspective. Their report, however, would be worthless. William Edmundson 01:35, 7th December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The hadith collections recognized by the Sunnis were assembled by medieval scholars using medieval methods -- they are both biased and contradictory. Sometimes the scholars accepted a dicey hadith because it supported some interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and they were unwilling to abandon a legal principle, or question a supposed narrator in the chain of narrators. Some Western historians believe that hadith are ONLY useful as reflecting the circumstances of the time that they were recorded, not the time they supposedly narrate. Other Western historians are willing to use them if aforesaid historians have enough of a historical background in the various religious and political disputes involved, as well as in the biographies and genealogies of the narrators, to try to make some sense out of hadith. NO academic historians accept the views of the Sunni and Shi'a ulema as to the veracity of the hadith collections; the ulema accept them for religious reasons, and the academics doubt anything accepted for such reasons, unless it can be verified by historically sound methods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Sunni collections are highly diverse. Tradition-minded Islamic scholars believe that it takes a trained professional to read the hadith collections and come to an acceptable conclusion as to what the hadith say. That means accepting some hadith and rejecting others. There's NO account of events that will make sense of all the hadith. Well, I suppose there are Muslims who will dispute that. Some Salafis feel that laypeople can interpret hadith -- but usually they limit themselves to what are supposed to be the best collections, Bukhari and Muslim. Then they ignore contradictions &lt;g&gt;. Kinda like Protestants reading the Bible -- no interpretation needed, everything is perfectly plain. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're assuming that your ideas re dynastic succession were accepted by 7th century Arabs. There's much historical and ethnographic evidence to suggest that <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shura.html" title="Shura">shura</a>, choice of a new leader by the prominent men of the clan or tribe, was the standard practice in Muhammad's time. You're also assuming that Muhammad "knew" that his community would live on, hundreds of years past his death. However, the historian Fred Donner argues that the early Muslims expected an imminent Judgment Day, and that planning for the future when there might not be any may have seemed pointless. Of course, no Muslim writers take this point of view because that would mean admitting that Muhammad could not forsee the future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would have to disagree with you with regards to Mohammed's belief as to the longevity of his community. There seems to be a vast range of reports, accepted both by the Shia and the Sunni, with regards to the fact that Mohammed was deeply concerned about his ummah after his death, and that he had made a promise of a messiah figure that would appear many generations after his death. Even if one were to reject the idea that Mohammed was a man of prophecy, if one accepts these reports, as the Sunni and Shia have clearly done, they should both believe that Mohammed <b>was</b> concerned about his legacy, the religion, the state, his ummah, succession, etc. William Edmundson 01:35, 7th December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that Muhammad didn't appoint Ali his successor. Arabs at the time certainly knew that the Byzantine and Sassanid empires believed in dynastic succession (even though successions were often highly ... <i>irregular</i>). Muhammad MAY have felt that the Sassanid model was better for his community. I'm not sure that there's enough historical evidence to <b>prove</b> this one way or another, whatever the Shi'a or Sunni say. The evidence has been completely muddled by centuries of oral transmission and controversy. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's far from clear that Muhammad ever made such a speech.

<dd>I would like to see Madelung's reason for dismissing the report of Mohammed's speech. It seems to be an incident that is strongly documented. I personally have not come across many other incidents like it pre-1400 CE. William Edmundson 01:35, 7th December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Try reading Madelung's book, <i>The Succession to Muhammad</i>, Fred Donner's book, <i>The Early Islamic Conquests</i>, and perhaps, for an overview, <i>The Formation of Islam</i>, by Berkey. If you feel that the Sunni ulema have manipulated history, try reading <i>God's Caliph</i>, by Crone and Hinds.

<p>Your version is original research, uncourced and unsourcable. Ill give you a example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"No academic historian supports the Shi'a claim.".</li>
</ul>
<p>As if Shi'a scholars were not academics.</p>
<ul>
<li>"One hadith accepted by Sunni Muslims states that Hakim ibn Hizam, a rich Meccan convert to Islam, was born in the Kaaba. However, this claim does not seem to be widely accepted or publicized."</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is all about Hakim ibn Hizam in your version.</p>
<ul>
<li>"However, most Sunni historians, if they mention the matter at all, say that Ali was born in his mother's house, as one would expect."</li>
</ul>
<p>unsourcable original research.</p>
<p>Your article simply does not cut it. On the other hand, my article does not take the pov stance of having the Ali birthplace as the center of the article, and mentioning the other guy "by the way", but gives both narrations the same amoung of atention. Further, it sources most claims.</p>

<p>Strawman argument, my article does not claim he was born there. The conclusion "therefore he must have been born in the Kaaba" is entirly your own, i have never formulated such a thing. However, "there are no alternate traditions as to where Ali was born" is factual and relevant.</p>

<p>You are reffering to a section in the "Muslim view" section. Are you claiming that it is unsourcable?</p>

You clearly haven't read any of the material save Madelung (you must have gotten a copy of it recently, as you're now quoting from it). Yet you're presuming to doubt my reading, of which I have given ample proof. You really MUST let non-Shi'a speak for themselves. You often give your own summaries of what Sunni and non-Muslims believe and when you are told that your summaries are biased, you go on the attack. Look, Ali's birthplace is not mentioned in Madelung, Watt, Crone, Berkey, Donner, Shaban. (I'm still waiting for Hugh Kennedy's book, which I ordered on dgl's recommendation). Those are major sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I just now went to my Questia account and search for any material on the birthplace of Ali. Nothing. Tradition is not even mentioned. Here are the first two paras from a recent biographical dictionary (<i>The Rise of the Medieval World, 500-1300: A Biographical Dictionary</i>, Jana K. Schulman; Greenwood Press, 2002):</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>‛ALĪ IBN ABĪ TĀLIB (600–661). ‛Alī is the son-in-law and paternal first cousin of the prophet Muhammad as well as the father of Muhammad’s grandchildren, Hasan and Husayn. Questions about ‛Alī’s position in the early history of Islamic rule led to the division of the Muslim community into Sunni and Shiite factions. Whereas Shiite Muslims recognize ‛Alī as the first imam (the legitimate religious and political leader of the Muslim community), Sunni Muslims consider ‛Alī the fourth and last of the so-called rightly guided caliphs. ‛Alī ibn Abī Tālib, born around the year 600, competes with Abū Bakr al-Siddiq, the first rightly guided caliph of Sunni Islam, over the claim to be the first male convert to Islam after Muhammad. ‛Alī’s father, Abū Tālib, had taken care of Muhammad after the latter lost his parents and his grandfather. Although Muhammad is about thirty years older than ‛Alī, early sources describe the relationship between the two as being very close.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It mentions the dispute re priority, but NOT the claims to birth in the Kaaba.</p>

<p>sorry Zora, but im pretty sure you have the minority view here. UN is one of the bigest organizations in the world, and it addresing, even quoting large part Ali's letter specificaly (not inderectly) is noteworthy. UN does not quote 700 centuries people every day, and specialy not in their role as Muslim Caliphs. Specialy not when doing so in a atempt to influence its membembers. They doing it is extraordinary and meets every qualification of notability.</p>

Yet you're presuming to doubt my reading, of which I have given ample proof. You really MUST let non-Shi'a speak for themselves. You often give your own summaries of what Sunni and non-Muslims believe and when you are told that your summaries are biased, you go on the attack. Look, Ali's birthplace is not mentioned in Madelung, Watt, Crone, Berkey, Donner, Shaban. (I'm still waiting for Hugh Kennedy's book, which I ordered on dgl's recommendation). Those are major sources.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Zora, i dont demand you to give me quotes proving what you said, i belive you and take you on your word. I wrote that "non-Muslim scholars are skeptic and dissmissive" of the narration. That is the best you get from silence, you dont get "they deem it to be a fabrication". "skeptic and dissmissive" is a good deal. That is what they do, dissmisse it from their books, and you interpret it as a skeptical aproach. Acctualy, "skeptical" is to much without they expresing skepticism regarding it.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I just now went to my Questia account and search for any material on the birthplace of Ali. Nothing. Tradition is not even mentioned. Here are the first two paras from a recent biographical dictionary (</i>The Rise of the Medieval World, 500-1300: A Biographical Dictionary<i>, Jana K. Schulman; Greenwood Press, 2002):</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You should take that "Nothing. Tradition is not even mentioned." as a proof of lack of alternative narrations of his birthplace, you know that non-Muslims would be all over it if it existed a alternative narration.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>‛ALĪ IBN ABĪ TĀLIB (600–661). ‛Alī is the son-in-law and paternal first cousin of the prophet Muhammad as well as the father of Muhammad’s grandchildren, Hasan and Husayn. Questions about ‛Alī’s position in the early history of Islamic rule led to the division of the Muslim community into Sunni and Shiite factions. Whereas Shiite Muslims recognize ‛Alī as the first imam (the legitimate religious and political leader of the Muslim community), Sunni Muslims consider ‛Alī the fourth and last of the so-called rightly guided caliphs.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>‛Alī ibn Abī Tālib, born around the year 600, competes with Abū Bakr al-Siddiq, the first rightly guided caliph of Sunni Islam, over the claim to be the first male convert to Islam after Muhammad. ‛Alī’s father, Abū Tālib, had taken care of Muhammad after the latter lost his parents and his grandfather. Although Muhammad is about thirty years older than ‛Alī, early sources describe the relationship between the two as being very close.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That article let a pov slipp in, it gave Abu Bakr the honorific "al-Siddiq".</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It mentions the dispute re priority, but NOT the claims to birth in the Kaaba.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It also did not mention that Ali broke the door of Khaybar with his own hands. Im not surprised. In fact, it dint even mention that Ali was the only one that dared to face the hero that jumped over the moat in the Battle of the trench. Or that he followed in all the battles, exept the one he was promoted to guvernor of the capitol city. It didnt even mentin that he warrior. However, it does not mean that Jana K. Schulman was "skeptical" or even "dissmisive" regarding Ali being a warrior or that he regards everything he did not report with a "skeptical" or even "dissmisive" view, even less that his exclusion can be interpreted as he branding it as fabrictation.</p>
<p>However, a patern of Non-Muslim Islamic scholars not addresing the narration of Ali being born in the Kaaba warants "dissmissive". "Dissmissive" of the born in the Kaaba is a fair catch, i even throuhg in "skeptical" in the deal, that is more than fair.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You have some standing to speak for the Shi'a (though I suspect that many Shi'a would not agree with you),</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I have only seen one single Shi'a not endorsing everything i have writen, that was outside Wikipedia in a swedish forum, but he didnt bother to comment what he thought could be improved, after me asking for his involvment. Two, if you include my father giving me advice of things i <i>plan</i> to include.</p>
<p>That is a good record, not a single Shi'a Wikipedian editor has questioned anything i have writen or done, talk page included. One actualy gave me a Barnstar for representing the Shi'a view, another told i represented 100 000 Shi'a. I see no reason for questioning the validity of my ability of representing Shi'as.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>but you really shouldn't insist on defining the conflicting traditions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You have no problem in doing so, and i see no reason to give upp my right of representing views i do not endorce, while you retain that right.</p>
<p>If you feel that i represent them in a inacurate way, then i invite you to share that, so we can see what argumets are most firm, and everntualy reach consencus.</p>
<p>Having that said, i feel that i have responded to your concerns and given satisfacory justifications for my stance, and are now going to restore my prefered version.</p>
<p>I appreciate your raising the concerns you raised, and i await your repons to my respons. Peace. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:30, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
