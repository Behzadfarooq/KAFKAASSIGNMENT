<p>Although Alienware is often praised for building some of the fastest systems on the market, they have been criticized recently for various quality control issues and for their poor technical support department. There currently exists a very vocal community of angry Alienware customers who claim to have been victimized by Alienware's allegedly shady business practices. Some such customers have developed web pages so that others may avoid sharing similar experiences. Such web pages include: <a href="http://www.alienwaresucks.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alienwaresucks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alienwaresucks.com</a> and <a href="http://www.nethervault.com" class="external free" title="http://www.nethervault.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nethervault.com</a> and <a href="http://www.badsoftware.com/alienwaresucks" class="external free" title="http://www.badsoftware.com/alienwaresucks" rel="nofollow">http://www.badsoftware.com/alienwaresucks</a>.</p>
<p>-- Might wanna also mention how alienware is notorious in the tech community for their outrageous prices. Im surprised the page doesn't even touch on this, im not saying we should slander the company, but when i think "alienware" I think markup.</p>

<p>Why is the criticism gone again? Now it reads like an ad, with no mention of their customer-service issues, nor the massive markups.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jay 12:49 22nd May 2006 I'm unregistered, but calling non-gamers "n00bs" I felt was too derogatory and non-neutral so I changed "n00bs" to "newbies and inexperienced computer users". Hope this is okay. I also added citation needed?</p>
<p>Why would the customer service section be 'objective'? They have you talk to foriegn people for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours... until months have gone by and then tell you "sorry nothing we can do, you're outside of warranty!". Must be cheaper to pay Indian call centers then it is to sell functioning equiptment.</p>

<p>Nelson Gonzalez redirects here. For me that's the same as Bill Gates redirecting to the Microsoft article. If someone knows how to do it - please fix it (or at least let me know. i'll do it&#160;:-)))</p>

<p>This article should be somehow changed or merged due to the aquisition by Dell Inc. I'm not sure how this takes place so I have just suggested it instead of doing something wrong. <a href="../../../g/s/i/User%7EGsingh_0955.html" title="User:Gsingh">Gsingh</a> 03:17, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe that while it is owned by Dell, it should be kept seperate. Alienware will still be run as an independant body. This is completely different from Compaq which was not only made into a portion of HP when it was bought out but also wholly assimilated. The Compaq website in now just a redirect to HP.com which sell both HP and Compaq computers. To my understanding, Dell and alienware are to keep completely seperate domains. Also, Compaq has its own seperate article compared to HP, just as Emachines has a seperate article from Gateway. *shrug* Keep it as is I say or merge several companies. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyranis_b7cb.html" title="User:Shyranis">Shyranis</a> 02:39, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct, Sir. And on a related note, you mention "Dell, Inc." which was once known as "Dell Computer Corporation". At the time I wrote the paragraph you (and anybody else are reading now, this article referenced "Dell Computers". If all goes well, that will read "Dell, Inc." by the time you (or anyone else) reads this.... --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngrykeyboarder_f67d.html" title="User:Angrykeyboarder">angrykeyboarder</a> 10:21, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well its obvious when Dell means cheaper and put out faster it means outsource all of Alienwares jobs and technology to China, because majority of Dell PCs are made in Communist China, and it will take all credibilty from the name Alienware. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwag_6c07.html" title="User:Gwag">Gwag</a> 1:31, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ive been hearing great stuff from PCmag and all those other rating companies. Then I hear from you guys that they're pieces of crap. I don't know who/what to believe. Someone give me the highlights of these [Alienware] systems,please.</li>

<li>I think that people bash alienware because they need to vent there anger out on something. My friend reacently got an alienware area 51 (intel chip based) and I drilled him on how he likes it and he's said that he's had no problems from alienware or the computer and says its running beautyful. I think that we shouldnt blame the apple tree for a few bad apples. Just because a few people have had a few defective products doesnt mean that the whole company is bad. Its almost that same think as being racist but its with computers instead of people. also if your a big gamer most people just build there own pcs. Pheifdog</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe they bash Alienware because they sell systems with engineered periodic failures. I spend $3300 dollars on a desktop replacement that burned up three mainboards in 14 months, and they will do nothing for me.</p>

<p>Taken from the "Acquisition" section of the article: "This has caused a lot of controversy with gamers. Alienware was a favorite among them while Dell supposedly caters to consumers and inexperienced computer users."</p>
<p>This is false and misleading. The acquisition has caused almost no controversey at all, and furthermore Alienware is NOT a favorite among gamers. Quite the contrary - any gamer you question will laugh at the THOUGHT of purchasing an Alienware machine in contrast to just builindg their own or possibly upgrading a lower end system. Actually, you could say Alienware was a perfect buy for Dell because they, too, cater to inexperienced users. They simply cater to the rich, inexperienced users. -<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndTasked_b157.html" title="User:EndTasked">EndTasked</a> 11:50, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You're wrong, EndTasked. Any gamer you question would laugh at the thought of purchasing an Alienware? How many gamers are you around? None, right? I am a gamer and I have an Area-51m m7700 and it is awesome. And it is not just me, I have talked to a lot of other gamers and they said they would buy an Alienware in a second if they had the money. --Rigist 02:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's what me, my brother, and his friend all say, Rigist. We would all buy Alienwares. It doesn't matter if you're a gamer who likes to build your PC, you can still upgrade the Alienware (you can even customize the Alienware on their site). <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadishar_e5a7.html" title="User:Padishar">Padishar</a> 00:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I've deleted vandalism, jibberish, and a bunch of other crap. One of the other things I have been deleting is people spamming the article by saying Alienware used to compete with them when I have never heard of them and was unaware of their existence, this isn't the place for 1 person computer company spammers. Anyway, I'm not a bot(viewing my other contributions should prove that much), and I have only been making legitimate changes to the article.

<li>Ahh I see, you're the one adding a lot of the vandalism and crap that I've been deleting. I'll keep doing it if necessary, the fact that you are a disgruntled customer should not allow you affect the public viewpoint of the company. I don't own an Alienware, I'd never buy one, but that's because I know enough that I could build my own and think all manufacturers are overpriced. If you had the money and lacked the knowledge and needed to buy a PC, there's nothing arong with an Alienware, and they certainly don't purposely engineer periodic failures, that's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. -<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Payne_5aa2.html" title="User:Mike Payne">Mike Payne</a> 15:32, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I really think the criticism section needs to be added. I also plan to add (in wikipedia-worthy language) how alienware uses tactics like including top quality power supplies and motherboards, but always seems to use inexpensive out-dated CPUs, GPUs, and RAM. They really brag about how cool their systems are, when they are truly pieces of crap that are worth about 1/2 of their sale price. Check www.alienware.com and compare their components to www.newegg.com . (I will write this well, I just don't have time now) Any objections?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you were to do some research, you would realize that Alienware systems are actually pretty competitively priced with other manufacturers, and offer many of the same parts. Alienware's CPUs, GPUs, and RAM are the same ones you will find when you build a computer with any other manufacturer, and of course you will be able to those parts for cheaper when you order everything seperately and build it yourself. It's the same case with any manufacturer. I really wouldn't go as far to call Alienwares "pieces of crap". <a href="../../../v/l/c/User%7EVlcmdude_3117.html" title="User:Vlcmdude">Vlcmdude</a> 01:27, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
