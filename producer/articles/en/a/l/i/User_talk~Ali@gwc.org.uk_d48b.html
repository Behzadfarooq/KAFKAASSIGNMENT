<dd>to be honest I'm not too bothered what licence I use for these, obviously I can't imagine making money out of selling these pics! But I'm a little concerned about the commercial sites which rip off the entire wikipedia content wholesale with little or no credit to wikipedia. As I say I'm not that bothered about and if it was a case of free licence only or they would have to be removed then I would be fine with applying a free licence. I'm open to suggestions! --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli%40gwc.org.uk_d4f6.html" title="User:Ali@gwc.org.uk">Ali@gwc.org.uk</a> 12:10, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are moves afoot to remove non free images (see <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images</a>). Sites that use wikipedia content with no credit to wikipedia are definately violating the gfdl anyway. Most mirrors of wikipedia content do attribute it to wikipedia though i agree they try and make it as non-obvious as they think they can get away with. On the other hand once a user notices the link to the real thing i don't think they are very likely to go back. It is strongly reccomended (due to possible license compatibility issues depending on exactly how the licesnse is interpreted) to put images you create yourself for wikipedia under the gfdl.</p>
<p>As well as the fact that wikipedia is supposed to be free (as in the FSFs twisted definition of free) and noncommercial use licenses go against this they also create issues for any future dvd-rom or print editions of wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 12:29, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree the commercialised mirror sites are a pain but putting images under a nondcommercial license doesn't really help with them (its pretty common to just link the images direct from wikipedia in which case they haven't copied them anyway). <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 12:29, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice in combination with the above plaint, that you are mislabeling contributions as <i>rv vandalism</i> that aren't anything of the sort. Please be careful. In this case I found, the change of <i>BC</i> to <i>BCE</i> for the article's dates was reverted back and labeled vandalism when in fact, it is more appropriate, particularly in a global and not-necessarily-christian context, to use BCE (Before our Common Era) rather than a religious-specific abbreviation like BC (Before Christ) in academic circles.

<p>Please keep in mind that to wikilink years and days all over an article is meaningless. Example: <i>"his orders are dated <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>"</i>. What is so special about a date of the order of his draft?</p>
<p>Just like we don't link the words <a href="../../../r/u/l/Ruler.html" title="Ruler">ruler</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">army</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">man</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest.html" title="Southwest">southwest</a>, etc., in each and every article, there is no sense to link 1943 or <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a> everywhere. A rule of thumb: would you like to see the corresponding entry in the "<a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>" or "<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a>" article?</p>
<p>Please take a look into the "<a href="../../../o/v/e/Overlinking.html" title="Overlinking">Overlinking</a>" article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 04:02, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with you regarding years when they are on their own, but see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Preferences#Date_format" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Preferences#Date_format" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates_and_numbers)#Date formatting] for why dates should be linked. IMO there should be a way of marking a date for processing by the date preference code without wikilinking it but at the moment there is not. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli%40gwc.org.uk_d4f6.html" title="User:Ali@gwc.org.uk">Ali@gwc.org.uk</a> 04:12, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you're saying if the year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> appears 232 (or even <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> times in one article, each and every instance of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> should be linked? What could the possible reasoning be behind that be? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelic_Wraith_6ed7.html" title="User:Angelic Wraith">Dan</a> 05:55, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, years (and months) on their own should not be overlinked. But dates should be, to allow the date format preferencing mechanism to work. e.g. October 5 2005 looks weird and confusing to me and most non-americans, but written as [[October 5]] [[2005]] this will be formatted according to each user's preferences, 5 October 2005 in my case. As an another common example, if someone writes e.g. 9/11/2001 then many people will wonder what happened on the 9th of November. IMO it's a misfeature of the wiki software that the same wiki code is used for linking and indicating dates for preference-based formatting but that's the way it is at the moment. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli%40gwc.org.uk_d4f6.html" title="User:Ali@gwc.org.uk">Ali@gwc.org.uk</a> 15:03, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Ali—you may be interested in putting your name to, or at least commenting on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#A_new_parallel_syntax_for_autoformatting_dates" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">this new push</a> to get the developers to create a parallel syntax that separates autoformatting and linking functions. IMV, it would go a long way towards fixing the untidy blueing of trivial chronological items, and would probably calm the nastiness between the anti- and pro-linking factions in the project. The proposal is to retain the existing function, to reduce the risk of objection from pro-linkers. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 15:06, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
