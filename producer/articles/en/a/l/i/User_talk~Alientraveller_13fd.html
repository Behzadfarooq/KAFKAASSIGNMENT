<p>Other than that, definitely nicely streamlined and an improvement from yesterday's revision.

<p>hi - i added a link to a blog with info about the dark knight and you removed it. i think it is good to keep there because it contains information about the making of the film, and someone who is interested in it enough to look it up on wikipedia might want to check it out, and it doesn't hurt to have it there, it just adds to the info on the page. 24.69.67.173 12:56, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, Wikinew, for all the work on TP. I like the electric head shot the best, since it's clearly part of the Transported Man act, whereas the other one could be anything (although I think it's a better pic of Jackman). Here's to going GA soon!</p>

<dd>WikiNew! No criticism intended. Your edits have been great, especially the cite related ones. Some of the ones adding more detail to plot have been trying (not yours, but from others, particularly those from people who have never contributed before and are IP addresses only). I am worried about the volume, though, and how it might be perceived. What do you think vis-a-vis the stability issue?</dd>

<p>But why do we need two images that do nothing for the plot besides eye candy? Bond and Vesper in the elevator? I don't see how we can prove the fair use that. The images may have the right license tag, but they don't explain a rationale for fair use nor give copyright credit to anyone. I think it only needs 1 image and we need to find a better image that best sums up the movie. I mean, Revenge of the Sith has 2 pictures, with a longer plot, but both kind of illustrate some of the biggest parts of the film. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 12:32, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, gambling table was what immediately came to mind for me. I mean, the movie spends like 1/3 of it's time, at least, at Casino Royale, I think we can safely say that's a major plot point. Either the gunbarrel, or some action sequence with Craig. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 12:38, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi there! I do clearly understand "NPOV". It has nothing to do with that. As far as I have seen all reviewers (both those who support the film and those who did not like it) agree on this issue.

<p>Don't a lot of FA-class articles refer to the actor in parentheses the first time they are mentioned? A cast section is often frowned upon, even for a production this large.

<dd>Congratulations on the GA award. I know you worked hard for it. I'll have to read through JP later, don't have the time to go through it thoroughly right now. I did check out the plot for LOTR. It looks good, but it's been awhile since I've seen it. Did the explaination of Bilbo getting the ring come so soon? I thought it happened later. Other than that it looks good, it's a long movie and so will have a little longer plot, plus there is a lot going on. I tweaked a couple things. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 15:47, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I think that the headache of dealing with the POV pushers is part of the price we pay for a public encyclopedia. With a few notable exceptions, I think the vast majority of the people posting POV are doing so out of a genuine concern that the movie is going to damage how Persians (Iranians) are perceived.</p>
<p>Whether this comes from a lack of the entertainment saturation (that allows most folk in the western hemisphere to develop a more disciminating taste as to truth or falsehood) or from a cultural fear of being undervalued by a world in which they feel they are constantly playing catch-up - the end result is that they are going to argue long and hard to make sure their point of view is voiced. We just have to consistently reassure them that we aren't editing in any bias - pro-west or pro-east - and remain consistent in that. Most of them will come around. The rest will either go away for get themselves bounced out for failing to abide by the rules. I find it to be a learning experience, wherein I am learning how to be a better editor and spot the nuances of policies I have come to know almost by heart (sick, ain't it?). I heard about the Casino Royale thing.It sounded like a right stupid argument.</p>
<p>As for the film, I kinda liked it, but groaned at some of the overdone clichÃ©s in speeches. The visuals were stunning - and this was all the more fantastic when I went out and borrowed my brother's comics of the GN. I and my date noticed that the Persians all seemed to be people of color (she is Asian and I am hypersensitive about the lack of positive portrayals of people of color, having worked in advertising). Then my date (the smarter of the two of us) pointed out that the Persian Empire - much like the Egyptian Empire that preceded it and the Roman Empire that came after - employed folk from all around the Empire. that some of them would be dark folk is reasonable. If there had been black folk in the 300, I would have found that to be pandering, as Sparta has been described as a very closed, homogenous society.</p>
<p>In short, it is a guy movie - blood and guts, some sex and hot gals getting all nipply, and some righteous dudes beating the snot out of anyone who crosses 'em.

<p>Already reverted it to a prior, relatively un-vandalized state. I am currently going through and re-adding edits that were not POV-trash or vandalism.

<p>Hi Wiki-newbie. You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=114886194&amp;oldid=114885128" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=300_%28film%29&amp;diff=114886194&amp;oldid=114885128" rel="nofollow">reverted an edit of mine</a> without explanation on the <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_%28film%29.html" title="300 (film)">300 (film)</a> article. Using a revert tool is acceptable only in cases of clear vandalism, which my edit clearly was not. Rollback of another user's good-faith editing is considered extremely poor form. Looking through your contribution, I'm concerned that you may be over-using your revert-tool to undo things that are not obvious vandalism. As a courtesy to other editors you ought to provide an edit summary explaining your changes (why, for example, a perfectly legitimate link to a reputable academic source discussing the movie's historical accuracy ought to be excised). I understand that this movie attracts a great deal of criticism (and thus tendentious edits to the article), but the link was a reputable published source--exactly the type of source that Wikipedia aims to include in order to counter random people from inserting their personal opinion instead. So, in the future, if you want to remove sourced content from a fellow Wikipedian, at the very least you should do a manual edit and provide an explanatory edit summary. All the best.â€”<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, I should probably have chosen a different user warning template, since you didn't 'add' information. Anyway, even if you don't think the user is editing in good faith, there is no need to remove the talk section. Also, if you keep it, others will see what you are talking upon and contribute to the discussion. So, basically, you aren't solving anything by destroying the section since it isn't blatant trolling. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 18:17, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see the box for Temp Page, but, as I have never created on or used one, could I impose uponm you to tell me how to do it?

<p>Seriously, though. I know from your example what to put <i>into</i> the temp page, but I haven't the html skills to create a temp page like I described. Could I be a pain and ask you to do it?

<dd>I see. The screener shown as part of the mktg promotional at the convention showed that image, with the Persian ambassador's and Stelios' quipps about fighting in the shade. That's why it was placed in the Marketing section.

<p>I think that the film article needs an expanded Reception section. I'm not so good at trying to balance opinion about the film, though the reaction has been split down the middle, which makes things easier. Also, I'm not crazy about the writing style of the last paragraph in Themes. Someone else wrote it, and I never got around to copy-editing it. (Phrases like "A subset of reviewers (Anderson, Brussat)" just bother me, as it feels incomplete.) I've always wanted to nominate it for FA status, but I never got around to taking care of these two things before nominating it. I'm still sort of on my wikibreak (last day of spring break for me today), and not sure if I'll be returning soon -- got a busy week ahead of me when I resume classes. Basically, other than what I've mentioned, I think that the film article is in excellent shape. I gotta admit, though, I wonder how scathing the candidacy review will be, haha. â€”<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 22:08, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well so do I find it offensive when I try to improve an article and you just discredit it like that by reverting. If this article is going to be a feature article eventually you are going to have to let people try to improve it sir. You must we unaware of my work on wikipedia. I haven't been given many awards particularly James Bond awards if I haven't significantly contributed to articles and imporved Bond films on wikipedia. I have written articles like <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbas_Kiarostami_1c17.html" title="Abbas Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Maltese_Falcon_%281941_film%29_190e.html" title="The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)">The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)</a> so please give me a chance. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:09, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look, I didn't mean to be offensive but look if this article is going to be a featured article eventually you are going to have to let people try to improve it. I too am a seasoned editor and have written countless GA's and been given awards for my work also on Bond films -so my work has clearly been of some value. I wouldn't have had three articles on the front page in three days if I didn't know how to improve or write an article. And that cultural form is important maybe not the character but that scene took an enormous amount of time to develop and is discussed very much in the behind the scenes look at the dvd. YOur suggestion seems good - how about I add it in the talk page until we can decide what to do with it? Sorry about my tone but i don't appreciate you reverting as if I am some young kid messing it up . Also my family are Christian and I know editing wikipedia is not against any belief I'm just curious why ypu guard the page so strongly <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess I owe you an apology for barking at you but I also find it offensive when any of my efforts or attempts at trying to improve it or at least guide it are thrown out within seconds. All the best and I hope we can come to some agreement in the talk page-there are some important elements missing about the filming which is discussed strongly in the behnd the scenes analysis of the film <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah thats right. I agree that the character is not important but the behind the scenes look and the filming and techniques is very notable and is discussed strongly on the dvd. I feel a top article should address such important processes in how the film was made <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really do think we need a section on the behind the scenes look at the film. Many of the important details are missing. This should be developed in the talk page What do you think? To revert everything is like saying the article is perfect when it is not. It's very good but I guaratee you if it is eventually going to be a feature it needs such details -that little bit extra <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:53, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah. I see now why you have been guarding the page!!! It is not only a GA nominee but I beleive you have done substantial work on this and wouldn't want anyone to add something which might affect its promotion from a B to GA. Ahh!!! I did exactly the same thing with <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbas_Kiarostami_1c17.html" title="Abbas Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a>!! Give me a slap on my bald evil spectred head for my aggression!!! I don't know what got into me I guess I am not used to anybody reverting any work I do!) Seriously though I respect that this means a lot to you to have another GA and I won't touch the article itself until it is a GA. THen I really think we need to think about that new section which will hopefully take it to the top level. When I have time I will try to write it in the talk page until it can be added-but note I don't want to do this if I think after my efforts to try to improve are rmeoved as soon as they are added.

<p>The article is not only missing such details on the production though but has anyone ever thought about the missing sections on the script writing and cinematography?

<dd>It appears that you lumped my edit in with the edit that immediately preceded mine, which was the one that deleted the last two paragraphs. As you can see by the article's edit history, I've been restoring those paragraphs when they've been deleted by some other apparent vandals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what you're referring to about the mystery. Did you not want the summary description to include a description of what the machine does? I can't see why, because later paragraphs of the plot description seem to assume that knowledge. Also, in general, wikipedia is a place for information, not mystery. -<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Crawdad_39f2.html" title="User:Captain Crawdad">Captain Crawdad</a> 19:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe you are confusing what machine does with the trick that Angier performs with it. The machine's functionality is shown during the Colorado Springs scene. The climax of the film only explains how Angier used the machine to perform a trick. The machine's functionality should be described when it is shown in the movie. To withold that information distorts the plot of the movie and confuses the summary. -<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Crawdad_39f2.html" title="User:Captain Crawdad">Captain Crawdad</a> 20:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The film is revealed to be science fiction at Colorado Springs, when it is revealed that Tesla's machine creates exact duplicates of objects.

<p>You don't want any trivia to the article? Your not going to let anybody in are you.

<p>Well I am having second thoughts about that as 1. The article is already as GA and many other articles clearly need improving 2. It is very time consuming to immediately come up with a fully written sunmmary of both DVDS. 3. I have zilch confidence in you that you'll like it anyway. I don't have time to waste if you are only going to revert 2 seconds later so am very dubious at adding even another word. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>"S.P.E.C.T.R.E"</b></font></font></a></sup> 16:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey I know you aren't picking on me. YOu are right that FA class articles don't have trivia sections. Trivia section is a sign of a lack of comprehension to incorporate it into paragraphed writing. I also respect that you are trying to keep it at the highest possible standard. Soon enough I will watch it again and make some notes on paper. Then I can relay it on the talk page and we can have a go at writing the missing section together agreed?

<p><b>Comment</b> - The imdb has no naming of Star Trek XI. It is just called Star Trek so (film) would be highly appropriate and correct. ALthough on certain sites the wroking title appears to be XI -I'd suggest mentioning it in the first sentence</p>

<p>I agree its come on nicely today. I did first try the awards in what was going to be a tidier table but it was too bloated. I really think the details should be kept on it though as it provides encylcopedic information on acclaim of the film. I might think of some way to improve the aesthetics of that section.

<p>I think it would be great if I could take a screenshot of the rig used during the Venice house filming and add it to the special effects section.

<p>You are still quite negative about everything. Why? What do you mean two cast sections. I think the article needs one more final image that of Mr. White. He is not featured in any of the pictures yet is a major enough of a character to have his own article. If we added one more image of Mr White at the end of the cast section I beleive it would really help it for completion. With some copy editing I think this is nearly ready for a FA <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>â™¦ Sir Blofeld â™¦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>"S.P.E.C.T.R.E"</b></font></font></a></sup> 21:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK thats cool. I have watched the documentaries again in full and I can confirm that the summary is very good filling in info on those key scenes. There is now no detail missing at all from this.

<p>If you have no objection eventually I would like the write the awards section fully into a concise section taking away the list that I know you also don't really like. However I'd like to see the awards section strucutred a bit better to make reading the info easier.

<p>True, but we still have to look at Wiki's other guidelines for articles themselves, and these "early" film articles barely have enough reliable, verifiable, and non-speculative information to actually support themselves. I'm not saying "don't allow the information", just keep it where it's appropriate until we can substantiate a reason to actually have it's own page. Most "early" film articles are ones that are based on something (e.g. books, comics, previous films), and so their extistence is really more essential to those respective pages until the film actually starts to get made. Unlike films that are "original" (I use that lightly in today's world), which people really don't know about until they start getting made, or until a trailer comes out for them. How many projects has Jim Carrey attempted to start in the past couple years, and how many got off the ground. They are just now trying to re-establish the Carrey/Tim Burton film <i><a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripley%27s_Believe_It_or_Not%21_%28film%29_a5d0.html" title="Ripley's Believe It or Not!

<p>Yeah, there's so many great films whose Wikipedia articles are incredibly underdeveloped. I'm trying to pick and choose what projects I'd like to work on.

I might be bold and nominate <i>Fight Club</i> as an FA after a peer review; I'm not sure how many more resources I can milk (besides the DVD commentaries) for more information. <i>The Fountain</i>, of course, just need to find some time to get my head wrapped around the interpretative plot of <i>The Fountain</i> and its connotations. And <i>Spider-Man</i>, of course... sometimes I regret starting on that, 'cause it is a pain to find decent online sources for a title that scores a ridiculous amount of Google hits. I know there's some print sources, but I probably want to finish my semester before I start digging up stuff from the library. I'll try to keep an eye out for books on the films that you've mentioned, too, and pass quality information along to you. â€”<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 13:03, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I realized I didn't answer your question about exploring the mythos of Transformers. While I did have some exposure to Tranformers when I was younger, I never actually got into that particular universe. I've actually read the first two issues of the prequel comic book, but I don't think that these issues address the <i>real</i> Transformers (best known in their Earth form) yet. I have to admit, there were issues in the cartoon that bothered me, like the lack of consideration for mass displacement and so forth. I'm glad that Bay took realism into consideration; from what I've seen, it's going to be jaw-dropping to see all the parts move into place. I presume you've seen the TV spot that IGN posted, "The Hidden"? It showed more footage from the film. â€”<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 15:50, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean the plot that takes place on Cybertron in the prequel comic books, at least the first two issues that I've read. Plus, I guess comics aren't the best medium for Transformers to, well, transform. I understand the need for the backstory, but I'm looking more forward to vehicles and what-have-you transforming into robots and vice versa. I just hope that for the film, the human response isn't too underwhelming or absurd -- that's bothered me about invaders-come-to-earth films in the past. Anyway, it ought to be a good summer of movies between that and <i>SM3</i> and <i>POTC 3</i> and a few others. â€”<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 16:20, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been doing some research on whether it meets either criteria. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> didn't list it as a cult film in its <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/cultfilmsew.html" class="external text" title="http://www.filmsite.org/cultfilmsew.html" rel="nofollow">2003 list</a>. I've also visited the links at the Wikipedia article of the greatest films ever made, but I didn't find <i>Fight Club</i> listed at AFI's Top 100 or any similar list. I'm not sure if the film has really been received either way in the public scope, though I know my peers usually consider it one of their favorite films. I'll continue digging, but I don't think the award from <i>Total Film</i> really speaks for the world of cinema's perspective of the film. â€”<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 21:04, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
