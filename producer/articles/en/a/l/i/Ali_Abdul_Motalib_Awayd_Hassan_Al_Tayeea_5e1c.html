<p>When the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> first complied with <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_District_Court_a227.html" title="US District Court">US District Court</a> Justice <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jed_Rakoff_e510.html" title="Jed Rakoff">Jed Rakoff</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_order.html" title="Court order">court order</a> and released the transcripts of the Guantanamo detainees, they weren't identified by name. However, a small number of the detainee's names were mentioned in the body of the transcripts. Al Tayeea's transcript was one that contained his name.</p>
<p>A widely republished story from the <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a></i> described Al Tayeea as a mechanic who had been jailed by <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s regime.<sup id="_ref-AbcNews060315_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AbcNews060315" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>An article in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Weekly_Standard_ccd3.html" title="The Weekly Standard">The Weekly Standard</a> has extensive excerpts from the testimony Al Tayees offered during his Tribunal. He described a long history of emigration from country to country in the mid-east, that finally left him working, as a driver, for the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>, in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.<sup id="_ref-WeeklyStd_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WeeklyStd" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> reported that Al Tayeea's nickname in Guantanamo was "Pimp Daddy".<sup id="_ref-WeeklyStd_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WeeklyStd" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Al Tayeea said he met <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Walker_Lindh_e093.html" title="John Walker Lindh">John Walker Lindh</a>, "the American Taliban", who he describes as a "good guy" and a "jackass".</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I don't believe in the Taliban, but being hungry and homeless, I worked there for 2 1/2 months and traveled in an old Russian car called a Gas 66. There are many of these in Iraq; it's a bulls--car. Everyday there was a broken engine, so I requested the money to fix it. I put a little of the money in my pocket and I'd go fix it. I didn't want to go every day. The f--ing Taliban is f--ing my life.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> reports that Al Tayeea doesn't get along with the other Guantanamo detainees, and had bragged, to his Tribunal, about threatening to keep informing on the other detainees:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"They call me motherf--all the time and I say, "f--Osama Bin Laden and f--the Taliban." I'm very happy and I tell them I'll stay here forever and give information about them. I tell them, "f--you, if you believe in Osama Bin Laden.""</i></dd>

<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
