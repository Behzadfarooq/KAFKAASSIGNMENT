<p>In <i>The Dream Master</i>, Alice was a friend of Kristen Parker's; her brother Rick dated her. After her friends Kincaid and Joey were killed, Alice was pulled into Kristen's fight, literally, when Kristen accidentally pulled her into a nightmare with <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddy_Krueger_1557.html" title="Freddy Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>, an <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead.html" title="Undead">undead</a> <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> who was plagueing the children the Elm Street. When Kristen was killed, she passed her power to Alice, but it went through Freddy first, taking a part of himself into Alice. She was too late to save Kristen in the real world, however, and she burned to death.</p>
<p>As time passed, it became clear that Freddy put a piece of himself into Alice because he couldn't reach the other children. As she now had Kristen's ability to pull others into her dreams, Freddy could use her to pull in the other children of Springwood (who weren't descended from those who burned him and who he couldn't effect, although this was later retconned away). She became aware of her power when she witnessed Freddy killing another friend of hers, Sheila, inside a dream. In real life, it appeared that Sheila was suffering from an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> attack. While Alice tried to give her asthma medication, she was pushed back by some invisible force, and Sheila died. It started becoming clear that as Freddy claimed a victim, Alice would gain their dream power (Kristen's athletic ability and paranoia, Sheila's intelligence, etc.) Alice later witnessed Freddy take away her brother, thus gaining his <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">karate</a> skills.</p>
<p>After Rick's funeral, Alice planned to get together with her two remaining friends, Debbie Stevens and Dan Jordan, a nice guy jock Alice had a crush on but was too shy to tell him. Alice's father wouldn't let her leave the house, out of fear that she'd die too; he blamed himself for Rick's death. After he eventually passed out, Alice sneaked out but couldn't find Dan, so instead went to see a movie. But while there she realized that it was a dream, and got sucked into the theatre screen, which now showed a run-down Crave Inn, a diner Alice worked at. While inside, she met her fear of being a waitress for the rest of her life, and then watched Freddy <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a> her brother. Alice watched as the Crave Inn doors opened to Debbie, in her attic working out. Alice woke up and headed out to find Dan. The two drove off for Debbie's house, but Freddy put the two in a loop to keep them from her. They got there too late, and Freddy killed Debbie, granting Alice Debbie's toughness and strength. They saw Freddy on the road, and she tried to run him down, but he crashed the car. Dan was rushed to the hospital, going into surgery in 15 minutes.</p>

Alice battles Freddy Krueger.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Alice went home, now ready to face Freddy on his turf. She suited herself up with items from her friends: a bandana from her brother, a gizmo Sheila was tinkering with, and a studded wristband from Debbie. She saw Freddy about to kill Dan, and entered into the dream world. The two tried to find him, but ended up in one of his little "fun" rooms. He spun the room around, and the two crashed through a stained glass window into a church. Dan woke up in the real world when the doctors pulled him out from the gas. Alice was alone in the church when Freddy appeared. Alice used all the tactics she gained from her friends, even creating a giant hole through Freddy's chest, but nothing worked. He went in for the kill when she remembered the completed verse about the Dream Master, and took a piece of the glass window she crashed through and used it to make Krueger see the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a> inside him. The souls of his victims freed themselves from his burned body and flew off into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">heaven</a>. In the end, Alice and Dan have started dating and were finally free of Krueger, until one day Alice saw a glimmer of his reflection in a fountain, but dismissed it. <a name="The_Dream_Child" id="The_Dream_Child"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Johnson_%28character%29_ff45.html" title="Edit section: The Dream Child">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Dream Child</span></h2>
<p>Things have changed a year after the events of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dream_Master_e92c.html" title="The Dream Master">The Dream Master</a>. Alice's father has stopped drinking, Alice, and Dan graduated, and are sleeping together. One night Alice goes to take a shower, and is soon taken to Westin Hills, where she is the woman who gave birth to Krueger, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Krueger_cf14.html" title="Amanda Krueger">Amanda Krueger</a>, literally. She is shown in a room full of hundreds of people who she realizes are insane. She gets locked in (just like Amanda), and is about to be raped until she wakes up.</p>
<p>After graduating though, she is somehow in another dream even though she was awake. There she meets the real Amanda Krueger, who is in labour. After giving birth to Freddy one of the doctors believe it is one of "God's creatures". Amanda disagrees, and Alice watches the baby version of Freddy escape and follows him into the church, back to where she finished off Freddy in the last film. A few minutes of watching Freddy reform into his present state, he starts taunting Alice until Amanda appears. Freddy is afraid to go back into Amanda, and so he doesn't leave the church, but then Amanda tells Alice of how she can beat Krueger but the door slams. Alice goes through it only to be brought back to the Crave-In Restaurant.</p>
<p>She calls Dan because she is now scared that things are falling apart again. Dan is at a pool party and leaves to bring a gift to Alice anyways. On the way to the restaurant, Dan turns on the radio and hears his mother insulting him and Alice. Freddy appears and tries to kill Dan again but manages to escape and end up back at the pool. He leaves and goes on a motorcycle but Freddy appears in the bike, and melds Dan into it, turning him into a man/machine hybrid, before he wakes up in the real world and crashes into a truck. Alice heads outside to the crash site, and Krueger possesses Dan's remains and taunts her. Alice, shocked, faints.</p>
<p>She wakes up in the hospital to hear that Dan has died, and that she is pregnant. Later at night she meets a boy named Jacob who feels bad about Dan's death somehow, and leaves. When Alice leaves the hospital the next day, she tells her friend Yvonne about it, and they meet at one of her friend's house.</p>
<p>Alice tells them the story about Krueger but they don't believe her but promise that she won't get hurt. Later, another one of Alice's friends, Greta Gibson, is at a dinner table with her mother, Racine and other guests, and ends up falling asleep. In the dream she confronts her mother (who is demanding, and is obsessed in making her daughter the perfect girl so she can have a limitless modeling career). Greta gets mad and Freddy comes. He locks her in a high chair, and serves her a doll of herself. He cuts it open and starts scooping out mush which he forced feeds her. Her cheeks extend to a horrible size from the vomit forming in her mouth, and she finds out that he is scooping out her own organs and feeding them to her. He then grabs her and starts choking her like a baby and dies.</p>
<p>Alice realises that Greta has died, and Yvonne, and Mark are the only kids left to accompany Alice. Mark is upset that Greta's dead too, and wants to learn more of Krueger. He believes Alice, and finds out information about Amanda Krueger, and learn they never found her body when she hung herself after she learned of Freddy's escape on a technicality.</p>
<p>Alice meets Jacob again, but leaves when he is waiting for his "friend with the funny hand." She realises he is her son, and goes to the hospital thinking Freddy is using him. She is right: Freddy is using Jacob, and feeds him the souls of the children he has killed so far after the fourth film. He is also using him to be reborn into the real world.</p>
<p>Mark falls asleep while Alice goes to find Amanda in her dream. Mark dies, after failing to beat "Super Freddy" in a comic book world.</p>
<p>Later Yvonne falls asleep and is about to be killed by Freddy until Alice saves her, and finally believes her story. The two wake up, and find Mark dead. Yvonne is told to go find Amanda in the tower of Westin Hills while Alice goes to fight Krueger one more time.</p>
<p>Alice fights Freddy until he falls into the room where his mother was raped. She sees Jacob, with Freddy, and leaves him, and almost falls into one of his traps. The mother, and son are reunited, and Alice realises that Freddy is inside her "where he hides". Alice lets him out and Amanda is soon released by Yvonne. Amanda tells Jacob to use the power Freddy gave him to revert them both back to their birth state. Amanda absorbs him, and leaves, with Freddy fighting to get back out, but Alice leaves the dream world.</p>
<p>Months pass, and Alice gives birth to Jacob. Alice, Jacob, Alice's father, and Yvonne are having a picnic in a park... but nearby, a group of girls, dressed in white and skipping rope, are humming Freddy's lullaby, "One, Two, Freddy's coming for you...". Alice doesn't notice.</p>
<p>One year later, Alice and Jacob move away from Springwood.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Johnson_%28character%29_ff45.html" title="Edit section: Powers and Abilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Powers and Abilities</span></h2>
<p>Taught by her mother how to control her dreams at a very young age, Alice was given Kristen Parker's ability to bring people into her dreams. But because this power passed through Freddy first, a part of him went inside of Alice. This allowed Freddy to use Alice as a gateway into a new group of teenagers for him to kill since Kristen was the last of the Elm Street children.</p>
<p>As her friends (and brother) died one by one, Alice gained their personality traits and dream abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kristen Parker</b>: Athletic abilities, cigarette addiction, and paranoia</li>
<li><b>Sheila Kopecky</b>: Intelligence</li>
<li><b>Rick Johnson</b>: Martial arts abilities</li>
<li><b>Debbie Stevens</b>: Tough attitude and strength</li>
</ul>
<p>In the fifth movie, Alice's abilities seemed to have evolved. She can now enter someone else's dream without having to fall asleep, and can contact her friends in the dream world. At three points in the movie, she had contact with her friends while they were dreaming.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dan Jordan</b>: Alice saw him in the man/machine hybrid mode as he fell down a pulsating tunnel.</li>
<li><b>Greta Gibson</b>: Greta was stuck inside Alice's refridgerator wall crying for help. Alice tried to pull her out, only to have Freddy snatch her back.</li>
<li><b>Mark Grey</b>: Alice witnessed him walk into a drawing of 1428 Elm Street. She then drew a stick figure of herself in the drawing, and willed herself into his dream.</li>
