<p>The Alignment was not strictly a political party in itself, but more of an umbrella of left-wing parties, with each retaining a set number of slots on the party's Knesset list. It was originally formed by <a href="../../../m/a/p/Mapai.html" title="Mapai">Mapai</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Unity_cf23.html" title="Labour Unity">Labour Unity</a>, the latter an offshoot from Mapai, prior to the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_legislative_election%2C_1965.html" title="Israeli legislative election, 1965">1965 elections</a>, and was initially called the <b>Labour Alignment</b>. Its formation was in response to the merger of the two major <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_wing_politics.html" title="Right wing politics">right-wing</a> parties in Israel, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herut.html" title="Herut">Herut</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28Israel%29_642e.html" title="Liberal Party (Israel)">Liberal Party</a> to form <a href="../../../g/a/h/Gahal.html" title="Gahal">Gahal</a>, and to try and preserve the left's hegemony in Israeli politics.</p>
<p>In its first elections, the Alignment won 36.7% of the vote and 45 of the 120 Knesset seats, enough to comfortably beat Gahal, which had only won 26, though not as many as Mapai had won in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_legislative_election%2C_1951.html" title="Israeli legislative election, 1951">1951</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_legislative_election%2C_1959.html" title="Israeli legislative election, 1959">1959 elections</a>. The party's leader, <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levi_Eshkol_71ab.html" title="Levi Eshkol">Levi Eshkol</a> formed a coalition government with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Religious_Party_fa5e.html" title="National Religious Party">National Religious Party</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/p/Mapam.html" title="Mapam">Mapam</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Liberals_%28Israel%29_7205.html" title="Independent Liberals (Israel)">Independent Liberals</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agudat_Israel_Workers_4f00.html" title="Agudat Israel Workers">Agudat Israel Workers</a> and two <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Arab_59b5.html" title="Israeli Arab">Israeli Arab</a> parties associated with the Alignment, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progress_and_Development_cc40.html" title="Progress and Development">Progress and Development</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Participation_and_Brotherhood_5abd.html" title="Participation and Brotherhood">Participation and Brotherhood</a>.</p>
<p>The party's main challenge during its first term in power was the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>. As war broke out, Eshkol formed a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_government.html" title="National government">national unity government</a>, which included Gahal and <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafi_%28political_party%29.html" title="Rafi (political party)">Rafi</a>.</p>
<p>After the war had finished, the alliance sought to strengthen itself further, and invited <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafi_%28political_party%29.html" title="Rafi (political party)">Rafi</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/p/Mapam.html" title="Mapam">Mapam</a> to join. Both parties accepted the offer, though Rafi's <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ben-Gurion_1a9e.html" title="David Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> (a former leader of Mapai) refused to accept the move, and broke away from his party to sit as an independent MK for the remainder of the Knesset session. The party also dropped the word Labour from its title, becoming known as just <b>Alignment</b>. The merger with Rafi and Mapam meant that the party held 63 seats, the only time a party has ever achieved a majority in the Knesset. Within the alliance, Mapai, Labour Unity and Rafi merged to form the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_%28Israel%29_9b3f.html" title="Labor (Israel)">Labour Party</a> in 1968, though Mapam remained a separate entity.</p>
<p>When Eshkol died on 26 February, 1969, he was succeeded by <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golda_Meir_0ec1.html" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a>, Israel's first, and so far only, female <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Israel_ea19.html" title="Prime Minister of Israel">Prime Minister</a>, making Israel one of the first countries in the world to have a woman heading the government.</p>
<p>The country's success in the Six-Day War helped the party's popularity, and led to its comprehensive victory in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_legislative_election%2C_1969.html" title="Israeli legislative election, 1969">1969 elections</a>. Although it lost its majority, the 46.2% of the vote and 56 seats was (and remains) the best electoral performance in Israeli political history. Meir continued with a national unity government including Gahal, the National Religious Party, the Independent Liberals, Progress and Development and Participation and Brotherhood until 1970 when Gahal resigned after the government had decided in principle to adopt the <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogers_plan.html" title="Rogers plan">Rogers plan</a>, though ultimately they decided against it.</p>
<p>During the Knesset session, the party gained one seat as Meir Avizohar defected from Ben-Gurion's new party, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_List_2148.html" title="National List">National List</a>.</p>
<p><a name="1970s"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alignment_%28political_party%29.html" title="Edit section: 1970s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1970s</span></h2>
<p>The seventh Knesset also covered the event that played a major part in the party's downfall. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">6 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, as Israelis were observing <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Kippur_c0e4.html" title="Yom Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>, a surprise attack was launched by <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, resulting in the <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Kippur_War_eeba.html" title="Yom Kippur War">Yom Kippur War</a>. Although Israel later recovered the ground initially lost, the war was generally considered to be a failure, and the government faced significant criticism. The <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agranat_Commission_f15d.html" title="Agranat Commission">Agranat Commission</a> was set up to examine the circumstances that led to the war.</p>
<p>Before the Commission could publish its results, an election was held. Anger at the government was not significantly noticeable, as the Alignment still won 39.6% of the vote and 51 seats. More significantly, the new major right-wing party, <a href="../../../l/i/k/Likud.html" title="Likud">Likud</a>, won 39 seats, and was now breathing down the Alignment's neck. Meir formed a coalition with the National Religious Party and the Independent Liberals. However, ten days after the Agranat Commission published its findings on 1 April, 1974, Meir resigned, despite the report clearing her and her <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_Minister_of_Israel_7014.html" title="Defense Minister of Israel">Defence Minister</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshe_Dayan_197d.html" title="Moshe Dayan">Moshe Dayan</a> of all responsibility.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_b27b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> took over the party, beating <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimon_Peres_8663.html" title="Shimon Peres">Shimon Peres</a> in a leadership contest. This battle led to a long-term falling out between the two, after Peres described Rabin as an "indefatigable intriguer" in his autobiography. Rabin formed a new government with <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratz_%28political_party%29.html" title="Ratz (political party)">Ratz</a>, the Independent Liberals, Progress and Development and the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_List_for_Bedouins_and_Villagers_163f.html" title="Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers">Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers</a>, another Israeli Arab party associated with the Alignment. The National Religious Party joined the coalition soon after, though their arrival precipitated the departure of secularist Ratz.</p>
<p>The party's internal divisions were also beginning to show, as Mapam broke away from the party, as did Progress and Development and the Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers, who had both come under the Alignment umbrella during Rabin's tenure. Although Mapam returned to the fold, the two Arab parties broke their ties with the party, uniting to create the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_List_%281976%29_e01b.html" title="United Arab List (1976)">United Arab List</a>. Two other MKs, Arie Lova Eliav and Mordechai Ben-Porat also left the party, the former going on to form <a href="../../../y/a/27/Ya%27ad_%E2%80%93_Civil_Rights_Movement_6172.html" title="Ya'ad – Civil Rights Movement">Ya'ad – Civil Rights Movement</a> and then the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Socialist_Faction_bc95.html" title="Independent Socialist Faction">Independent Socialist Faction</a>, whilst the latter remained an independent MK.</p>
<p>Rabin fell victim to a double scandal in 1977 when it was revealed his wife, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leah_Rabin_c640.html" title="Leah Rabin">Leah</a> had a foreign currency bank account, illegal in Israel at the time. He also took responsibility for an apparent breach of the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a> on an <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Air_Force_4b7e.html" title="Israeli Air Force">Israeli Air Force</a> base. Rabin resigned over the former incident, and Peres took over as Prime Minister just a short time before the next elections.</p>
<p>Peres led the party into the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_legislative_election%2C_1977.html" title="Israeli legislative election, 1977">1977 elections</a>, which proved to be a historical turning point in Israeli political history: For the first time the left-wing were defeated. The Alignment won only 24.6% of the vote, a decrease of over a third, and picked up just 32 seats. In contrast, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Begin_0c8c.html" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a>'s Likud won 43 seats. Begin was able to form a right-wing coalition with <a href="../../../s/h/l/Shlomtzion_%28political_party%29.html" title="Shlomtzion (political party)">Shlomtzion</a> (which quickly merged into Likud), the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Religious_Party_fa5e.html" title="National Religious Party">National Religious Party</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agudat_Israel_cd16.html" title="Agudat Israel">Agudat Israel</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Movement_for_Change_9db8.html" title="Democratic Movement for Change">Dash</a>. Even after Dash disintegrated, Begin still held a majority.</p>
<p>Although the disastrous Yom Kippur War was a factor in the party's heavy defeat, allegations of corruption and nepotism (highlighted by the Rabin scandal) and anger at the party's perceived bias towards <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Jew_01bb.html" title="Ashkenazi Jew">Ashkenazi Jews</a> over <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizrahi_Jew_9a00.html" title="Mizrahi Jew">Mizrahi Jews</a> also played major roles in the election result.</p>
<p>Further embarrassment for the Alignment was brought about as Begin offered Moshe Dayan the position of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Minister_of_Israel_ce14.html" title="Foreign Minister of Israel">Foreign Minister</a> despite his party not being in the coalition. Dayan accepted the offer, and was expelled from the party. After sitting as an independent MK, he founded <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telem_%28political_party%29.html" title="Telem (political party)">Telem</a>.</p>
<p>However, the Alignment still had an important role to play, as it helped pass the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_David_Accords_3d02.html" title="Camp David Accords">Camp David Accords</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Egypt_Peace_Treaty_3fc5.html" title="Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty">Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty</a> in the Knesset. This was necessary as many Likud MKs had broken away to form opposition parties (<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Israel_%281980%29_d85e.html" title="One Israel (1980)">One Israel</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/e/Ometz.html" title="Ometz">Rafi – National List</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehiya.html" title="Tehiya">Tehiya</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosef_Tamir_cd75.html" title="Yosef Tamir">Yosef Tamir</a> as an independent) and several others (including <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> and <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Shamir_9bb6.html" title="Yitzhak Shamir">Yitzhak Shamir</a>) abstained from voting on it.</p>
<p>Despite losing Dayan, the party picked up two more seats as former Dash MKs Zeidan Atashi and David Golomb defected from <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinui.html" title="Shinui">Shinui</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alignment_%28political_party%29.html" title="Edit section: 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1980s</span></h2>
<p>The party recovered well in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_legislative_election%2C_1981.html" title="Israeli legislative election, 1981">1981 elections</a> as it gained 36.6% of the vote, an improvement of 12%, and 47 seats. However, Likud took 48, allowing Begin to form the government with the help of small right-wing and religious parties. Ratz briefly merged into the Alignment, but broke away again. Nevertheless, by the end of the Knesset session the party had more seats than its rival as two Likud MKs had defected to join it. The Alignment was also boosted when the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Liberals_%28Israel%29_7205.html" title="Independent Liberals (Israel)">Independent Liberals</a> merged into it in 1984.</p>
<p>With Peres still at the head of the party, the 1984 elections resulted in stalemate. Although the Alignment won 44 seats to Likud's 41, it could not muster enough support from suitable smaller parties to form a government (the next largest party had only five seats, and two of the small left-wing parties, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadash.html" title="Hadash">Hadash</a> and the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_List_for_Peace_8b7a.html" title="Progressive List for Peace">Progressive List for Peace</a> were not viewed as potential coalition partners due to their radical left-wing views). However, the Likud found itself in the same situation (<a href="../../../k/a/c/Kach_and_Kahane_Chai_c19d.html" title="Kach and Kahane Chai">Kach</a> being impossible to work with). The result was a grand coalition of the Alignment, Likud, the National Religious Party, <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agudat_Israel_cd16.html" title="Agudat Israel">Agudat Israel</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shas.html" title="Shas">Shas</a>, Morasha, Shinui and Ometz (which later merged into Likud). With 97 seats, it was the largest coalition in Israeli political history aside from national unity governments.</p>
<p>Peres and new Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir agreed to share power, with Peres Prime Minister for the first two years of the Knesset term and Shamir for the last two. When Shamir took over, Shinui left the coalition. The Alignment ended the session with six less MKs, as Mapam broke away from the party, unhappy at the power-sharing agreement with Shamir. The party also lost one MK to Ratz (<a href="../../../y/o/s/Yossi_Sarid_389c.html" title="Yossi Sarid">Yossi Sarid</a>), one to Shinui (Yitzhak Artzi) and one to the newly formed Arab Democratic Party (Abdulwahab Darawshe) but replaced them when the three-man <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yachad_%281984%29.html" title="Yachad (1984)">Yachad</a> merged into the Alignment.</p>
<p>The result of the 1988 elections was also ambiguous, with Likud winning 40 seats and the Alignment 39. Another power-sharing arrangement was made, and the coalition again had 97 members, consisting of Likud, the Alignment, the National Religious Party, Shas, Agudat Israel and <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degel_HaTorah_c07c.html" title="Degel HaTorah">Degel HaTorah</a>.</p>
<p>However, in 1990 Peres made a bid for sole power through the creation of a narrow 61-seat coalition with the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Ultra-orthodox</a> parties Shas, Agudat Israel and Degel HaTorah and the left-wing Mapam, Ratz and Shinui. Ultimately the bid failed, and the Alignment was kicked out of the coalition for the last two years of the Knesset's term. The party also lost one MK, Efraim Gur, who left and set up Unity for Peace and Immigration before joining Likud.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1992 elections, the Alignment ceased to exist. Rather than operating as an umbrella alliance, it was decided to create a unitary party without internal divisions. The new party was named the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_%28Israel%29_9b3f.html" title="Labor (Israel)">Israeli Labour Party</a>, and was taken over by Yitzhak Rabin who went on to win the elections.</p>
