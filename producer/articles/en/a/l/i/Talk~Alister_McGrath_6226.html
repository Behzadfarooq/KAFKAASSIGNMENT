<p>I think it is worth making it clear that McGrath only has a "Title of Distinction", i.e. he does not actually hold a chair (such as the Regius and Lady Margaret Professors of Divinity do). <a href="../../../o/x/o/User%7EOxonian2006_e7e1.html" title="User:Oxonian2006">Oxonian2006</a> 00:11, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article reads "After years of research and study ..." when describing McGrath's PhD. work, but it was only 3 years (the UK norm). It sounds like it was decades of hard graft or something (or, at least, that's how I first read it). Tweaking the text to "fix" this.

<dd>Is he "in science"? I don't think so. He once was a published scientist, but seems to be wholly theology these days. A "former scientists who are now theologists" category might be more appropriate. He cites a lot of "Christians in Science", but technically I don't think he's one himself.

<dd>It's titled Category:Christians in science because "Category:Christian Scientists" is too easily confused with categories about members of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ%2C_Scientist_837b.html" title="Church of Christ, Scientist">Church of Christ, Scientist</a> as they are often called "Christian Scientists." If McGrath is a scientist who is notable for writing about Christianity's relationship to science than he fits the category whether he's currently active in science or not.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>There are those who seemingly desire to recategorize all people with education/training in science, who may have an extensive publishing or research history within their field, who now write about religion as being theologists, rather than scientists. Alister McGrath is just one of several on Wikipedia that I've seen. <a href="../../../r/k/e/User%7ERkevins82_9ffc.html" title="User:Rkevins82">Rkevins82</a> 04:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we're going to be technical, we'll have to remove large swaths of people from the '[x] in science' type categories, because many of the people on those lists are.. well. Dead. Hard to be in science when you're in a box, unless you're a very aggressive quantum physicist. Certainly few of them died in the middle of research; they retired from the field. McGrath meets the qualifications of having been a scientist, and his PhD and research didn't evaporate when he became a christian. Excluding him from the list just seems... weird. 141.151.116.228 08:25, 21 December 2006 (UTC) Anonymous</dd>

<dd>I suppose the point I was trying to make above is that there are many successful working scientists who are also Christians for whom the category makes a lot of sense. McGrath is not really one of them anymore, so to label him as such might be confusing. That said, as he has a formal training in science, ostensibly he's in a notable position in his commentary on it. I say "ostensibly" because, having recently seen him deliver a seminar, his presentation style/tactics are emphatically not those of a scientist; a lawyer perhaps, but certainly no scientist. --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a> 09:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, naturally - his presentation is about relaying an intellectual argument regarding science and scientific topics - he's not posing new theories. When Steven Weinberg talks about his views on religion and morality, he doesn't sound like much of a scientist either; appropriate, because it's a different (if related) sphere. You make it sound as if McGrath traded in his knowledge of science in exchange for his knowledge of theology, which is not the case. I'm a mere anonymous contributor, so I'll leave the actions to someone else - but place me firmly in the 'Adding McGrath to the Christians in Science' category, as it makes more sense to do so than to not do so. 209.158.59.163 05:35, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Discussion is now moot as the Category was deleted. There were some valid concerns tossed out about misuse and another it allowing for confusing things like say people who claim the classification of angels is science. Neither of those things were happenin, or ever really did in its 13 month history, but I suppose it had a logic. That wasn't the reason for deletion though unfortunately. Deletion was based more on "overcategorization", which has become a nice excuse to delete any intersection that a person finds irritating or uncomfortable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>Perhaps my "Possible reason for Dawkins's catty and silly comment?" viz "McGrath became a full professor at Oxford at the age of 46 and has written 18 books which have nothing to do with Dawkins (whereas Dawkins had to wait until he was 54, and to have a chair endowed specially for him by an admirer)" was a bit harsh. I might have added that McGrath got a First in both his undergraduate degrees, Dawkins got a second (and only took one), that McGrath is very popular with his colleagues whereas I'm told that Dawkins is pretty much a pariah at Oxford, and that when McGrath comments on science he is qualified and knows what he is talking about whereas when Dawkins comments on philsophy or theology is is unqualified and makes laughable howlers. However I think at least the first part, without the parentheses, is fair comment. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 12:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This addition to the article is easily one of the most churlish I've ever read. Its tone is completely unencyclopedic and sounds like a childish rejoiner to the Dawkins quote. Said quote isn't, perhaps, the most carefully considered riposte, but it does capture something about the nature of McGrath's endeavours. As for the continuation of the article's rejoiner on this page, well, the best that can be said about this piffle is "who cares?". As well as being even more out of place in an encyclopedia (I note that it's here, rather than in the article), it's shameless toadying towards McGrath. And, on a technical note, why is McGrath OK on philosophical matters, but not Dawkins? I understand that Dawkins might be ill-equipped on theological cruft, but why on Earth should he be precluded from musing on philosophy? Finally, I just <i>have</i> to say that, in my long experience of attending seminars and lectures, McGrath's was unique in its disingenuousness, its muddying of waters and its blatant misrepresentation of scientific ideas. He might be alright in print, but he's shameless in person. --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a> 13:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, but I'm removing the sentence after the Dawkins quote. The article is not the place for personal bias. Whatever you or I think of the two is irrelevant. It is right to include Dawkins' response as it is to include Mcgrath's on his page, as they have history with each other, but not right to add our own feelings.</p>
<p>For the record, you can bad mouth Dawkins and prop up McGrath all you want, but I read his first Dawkins book - it's empty of anything remotely robust as an argument. 164.143.240.34 13:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
