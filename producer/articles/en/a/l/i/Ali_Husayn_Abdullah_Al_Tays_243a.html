<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>.

<p>The Tribunal President explained the Tribunal process to Al Tays.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAlTaysPg11_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAlTaysPg11" title="">[5]</a></sup> He then asked him if he had any questions. Al Tays asked where they got the information on which they based the allegations, which, he said, were "all lies". The Tribunal President then asked Al Tays if he wanted to make a statement. Al Tays replied that they had all the statements. The President seemed to conclude that Al Tays had not understood the process after all. Both the President, and the Personal Representative tried to explain that the Tribunal had not seen any of the evidence yet, and this was Al Tays's opportunity to explain himself.</p>
<p>When the first allegation was repeated, saying he had traveled to Afghanistan for training, so he could fight in a tribal war in Yemen, he expressed confusion, asserting that it was not the concern of the United States, since he was not an enemy of the United States.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAlTaysPg12_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAlTaysPg12" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the Tribunal President explained that, in and of itself it did not indicate he was an "<a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>", when considered with the other allegations, it might.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAlTaysPg13_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAlTaysPg13" title="">[7]</a></sup> Al Tays then acknowledged that the first allegation was correct.</p>
<p>One of the Tribunal members asked the President if he could try and explain the Tribunal process to Al Tays.</p>
<p>Al Tays acknowledged staying at Al Nabrass while awaiting transportation from Kandahar to Al Farouq.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAlTaysPg14_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAlTaysPg14" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Al Tays expressed confusion over the third allegation, that the place where he stayed had been frequented by Osama bin Laden. The Tribunal moved on to the next allegation without getting an answer to the third allegatioo.</p>
<p>Al Tays acknowledged both attending the Al Farouq training camp, and receiving AK47 training there.</p>
<p>Al Tays denied fleeing Al Farouq for Tora Bora in September 2001.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAlTaysPg15_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAlTaysPg15" title="">[9]</a></sup> He denied that he had been held at the border by Pakistani authorities in October 2001.</p>
<p>When the allegations were exhausted the Tribunal Recorder asked Al Tays when he left Al Farouq, and under what circumstances.</p>
<p>Al Tays answered: <i>"The took us from there and I didn't know where we were going. They took me to another place to finish my training."</i></p>
<p>The Tribunal members then started asking their questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>He went to Afghanistan for Weapons training because he could get training there immediately, whereas he would have to wait years for training in Yemen.</li>
<li>He said he had never heard of Al Qaeda until he arrived in Cuba.</li>
<li>He said he had heard of the Taliban.</li>
<li>When asked if he had known that the Taliban controlled Afghanistan he said he had known that they controlled a part and that Al Masood had controlled a part, but he had not realized that they were at war.</li>
<li>He said he hadn’t been captured, that he had voluntarily turned himself in to Pakistani authorities. He said he thought they would help him contact the Yemeni embassy.</li>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
