<p>Editorializing moved here:</p>
<p>On the face of it, the most severe problem with this theme is that Earth is a horrible place in many ways: 1. It is so hot here that water is liquid. 2. It is so cold here that matter exists in un-ionized form. 3. Water is as close to a perfect solvent as any known substance, and Oxygen is is the second most corrosive gas known. For most forms of life, Earth is probably Hell.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unique nature of Earth's environment means that for any other life-forms that thrive in such conditions, Earth represents very rare and valuable real estate.</p>
<ul>
<li>this article is outlandishly speculative and presumptive. I am going to rewrite it <a href="../../../v/r/o/User%7EVroman_e928.html" title="User:Vroman">user:vroman</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The whole article should be deleted.... starting from scratch would be better.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Earth Defense section is ridiculous in numerous ways, I'd say it needs revision the most.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well perhaps you would care to back up your opinions with logical reasoning. Exactly why is this article "ridiculous in numerous ways"? It's dealing with a hypothetical scenario - there is no right or wrong!</p>
<dl>

<dd>Given that the very existence of intelligent extra-terrestrials is in question - much less what would happen should they invade or attack Earth - it goes without saying that this article will be speculative. As aforementioned, it's a hypothetical scenario. That said, the article is definitely POV, basically stating that if aliens exist, they wouldn't have reason to attack Earth. In this general argument it poses, it equates human reasoning to a life form that isn't human, AND only applies one-sided logic to beings that may or may not behave in what is percieved by us to be logical, AND equates technological intellect and advancement with enlightenment, possibly moral enlightenment. No one would argue that virtually any adult is more technologically adept and savvy than an infant, but that doesn't mean they're less prone to random acts of barbarity and cruelty that have no sound reasoning. Quite the contrary in fact. And that's just one counterpoint. Aliens may not want to conquer Earth for resources or slave labor, they may just do it for sport or sadism or religious fanaticism or some other reasoning we couldn't possibly ponder. Who knows?</dd>

<dd>Since this is such a speculative subject the article should be far more open minded and represent more possibilities than just cold logic and science that generally doesn't permit for the existence of the creatures in discussion in the first place. It's a well written article, but the authoritative voice that repeatedly dismisses the idea of an invasion even taking place undermines the entire piece. If it's all hypothesis it should be a lot less POV (especially considering their are limited reliable references to back up the authoritative statements being made). I'll try to research and update whenever possible. jcomp489</dd>

<dd>Thanks. Considering this article tends to cover a fictional theme, I would rather have this article focus more on the fiction than speculative fact. I would like examples, the alien invasion as allegory for colonalism, the cold war, etc., variations on the theme such as interdimensional alien invasion or Earth invasion of alien planets, etc. --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 18:38, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please refer to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. This is not the place to write your own personal essay about alien invasion. Hopefully we can turn this into a proper article about a subject in science fiction. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:07, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would suggest that the subject lends itself well to the areas listed such as Exopolitics - which - regardless of peoples perceptions is a legitimate philosophical and perhaps reasonable excercise in discussion on sociological impacts, and philosophical arguments. Just because we don't have little green men running around the U.N. does not mean we should not research the subject in the (unlikely) event they do show up. Consider the implications that such discussions would have had on colonists of the Americas, Asia and so on had they been allowed to occur before people had made contact. Sequestering such discussions as 'fiction' merely because you consider them to be - does not make them so. The topic is legitimate, and worthy of research, if only from anthropological views - as it allows a history of our current human perceptions of theoretical scenarios -- although agreeably, perhaps somewhat far fetched scenarios - they are none the less valid, IMHO.

<p>I hadn't originally consider this an alien invasion, but it's more than acceptable. I like the Childhood's End reference, but because its submitter admitted it's borderline, I would like to get more examples for this. The closest ones I can think of Doom and Urotsukidoji, but those might be considered a bit low-brow, especially in regards to Childhood's End.--<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 04:59, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd have to say that although there are many variations on the alien invasion theme, I like the "land on earth and destroy its cities" version best, because it features a lot of action.

<dd>Well, that said, I like your work with the introduction to the section and the mention of combination. I'm considering adding a few more variation, such as <b>alien raids</b>, which would be short-term, small-numbers hostile alien contact and more with the intention of probing defenses, sending a message, or terror raids than occupying or genocide, etc. (I think <i>Signs</i> would be a good example: the aliens bug out for no real reason), and something I'm referring to as <b>Little Green Man's Burden</b> for the time being, in which the aliens invade with the intent to civilize humans. --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 03:52, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entire article reads like a high school original research project. There is no mention of any scholarship. No history of the genre. No references. Just generic generalizations and unsourced analysis mixed in with incomplete lists of various popular books and movies. There is probably material here that is valid, but the very structure of the article is undisciplined and shows a lack of research from the leading scholars in the genre. Not even sure it's a valid article. Perhaps "Alien invasion literature"? It needs someone to do some proper research and report on what the scholarship says. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 23:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The ships do <i>not</i> use a "heat ray", if you look CLOSELY, into the green or blue-green beam, you'll see what looks like a fireball travel down the beam. It is a blob of <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antimatter.html" title="Antimatter">antimatter</a></i> that strikes the targeted building, and the detonation of this "bomb" is what destroys the city or other target. Two of these destroy the White House outright, then Washington DC is consumed in the blast. I have a DVD copy of this movie. I was told long ago that a cup full of antimatter making contact with matter is like setting off a 30 MEGATON H-Bomb, only there is no lingering radiation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 09:52, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading through the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_War_8641.html" title="Interstellar War">Interstellar War</a> article, I found some direction for this page!

<p>I think at least one of the Superman movies concerns an alien invasion ("Kneel before <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Zod_1922.html" title="General Zod">Zod</a>!"), although that invasion consists of, like three aliens. Superman himself is an alien, for that matter. <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204.52.215.107.html" title="User:204.52.215.107">204.52.215.107</a> 21:50, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
