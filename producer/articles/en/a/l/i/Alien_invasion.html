</dl>
<p>The <b>alien invasion</b> is a common theme in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> stories and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_film.html" title="Science fiction film">film</a>, in which a technologically-superior <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">extraterrestrial</a> society invades <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> with the intent to replace human life, or to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">enslave</a> it under a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonial</a> system, or in some cases, to use humans as food.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion.html" title="Invasion">invasion</a> scenario has been used as an <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegory.html" title="Allegory">allegory</a> for a protest against military <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegemony.html" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> and the societal ills of the time. Wells' <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28novel%29_a633.html" title="The War of the Worlds (novel)">The War of the Worlds</a></i> is often viewed as an indictment of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> and its "<a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunboat_diplomacy.html" title="Gunboat diplomacy">gunboat diplomacy</a>" â€”setting a common theme for some politically motivated future alien invasion stories, that suggest audiences in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">Western</a> societies should empathise with the conquered rather than the conqueror, due to some presumed guilt on their part.</p>
<p>Prospects of invasion tended to vary with the state of current affairs, and current perceptions of threat. Alien invasion was a common metaphor in science fiction during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, illustrating the fears of foreign (i.e. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communist</a>) occupation and nuclear devastation of the American people. Examples of these stories include "The Liberation of Earth" by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Tenn_6006.html" title="William Tenn">William Tenn</a> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Body_Snatchers_dd11.html" title="The Body Snatchers">The Body Snatchers</a></i>.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in fiction the aliens tend to either observe (sometimes using experiments) or invade (<i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space_2576.html" title="Plan 9 from Outer Space">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></i>, and the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalek.html" title="Dalek">Daleks</a> and others in the long-running series <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>), rather than help the population of Earth acquire the capacity to participate in interplanetary affairs. There have been a few exceptions, however, such as the alien-initiated <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_contact.html" title="First contact">first contact</a> that begins the 1951 film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still_e641.html" title="The Day the Earth Stood Still">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>, and the <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulcan.html" title="Vulcan">Vulcan</a>-initiated first contact that concludes the 1996 film <a href="../../../f/i/r/Star_Trek%7E_First_Contact_51ac.html" title="Star Trek: First Contact">Star Trek: First Contact</a> (although notably after a failed invasion by the Borg in the rest of the film).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_invasion.html" title="Edit section: Variations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variations</span></h2>
<p>The most well-known alien invasion scenarios involve the aliens landing on Earth, destroying or abducting people, fighting and defeating Earth's military forces, and then destroying Earth's major cities. Usually the bulk of the story follows the battles between the invaders and Earth's armies, as in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28novel%29_a633.html" title="The War of the Worlds (novel)">The War of the Worlds</a></i>. However, not all alien invasion stories follow this plot. In some accounts, the alien invaders will covertly subvert human society using disguises, shapechanging, or human allies. In other depictions, the aliens score an overwhelming victory over humanity and the bulk of the story occurs after the aliens have taken over. Sometimes, the aliens do not come from space, but from another dimension. And in some fiction, the invaders may not actually be aliens, but <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demonic</a> creatures.</p>
<p><b>Alien infiltration</b> has been a familiar variation on the alien invasion theme. In the infiltration scenario, the invaders will typically take human form and can move freely throughout human society, even to the point of taking control of command positions. This type of invasion usually emphasizes <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoid</a> fears and was very common during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, with the Communist agents suspected everywhere, but has also become common in during any time of social change and unrest. The classic examples of this would be <i><a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_79f8.html" title="Invasion of the Body Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a></i>, the gradual evolution of humans to `hybrid' aliens in TV's <i><a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_%28TV_series%29_a170.html" title="Invasion (TV series)">Invasion</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Threshold_%28TV_series%29_1e5c.html" title="Threshold (TV series)">Threshold</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../i/n/v/Invader_Zim_0ae3.html" title="Invader Zim">Invader Zim</a></i>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Puppet_Masters_f3e4.html" title="The Puppet Masters">The Puppet Masters</a></i> and the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Campbell%2C_Jr._77b4.html" title="John W. Campbell, Jr.">John W. Campbell, Jr.</a> short story, <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Goes_There__760b.html" title="Who Goes There?">Who Goes There?</a></i>, which was made into <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hawks_5dfc.html" title="Howard Hawks">Howard Hawks</a> film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_from_Another_World_38ff.html" title="The Thing from Another World">The Thing from Another World</a></i>, with a more faithful adaptation being made by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carpenter_cfa6.html" title="John Carpenter">John Carpenter</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_6e13.html" title="The Thing">The Thing</a></i>.</p>
<p><b>Alien occupation</b> can occur in many invasion stories. In short, the alien invaders win and occupy Earth or human civilization, at least until a human resistance overthrows the aliens and/or their <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet_government.html" title="Puppet government">puppet governments</a>. Many occupation stories are influenced by the real human invasions by totalitarian governments, such as <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, in which the alien invaders support existing human government infrastructures that welcome their new alien overlords or purge opposition governments and rebuild them in their own image and the enforcement of their rule through the use of collaborators and secret police. Examples of life under alien occupation can be seen in the TV series <i><a href="../../../v/_/%28/V_%28TV_series%29_588a.html" title="V (TV series)">V</a></i>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Christopher_5ce9.html" title="John Christopher">John Christopher</a>'s book series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tripods_7e6d.html" title="The Tripods">The Tripods</a></i>, and the <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_ea8b.html" title="Half-Life">Half-Life</a></i> series of computer games.</p>
<p><b>Alien raids</b> are short-term alien invasions. The aliens are incapable of supporting a large-scale invasion due to small numbers and instead use the shock of their arrival to inspire terror. Other stories following this line of reasoning would have the alien invaders conducting reconnaissance and probing raids on the Earth's population and especially their military forces. Also, the invaders will try to choose isolated spots, such as the desert or farmlands of rural <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a>, as a staging area or landing zone. This type of plotline provides a better possibility of small groups, like local police and military, or even ordinary civilians, the ability to repulse the invaders and return to normal life after the event. Because of budget constraints, this variation was fairly common in the 1950s <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="../../../b/-/m/B-movie.html" title="B-movie">B-movies</a>, such as <i><a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Came_from_Outer_Space_67cc.html" title="It Came from Outer Space">It Came from Outer Space</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenagers_From_Outer_Space_d40e.html" title="Teenagers From Outer Space">Teenagers From Outer Space</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_9_From_Outer_Space_7ec9.html" title="Plan 9 From Outer Space">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a>.</i> It also appears in the film <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Signs_%28film%29.html" title="Signs (film)">Signs</a></i> as they do not want the world's powers to retaliate using nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The theme of <b>beneficial alien invasion</b> has also been explored in fiction on the rare occasion. With this type of story, the invaders, in a kind of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_man%27s_burden.html" title="White man's burden">little grey/green man's burden</a>, colonize the planet in an effort to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_imperialism.html" title="Cultural imperialism">spread their culture</a> and "civilize" the indigenous "barbaric" inhabitants or secretly watch and aid earthlings saving them from themselves. The former theme shares many traits with hostile occupation fiction, but the invaders tend to view the occupied peoples as students or equals rather than subjects and slaves. The latter theme of secret watcher is a paternalistic/maternalistic theme. In this fiction, the aliens intervene in human affairs to prevent them from destroying themselves, such as Klaatu and Gort in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still_e641.html" title="The Day the Earth Stood Still">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a></i> warning the leaders of Earth to abandon their warlike ways and join other space-faring civilizations else that they will destroy themselves or be destroyed by their interstellar union. Other examples of a beneficial alien invasion are <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Roddenberry_868c.html" title="Gene Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Questor_Tapes_338a.html" title="The Questor Tapes">The Questor Tapes</a> movie and his 1968 <a href="../../../e/a/r/Assignment%7E_Earth_%28TOS_episode%29_ef1d.html" title="Assignment: Earth (TOS episode)">Assignment: Earth</a> Star Trek episode, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_C._Clarke_6dac.html" title="Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Childhood%27s_End_7fd2.html" title="Childhood's End">Childhood's End</a></i>, the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> and novel series <i><a href="../../../c/r/e/Crest_of_the_Stars_3bc5.html" title="Crest of the Stars">Crest of the Stars</a></i> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Brin_c616.html" title="David Brin">David Brin</a>'s <i><a href="../../../u/p/l/Uplift_series.html" title="Uplift series">Uplift</a></i> series of books.</p>
<p>Another conception of the alien invasion theme is a <b>demonic alien invasion</b>, in which the invaders are Biblical or religious-inspired demonic beings, who infiltrate the Earth, attack mankind, take over human society (disguised as humans themselves) and make war upon the saints, fulfilling the events described in the Book of Revelation or another religious prophecy, occasionally invented for the story itself. The <i><a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a></i> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_games.html" title="Computer and video games">computer game</a> series and the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hentai.html" title="Hentai">hentai</a> series <i><a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_the_Overfiend_e417.html" title="Legend of the Overfiend">Legend of the Overfiend</a></i> both follow this concept. The novel <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Childhood%27s_End_7fd2.html" title="Childhood's End">Childhood's End</a></i> may be viewed as a form of demonic alien invasion, because of the Overlords' devilish appearances.</p>
<p>Occasionally, two or more themes can be used as a combination. For example, the aliens may first infiltrate society secretly, then, after gaining human trust, they will suddenly begin destroying Earth's cities, with the humans taken by complete surprise. Another example of this is in two episodes of the popular sci-fi show <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_SG-1_3423.html" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a></i> an alien race known as the Aschen befriend humans and share their advanced technology and medicine freely in exchange for stargate addresses. But it soon becomes clear that the Aschen plan to eradicate the human race slowly by making both women and men infertile so the human race dies out over generations.</p>
<p>An additional angle is provided by the concept of <b>Alien invasion in the past</b>, with a period of the recent or distant past serving as the secene of an alien invasion of one of the aforementioned types. The most ambitious project of this kind seems to be <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Turtledove_6c42.html" title="Harry Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_history_%28fiction%29.html" title="Alternate history (fiction)">alternative history</a> <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosev_timeline.html" title="Tosev timeline"><i>Worldwar</i> &amp; <i>Colonization</i> Series</a> , where lizard-like aliens land on Earth in 1942, bent on conquest, forcing the opposing sides of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> to unite against them. In <i><a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideslip.html" title="Sideslip">Sideslip</a></i> by <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_White_%28author%29_6214.html" title="Ted White (author)">Ted White</a> and Dave Van Arnam, a private detective from our New York finds himself in an alternate reality where Earth is under occupation by interstellar humanoids nicknamed "Angels", who had landed in 1938, taking advantage of the confusion following <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Wells_30c5.html" title="Orson Wells">Orson Wells</a>' <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28radio%29_eb0e.html" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">War of the Worlds</a></i> radio program, and had ruled Earth as a colony ever since. In <i>Starspawn</i> by Kenneth Von Gunden, Earth is infiltrated by small parasitic aliens capable of attaching themselves to a human and controlling him or her - similar to the scenario of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Heinlein</a>'s aforementioned <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Puppet_Masters_f3e4.html" title="The Puppet Masters">The Puppet Masters</a></i> - except that the invasion takes place in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">Medieval</a> England, against the background of knights besieging a castle. In similar settings at <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul_Anderson_c3f6.html" title="Poul Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s <i><a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Crusade_7550.html" title="High Crusade">High Crusade</a></i>, an alien ship lands at a Medieval English village, but the overconfident would-be conquerors find the hard way that they are not immune to swords and arrows; the humans take over the ship and proceed to carve out an empire among the stars, but lose contact with Earth which goes on with its familiar history. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> movie <a href="../../../f/i/r/Star_Trek%7E_First_Contact_51ac.html" title="Star Trek: First Contact">Star Trek: First Contact</a> deals extensively with this theme, although the frame of reference is in the future; <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borg.html" title="Borg">Borg</a> come to Earth in <a href="../../../2/0/6/2063.html" title="2063">2063</a>, approximately two to three hundred years prior to the relevant events in the Star Trek universe.</p>

Until the end of the books, the deep-sea invaders are not seen and humans have no idea what they look like.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midwich_Cuckoos_c18f.html" title="The Midwich Cuckoos">The Midwich Cuckoos</a></i> Wyndham describes an alien ship landing at an English village, putting all its inhabitants to sleep and impregnating all the women. The children born of that visit have strong <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathy.html" title="Telepathy">telepathic</a> abilities, and upon growing up act like dangerous invaders, though in law they are nothing but a group of English children. Here, too, the identity of the aliens who planted them remains unknown until the end of the book.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still_e641.html" title="The Day the Earth Stood Still">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a></i> - alien invasion movie (1951), in which the alien being (played by Michael Rennie) and his robot/android demonstrate their superior technology and firepower by neutralizing all of mankind's electronic machines (i.e., cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc.). The theme of the movie is pacifism/anti-war/one-world government: the alien shows a superior technology and the governments of the world over-react and kill the alien as a perceived threat when his intention was to help the human race.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a></i> illustrates the effects of a prolonged occupation of Earth by an alien empire known as "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Combine_%28Half-Life_2%29_a5c0.html" title="Combine (Half-Life 2)">The Combine</a>",</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Resistance%7E_Fall_of_Man_4654.html" title="Resistance: Fall of Man">Resistance: Fall of Man</a></i> takes place in alternate World War Two, in which Most of Asia and Europe has been destroyed by the Chimera.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../k/i/l/Killzone.html" title="Killzone">Killzone</a> is in the future, where a sub-species of human, called "Helghast", invade a human colony called "Vekta", sparking a war between both races.</i></li>
<li><i>Alien Siege</i> sees aliens demanding the lives of millions of people in return for vast amounts of knowledge and technology.</li>
<li>The video game <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Halo%7E_Combat_Evolved_d61d.html" title="Halo: Combat Evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i> depicts a religious alliance comprised of different alien species known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Covenant_%28Halo%29_49f3.html" title="The Covenant (Halo)">the Covenant</a>, who invade Earth's expanding empire and destroy the majority of humanity's planets. They claim that, "Your destruction is the will of the gods, and we are their instrument!" Although the reason why the Covenant are intent on human destruction has not been fully explained, the Covenant are ruthless and brutal in their attempt to wipe out mankind.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28film%29_cbd9.html" title="Independence Day (film)">Independence Day</a></i> - instead of the typical large fleet of UFOs, aliens used large destroyers to cover an entire city and synchronize with each other worldwide by using artificial satellites so they could strike at the same time. Also very importantly, they used one giant beam of light which strikes the ground producing a large wall of fire that destroyed anything it came in to contact with, moving in an outward circular pattern (like ripples moving out in a pond).</li>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../x/-/c/X-COM_9c66.html" title="X-COM">X-COM</a></i> series depicts a series of massive alien invasion attempts on Earth, first by the hostile Sectoids, then later by bizarre creatures from another reality. The tone of each of the games is dark and tense with occasional moments of levity to break up the relentless fear. <i>Enemy Unknown</i> is the first in the series. Aliens known as Sectoids launch covert strikes against Earth-based targets from their base in the Cydonia region of Mars. X-COM is formed to research and defeat the alien threat, finally achieving its objective by reverse-engineering alien technology and destroying the Martian base. In the sequel, <i>Terror From the Deep</i>, an ancient Sectoid ship which has crash-landed beneath the ocean begins to awaken, reviving legions of Sectoids adapted to live underwater. The last true sequel is <i>Apocalypse</i>, which takes place many years after the Sectoid threat has been neutralised. In <i>Apocalypse</i>, the aliens are from another dimension rather than another planet.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_Attacks_54a4.html" title="Mars Attacks">Mars Attacks!</a></i> can be considered a parody of this genre.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_539c.html" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>, a fleet of Vogon "constructor" ships, resembling giant flying yellow bricks (symbolizing bulldozers) demolish the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. They do it in mere minutes by circling the Earth with all of their ships and firing at once; humanity is annihilated with no resistance.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Roddenberry_868c.html" title="Gene Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Earth%7E_Final_Conflict_5c9c.html" title="Earth: Final Conflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></i>, the <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taelon.html" title="Taelon">Taelon</a> race came to Earth and solved many of the worst problems of mankind, but were later revealed to have a hidden agenda of turning human beings into weapons to be used in their own war themes.</li>

<li>One of the movies parodied by <i><a href="../../../s/c/a/Scary_Movie_4_614b.html" title="Scary Movie 4">Scary Movie 4</a></i> was <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, where the humans were being destroyed by giant tripods sent by a vengeful alien father.</li>

Keroro, the main character, is taken by the Hinata family, and ends up becoming a servant to them, as well as a friend of Fuyuki Hinata. Most of the frogs regroup, but far too often, they get sidetracked in various activities with the humans. Even when they finally get serious about their mission, it still gets botched somehow.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_%28game%29_337e.html" title="Shadow the Hedgehog (game)">Shadow the Hedgehog (game)</a></i>, The <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Arms_33b3.html" title="Black Arms">Black Arms</a> aliens, lead by <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Doom_0d6a.html" title="Black Doom">Black Doom</a>, invade the earth so Black Doom can get the seven chaos emeralds and warp their vessel, the Black Comet, to earth so it can release a parylizing gas over the entire planet.
