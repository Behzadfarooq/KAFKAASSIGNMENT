<p>Alice in Chains is definetly my favorite band, but I only wish that Jerry Cantrell would have allowed Layne to sing more of the songs in their catalouge (especially for lead vocals). While Jerry may have been a more consitent song writer and less dependant on drugs, it is Layne's exceptionally powerful voice that put this band over the top and Jerry's mediocre voice is not what the fans really wanted to hear in the end. TKforever 16:04, 27 March 2006(UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, Layne sang the majority of the lead vocals.</p>

<p>Comparing the two, its pretty obvious that the better vocals were of Layne Staley anyday I feel this certain angst (sorry for the cliché) while I hear him sing,its probably the shrillness of his voice and the fact that its not a very often heard vocal pattern that gives hid voice this certain character which sets him apart. Or maybe I am just obsessed with this bands music!</p>

<dd>I've been listening to the band for a long time, and I always liked the combination of the two voices and particularly the great harmonies in a lot of the songs. It really sets Alice apart from the other bands of the same period.12.162.189.80 19:06, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anyone know anything about Alice in Chains opening the Clash of the Titans tour in 1991? I've heard that was a big boost toward their mainstream success. 72.40.53.121 23:25, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>the years on the "classic lineup" are misleading... the band was inactive for much of it due to Layne's health. For me, the "classic" (if there was one) AiC lineup was with Mike Starr on bass, not Mike Inez. With Starr they recorded Facelift, Sap and (most importantly) Dirt. With Inez they recorded only Jar of Flies and the self-titled release.</p>
<p>Dirt was their artistic peak according to most critical sources and, I would guess, is most popular with the diehard fans. Added to that, the Facelift/Sap/Dirt era was their most active touring period (although I guess Inez came in for the Dirt tour). I know I'm just being pedantic, but Alice in Chains were a very special band for me, and I loved them at a time when I was way too serious about music fandom. So it looks like I still take them too seriously.</p>
<p>I think perhaps it would be best just to refer to the different lineups as "original lineup" and "second lineup". Starr was an important part of the Alice legend even if he did fuck things up (and even if Inez was way better). Alice was one of those bands where you could take snapshots -- "classic" snapshots -- from various points of their career. You watch the video for Would? and it's Starr there with the intro and that is their all-time pinnacle. Or if you prefer Man In The Box it's Starr there again. The classic Inez moment was probably the Unplugged set, but man it was sad to see Layne look like that.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that Alice in Chains has no turntables, no rapping, and predates the "nu-metal" genre by a full decade, I can't see how anyone could seriously suggest that this band is nu-metal. They fit squarely into the grunge/alternative genre of the late 80s and early 90s. My conclusion is that the recent edits are a prank by someone who is just not a fan of the band. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 05:12, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If they truly are nu-metal, provide a source which verifies this. Googling "alice in chains grunge" comes up with 314,000 results. Googling "alice in chains nu-metal" comes up with 65,000. I check the first few pages and most are not actually refering to Alice In Chains as nu-metal, but are either: 1)Explaining the bands influence on nu-metal (without them being nu-metal, or 2)Talking about Godsmack not being nu-metal but instead being post-grunge (because of their obvious AIC influence). If you can provide proof, I will allow you to change the genre. Until then, though, they remain classified as grunge.<a href="../../../l/a/_/User%7ELa_Pizza11_cb60.html" title="User:La Pizza11">La Pizza11</a> 23:03, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Alice In Chains are not Nu-metal, but I can understand that many find them similar, as they probably influenced an good deal of Nu-metal bands. However the argument that Alice In Chains existed previous to the "Nu-metal movement" is not a good one, the music is what matters. Give a good reason, related to the music, as to why they're not Nu-metal so that everyone can see that it is so. I am also sceptic as to calling them grunge, they seem more of an alt. metal band lumped into that category simply for being contemporary to it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I listed them as crappy because they are". You're such a penis. There is no way that Alice In Chains could possibly be considered Nu-metal. Do you hear rapping and/or turntables in their songs? The argument about them not being Grunge is a better argument. But what does define Grunge? It's a very loose definition applied to many bands from the Seattle area.</dd>

<p>Since grunge was such a blanket term for the emerging seattle music scene in the early nineties, it's hard to really place any one particular band under this genre. Alice in Chains were definitely more metal but were classified grunge more because of where they were from and when.</p>
<p>Metal? I considered them to be grunge, but not because of where they were from. I classified them to be grunge because of their fusion of metal/punk/alternative influences. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:25, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Grunge is the label that they were/are put under, that really shouldn't be disputed. It is blatantly evident that the traditional heavy metal influences are very apparent on their debut, as well as other albums. I guess most people that edit this page are somewhat unfamiliar with either their early work or what metal is, to be reverting these edits. I even cited the Encyclopaedia Metallum entry, who are well-known in the metal realm for their strict submission guidelines. A good amount of the so-called "heavy metal" bands on Wikipedia do not show up there. There really isn't much reason for getting rid of metal other than ignorance. --<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyouga_27f8.html" title="User:Ryouga">Ryouga</a> 00:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alice is way more metal than grunge the only reason they were labeled grunge is because of there seattle roots and look, all of the grunge bands (Nirvana, Mudhoney, Screamin Tress etc) were on Sub Pop and playing local shows while Alice was out toruing with Van Halen, and if you listen to the music its obvious that facelift, dirt, &amp; tripod are Hard Rock albums if not metal albums</p>

<p>If someone would care to revisist their alice in chains albums, they will note that they are not grunge but metal. the reason aforementioned for being labeled grunge is widely held to be true, just ask some actual fans. and for that matter, soundgarden is also not grunge and to a lesser extent, neither is pearl jam. anyone care to comment? <a href="../../../l/u/e/User%7ELue3378_f66f.html" title="User:Lue3378">Lue3378</a> 08:46, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though you definitely have point, I disagree withyou. Grunge is the term used to describe early 90 bands almost exclusively from Seattle that fused metal and punk. Grunge music describes a large amount of bands which do not necessarily sound similar, but do have similar roots and lyrical themes.<a href="../../../l/a/_/User%7ELa_Pizza11_cb60.html" title="User:La Pizza11">La Pizza11</a> 18:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do believe Alice in Chain's music would be best described as metal, but due to the fact they came from Seattle during the so called "Grunge Explosion" they would best fit under the "grunge" banner. Grunge was more a term used to describe a certain style of dress and locality as opposed to music. Most of the "grunge" bands did not sound at all similar. Alice in Chains was metal and belonged to the Seattle Sound genre of music, but history will always list them as a grunge band. Just my $0.02 on the matter <a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscalia_eb42.html" title="User:Jscalia">Jason Scalia</a> 03:55, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alice in Chains started as a metal band but later became grunge. People used to give them shit for not being part of the Sub Pop grunge scene, although later they became friends with a lot of bands like Soundgarden. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 07:20, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also have to add that regarding the whole Seattle scene, Layne Staley was close friends with both Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Mark Lanegan of the Screaming Trees, both of whom are considered to be musical pioneers of the Seattle movement.</p>
<p>I think that all grunge bands are really alternative metal bands, as they play an alternative form of metal, fusing punk/metal and whatnot. as somebody said before, grunge is a label created by mainsteam record companies and refers to the clothes and the culture rather than the actual music.</p>
<p>I agree with you because Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Sound Garden were more punky Metal or Punky Hard Rock. Thats what I liked about these bands! Is Guns N Roses not the real pioneers of turning rock around? They used punk with Metal/Rock but to a lesser extent than the 90s punky Metal/Hard Rock bands.</p>
<p>This debate will go on and on, I prefer Metal, they did tour with the likes of Megadeth, Slayer, &amp; Anthrax and they started out as a hair metal band. But I can see them also labeled as "grunge'. <a href="../../../x/u/c/User%7EXuchilbara_5563.html" title="User:Xuchilbara">Xuchilbara</a> 04:27, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just thought I'd add my thoughts here: Few, if any, 'Grunge' bands sound very similar; the unifying aspects of Grunge for me were: Attitude; appearance; lyrical content; geographical location and time. Those are the only things that actually tie together most Grunge bands. Anyhoo, I say keep the Grunge tag for that reason, and because most people get into AIC after hearing of them as 'a really great Grunge band' or similar. Stratpod 03:33, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you're certainly not the only one. At least in my opinion, Layne Staley was the very heart and soul of AiC, and I would list him at the top of both the infobox and the AiC template, because I am of the opinion that AiC died alongside of Layne.</dd>

<p>I agree. Perhaps we could add the list of founding members above current members.</p>
<p>I dont think Layne ever left AiC. He lives on in their music. He sang most of the stuff and wrote some. He really was AiC. Jerry was really important too(he wrote so much) but its just easier to replace a guitarist if they leave a band than a vocalist. If I was Jerry I wouldve started a new band with a new name instead of trying to keep AiC going without Layne(like Dave Grohl did with Foo Fighters after Kurt offed himself). <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamentingvampire09_f97f.html" title="User:Lamentingvampire09">Lamentingvampire09</a> 12:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article makes it sound like AIC just chose not to tour because of Staleys "health", but I clearly remember them just not playing shows they were schedualed at. They were supposed to be on the "Summer Shit" tour with Metallica, Suicidal and Candlebox. They were even on the advertising and merchandiseing, but failed to show up at either the L.A. or Las Vegas dates. I am thinking that at least 3 times I had a ticket to a show that they were supposed to play at and did not. The only time I actually got to see them was on the Facelift tour. It would be interesting if it could be researched what tours they actually did, and what tours and shows had to be canceled due to Staleys.. uhhh..

<p>via this part: "... Early career (1987–1990) In 1987, Layne Staley met guitarist and song-writer Jerry Cantrell at a party and allowed him to stay at the Music Bank with him. ..."</p>
<p>Was the Music Bank his recording studio or what? I know there's an album called "Music Bank"... but, that sentence makes it sound like it was a place too. Would be nice if someone would explain. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowicide_13d7.html" title="User:Cowicide">Cowicide</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowicide_6ca7.html" title="User talk:Cowicide">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cowicide_3f9c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cowicide">contribs</a>) 22:20, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I was going to add a sentence about Eddy Vedder's lament "4/20/02" - a hidden track on the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Dogs_%28album%29_b5c7.html" title="Lost Dogs (album)">Lost Dogs</a> album, but then I wondered about whether it really fits? It is certainly relevent. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 00:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's specific to Layne, so it probably belongs in his article. (It's already mentioned there.) I don't think it's relevant to Alice in Chains as a band. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisB_39d0.html" title="User:ChrisB">ChrisB</a> 05:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, guys, ffs, will you discuss the Genre here and stop just editing the info box? It's such a pointless edit and its all that happens to the artical, just figure it out here and lets get some proper editing done, I'm not a massive fan but I'll veture the opening of the debate: I prepose Alt-Metal.--<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerdiaob_16f0.html" title="User:Ferdiaob">Ferdia O'Brien</a> 18:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
