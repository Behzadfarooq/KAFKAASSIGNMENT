He became a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Member of the Privy Council</a> on entering Cabinet.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> he was made the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Social_Security_ab0d.html" title="Secretary of State for Social Security">Secretary of State for Social Security</a> replacing <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Harman_9923.html" title="Harriet Harman">Harriet Harman</a> who had been dismissed. After the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2001_c88c.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2001">2001 General Election</a>, the department for Social Security was abolished and replaced with the new <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions_2db2.html" title="Department for Work and Pensions">Department for Work and Pensions</a>, which also took employment away from the education portfolio, Darling headed the new department until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> when he was transferred to the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_for_Transport_4797.html" title="Department for Transport">Department for Transport</a>, in the wake of his predecessor <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Byers_f312.html" title="Stephen Byers">Stephen Byers</a> resigning after a great deal of criticism.</p>
<p>As Transport Secretary, Darling was given a brief to "take the department out of the headlines" and was widely considered to have achieved this, although he was also criticised for achieving too little else whilst he held the transport brief. He oversaw the creation of <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Rail_3734.html" title="Network Rail">Network Rail</a>, the successor to <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railtrack.html" title="Railtrack">Railtrack</a>, which had collapsed in controversial circumstances for which his predecessor was largely blamed. He also procured the passage of the legislation - the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways_and_Transport_Safety_Act_2003_08ad.html" title="Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003">Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003</a> - which abolished the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_Regulator_0642.html" title="Rail Regulator">Rail Regulator</a> and replaced it with the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Rail_Regulation_5dd9.html" title="Office of Rail Regulation">Office of Rail Regulation</a>. He was responsible for the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways_Act_2005_bf2b.html" title="Railways Act 2005">Railways Act 2005</a> which abolished the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Rail_Authority_3bf2.html" title="Strategic Rail Authority">Strategic Rail Authority</a>, a creation of the Labour government under the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Act_2000_9e25.html" title="Transport Act 2000">Transport Act 2000</a>.</p>
<p>Although he was not at the Department for Transport at the time of the collapse of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railtrack.html" title="Railtrack">Railtrack</a>, Darling vigorously defended what had been done in a speech to the House of Commons on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a> 2005. This included the making of threats to the independent Rail Regulator that if he intervened to defend the company against the government's attempts to force it into railway administration - a special status for insolvent railway companies - the government would introduce emergency legislation to take the regulator under direct political control. This stance by Darling surprised many observers because during his tenure at the Department for Transport he had made several statements to Parliament and the financial markets assuring them that the government regarded independence in economic regulation of the railways as essential.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Office_10e7.html" title="Scottish Office">Scottish Office</a> was folded into the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_for_Constitutional_Affairs_a1eb.html" title="Department for Constitutional Affairs">Department for Constitutional Affairs</a>, he was made <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Secretary_2e06.html" title="Scottish Secretary">Scottish Secretary</a> in combination with his transport portfolio in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. In the Cabinet reshuffle of May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he was moved to his current position of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Trade_and_Industry_1b9e.html" title="Secretary of State for Trade and Industry">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</a>; <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Alexander_cff3.html" title="Douglas Alexander">Douglas Alexander</a> replaced him as both <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport_2ef6.html" title="Secretary of State for Transport">Secretary of State for Transport</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland_682d.html" title="Secretary of State for Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a>. On 10 November 2006 in a mini-reshuffle, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Wicks_8508.html" title="Malcolm Wicks">Malcolm Wicks</a>, the Minister for Energy at the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_for_Trade_and_Industry_8f3d.html" title="Department for Trade and Industry">Department for Trade and Industry</a> and therefore one of Darling's junior ministers, was appointed Minister for Science. Darling took over day-to-day control of the Energy portfolio.</p>
<p>Darling is the great nephew of Sir <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Darling_a7d9.html" title="William Darling">William Darling</a> who was Conservative MP for Edinburgh South (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>). He has been married to Margaret McQueen Vaughan since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> and they have a son and a daughter. After the creation of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> the number of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> seats at Westminster was reduced, his Edinburgh Central seat was abolished and since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> he has represented the new seat of Edinburgh South West. The Labour Party was so concerned that Darling might be defeated in Edinburgh South West in the 2005 general election that several of the most senior of the party's leading members - including Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and Chancellor Gordon Brown (Darling's political mentor) - made supportive visits to the constituency during the election campaign, and despite being a senior Cabinet minister himself during the campaign Darling was hardly seen outside the area, so hard was he working to win the seat. In the event, he won it comfortably, with a majority of 7,242 over the second-placed Conservative candidate, a 16.49% margin on a 65.4% turnout.</p>

<p>Although he is frequently tipped as a leading contender to be appointed <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_78e8.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> if <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Brown_e90d.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a> succeeds Tony Blair as prime minister, Darling's qualifications for appointment are not obvious. His record as a minister is mainly one of being so cautious as not to make any decisions of significance, at least not without the prior specific approval of Gordon Brown. Other commentators believe that may be Darling's greatest advantage in his hopes to succeed Brown at the Treasury.</p>

<p>Although he is one of only seven Ministers who have been continuously in the Cabinet since New Labour gained office at the May 1997 general election, Darling's public recognition rating is low. He was voted Britain's most boring politician two years running. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/01/05/nbul05.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/01/05/ixhome.html#2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/01/05/nbul05.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/01/05/ixhome.html#2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> In his book <i>Servants of the People</i>, about New Labour's first term of office (1997-2001), Andrew Rawnsley described Darling as a "managerial technocrat" of a type preferred by Prime Minister Tony Blair. "Robotic" is another description which is sometimes applied to him.</p>

<p>Due to his unusual combination of white hair and black eyebrows, he is a frequent target by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Merton_bc3d.html" title="Paul Merton">Paul Merton</a> on <i><a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_I_Got_News_For_You_715d.html" title="Have I Got News For You">Have I Got News For You</a></i>. Paul has on numerous occasions sparked debates as to whether Darling dyes his hair or his eyebrows. When <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hislop_1212.html" title="Ian Hislop">Ian</a>, his fellow panel member, told him that Darling once had a black beard too, Paul finally decided that he dyed his hair.</p>
