<p>Hello. It is POV to say that his actions were "egregious" (<i>Wordnet: conspicuously and outrageously bad or reprehensible</i>). Wikipedia is not here to judge what is "outrageously bad"; we present information in an npov way and try to not abuse adjectives. You can leave it up to the reader to judge whether his actions were "egregious" (and especially whether they were the <i>most</i> egregious). I'm not defending his actions, but if we present the facts, then readers should be able to judge for themselves that he was egregious without us preaching it to them. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.224.153.40.html" title="User:24.224.153.40">24.224.153.40</a> 00:15, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hai <b>Ali</b>, there are intresting articles about <b>Ayyavazhi</b>, a new religion on both mythology and religiosity. Wikipedia is rich with this topic in English, but poor in other languages. Since french is a leading language in Wikipedia it is better to translate the contents on this <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">Ayyavazhi</a> family to french. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj">Paul Raj</a></p>

<p>Since joining Wikipedia recently I have learnt an awful lot, and one of those things is the value of teamwork. It has become increasingly apparent to me that there are absolutely tons of people out there devoted to editing the Scottish articles, but we communicate only haphazardly. To begin to attempt to remedy this, I have initiated a notice board for all Scoto-fans!</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Burning Man image</span></h3>
<p>Did you take the Burning Man image? Currently, attendees at Bman who want to take photos and put them to potential commercial use (such as the GFDL allows) you have to get special permission of the Bman media people. Was this the case to your knowledge in 1999 when you took the photo? I would not be surprised if these restrictions were more recent, but I am trying to make sure that we have permission to use all the images on <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> so I would appreciate any info you have on your picture.

<li>I've done some tidy-up on the article. Reckon the cleanup tag can be reduced to cleanup-section on one or two of the new sections. I've made a first attempt at adding sections - see what you think. Also, I fixed up the disambig page &amp; put dablinks up on the two Sheehan pages.</li>

You might want to consider using 'sandbox' pages so you can do your own private editing, if you're finding others are stamping on your edits. That way, you can edit away to your heart's content and only merge it with the live article when you're good and happy with it. Otherwise, well-meaning editors will come around and modify it (as is their right, mind). I see you mentioned Neil O'Donnell and linked to one of his images.

<p>That is the one I was trying to put on yesterday. It is truly splendid.</p>
<p>Well: M- how very coincidental. From B, but in exile. There is more to be put on about Canon Sheehan; especially an appraisal of his writing. Imagine the one who dumped him off yesterday.

<li>Thanks a million. The photographs worked out magnificently. See how marvellous the interior is and how well preserved it is after nearly 800 years. Any luck with the the Duc de Berry hours. There is a columbarioum on the right hand side.</li>
<li>Dear Ali,ù</li>
</ul>
<p>I have included a few more pictures on the Buttevant site and would be obliged oif you could upload them. The picure from the Berry hours is already on the site for the book of hours as is the one of Napoleon. There are also two of Buttevant Friary by the same man who took the Ballybeg pictures. Alsoi, I have a oprint from Smith's History of Cork (1760) of the inside of the Friary before the tower fell down in 1814 and would loike to scan and mount it too. How do I do that?</p>

<p>Thanks much for your welcome msg on my talk page.</p>
<p>A quick question about your edit on the CCO'B page....</p>
<p>You restored the commentaries leading to Bowen-Colthurst and WB Yeats, which someone (not me) had deleted. It seems to me that those sentences are wandering way off the topic and probably should be dropped. In the first one, we're reporting the retirement fate of someone who ordered the killing of the husband of an aunt of CCO'B. The second one discusses a former love interest of the mother of one of CCO'B's bosses.</p>
<p>I'm sure that this material is verifiable, but wouldn't it be better placed in the entries for those various individuals... yes/no?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transsexuality</span></h2>
<p>Hi Ali-Oops. After seeing your revert of this article, I reverted part of it back. Even though I am a transsexual woman myself and I am against all forms of discrimination against transpeople, I also agree with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy and strive to follow it when editing articles. Well, one thing I have noticed about this article is that it uses "transsexuality" in some sections and "transsexualism" in others; I think it should use one term consistently, other than for having a brief notation that both terms are used interchangeably (not within the article though). I have considered renaming it as "transsexualism" as that seems to be the term in widest use today, but as you recommend, I feel I should discuss such a change before making it. I left a note about this on the article's talk page, but so far, no one has responded. I also would like for this article to be <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured</a>, but it still needs a lot of work. I will appreciate anything you can do to improve it.</p>

<p>Regarding your comment on my talk page. Did you want me to do something about it?

<li>There's not a lot <i>can</i> be done about it, unfortunately. Robert was banned a few weeks ago due to his behaviour and attitude, yet he persists on evading the ban using various IP addresses. Most of his talk page comments are just personal attacks/accusations re. various editors. Right now, he's collecting editors who are monitoring his vandalism &amp; on it goes. Thanks for the offer, though - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">Ali-oops</a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAli-oops_b892.html" title="User talk:Ali-oops"><font color="DarkRed">✍</font></a></sup> 06:13, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
