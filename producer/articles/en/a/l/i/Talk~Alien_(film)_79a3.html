<p>Regarding the following sentence from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The alien embryo is discovered in a ruined pyramid on an alien planet; this concept was actually held onto for a long time, and preliminary H.R. Giger pyramid drawings intended for Alien exist, but eventually the producers went with the idea of a wrecked derelict (also designed by Giger, even though the ship was supposed to be that of a different alien species).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>What is meant here by "different alien species"? It is my understanding that the derelict was built by a different species than the "aliens", that it was infested with the aliens, and its crew was defeated by them. One of their corpses is seen by the humans as they first begin to explore the derelict. The above passage is very ambiguous, but I suppose you could interpret it to mean that the derelict was built and piloted by the <i>aliens</i>, but that is not the case. In other words, it makes little sense to say that the ship was <i>supposed</i> to be that of a different species, when it <i>was</i> in fact that of a different species. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 20:50, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think what was meant by that was that initially, there were meant to be two seperate alien cultures in the film: the alien on the ship, which was from an advanced, spacefaring civilisation, and the aliens who built the pyramid and worshipped the Aliens, who were a primitive, Bronze-Age level society. The bronze-age Alien-worshippers were subsequently dropped. 82.35.49.147 11:27, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is quite impressive how well the 1979 film has stood the test of time, visually. Watching a rerun on cable the other week, I found myself musing that, apart from some rather dated computer displays on the Nostromo, the sets and gear could easily be deployed in a new science-fiction film today and few audience members would notice anything out-of-date.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Just to let you know that when it talks about the other alien species, it is talking about that thing that seems to be in the "chair like thing", that is all white, when the crew enter the space-ship on <a href="../../../l/v/-/LV-426_105c.html" title="LV-426">LV-426</a>, and then the screen shoots to where Ripley says to Ash that Mother has de-coded the message and that it's actually a warning.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. And oh yeah, now that I have explained this to you, you might want to add in the part of the text that you removed.</p>

<p>There is some confusion as to Ripley's status; is she military personnel or not, and what is her rank?</p>
<p>In the 1979 novelisation of the original <i>Alien</i>, when Ripley confronts Dallas about taking off from the planet, Dallas clearly states "this isn't a military vessel...standard procedure is to do what the hell they tell you to do". This would fit in with the fact that the <b>Nostromo</b> is a commercial towing vehicle.</p>
<p>Ripley's status in <i>Aliens</i> seems to be as a civilian advisor to the Colonial Marines. She wears no uniform and is not addressed by rank. Lieutenant Gorman and Sergeant Apone (who is called "Master Sergeant" in the novelisation, but in the film wears U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class chevrons; one grade below Master Sergeant in both the Army and Marines) are in charge.</p>
<p>However, in both the movie and novel of <i>Alien3</i>, Ripley is addressed as "Lieutenant" (pronounced "lef-tenant" by the primarily British cast). The novelisation also clearly states "she <i>was</i> military, after all".</p>
<p>So, when did she "morph" from being a "civilian" Warrant Officer to a "military" Lieutenant?--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 22:36, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the line is meant to indicate that Ripley had previous military experience before working on the Nostromo. However, this is inconsistent with her attitudes among the marines in Aliens, I would think.</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Still unsure. As a former USAF enlisted man, I can add my perspective. The Marines may not have liked her simply because she was an officer (remember that SGT Apone and CPL Hicks pretty much ran things, which is the case a lot of the time in military situations, corporals and sergeants running things with an officer overseeing them), if she indeed was (remember how contemptuous they were of Lt Gorman?), but they would have had to give her an officer's customs and courtesies (salutes, addressing her either by rank or "Ma'am", etc - they addressed her by last name, which would have been a big, big no-no). In the US forces a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrant_officer.html" title="Warrant officer">warrant officer</a> is entitled to the same courtesies as commissioned officers (lieutenants and above), but they still rank below lieutenants.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 22:45, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>i am fairly unfamilar with non-naval meritime(having to do with ships) ranking systems but is it possible that her spot on the nostromo, gave her the rank of lieutenant, or lef-tenant (which if i recall correctly was a british naval rank, not a very high one though) along with her being a warrent officer? -manwithbrisk</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Again, this is a really grey area. About the only analogy I can draw is officers in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Merchant_Marine_142c.html" title="United States Merchant Marine">United States Merchant Marine</a>, who, when in uniform, are almost indistinguishable from <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_Guard_32fd.html" title="Coast Guard">Coast Guard</a> officers (the USMM is closely linked to the USCG) and would have definitely rated a salute from me when I was in the military. The novelisation implies that "warrant officer" was a position, not a rank, but in the U.S. Armed Forces (which seem to be the model for the rank structures), a warrant officer is a specialist officer in between enlisted and commissioned officer ranks. Of course, in the novel of the first film, Dallas is the only one given an actual rank title (captain). The only explanation I can find is that she would have been given <i><b>honorary</b></i> lieutenant's rank in <i>Aliens</i>, since they were going into a combat situation. She would have no longer held warrant officer status in Weyland-Yutani's merchant fleet, since they basically cleaned her out in the corporate board of enquiry in <i>Aliens</i>. NB: In the novelisation of <i>Aliens</i>, Burke, when trying to persuade her to go out again with the Colonial Marines, tells her "one more trip and you qualify for a captain's certificate." This would imply to me that she was never truly military, but held a specific position (warrant officer) aboard the <i>Nostromo</i>, which was an unarmed vessel owned by "The Company"/Weyland Yutani. Incidentally, in the USN/USCG there are two grades of lieutenant, close to the bottom of the officer tier (but still outranking warrant officers) and in the Royal Navy and Commonwealth Navies (Australia, Canada, NZ) there are "acting sub-lieutenant", "<a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-lieutenant.html" title="Sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a>" and "<a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">lieutenant</a>" ranks, though the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_New_Zealand_Navy_73bd.html" title="Royal New Zealand Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a> follows US precedent in using "<a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensign.html" title="Ensign">ensign</a>" as its lowest commissioned rank. Having said all of this, I still maintain that Ripley was a <b>civilian</b>, though one with considerable combat experience! --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 22:45, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(*) There are two theories about how the egg was found within the Sulaco: - The Alien Mother laid it there during the escape from LV-426 (which is almost impossible since its tale-like birth-pipe was broken apart during the explosions and left behind, she couldn't laid any other egg then), - The egg was recovered by Bishop while Ripley came back looking for Newt before the Atmosphere Procesor would explode; Ripley came back to the landing area and Bishop wasn't there. Following his scientific goals, Bishop had enough time to leave the landing area and to pick one of the eggs up to finally bring it back home (Earth) after escaping from the LV-426; Corporal Hicks was on the ship with him but he was knocked down since he got hurt while running away from the Aliens.</p>

<p>Why the crap are Predator and Predator 2 listed as prequels?? They're a completely different franchise! Yeah, I'm definitely one of those anal Alien fans who despise the crossover, but are we so technical as to claim that they're prequels to the Alien saga?</p>
<p>If anything, you can throw AvP in there, because it actually featured the Alien in it... Still, does anyone else think it's really weird to suddenly lump Alien and Predator within the same franchise? It's illogical to call something a prequel just because of a crossover. It really didn't lead up to the Alien storyline at all (neither did AvP...that just happened before, and never had any sort of direct effect on the plot of the Alien films)</p>
<p>For this reason, I've removed the Predator films from the list. If I'm mistaken, please, I'd really like to get another opinion in on this.</p>

What is the name of this fish?--<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonjaaa_33fb.html" title="User:Sonjaaa">Sonjaaa</a> 16:41, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have deleted the sentence in the Alien Resurrection summary that says the Betty landed in Paris on Earth. This only happens in the Special Edition of Alien Resurrection and directly contradicts the ending of the theatrical version. In the theatrical version Ripley utters her final line "I don't know, I'm a stranger here myself" while still aboard the Betty. Also, the Betty is shown flying over an island beach (not a ruined city) and Call comments on how beautiful it is. In the novel Aliens: Original Sin (2005), the Betty lands on a beach in New Zealand, indicating that the theatrical ending is considered canon. Although novels are not canon they are required to be consistent with canon.</p>

<p>The <b>Influence</b> section is terrible. Here are the problems I have with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no introduction to the section. There should be a short paragraph explaining the impact that the film has had not only for horror and sci-fi movies, but for movies in general.</li>
<li>It degrades into a list of other movies and games that have merely referenced it. These are less and influence than an homage, and should probably be in a separate section.</li>
<li>Some items in the list are neither <i>Influenced Works</i> nor <i>References to Alien</i>, but something else altogether, namely the <i>Helene Cixous</i> item and should be moved. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus</a> 21:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I agree, especially on the second point&#160;: it's preferable, for clarity's sake, to split the Influence section in two separate sections&#160;: one being a "Reference" section, containing all little references and homages to the Alien movie(s) in games and movies, and the other being the <i>real</i> "Influence" section, containing the works influenced by Alien movie(s). <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceNoctali_d07a.html" title="User:AceNoctali">AceNoctali</a> 15:47, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Agreed!</b> Either I'm wrong, or someone is very confused about a plot section's purpose: I thought it sought to <b>briefly describe</b> a film's story, not to reproduce it in its entirety, dialogs included.

<dd>Moot point since this has been reworked now, but to answer the original question: The task when comparing things is to high-light their similarities <b>and</b> differences. If there were no similarities, there'd be nothing to note. If there were no differences, they would be identical. By summing up the differences <b>and</b> similarities, you can judge the level of influence and originality in the successor work. For example, if you wanted to compare <i>Flash Gordon</i> with <i>Alien</i>, about the only thing they have in common is that they both feature spaceships, so you could conclude that <i>Flash Gordon</i> was not an influence on <i>Alien</i>. When you compare <i>It!</i> with <i>Alien</i>, you find many similarities, which implies <i>It!</i> was an influence, at least on the storyline, but also many original features in <i>Alien</i>, which are what makes <i>Alien</i> a much better movie than <i>It!</i>. BTW, try comparing <i>Alien</i> with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thing_From_Another_World_370b.html" title="The Thing From Another World">The Thing From Another World</a></i>... --<a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscar_Bravo_279f.html" title="User:Oscar Bravo">Oscar Bravo</a> 07:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The influence section is, in my opinion, terrible. At this point, it is just a list of movies, games, comics, TV shows and miscellany that have referenced the film (or simply have creatures with a similar design). It is beyond cruft. It is <a href="../../../u/b/e/Uber.html" title="Uber">uber</a>-cruft. Alien has had a such a huge influence on not only horror films, but films in many genres, and instead of discussing those influences, we simply have a list of references. I would love to get this article up to featured status, so let's try and eliminate the cruft and put in some good encyclopedic material about Alien's place in movie history. I mean, Alien was deemed "culturally significant" Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

<dd>I dunno what do you mean by "cruft" (neither me nor my English-French dictionary does know that word), but... This is the second time you're complaining about the Influence Section, and this is the second time I'll answer you. Like you, I'd really love to improve that article, since I'm an uber fan of the Alien saga. I already proposed to separate the section in two parts&#160;: one being the "real" Influence section, the other being the Reference section.</dd>
<dd>Here's my new proposition&#160;: take out ALL the references, create a new Wikipedia article by the name of "List of references to Alien movies", or a title in that style, and put those references in it. Then, put a link of that article into the "Alien" article. A bit like what has been done in, for example, <a href="../../../g/e/t/GetBackers_b7e6.html" title="GetBackers">GetBackers</a> article about the characters' list. And then, create the real Influence section (for this, I'll let you take care of it, since it seems you have an idea about this).

<dd>Hopefully it should still look good as it'll be based on your AVP template - using a table so the headers are on the left will reduce the amount of vertical height each section requires (in the current Alien template) will be reduced so the end result shouldn't take up anymore room that the current Alien one while fitting more information in (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 17:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC))

<dd>I suppose it depends on what the topmost entry is. If it is this one then most certainly. I went with the film series one as it links off to all the film and can be considered as a higher level entry. A fix might be: Alien, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Category%7EPredator_series_5ab1.html" title="Category:Predator series">Predator</a> &amp; <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_vs._Predator_f0d6.html" title="Alien vs. Predator">Alien vs. Predator</a> - although note that Category:Alien series links to the film series entry at the top. I think this will have to be a group decision. I am not really fussed either way although marginally lean towards having it as it is. See what other people think and its easy enough to change.

<li><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Quadrilogy_8a7e.html" title="Alien Quadrilogy">Alien Quadrilogy</a> - deals with the boxset and, as great as it is, I suspect it could go in <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_%28film_series%29.html" title="Alien (film series)">Alien (film series)</a></li>

<dd>It isn't just about the size (though it was overly long). It's also about the "in this film", "at the start of the film" type text. It's just things like those examples that should be removed. I haven't had a chance to read through the whole plot summary, but those are things I just caught in the first paragraph. Sometimes they are necessary to explain what is going on, but usually they are needless text that can be removed. Example, we don't need the "this film mostly takes place on the Nostromo", because that will become evident during the reading of the plot itself. I think you've done a good job of shortening it, but not it needs some copyediting (which, most likely will shorten it some more, but that's not definitive). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 17:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most critics and fans of the film have commented on the theme of the human birth cycle. When Kane, Dallas, and Lambert venture into the alien craft, they enter through giant vagina-like openings and travel up a tunnel that resembles the birth canal. The fossilized alien sits in a long, telescopic phallus-shaped piece of machinery, and the audience can intrepret the egg that Kane finds as an <a href="../../../o/v/u/Ovum.html" title="Ovum">ovum</a>. Such imagery fits with the often sexual nature of Giger's art.</p>
<p>The film presents a version of birth that might seem almost empathetic with that of the woman's experience: the alien bursting from Kane's chest reflects the intense pain that a woman experiences during natural child-birth (birth without <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anesthesia.html" title="Anesthesia">anesthesia</a>). The film also more broadly deals with issues of human sexuality, including <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_love.html" title="Free love">free love</a> and even <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, although these last two points only emerge in the director's audio commentary on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>.</p>
<p>Another major theme of the film deals with <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue-collar_worker.html" title="Blue-collar worker">blue-collar workers</a> faced with extraordinary circumstances. With the exception of Ash (the science officer), all the characters, even the officers, appear as working-class. In contrast stands the image of a corporation that puts profit before the safety of its workers. Ripley speculates that the company wanted the creature for its weapons division. To acquire it, the company makes the lives of the crew members expendable. This may reflect an American view of the economic culture of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, when millions of blue-collar workers lost their jobs as American corporations shut down factories and other production facilities in favor of cheap, overseas labor. David Giler and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Hill_62d5.html" title="Walter Hill">Walter Hill</a> added these paranoia themes, much to the chagrin of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_O%27Bannon_7953.html" title="Dan O'Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a> who thought they had used his film to make a trite statement against the American <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work_ethic.html" title="Work ethic">work-ethic</a>.</p>
<p>The film also explores the confusion of artificial with organic. The initial stress laid on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_life_cycle.html" title="Biological life cycle">life-cycles</a> and biological processes eventually eases off once the alien births. After it escapes, much weight is given to visually confusing its smooth head with metal piping and its spindly, bristling legs and tail with wires, chains, and grates. The film further explores this theme with the computer system "Mother", with the revelation of Ash as an android, and with the realization that Ash's mission involves regarding humans as accessories or mechanisms in the process of preserving the alien and of bringing it to Earth at all costs.</p>
<p>The name of the ship, "Nostromo", provides a reference to the novel of the same name by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Conrad_a506.html" title="Joseph Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>, an author visited earlier by Ridley Scott in his movie <i>The Duelists</i>. In Conrad's <i>Nostromo</i>, a silver-mining corporation entrusts a dangerous cargo (silver — dangerous because revolutionaries want it) to an audacious anti-hero called Nostromo, tasking him with protecting it from the revolutionaries. This may link with the idea of blue-collar workers facing impossible odds, as mentioned above. Given the eventual destruction of the alien cargo, like the betrayal of the silver in Conrad's <i>Nostromo</i>, one could draw parallels between the eventual corruption of Nostromo and the "corruption" of Ripley. The shuttle <i>Narcissus</i> also comes from Conrad's oeuvre: see <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nigger_of_the_Narcissus_879a.html" title="The Nigger of the Narcissus">The Nigger of the Narcissus</a></i>.</p>

<p>I removed the list of deleted scenes. I did this for several reasons, one is that listing isn't good for an article and another is that listing every deleted scene is unencyclopedic, it runs up there with expanded plots that detail everything that happens in a film. If it was something special, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman_II%7E_The_Richard_Donner_Cut_0e82.html" title="Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut">Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut</a>, then I could understand. There is a history behind that film's deleted scenes, steming back 20 years. The scenes that were deleted in this film were done by the original Director for the same reasons that every Director deletes them. Noting that there are deleted scenes, that the Director's cut is actually shorter than the original theatrical, and that the Quadrilogy allows you to view either film is enough to note. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 03:32, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. When I was checking out the article, I noticed a lack of a Reception section. I think part of the problem is that, when I looked, I mostly found reviews of the 2004 re-release.

<p>There is no evidence provided to support this claim. Many action films prior to Alien featured female protagonists in the heroine role. This was a huge trend in blaxploitation films, notably Coffy and Foxy Brown. Many 60s spy/mod films, for instance Modesty Blaise, also featured a female heroine in an action film.

<dd>Any of the versions I have contributed would satisfy me, and I regard any of them as better and more expressive of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> than the bland formula "<i><b>Alien'</b> is a ... film ...". We certainly can and do treat</i> Alien <i>as a film, but we could equally (and people do) discuss</i> Alien <i>as a cultural icon, as a cinematographic turning point, and or as a watershed in the careers of Ridley Scott and/or Sigourney Weaver. The file</i> Alien <i>"is" all of these things. To use the simple assertion that "</i><b>Alien'</b> is a ... film ..." belittles the phenomenon and reduces it to a single category. I wouldn't want to see us doing that in the first sentence of any Wikipedia article. (For hints on the arrogant dogmatism and potential confusion resulting from the use of "is" and other forms of the verb "to be", see the article on <a href="../../../e/-/p/E-Prime_aa15.html" title="E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.) - <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 01:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly <i>Alien</i> was more than just a film, but I don't think we're "belittling the phenomenon" in the first sentence. We're stating the simple fact that <i>Alien</i> is, first and foremost, a film. But it's not like we're completely ignoring its other attributes, as they're covered in the very next sentences (hopefully), and people don't usually stop after reading the first sentence of the article.</dd>

<p>With your wording, it sounds like the article is about Ridley Scott, not the film itself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly, but we already have the article's title written bold and large immediately above, and we have the entire context of the article to restore any perceived imbalance between Scott and <i>Alien</i>. I sometimes use the title as the first word or phrase (see above for examples of my suggestions), but we could make a case for disparaging the practice as repetitive and formulaic. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 01:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Films don't simply spring into existence: someone makes them. We can highlight a director or a star or whoever functions as an active agent in getting a film made. This article contains the length and detail that it does because of the creative work of Ridley Scott and his people.

<p>I've also seen you add some "in order to"'s when just "to" would suffice.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I plead guilty as charged. For example, on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">12-14</a> I changed the sentence "The crew split up into two teams to capture the creature" into "The crew split up into two groups in order to capture the creature". My version sounds more euphonious, avoiding the confusing sound-repetition of "in<b>to two</b> teams <b>to</b>". My version also by-passes any hint of ambiguity as to whether the phrase "to capture" refers to the "teams" (teams with the purpose of capturing) or to the "split" (splitting in order to capture). We could improve the situation still futher by re-casting the sentence into "In order to capture the creature, the crew split into two groups." - <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 01:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "in order"'s don't add anything at all-the repetitive "two/to" sounds are still there. But I agree a re-wording is necessary.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "in order"'s break up at least one of the combinations. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 05:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, you linked <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_office.html" title="Box office">box office</a> as <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_office.html" title="Box office">box-office</a>. That doesn't sound right.</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, changing "box office success" to "box-office success" better reflects the sound of the spoken phrase. The text "box office success" appears ambiguous when out-of-context: the reader cannot tell whether it refers to a success in an office where that success has something to do with a box, with boxes or with boxing; or whether it references a success which has something to do with what we call "the box-office". We hyphenate the noun-phrase "box-office" to alleviate the ambiguity -- especially when using "box-office" as an adjectival phrase, as in this case. - <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 01:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look at basically any film article and you'll see they pretty much all read the same in the opening line. The opening line is supposed to be about "what is this film" not what happened to the film. If a film was released in 1960, it's a 1960 film. If it's a horror film, then it's a 1960 horror film. Saying "it went into release in 1960" is not only just verbose wording but implies that the film is still in release today. Maybe that could be understandable to films released in December, which might make them effectively a film of one year and of the new year, but this particular film was released in May. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 01:58, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
