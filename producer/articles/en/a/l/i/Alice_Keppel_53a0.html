<p>Keppel was born Alice Frederica Edmonstone, to Sir William Edmonstone, 4th Baronet and Mary Elizabeth Edmonstone, née Parsons, at Duntreath Castle in the Blane Valley, near the village of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strathblane.html" title="Strathblane">Strathblane</a>, north of Glasgow, the scion of a distinguished family. Her father was the 4th <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">Baronet</a> Edmonstone and a retired <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">Admiral</a> in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>; her grandfather had been Governor of the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionian_Islands_d3d4.html" title="Ionian Islands">Ionian Islands</a>,</p>
<p>She had one brother and seven sisters, Alice being the youngest. Alice married <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Keppel_06ef.html" title="George Keppel">George Keppel</a>, son of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Keppel%2C_7th_Earl_of_Albemarle_93bc.html" title="William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle">William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle</a> and four years her senior, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Keppel_53a0.html" title="Edit section: Extra-marital affairs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Extra-marital affairs</span></h2>
<p>Even early on, Alice Keppel had a reputation for adultery, and it was rumoured that her eldest daughter was not fathered by her husband George, but in fact was the daughter of the future Lord Grimthorpe, one of her lovers. Pretty, articulate, and discreet, Keppel quickly climbed the society ladder through affairs with prominent men of the day. <a href="http://www.justwebit.com/members/38460/free.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.justwebit.com/members/38460/free.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Known as a very attractive woman, her extra-marital affairs were usually initiated by her desire to gain a better <i>social status</i>. She became so successful as a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtesan.html" title="Courtesan">courtesan</a>, that it has eclipsed any accomplishments of her husband George. Most of her affairs were with his full knowledge, and Edward VII even visited her house on a regular basis, her husband conveniently leaving during the visits.</p>
<p>Although it might sound unusual by today's standards, extramarital affairs were quite common and even accepted in wealthy circles of that time. It was not unusual for both the husband and the wife to take a lover, or lovers, as long as they were semi-discreet in their encounters. It was (if not acceptable) common for well-to-do women of the time to act as courtesans for the benefit of their husband's career, or their own social status.</p>
<p>In 1898, Keppel met the future Edward VII, then the 56-year old heir to the throne. It was not long before Keppel became one of Edward's many mistresses, despite a twenty-eight year age difference. Their relationship would last until Edward's death in 1910.</p>
<p>Edward took other mistresses, such as actresses <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillie_Langtry_31e3.html" title="Lillie Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Bernhardt_723d.html" title="Sarah Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>, and socialites <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennie_Jerome_2a31.html" title="Jennie Jerome">Jennie Jerome</a> (mother of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>) and <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daisy_Greville%2C_Countess_of_Warwick_3b8c.html" title="Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick">Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick</a> (Frances Brooke). His last two mistresses, contemporary with one another and both beginning between 1898 and 1900, were Alice Keppel and a wealthy daughter of a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_Exchange_8372.html" title="Stock Exchange">Stock Exchange</a> member, <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Keyser_acc4.html" title="Agnes Keyser">Agnes Keyser</a>. Keyser was the more acceptable of the two in royal circles, due to her discretion and respect for the monarchy, but mostly due to the fact that she herself was not married. A humanitarian, Keyser's charity to found a hospital for military officers in partnership with her sister was supported by Edward VII. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750918225/203-8923514-6770348" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750918225/203-8923514-6770348" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>However, it was Keppel who was more well-known. "Alice Keppel was a fantastic help to Edward VII, more help than his wife Queen Alexandra could have ever have been", wrote Christopher Wilson, who has done extensive writings on Keppel's great-granddaughter, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camilla_Parker_Bowles_fbd3.html" title="Camilla Parker Bowles">Camilla Parker Bowles</a>. Keppel was one of the few people in his circle who was able to defuse Edward VII's cantankerous mood swings. <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3DAlice%2BKeppel%26sm%3DYahoo%2521%2BSearch%26fr%3DFP-tab-img-t%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3D%26ei%3DUTF-8%26vm%3Dr&amp;w=203&amp;h=230&amp;imgurl=newsimg.bbc.co.uk%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2F39259000%2Fjpg%2F_39259862_203edwardvii.jpg&amp;rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2Fgo%2FnewsFeedXML%2F-%2F1%2Fhi%2Fmagazine%2F3055376.stm&amp;size=12.7kB&amp;name=_39259862_203edwardvii.jpg&amp;p=Alice+Keppel&amp;type=jpeg&amp;no=11&amp;tt=11&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vm=r" class="external autonumber" title="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3DAlice%2BKeppel%26sm%3DYahoo%2521%2BSearch%26fr%3DFP-tab-img-t%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3D%26ei%3DUTF-8%26vm%3Dr&amp;w=203&amp;h=230&amp;imgurl=newsimg.bbc.co.uk%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2F39259000%2Fjpg%2F_39259862_203edwardvii.jpg&amp;rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2Fgo%2FnewsFeedXML%2F-%2F1%2Fhi%2Fmagazine%2F3055376.stm&amp;size=12.7kB&amp;name=_39259862_203edwardvii.jpg&amp;p=Alice+Keppel&amp;type=jpeg&amp;no=11&amp;tt=11&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vm=r" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Aristocratic and royal approval of Keppel was mixed. Extra-marital relationships with both spouses being aware were not uncommon in the period, with either one or both the wife and husband having discreet lovers. Edward's wife <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_of_Denmark_23f1.html" title="Alexandra of Denmark">Alexandra of Denmark</a> was on good enough terms with Keppel to send her a consoling letter when her husband was stricken by <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhoid.html" title="Typhoid">typhoid</a>, and to permit her at Edward's side when the King was on his deathbed. However, she reportedly merely tolerated Keppel, and did not like her. Alexandra, on the contrary, thoroughly did enjoy the company of Edward's former mistress Jennie Jerome, finding her pleasant and appealing. She also was said to be quite fond of Agnes Keyser, with whom Edward was involved until his death. However she resented Keppel who, although somewhat discreet, would still show up at functions to which Alexandra was accompanying Edward VII, which irritated the queen. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/EdwardVII.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/EdwardVII.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>High-ranking aristocrats such as the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Fitzalan-Howard%2C_15th_Duke_of_Norfolk_5c22.html" title="Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>, the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_John_Arthur_Charles_James_Cavendish-Bentinck%2C_6th_Duke_of_Portland_36c3.html" title="William John Arthur Charles James Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland">Duke of Portland</a>, and the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Edward_Hubert_Gascoyne-Cecil%2C_4th_Marquess_of_Salisbury_8f4b.html" title="James Edward Hubert Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury">Marquess of Salisbury</a> were decidedly cool towards the King's mistress.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Keppel_53a0.html" title="Edit section: After Edward VII's death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After Edward VII's death</span></h2>
<p>Upon Edward's death, Keppel discreetly left for <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> for two years, although she later returned to England.</p>
<p>Later, upon hearing that <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a> was renouncing the throne to marry <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallis_Simpson_0939.html" title="Wallis Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>, Keppel remarked that "things were done much better in my day." (as per <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/souhami-keppel.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/souhami-keppel.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>).</p>
<p>Her point in making that comment was simply that during the years prior to, during, and for some time after her affair with Edward VII, extra-marital affairs among royalty, and the wealthy and powerful, were accepted as being normal. Both wives and husbands in the social elite would often take lovers. However, there was an unwritten rule that when involved romantically in an extra-marital affair, you did not disrupt your lover's personal life, nor they yours, simply as a matter of respect. This would later come into play with the <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> lover of Keppel's daughter, <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Sackville-West_9b1f.html" title="Vita Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a>, who broke that rule regularly with her affairs, much to Keppel's dismay.</p>
<p>In his book, titled <i>Edward VII's Last Loves: Alice Keppel and Agnes Keyser</i>, author Raymond Lamont-Brown places emphasis on the fact that the influence inside the royal court that both Alice Keppel and Agnes Keyser had, on politics and diplomacy of the time, should not be underrated. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750918225/203-8923514-6770348" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750918225/203-8923514-6770348" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>In 1995, an image of Keppel was placed on a British <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postage_stamp.html" title="Postage stamp">postage stamp</a> with her then-infant daughter, Violet.</p>
<p>Her daughter <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonia_Cubitt%2C_Baroness_Ashcombe_3d3f.html" title="Sonia Cubitt, Baroness Ashcombe">Sonia</a> married Roland, son of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Cubitt%2C_2nd_Baron_Ashcombe_1eac.html" title="Henry Cubitt, 2nd Baron Ashcombe">Henry Cubitt, 2nd Baron Ashcombe</a>. Roland became 3rd Baron.</p>

<ul>
<li>Keppel's daughter <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violet_Trefusis_d4e8.html" title="Violet Trefusis">Violet Trefusis</a> became an author and was famous for her sexual escapades in her own right, thanks to a high-profile and volatile <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbianism.html" title="Lesbianism">lesbian</a> relationship with <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Sackville-West_9b1f.html" title="Vita Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a>. Keppel strongly objected to this relationship, and it caused her great stress in her attempts to draw her daughter away from Sackville-West. This was less due to her objections of her daughters sexuality, and more due to her wanting the affair to be less known publicly, and for her daughter to be more in-tune with social acceptance, and adhering to the unwritten rule of not disrupting a lovers social status. Her daughter later became the chosen lesbian lover of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">Singer</a> sewing machine heiress <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnaretta_Singer_b7d1.html" title="Winnaretta Singer">Winnaretta Singer</a>. Keppel did not object to this affair, partly due to Singer's immense wealth and power, and partly due to it being a welcomed relief from the previous affair, since Singer was more discreet, and the two seemed to have a healthy loving relationship.</li>
