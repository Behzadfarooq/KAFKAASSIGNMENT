<p>First and foremost I would like to thank you for your additions to the Lord of the Rings article. Any help we can get is great and you have made valueable contributions. In addition I would like to add that if you plan on working on middle-earth articles in the future that you join WikiProject: Middle-earth. All of this aside, however, I would like to notify you that as agreed on the talk page for the LotR article your section has been removed. The reasoning behind this is three-fold. A. We are currently attempting to cut size from the article instead of lenght it. This is due to the article's FAC which is currently in process. Which leads be to B. We are attempting to show the article is stable and large additions like yours do not help in this. C. As said, it was a large section and I believe it best you make an article for. Themes of the Lord of the Rings would make a great article in my opinion and could be linked to from the main article. I hope you see the reasoning behind this and assuming you do hope to work with you in the future. If you believe the section needs to be re-added please say so on the talk page, or even mine.

<p>I have noted that you often edit without an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summary.html" title="Edit summary">edit summary</a>. Please do your best to <b>always fill in the summary field</b>. This is considered an important guideline in Wikipedia. Even a short summary is better than no summary. An edit summary is even more important if you delete any text; otherwise, people may think you're being sneaky. Also, mentioning one change but not another one can be misleading to someone who finds the other one more important; add "and misc." to cover the other change(s).

<p>I put the 'bringing elements of Son of the Demon' bit back in, though frankly until Grant Morrison actually DOES it in such a way that we say 'yes, indeed, that's canon again', it's a little more spec-ish than I'd like to see. Bygones&#160;:) FYI, I made a LOT of other changes, trying to clean up and not duplicate information all over the place. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 19:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's not good form on a wikipedia page to leave spec or 'original research' on a page. Your comments, about how his attitude <i>may</i> stem from certain events is speculation simply becuase Batman hasn't said in an issue 'Too many people I like get hurt.' Sure, it's insinuated, but it's unconfirmed speculation at this time. And that's why it shouldn't be in the article. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 19:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, you're right, I think the article is better than B-class. I was just giving grades that seemed applicable at the time because there were a ton of unclassed film articles, but now I see it is probably A-class. I'm sorry if you feel I was under-rating you, it's just that there are very few A-class film articles, so I wouldn't have automatically given you A-class. The other two levels higher than B are GA &amp; FA (Good Article and Featured Article respectively), and articles have to be voted upon to get that status. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 19:46, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but the article cannot be nominated to A-Class unless it gets at least a GA-Class film rating, I suggest you find some way to nominate it for GA-Class or for a peer review. I am moving it back to a B-Class (not because of its content, but it can't be considered a A-Class until it gets GA-class status). <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 22:21, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I nominated it for good article status. Just to let you know because you cannot pass or fail it since you are huge contributor to it. If it reaches Good Article status, you can list as A-Class on the grading scale (or GA-class, but A-class is higher). <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 23:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Based on advice from you, Oskar Mayer Nguyener and Peta, I recently overhauled the use of images at <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></p>
<p>Originally there were 24 images in the article. 17 images have been removed in the past few days. That means that the article has only 7 fair use images left (and two free use ones). The remaining fair use images have been given detailed rationales on their respective pages. The seven images left are all very low resolution (I personally replaced high resolution ones with low resolution versions), and are (not in order):</p>
<p><big>Screenshots</big></p>
<ol>
<li><b>A screenshot of the logo</b>, - in the infobox (I feel that this image is very important to the article)</li>
<li><b>Buffy taking on a vampire</b> in the <i>Format</i> section (this section talks about how the show was structured around Buffy's battle against supernatural evil, and the screenshot illustrates that battle)</li>
<li><b>Sunnydale High</b> the main setting for early seasons in the <i>Setting</i> section (Sunnydale High - the school in which most of <i>Buffy</i> was based for the first three years - I feel that this image is very significant to the feel of the series, since for 3 years every single episode had many scenes in this fictional setting)</li>
</ol>
<p><big>Promotional photographs</big></p>
<p>My own opinion is that these four promotional photographs have been delibarately circulated by the copyright owners who only stand to gain from the use of such images.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Gellar as Buffy</b> from the unaired pilot in the <i>origins</i> section (I feel it is useful to have a photo of Gellar as Buffy early in the article, and I feel this is very appropiate to the origins section , since it is the first time Gellar was acting as Buffy. I also think it is useful to have an image of Gellar as Buffy early in the article, so that readers unfamiliar with the topic can have an immediate idea of what Buffy 'the Vampire Slayer' Summers actually looks like).</li>
<li><b>The cast as their characters</b> in the <i>Main characters</i> section. Once again I feel it is useful to have an image of the main characters, and allows unfamiliar readers to have a reference point in their minds to what the characters look like.</li>
<li><b>Angel</b> - in the secion about the spin-off, <i>Angel</i></li>
<li><b>Cover: <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1</i> comic series</b>. Whedon has said that these new comics will be an official and canon continuation of the television series, and therefore I believe this particular comic is very important in relation to the TV series.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that the remaining images illustrate parts of the series in a way that words cannot: I carefully kept only the images which I felt really belonged in the article and removed those I thought the article could manage without.</p>
<p>I hope I have addressed the issues you brought up, and you are willing to offer your support at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_dc65.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, but regardless thank you for collectively (along with other users) bringing to attention the problem in the article. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 02:24, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am here with regard to more or less similar topic, so I let myself comment here. You have recently nominated <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberman.html" title="Cyberman">Cyberman</a> for GA. I left some comments on the talk page following that nomination, and in the course of the discussion we've had there we have established that perhaps it might not be the best to nominate it, as it is almost certain to fail unless significant changes are made, and there is little chance they will within a reasonable timespan. So, this nomination could potentially consume quite a lot of some reviewer's time with a certain negative outcome - therefore, I would like to ask you to take a look at the talk page and consider withdrawing the nomination.

<p>If you have three pieces of information spread out in an article and have the same reference to cite all three pieces, start with the first piece of information in the article. Instead of &lt;ref&gt;, type &lt;ref name="source"&gt;, and enter the rest of the information like usual (e.g., &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Doe | url=http://www.johndoe.com/ | publisher=John Doe | date=[[2006-09-30]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Instead of "source", have something that's unique about the reference, such as part of the title or the author himself. After citing the first sentence, instead of using the same command again with the second and third pieces of information, just put &lt;ref name="source" /&gt; (with the space and slash) after the sentence. You must have the full citation in the first sentence. If you have &lt;ref name="source" /&gt; for the first sentence, then have a full reference later, Wikipedia won't be able to identify where the citation for the first sentence points. Hope that helps. Just look at the citations at <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_eca3.html" title="The Dark Knight">The Dark Knight</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i> to see how they work. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 18:48, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I appreciate the good-faith edits you've been doing. I'd like to give you some tips on using the citation templates, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use "cite news" instead of "cite web" for online news articles. "Cite web" is generally for online items that you can't really subscribe a date to, like budget information for a film, for example. Both present slightly different formats, so please use "Cite news" when you can.</li>
<li>"format=" is generally for identifying the file type of a URL. For example, if it was a PDF, then it would be format=PDF, or if it were an audio file, then it would be format=MP3 or whatever the format is.</li>
<li>"work=" does not generally have to be used unless... well, I can't think of any off-hand examples, honestly. I don't think when we cite articles, we really have to worry about using that.</li>
<li>"authorlink=" does not need to be used if the author does not have a Wikipedia article of his/her own. Just adds unnecessary red to the article, you know?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just wanted to give you a heads-up on that. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 15:11, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(repost from the article's talk page)</p>
<p>Concerning terminology - we should only limit ourselves to what the films say, and omit details appearing only in the book. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Orlando Bloom</b> as <b>Legolas</b>, an Elven prince who accompanies the Fellowship. He is an accomplished fighter and archer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is Legolas identified as a prince in the films? If not, we should only use archer and fighter. It should be rephrased as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Orlando Bloom</b> as <b>Legolas</b>, an Elven archer who accompanies the Fellowship. He is an accomplished fighter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, with</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ian Holm</b> as <b>Bilbo Baggins</b>, Frodo's (much older) cousin.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Bilbo was only called Frodo's uncle, we should use uncle.</p>
<p>Is the term "Rangers of Ithilien" used in the films? The merchandise uses "Gondor Rangers" or "Gondorian Rangers". If "... of Ithilien" wasn't used, we should use the merchandising terms.</p>
<p>Sorry, I've never seen the extended versions (unavailable), so if these terms are actually in those versions, I understand. <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUthanc_61f6.html" title="User:Uthanc">Uthanc</a> 12:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I hope you don't think I'm being too rude in nominating this page for deletion, but I just don't think that the series is established enough, after the broadcast of a single episode, to merit articles for each episode. If the parent article eventually becomes too long then sub articles may well become appropriate, but I think for the time being there's not a great deal of merit in creating these. Please don't take it personally, and I hope you're not offended at my view. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 19:11, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about reverting your theme edit today! I really didn't read the citation closely enough -- was a bit too tired to actually focus on the words in the news article. So I'm glad you were bold and put it back in. I moved it to the beginning of the paragraph and re-worded it differently, so hope you don't mind. Otherwise, I like the changes you made to the casting information -- "Casting interests" does work better as a subsection, and we didn't need subsections for individual characters that may or may not be in the movie. Hope the Lord of the Rings work is going well -- I've seen a lot of LOTR edits in your history! --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 02:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure exactly why production section feel small to you. The only other FAs that I've been able to find that have bigger sections are Casablanca and the various horror movies. However, it's not worth discussing because it's about how broad the information is, not the size of it. Let's just say my production sections are..... comprehensive.&#160;;) Anyway, how much should write on set stuff? Accidents? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh, sounds like trivia to me. But I don't know what the information is (as I haven't read the article yet), so you'll have to be the judge of whether it's encyclopedic or "interesting but not important". Filming locations are perfectly relevant and should be included. Weather? Only if it impacted the filming to a great degree. I write about in the <i>A New Hope</i> article, and even than I think it's only a sentence or two. It's not particularly encyclopedic if they were delayed by <i>one</i> day by rain. However if a tsunami comes along, and they end having to rebuild sets or move to another location, that is most likely encyclopedic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 14:26, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd also suggest putting the production section on top, not only is it a personal preference of mine, but it's normally done to keep the infobox from extending into the synopsis section. If you do move the production section up, I think you could fit another photo in the synopsis section.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 14:30, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was only able to skim through it, but I don't see enough information to fill out a whole section on cultural references. Your best bet would be to keep it the way it is.</dd>

<dd>Normally, I format my production sections to be in order of events. Therefore, one paragraph would focus on one area.

<p>Dude, I have to applaud you for all your prolific contributions to Wikipedia. I like what you've been doing with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I appreciate the effort you've been making to keep film articles like <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29_af91.html" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">Casino Royale</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prestige_%28film%29_f547.html" title="The Prestige (film)">The Prestige</a></i> in shape, not to mention keeping <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformers_%282007_film%29.html" title="Transformers (2007 film)">Transformers</a></i> from backsliding into an uncited fanboy mess. So you get a special spot under "Wikipedia editors worthy of my respect" (don't worry, it's listed alphabetically) on my user page for your contributions.&#160;:) I'd do the Barnstar deal, but I don't really feel like looking into what that takes, so, this should do instead. Keep up the good work, and let's get <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i> into shape together. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 17:10, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In regards to <i>Transformers</i>, I think that there are various bits of speculative statements throughout the article. I've listed some below:
<ul>
<li><s>"It is unknown if Cullen will also reprise Ironhide, though he read both parts during his first of two auditions." The citations could be re-arranged to say that Cullen audited for both Optimus Prime and Ironhide, and that he was confirmed for Optimus Prime. Don't say anything about Ironhide until something comes up.</s></li>
<li><s>"Those roles will require new talent, though there is no evidence that they would have received the parts if still living." This is pseudo-speculation. Just say that the original voice actors are deceased.</s></li>
<li><s>"Despite some reports it is extremely unlikely that his voice will be used for any of the Transformers in the final cut." Who determined that it was extremely unlikely? Too POV.</s></li>
<li>Production section seems fine, though a little dry (as it's probably expected to be). Maybe you can tie some information together for more full paragraphs, as that seems to be popular with FA-class articles.</li>
<li><s>"Lorenzo Di Bonaventura admitted they attempted a computer generated version of Optimus Prime's comic book look, but it looked ridiculous." Specify that the "looked ridiculous" comment came from Bonaventura. Otherwise, it seems like a fanboy's having his own take of it.</s></li>
<li><s>One subsection for Release? Can anything be broken down, or can it all really fall under just Release? Also, sentences in Release can be grouped together for more full paragraphs.</s></li>
<li>References that are specifically online news articles need to be rewritten under the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">Cite news</a> template, such as JoBlo, IGN, ComingSoon.net, etc. Some citations' date= attributes need to be wiki-linked to be formatted correctly for registered users' visibility.</li>
<li>Maybe it's just me, but I have an issue with linking to forums (unless a moderator posts an interview in a new thread, like the Heath Ledger interview on Newsarama) and also image servers such as PhotoBucket. It seems unprofessional to link to such unreliable sources, even though the images within can be seen as verifiable. It's just that I don't think this Wikipedia article needs to stay <i>that</i> on top of the game by linking to leaked content. The only way to implement leaked content, in my opinion, is to ensure that the citation has been published as an article instead of being linked to forums or image servers.</li>
<li><s>Cast section's wikitable looks like it needs fixing... there's a third narrow column that's probably added by mis-formatting.</s></li>
<li>Plot section could be rewritten to sound more in-universe. It's a mix of "This source reported that so-and-so happened" and "So-and-so happened."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Sorry if that's a lot to change, but I've been generally hands-off this article 'cause I'm just not familiar at all with this franchise. <i>Batman Begins</i> looks good for the time being, but I think there's more that can be added (maybe so that the Production section can stand on its own and that its subsections can become their own sections with enough content).

<p>Hi there, just wondering if we could come to some sort of an agreement over the cast list on the <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29_af91.html" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">Casino Royale</a></i> page. I disagree that the short biogs are much better. All of the details about a specific character can be found by linking to the page in question. Also, trying to write a small piece has the problem of being occasionally subjective, giving away spoilers, and not being particularly detailed. For an encyclopaedic entry it is much more useful to find out the minor characters of the movie through publication of the entire cast list. This was the level set by the pages for the previous 20 Bond movies. Would be interested to hear your opinions on this. All the best. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMagoo_db18.html" title="User:MrMagoo">MrMagoo</a> 05:03, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I realize original research is bad, so maybe it would be possible to re-add the trivia section saying "such and such MAY BE a reference..."?

<p>I'm curious by what standards of "importance" Korea's first full-length <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Taekwon_V_4ab8.html" title="Robot Taekwon V">animated science-fiction feature</a> and the first Korean film to receive full digital restoration, and a <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punguna.html" title="Punguna">film</a> by Korea's equivalent of D.W. Griffith and Orson Welles rolled into one both rank "low," while a recent Johnny Depp action flick ranks "high." The only standards I can see in which this works are those of cultural myopia, and the sort of "judgment" which ranks <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k_5ab9.html" title="Béla Bartók">Bartók</a> lower than the Rolling Stones because the Stones made a whole buncha money... and cool people don't listen to Bartók. Unless the Film Project explicitly states current American blockbusters and pop cinema are all there is to cinema, then Korean cinema should be included, as well as other national cinemas. And <a href="../../../n/a/_/Na_Woon-gyu_d801.html" title="Na Woon-gyu">Na Woon-gyu</a> and <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Taekwon_V_4ab8.html" title="Robot Taekwon V">Robot Taekwon V</a></i> are cornerstones of Korean cinema and animation. To your credit, you seem to have at least <i>heard</i> of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Mizoguchi_d836.html" title="Kenji Mizoguchi">Kenji Mizoguchi</a>... and even do him the great honor of ranking his importance in the scheme of cinema as equal to <i>Pirates of the Carribean</i>. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:52, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply, Wiki-newbie. I'm not bothered by your changing the rankings to "low" on these subjects just because they are my contributions. I find it unbelievable that Mizoguchi could be ranked anything below "top" in any kind of film project, but I don't think I've worked on that one at all. What bothers me is that these rankings seem to be highly subjective, and based on "Have I heard of it? / Do I like it? / Do people <i>here</i> know it <i>today</i>?" rather than an objective judgment of actual importance in film history. I've never seen <i>Robot Taekwon V</i>, and I doubt it's of very high artistic quality or originality, but literature and the judgment of Korean writers, as well as its historical position make its importance to Korean animated film undeniable. Na Woon-gyu's films are all lost, so of course they are not popular, though they were highly popular in Korea at the time. Even if one of his films were found today, it would be of interest to only a small group of film buffs. But still, the importance of his films and their influence on Korean cinema-- which is important in world cinema, and therefore in a film project-- is undeniable. But I'm not sure how important these rankings are anyway. Just thought I'd sound off a little. Have a good day. Oh, and listen to some Bartók sometime. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 21:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I just modified the cites as wished, using WP:FOOT. In particular, the cites are now directly after the punctuation, the web links are according to WP:CITET, and I added the publisher in the comic book references.

<dd>Thanks for moving it up to GA, and thanks for your numerous constructive criticisms. If I have time, I'll also try my hand in kicking it up to FA. I think that peer review and collecting input / feedback first is a good thing, and if you have some ideas on dealing with comic-character-related FAs, just let me know. —<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnomatopoeia_fd00.html" title="User:Onomatopoeia">Onomatopoeia</a> 15:25, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd suggest just winging it. There's not really a template for extras on DVDs, including commentaries -- the references at FA-classes <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Wars_Episode_I%7E_The_Phantom_Menace_412d.html" title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Star_Wars_Episode_II%7E_Attack_of_the_Clones_5ae6.html" title="Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</a></i> just kind of set up something on their own about DVD commentary. Doesn't seem like there's a standard template for that kind of thing. Maybe WikiProject Films should work on making a template for DVD as it'd be specific to them. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 16:45, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Appreciate your input. Also, in the peer review, I responded to your suggestion about cast information for the film. While franchise films would have fleshed out cast lists especially with characters that already had pre-existing articles, <i>The Fountain</i> is really a singular film where some roles aren't incredibly notable (like three in the list are lab technicians who don't contribute in any major way to the story). Your take on this would be appreciated. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 18:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
