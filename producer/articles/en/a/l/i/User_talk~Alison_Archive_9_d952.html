<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article Deletion</span></h2>
<p>Alison, I am writing to you about the deletion of an article titled: Healing Cancer: The Top 12 Non-Toxic Cancer Treatments To Help You Beat Cancer (2005)<br />
<br />
The article was not meant to be an advertisement, as I do not consider Wikipedia as an advertising medium, but rather as an encyclopedia of knowledge. My understanding was that the entry met Notability requirements because it listed two reviews of the book that have been published in appropriate UK Journals. Further, I had written the entry as a basic description of the books contents, as this seems the most appropriate article entry for a book. I have no problem in rewritting the entry so that it meets Wikipedia guidelines - though at this stage, I am unsure as to what would need to be altered for it to acheive this.<br />
<br />
I should also like to explain that a more expereinced Wikipedia contributor had first marked up the article with concerns - which I was working to alleviate - but that then another user (self described to me) marked it for speedy delete. Thanks.<br />

<ul>
<li>I've re-visited the above deleted article and read it all through in detail again. And yes, it's a blatant advert and little else. From your edit history, I can see that you've contributed absolutely nothing other than the blatant advertising of your own two books, the other of which is featured on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Seriously, it fails on a number of points; it's non-notable, your edits fail <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and it's an unmistakable, blatant advert. If you'd like to get another opinion, feel free to refer this to another administrator. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Healing_Cancer:_The_Top_12_Non-Toxic_Cancer_Treatments_To_Help_You_Beat_Cancer_%282005%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Healing_Cancer:_The_Top_12_Non-Toxic_Cancer_Treatments_To_Help_You_Beat_Cancer_%282005%29" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> the relevant link. I note also that you've berated the two other editors who questioned your article. - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlison_304c.html" title="User:Alison"><font face="comic sans ms" color="green">Alison</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlison_52bb.html" title="User talk:Alison">☺</a></sup> 03:00, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alison. The other entry was for a film, not a book (and which I agree, I cannot provide sources to show that it is notable - at present). However, I am not understanding why the book article is non-notable. I read through the relevant document, and the understanding I got from that was that if a book is discussed in at least one journal, then it can be counted as notable.</p>
<p>I am genuininly not understanding how such an article could be written so that it is not an advert, and as such, I would like to clarify that it is your view that it is blatant advert, not mine. I tried looking through Wikipedia to find books, but I couldnt find a way to bring them up. The only one I found was Harry Potter. As I mentioned to you, I am not trying to enter this book in as an advert, but rather I think it deserves being entered into Wikipedia as part of a body of knowledge.</p>
<p>For your information, I did not berate two editors - rather I berated one. The first editor marked the entry with concerns, and I did not have a particular problem with how they were expressed. The second editor seemed to feel the need to mark the article for speedy deletion, which I did not appreciate.</p>
<p>I do not think it fails COI, as really, it does not make rational or logical sense to judge an article by who contributes it, but rather on the subject matter of the article itself. The issue obviously, is how an article is worded, and whether it is written from a neutral point of view. I have written you that I have no problem in updating it until it is acceptable. Further, unless you are saying that Wikipedia is some kind of club, of which you have to be an accepted member, then your statement here, is I consider, unacceptable: 'I can see that you've contributed absolutely nothing other than the blatant advertising of your own two books'. And secondly with regard to this statement, you have no information on which to reasonably jump to such an assumption or assert such a claim, especially in such a tone.</p>
<p>Alison, really like I said in the other post. It's no big deal for me, but I have to say that I consider your attitude arrogant and improper (and not the tone suggested by the document you referenced me) - and I am sure if you read it again - you will se what I mean. Further, I would like to say, that I have seen all this before with Dmoz of which I was an editor for a couple of years. Funny thing now - is when I was there the other day - they are looking for an editor for every category I looked at.</p>
<p>I have better things to do with my time than engage in conversations like this. I asked you civil questions, to which you provided no reply. I have used Wikipedia extensivily over the last few years, but I have to say that my experience of the last 24/36 hours has made me think lesser of it in terms of its future. I am sorry to say.</p>
<p>Wiki5000 03:40, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Apologies if I came across as uncivil; that was not my intent. However, my review of the deletion still stands. It's non-notable, there's a conflict of interests, you've done little else here other than advertise your book/movie/book (see <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>), and the whole article reads as a blatant advert as does the other one currently with <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. At this point if you wish to dispute it further, you might want to bring the issue up with another administrator. Thanks - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlison_304c.html" title="User:Alison"><font face="comic sans ms" color="green">Alison</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlison_52bb.html" title="User talk:Alison">☺</a></sup> 04:15, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Alison: At this stage I am not asking you to review your deletion decision, rather at present I am needing to understand why the article is non-notable, and secondly, how such an entry could be written in a non-advertisment way. Until I understand more, there doesnt really seem any point in moving to another editor, because I am presuming they may have similar concerns to yourself - unless those concerns are met.<br />
<br />
I am thinking as I write this message to you, that one of the things causing us difficulties, is that though I am asking you questions about, for instance, why you consider the article was non-notable, you keep providing me with just the same information - i.e. that it is non-notable.<br />
<br />
This just isn't providing me with the rationale or help in understanding that I am needing to judge the issue myself in line with Wikipedia documents, so that I can pursue the matter or leave it and move on. For instance, you could write me things like, there were not enough references, or the references were not in appropriate journals, or some other reason.<br />
<br />
I am sure you can appreciate that it is frustrating not to receive answers to questions, (when you have been the judge in this matter) and actually, it also feels like it is conflict creating on/by my side, with me keeping on asking the same question. It seems like I am being stubborn or insistant<br />
<br />
This is what I understand the notability criteria to be:<br />
<br />
'The book has been the subject [3] of multiple, non-trivial[4] published works whose sources are independent of the book itself,[5] with at least some of these works serving a general audience. This includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, other books, television documentaries and reviews. Some of these works should contain sufficient critical commentary to allow the article to grow past a simple plot summary.'<br />
<br />
I would be grateful therefore, if you could explain me why you consider the subject of the article non-notable. And also, some indication or an example of how such an article might be written in a non-advertising way would also be appreciated.<br />
Wiki5000 18:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok - have a read of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>. They're basically the statement of where this issue is at. It is my contention and that of the original editor who marked your book article for speedy delete that your article did not meet these criteria. See the 'criteria' section on that page. It doesn't end there, though. There is a conflict of interests here in that you are using Wikipedia to promote this book (and DVD) of yours. See <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Not only that, you've done little other than these two articles, as well as comment on editors' userpages on the two articles. This smacks of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At this point, if you want further address, you can bring the issue to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>, where speedy deletions get reviewed for accuracy, etc. Failing that, you could contact another administrator or bring the issue up on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> for review by another admin - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlison_304c.html" title="User:Alison"><font face="comic sans ms" color="green">Alison</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlison_52bb.html" title="User talk:Alison">☺</a></sup> 04:00, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<br />
Alison, I am not feeling that you have provided me with an adequate answer, despite my asking several times for your to qualify you decision, as an admin.<br />
<br />
I do not understand or appreciate why you do not consider that the book is eligible for notability under the following description under criteria:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>'The book has been the subject [3] of multiple, non-trivial[4] published works whose sources are independent of the book itself,[5] with at least some of these works serving a general audience. This includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, other books, television documentaries and reviews. Some of these works should contain sufficient critical commentary to allow the article to grow past a simple plot summary.'<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>I just looked up the meaning of multiple in the dictionary and it states:<br />
<br />
1. Having or involving or consisting of more than one part or entity<br />
<br /></p>
<p>I would like to state my view to you, that the kind of attitude that makes a person eligible to be a good judge of things, is an attitude that enables a persons character to qualify things in a detailed manner, carefully and with consideration. In this regard, I am feeling that you replies to me lacking due respect, and the civility that is outlined in various Wikipedia documents. In detail I am referring to:<br />
<br /></p>
<p>1. Even after repeatedly asking you to qualify your decision, you have just sent me to the whole Notability document - and/or the criteria section, even though I have provided you reasons why I consider it does meet the criteria listed.<br />
<br />
2. You are still making statements in an absolute way - even beyond any information you have. Alison, I am considering that I would find your communication more respectworthy - and actually - more true (in the sense of true meaning accurate) - if you prefaced your comments with words such as: I am feeling this to be the case - or 'to me this feels like...'.<br />
<br />
3. Your reply presents statments about my motiviations as 'FACT' - even though you are not in a position to make such statments, because quite simply - you do not know.<br />
<br />
4. Expressions such as 'This smacks of...' is - I dont think at all, appropriate in this thread of communication. I am actually feeling, unfortunately, that I am being spoken to by the Lone Ranger or someone of that ilk.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>I hope you will take more care with your next reply Alison. Further, I would be grateful if you could adopt a slightly different perspective on the matter, and rather, as I am personally suspecting (note I am owning my feeling - not stating it as an absolute fact) dredging up any more reasons that you can find for the article not to be included.<br /></p>

<dd>Hi again. With due respect, the onus is upon you to provide a reasonable amount of information to indicate notability. It is my opinion that you have not done that. Furthermore, you have not addressed my concerns regarding single-purpose accounts, not the issue of conflict of interests.&#160;: At this point, if you want further redress, you can bring the issue to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>, where speedy deletions get reviewed for accuracy, etc. Failing that, you could contact another administrator or bring the issue up on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> for review by another admin as we're obviously not making any progress here. Best off sending it to deletion review where a panel of editors can decide (probably far better than either of us can). That way, you can be assured of due process.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>Is it good to create user pages for 'indef' tags? Despite a desire to do so for certain vandals, I have usually not done it unless they already created a user page. I know this is trivial but I happen to be wondering now. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 19:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I generally do because the {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblock_e2ef.html" title="Template:Indefblock">indefblock</a>}} tag also puts them into <a href="../../../t/e/m/Category%7ETemporary_Wikipedian_userpages_417b.html" title="Category:Temporary Wikipedian userpages">Cat:Temporary Wikipedian userpages</a>. It also serves to inform others and as they're indefblocked by definition, they're hardly likely to be editing the page in future. Also, as they're almost always vandalism-only accounts, they're usually empty (as you say), thus adding the template isn't usually blanking anything. - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlison_304c.html" title="User:Alison"><font face="comic sans ms" color="green">Alison</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlison_52bb.html" title="User talk:Alison">☺</a></sup> 19:26, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What I mean is that I don't know if it is discouraged to actually create a page just to indef tag it, since it takes up more space. However, I have noticed that WP seems to have a lot of space available... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 19:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

Thanks Satyr!</li>
<li>The number of articles within our project's spectrum (6,667 currently) should now be relatively stable and only grow with article creation. However, if you find a category that should be included, please let <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> know so it can be included in the bots runs.</li>
<li>Work is underway to improve the <a href="../../../l/g/b/Portal%7ELGBT_4e48.html" title="Portal:LGBT">LGBT Portal</a>.

<dd>There is no 'h' in the present tense. Doesn't take as gaelgoir to know that. Also, if you think "tusa" is more correct than "tú", I would advise you to kindly inform the Irish Department of Education because mé-féin along with thousands of others were thought tú.

<p>Hmm.. I've already fully protected the page.

<li>I concur with the full prot on the page. The two editors are filling out long comments in their edit summaries by way of justification so I'm hoping that will continue on the talk page as they've just run out of option&#160;:) I guess the RfC will have to run its course and they abide by that - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlison_304c.html" title="User:Alison"><font face="comic sans ms" color="green">Alison</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlison_52bb.html" title="User talk:Alison">☺</a></sup> 15:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
