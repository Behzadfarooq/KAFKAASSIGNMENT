<dd>O.K., I'll stop merging. Why don't you like that? It's much easier to navigate and find what you're looking for if you have just one page for one word. I don't really see a difference between natural words and acronyms in terms of dabs. A dab exists to help a person find what they need, and to split up that information unnecessarily makes it harder to do that. I don't find any information on acronyms/natural words in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</a>, so there isn't (AFAICS) a precedent to go by either way; but it seems to me that merging would make navigation easier without any significant detriment. (Note: I'm going to put up {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}} tags directing to this talk now). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 06:42, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am always confused and surprised when looking for an acronym to find myself on a non-acronym (and usually messy) article or some page with lots of "And X is also" sections. It is equally maddening to search for a regular word and end up with an acronym. It seems to me that it would be better to name acronym articles in all capitals and non with the usual capitalization. Sadly, this runs into the tendency in non-American English to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 06:58, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, now that I think about it, it makes much more sense to merge this with <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice.html" title="Alice">Alice</a>.

<dd><s><b>support combined page</b> True, I can understand the argument that people like to see ATLAS and Atlas separated, and I would normally take such an anally retentive line on this one myself. However I would expect that 95% of the droves would not distinguish when searching. The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_least_astonishment.html" title="Principle of least astonishment">Principle of least astonishment</a> should apply here, and I think that most people would be more astonished to find that searching for "Alice" does not match up with "ALICE" than if it did. I think that wikipedia should be organised in the way that makes it easiest for people to find what they are looking for. This is after all why we contribute to wikipedia, to share knowledge. As a result, I agree with Blackcap that there should be one page for the sequence of characters a-l-i-c-e and that this should be case-insensitive, providing a dab to all possible meanings of the 'word.'</s> <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinness2702_d731.html" title="User:Guinness2702">Guinness</a> 13:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two pages should link to each other. So if somebody types in "ALICE" because his caps lock is on, and doesn't see what he's looking for, ther'll be a link at the bottom saying "Alice" also means many things, and they can try there. So the problem you describe doesn't exist—and I think it's silly to crowd more onto one disambiguation page than necessary, which may also confuse people. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:11, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That statement was introduced back on 23 March 2006 (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice&amp;diff=45034140&amp;oldid=43887006" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice&amp;diff=45034140&amp;oldid=43887006" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) by an anonymous user (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.1.67.52_0caa.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.1.67.52">62.1.67.52</a>) who has made only one other contribution to Wikipedia. Since I find its authenticity to be highly dubious, I am removing it for the time being. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 02:49, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know that this is an issue that was 'closed' several months ago, but, with reference to the "<a href="#Things_that_don.27t_belong_here" title="">Things that don't belong here</a>" section above, I was wondering whether it would make sense to re-introduce the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice&amp;oldid=14752981" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice&amp;oldid=14752981" rel="nofollow">older content present in the page</a> before <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s trim-down on 5 June 2005. I was not present when the original debate took place, but my opinion is that the article was much better defined and structured back then. The current version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29#Examples_of_individual_entries_that_should_not_be_created" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29#Examples_of_individual_entries_that_should_not_be_created" rel="nofollow">Manual of Style for disambiguation pages</a> explicitly allows for such lists to be added below the main disambiguation list. If the consensus is that this will result in the page becoming too cluttered, a new Alice (given name) page could be created as recommended in the Manual of Style.</p>
<p>My rationale for this suggestion is the fact that deciding whether a person is sufficiently popular by first name alone to warrant inclusion in this page is often subjective and POV. For example, I myself would find the list inapplicable to even some of its most notable entries, such as <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Cooper_62c7.html" title="Alice Cooper">Alice Cooper</a> whom I have <i>never</i> encountered being mentioned by first name alone. Same goes for pretty much the rest of the persons in the list save for royalty, which are apparently being given a disproportionate advantage. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 02:32, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am going ahead with the re-inclusion. If anyone disagrees with this move, please discuss it here <i>before</i> reverting. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 13:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
