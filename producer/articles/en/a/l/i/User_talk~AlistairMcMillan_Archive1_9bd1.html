<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlistairMcMillan_Archive1_9bd1.html" title="Edit section: FL 2000 - Re: &quot;disenfranchisement&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">FL 2000 - Re: "disenfranchisement"</span></h2>
<p>The term "disenfranchise" plain and simply has a more profound meaning that merely missing a vote for one reason or another. Rather, a "disenfranchised" person is barred from all votes, now and in the future.</p>
<p>It is simply too extreme of a charge to lay upon Bush and/or the Florida 2000 fiasco to say that people were "disenfranchised". Think of it this way, if you are shot by a rifle in battle and are not killed, you are wounded. However, if the wound is fatal, you are killed.</p>
<p>In this analogy, "disenfranchisement" is equivalent to death. But what happened to complaining voters in FL was a wound - they are still free to vote again. Also, if they don't like Palm Beach butterfly ballots, they are free to move to whatever location they decide has a ballot they like. On the other had, a truly "disenfranchised" person is not allowed to vote regardless of the ballot type or where they live.</p>
<p>It is sloppy English, plain and simple to use that word ("disenfranchise") to describe the SNAFUs of FL 2000.</p>
<p>Also, such word usage to describe SNAFUs, flies in the face of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_large_numbers.html" title="Law of large numbers">Law_of_large_numbers</a> by suggesting that an election with millions of votes being cast, must not have any votes that are miscounted or voided in error.</p>
<p>And, unless you are claiming bad intent by a controlling party the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_large_numbers.html" title="Law of large numbers">Law_of_large_numbers</a> will see to it that such errors and miscounts are evenly distributed among both major party candidates in a close election.</p>
<p>What this means is that both Gore and Bush voters missed out at roughly the same rate. This also means that Gore and Bush had a roughly equal number of miscounts and non-counts.</p>
<p>At the same time, this still does not constitute "disenfranchisement". Rather, what you must keep in mind is that even a precise process will, on a large scale have some error. And this is what happened in FL 2000.</p>
<p>Whether you believe Bush won or Gore won there is moot so far as the vote count error rate goes. That election was so-close, that for all intents and purposes all of the potentially different types of recounts would have still fallen within the margin of vote count error.</p>
<p>That being the case, the SCOTUS was perfectly just in making FL stop counting and stick with the rules which were in place on the date of the election. Those rules did not allow for Gore to keep counting again and again in hand picked areas. Regardless of what Gore was hoping for, it is true that GWB did win the tally (albeit, very closely) that was added up based on the rules which were in place on the day of the election. And in fact FL 2000 proves the value of rules of that type.</p>
<p>Prior to invoking a large election, the tally method must be agreed upon in advance. If not, for any election which is so close that it the tally falls within the margin of error, the outcome will change if you change the tally method.</p>
<p>This is why Gore voters still feel cheated - they assert that under some tally methods, Gore would have won. The only problem is that the tally methods they point to were not provided for under FL law at the time, but were instead being sought by Gore in court after the fact.</p>
<p>If such an approach is allowed, well then Bush could then come right back and say "use my method" while pointing to one that put him ahead. And back and forth we go.</p>
<p>It is this ex-post-facto re-jiggering of the tally methods that SCOTUS put a stop to, not any actually vote counting. The votes had already been counted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what Gore was asking for was not provided for under FL law and in any case, SCOTUS agreed that in giving the green-light to Gore's extra-legislative request for a special tally, the FL Supremes violated the principle of equal protection.</p>
<p>You see, once the tally began being re-done under a statutorily unfounded court-ordered system, the only trumping law left is US Constitution.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that when judges re-write law from the bench, the only remaining defense is an appeal to constitutional principles, which is what Bush did. By the way, there were two rulings by SCOTUS in this case, one was 5-4, but the other was 7-2.</p>
<p>Anyway, in regards to all the vote SNAFUs issues themselves: errors on felon voter list, chads in Miami, Butterfly Ballot in Pam Beach, Military votes being DQ'd because military mail lacked a postmark, the news media falsely declaring the polls closed one hour before the FL panhandle (which is on Central Time) was actually done voting, were not under the control of any single person(s) or group(s), so there is certainly no way the say that all those who mis-voted or missed voting were "disenfranchised".</p>
<p>Certain voters and votes were adversely affected, yes. But this does not rise to the level of "disenfranchisement". The usage of that term is wrong and leaves a false impression.</p>
<p>Remember: precise thought requires precise word usage.</p>
<p>It is through the loopholes of imprecise language that race-baiters have long slipped on this issue. There are numbers of people out there who still try to suggest that there was a master plan (tied to Bush somehow of course) to "disenfranchise" black FL voters and thereby give Bush the win. Such racial based demagoguery is disgusting and offensive on the face. And in order to put a stop to it, people who write on the subject must give the facts in a rigorously clear manner.</p>
<p>I am trying to do that and it's why I oppose the use of the term "disenfranchised". It's not true. It misleads. And in the hands of certain race-baiters (such as Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, etc.) it fans the flames of racial discord.</p>

Please take note however, that I have been the proginator of (4) new articles in the two months I have been here (see my user page). Even so, since your experience is broad compared to say Nysus, I'd be inclined to put heavier wieght on comments from you than from him.

<dd>Hi! I thought I'd add my 2 cents: I think that for software that supports lots of different algorithms (<a href="../../../d/e/s/DES_80ac.html" title="DES">DES</a>, <a href="../../../m/d/5/MD5_7f13.html" title="MD5">MD5</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/s/AES_76b7.html" title="AES">AES</a> etc..), then it's better to put a single external link to the software on one "parent" page, rather than a separate link for each and every algorithm article. A similar question is still open for the "Jacksum" software, the author of which added links to every hash function page we have (see <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonelo_cc9f.html" title="User talk:Jonelo">User talk:Jonelo</a>). Perhaps a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptographic_software.html" title="Cryptographic software">cryptographic software</a> article would be good, given that we have <a href="../../../p/g/p/PGP_3f37.html" title="PGP">PGP</a>, <a href="../../../g/n/u/GnuPG_86f3.html" title="GnuPG">GnuPG</a>, <a href="../../../a/x/c/AxCrypt_9532.html" title="AxCrypt">AxCrypt</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/CrossCrypt_9068.html" title="CrossCrypt">CrossCrypt</a> etc? I'm just uneasy about adding these external links to all our articles — they'd be more maintainable in a single location. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 10:18, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your particpation in the un-justified deletion (via non-discussed reverts) of a factually accurate, non-POV, historical fact from that page has contributed to causing that page to be "protected". Therefore, I am asking you to particpate in the dialog at <a href="../../../d/e/d/Talk%7EDedham%2C_Massachusetts_9659.html" title="Talk:Dedham, Massachusetts">Talk:Dedham, Massachusetts</a> which the "protection" notice calls for. Either that, or please leave a message for <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> and request that the page be unprotected. This message will be reposted here daily (approximately) until you acknowledge it on the <a href="../../../d/e/d/Dedham%2C_Massachusetts_3dc7.html" title="Dedham, Massachusetts">Dedham, Massachusetts</a> talk page.
