<h3><span class="mw-headline">Hitler, victim of "horrendous parental abuse"?</span></h3>
<p>"... as she discussed in her psycho-biographies of Hitler and Bartsch (both victims of horrendous parental abuse)."—I'd just like to point out that I am not aware that Hitler suffered "horrendous parental abuse". What's the bottom line here, was all that warmongering and genociding just a cry for help? <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaikel_c22c.html" title="User:Maikel">Maikel</a> 19:59, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maikel, the issue is a rather complex one. Alois Hitler beat very often little Adolf; as Adolf’s sister and Adolf Hitler himself confessed. The psychological issue cannot be fully explained here but yes: the horrendous abuse originated Hitler’s vengeance on innocent scapegoats since Hitler fulfilled the commandment to honor his father. In psychology this is called <i>displacement</i>. Perhaps you might find interesting to take a look at Miller’s <i>For Your Own Good</i>? —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 20:17, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You may also find this deMause article interesting: <a href="http://primal-page.com/holocaus.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://primal-page.com/holocaus.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 22:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your information. I have to say this about Alice Miller, though: to attempt to psychoanalyze anyone without ever having met him or her seems rather unprofessional to me; to do the same for someone like Adolf Hitler amounts to megalomania. By what I know about his upbringing—mostly from Brigitte Hamann's <i>Hitler's Vienna</i> — I have to ask myself what sort of ideal childhood one must have had in order <i>not</i> to have carte blanche for turning into a genocidal maniac. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaikel_c22c.html" title="User:Maikel">Maikel</a> 20:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But please note Maikel that Miller didn’t use psychoanalytic models to retroactively be able to empathize with battered little Adolf. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 21:34, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, this is the problem with a emotional trauma model of behaviour dysfunction - the alleged "trauma" is not proportional to the dysfunction. I'm sure, as a result of Hitler's policies, many young European Jews suffered equally horrendous childhoods - none of them have 'displaced' quite to the spectacular extent Hitler did. Of course, opportunity has a big role to play (but genetics does not, according to Miller, play a role) As for her psychoanalysis of historical figures - well, i'm sure it has made her a decent living and a higher profile than those putting their skills to use on the mere living. Historians can't even agree on most historical facts, thus analysis of historical psyche can be nothing other than pure speculation. Retrospective analyses like these are pretty useful to bolster whatever theory one is promoting, but thats about the limit of its credibility. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 21:27, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason that Jews didn’t displace the abuse is clearly explained in Miller’s concept of “enlightened witness”. Only the abused child who has absolutely no one to empathize with him turns into an abuser himself. Jews did have witnesses. As psychiatrist Silvano Arieti wrote in <i>Interpretation of Schizophrenia</i> not about dead persons, but about his clients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"First of all we have to repeat here what we already mentioned [...], that conditions of obvious external danger, as in the case of wars, disasters, or other adversities <i>that affect the collectivity</i>, do not produce the type of anxiety that hurts the inner self and do not themselves favor [insanity]. Even extreme poverty, physical illness, or personal tragedies do not necessarily lead to [insanity] unless they have psychological ramifications that hurt the sense of self. Even homes broken by death, divorce, or desertion may be less destructive than homes where both parents are alive, live together, and always undermine the child’s conception of himself".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Jews suffered collectively, young Adolf’s ego underwent an all-out assault by his father and no soul helped him. He repressed an infinite hatred that exploded years later. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 21:55, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously i was using the victims of the Holocaust for dramatic contrast, but the principle remains true - individuals react differently to the same emotional trauma - and claiming trauma conditions form psychopaths retrospectively to prove a point, is inherently self selecting. There may be millions of perfectly adjucted people who had identically abusive childhoods to Hitler, but because they never slaughtered millions of people, we will never have their psyche analysed to counter the point. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 22:58, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They never had political power but could instead become serial killers or, when the repressed anger is directed toward oneself, addicts, bulimics, self-harmers or a myriad of psychopathological conditions. And no: there are no individuals who have had identical abusive childhoods to Hitler <b>with no enlightened witness</b> that are sane. Show me one. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:37, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, obviously i cannot, for the very reason that no two people have an identical childhood, though i know of at least one person that has had an extremely abusive childhood and, appears (and claims to be) perfectly adjusted. However, i would argue that for this theory to be acceptable, the burden of proof would be for you to show me that everyone who is not sane had a similarly abusive childhood. I find that very hard to believe. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 07:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that the burden of proof rests on me. Did the abused person you know had an enlightened witness? I insist in this since it’s possible to endure Auschwitz and be sane (in Houston I met Yakoff Skurnik, who was castrated in Auschwitz, and he is perfectly sane) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964429322/qid=1145548757/sr=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964429322/qid=1145548757/sr=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. If you take a look at the book of neurologist Jonathan H. Pincus’s <i>Base Instincts: What Makes Killers Kill?</i>, published in 2002, you will see that “virtually all criminals suffered severe abuse as children” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393323234/qid=1145548864/sr=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393323234/qid=1145548864/sr=2" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 16:10, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I honestly do not know, though they have never identified anyone to me. But what if they say 'no'? Miller would say: well you must have done, even though you do not realise it. Isn't an enlightened witness simply something to explain away why not all abused people follow her theory?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No: that’s not an enlightened witness. It’s not an ad hoc rationalization of a psychological theory. Rather, it’s a very concrete person. Though this is a risky argument (because it is so personal) I could only cope in life after I found one. (Unfortunately millions of abused people found none in this cruel world.) As stated elsewhere, this is not a scientific theory. It belongs to the humanities and to what may be called intuitive psychology (something totally alien to the specious thing studied in the academia). —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:17, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, if a person has been abused and does not identify an "enlightened witness", then by Miller's theory they must have a mental disorder? <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 00:22, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“Identify” is not the word; nor mental disorder would necessarily follow (see what I’m going to write below in a couple of minutes). —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:45, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As its impossible to prove that any given person did or did not have one. However this concept could be turned around to say the certain abused people can influence the situation to obtain and "enlightened witness" while others can/do not. Afterall it appears to me that in many cases there is always the potential for an "enlightened witness", but lots of factors may conspire for or against their envolvment.</dd>
<dd>This comes back to the possibility that one of these factors are the inherent differences in how people 'deal' with their abusive environments and that can impact the consequent effects.</dd>
<dd>Again, i would argue this is another example of how how mental disorder is a complex consequence of genes interacting with environment.</dd>
<dd>That “virtually all criminals suffered severe abuse as children” is obviously incorrect, some people commit crimes for political or financial reasons, for example. That many serial killers have been abused may well be true (though perhaps not all, as the motivations of some, like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Shipman_a6d7.html" title="Harold Shipman">Harold Shipman</a>, seem borne out of tragedy combined with narcissim, with no evidence of abuse). However, the argument that certain groups of people share abusive childhoods says nothing about primary cause and effect. It is no different than saying virtually all <a href="../../../c/y/s/Cystic_fibrosis.html" title="Cystic fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a> sufferers die from lung infections. True, they do, but not all people with lung infections die. It is not the lung infections alone that kills CF sufferers, it is the lung infections interacting with their CFTR gene. Thus that serial killers are often abused as children says nothing about childhood being primarily responsible for their subsequent actions. Sure, it is a very strong risk factor, but there is no evidence that rules out a biological basis. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 18:09, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are answers for each and every one of your astute observations in Miller and Lloyd deMause’s writings (and mine as well but, alas, I write in Spanish!). To fully explain them I would need an enormous amount of space. Since this isn’t an edit war perhaps it’s not the forum for extremely complex explanations. If you want thoroughgoing answers I could only recommend what I told Neurodivergent in another talk page, to follow the white rabbit and enter the very grim world of Wonderland, i.e., Primal Page chapters of a book by deMause <a href="http://primal-page.com/ps2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://primal-page.com/ps2.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:51, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate it is not your responsibility to justify Miller's work, but i thank you all the same for providing some background to her perspective. I did try to read the deMause chapter you cite, but i genuinely found it a strange mix of historical supposition with cultural associations. That is not to say that it isn't valid or even have some truth in it, but i don't feel it answers the questions from the same 'scientific' aspect i am asking them. Perhaps i'll never fully understand the sociological justifications, as my brain simply dosn't work that way. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 01:39, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you have a high IQ but to some extent lack “emotional intelligence”.

<dd>However, this is all beside the point. Whether Miller's analysis of Hitler is valid or not, correct or incorrect, the purpose of the article is to document her work and life, not to offer opinion, praise or criticism of it. Thus i would suggest the word "horrendous" be removed as it is a POV adjective (what type of abuse isn't horrendous?), or else it should be in quotes and referenced. Other than that, i don't think that Hitler had an abusive childhood is really in question. That Miller chooses to attach wider significance to this is entirely her opinion and we have acknowledged that. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with removing the adjective unless I find a direct quote. However, I’d like to elaborate a little further on Miller’s analysis of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Goldhagen_5ff5.html" title="Daniel Goldhagen">Hitler’s willing executioners</a>.</p>
<p>Hitler, like every other child, was born innocent, but was raised “as were many children at the time: in a destructive fashion”. Hitler was survivor “of a machinery of annihilation” that in the turn of 19 century’s Germany was called childrearing. The Prussian upbringing demanded absolute obedience and expressed contempt for the child. Hitler once told his secretary that during one of the regular beatings given by his father “he was able to stop crying, to feel nothing”. By denying his pain and despair, “Hitler made himself into a master of violence and contempt” for others, a person incapable of any empathy for other people.</p>
<p>Hitler was no exception. He “could make Europe and the world into a battlefield of his childhood because in the Germany of that time there were millions of people who had experienced the same kind of upbringing”, and thus became <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Goldhagen_5ff5.html" title="Daniel Goldhagen">Hitler’s willing executioners</a>. It is noteworthy that since these Prussian methods of childrearing were not so systematically used in other fascist countries, like Mussolini’s Italy or Franco’s Spain, in those fascist countries there were no murderous drive or hate displacement as the mass murder of Jews perpetrated by Germans. Take a look at citation #1 above in this talk page. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:37, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cesar, do you think that the following quotation of Alice Miller:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I betrayed that little girl [...]. Only in recent years, with the help of therapy, which enabled me to lift the veil on this repression bit by bit, could I allow myself to experience the pain and desperation, the powerlessness and justified fury of that abused child. Only then did the dimensions of this crime against the child I once was become clear to me."</li>

<dd>I don't have time to look for a "not selling website", so it's o.k. for me. I wonder why Alice Miller herself doesn't link to books and authors who back her findings on her own websites.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">For the good of "<i>Aryan race</i>"</span></h3>
<p>According to my judgement Miller erronously has not taken into consideration that there has been a racist ideology in order to justify all those massmurder for the "good" of socalled "aryan race". If Hitler had not got strong support from powerful people he could not have done nothing - or maybe he would have become a "private" massmurderer because of his infancy -, not being able to murder with the help of so many institutions so many people.</p>

<p>Hi Austerlitz:</p>
<p>I’ve no intent in protecting Miller. I myself added the critical link to Daniel’s essay in this article. Do you remember? And when Miller answered my letter about my proposal to make a journal, I step back because of the Dennis Rodie affair.</p>
<p>If I removed the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> link it’s because it is improper to put it in the opening sentence according to writing etiquette. At any event, Miller’s web site is already linked en the External sites section. If you want to include it anyway, you have to figure out a proper place for the link (I for one cannot imagine where).</p>

<p>This book is very interesting, and important, but it is not available in english, at least I have not been able to find it until now. But -nevertheless- it should be mentioned here. Austerlitz --88.72.31.227 09:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Austerlitz,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know German. Could you please translate what says the book's dust cover or just summarize the content in your own words?</dd>

<dd>Hi Cesar,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>perhaps I am going to do so one of these days. Since the original has been written in Dutch, I first try to put it on the dutch wikipedia site about Alice Miller. In case it will be translated into english it has to be done from the dutch original.</dd>

<dd>Believe it or not, I cannot find the title of the Dutch original any more. Inside a book one can usually find the title in language of the original, but it is not the case here. <a href="http://www.naap.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/symposium%202006/Sympfolder.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.naap.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/symposium%202006/Sympfolder.pdf" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Most probably this link cannot help neither.</dd>

<dd>Austerlitz -- 88.72.31.227 11:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, there is also no Dutch wikipedia site about Alice Miller <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Miller" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Miller" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, so I'd better just forget about all this.</dd>
