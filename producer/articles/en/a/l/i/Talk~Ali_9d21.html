<p>Zora, i apologized to you <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html#Striver_again" title="User talk:Grenavitar">here</a>. However, that issue had nothing to do with this article, but you reverted me without responding to any of my latest answers (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_Archive3_bcb7.html#Strivers_respons_2" title="Talk:Ali/Archive3">now in Archive 3</a>). So, i aske you: What is the justification for you omitting so many things? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:27, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_9d21.html" title="Edit section: Another rewrite">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Another rewrite</span></h2>
<p>It's funny -- for a long time, a Sunni editor named AladdinSE worked on this article and would not allow any Shi'a POV material at all. I had long arguments with him re the necessity of allowing Shi'a material too. Now the article seems to have been watchlisted by a large number of new Shi'a editors who are determined to turn it into a Shi'a-POV article. I keep trying to remove the pious veneration, and the Shi'a editors keep putting it back. Meanwhile, the Sunni editors are staying away -- possibly because they don't like struggles, and possibly because they're heavily involved with edit wars in other articles, with various anti-Muslim editors.</p>
<p>I'm guessing (though I don't know) that the Shi'a POV re Ali is <i>all</i> a number of the new editors know. They're probably being completely honest in adding what I'd regard as extremely doubtful or biased material. A lot of it isn't sourced at all. It is just repeated as "something everyone knows". Folks -- it's not accepted by everyone. Sunni doubt many of the claims for Ali. Academics doubt the claims for Ali.</p>
<p>There are extensive links to Shi'a websites here, so if readers want to find out what Shi'a think about Ali, they can go to those sites. As for this article, it has be NEUTRAL. NPOV. Not Shi'a. Please respect the purpose of this encyclopedia, which is to present all views and let readers make up their own minds. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:37, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zora, what "pious veneration" are you talking about? Stop giving vague accusations, if you have a issue with something, then bring it, stop giving random "Shi'a pov Shi'a pov" accusations. <b>WHAT</b> is Shi'a pov, and <b>WHY</b>?</p>
<p>The Sunni editor staying away should give you a hint!. Zora, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_dense" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_dense" rel="nofollow">dont be dense</a>, you are the only one still crying "Shi'a pov, Shi'a pov", not a single editor supports your random accusations. Give specific issues, tell why your view is correct, source it and you will see you will get plenty of support. But you dont. You just go "Shi'a pov" and thats it, nothing more. And then you complain that nobody supports you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I just got two barnstars from editors who think I'm doing a good job. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, you see, i dont do that. I have a good and relevant point by point list of every item i contest, and here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd><i>Shi'a Muslims believe that Ali was born inside the <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, the most sacred site in Islam. There is some argument as to whether or not any contemporary Sunni Muslims accept this. Most Sunni reject the claim, as do academic scholars.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no "<i>argument as to whether or not any contemporary Sunni Muslims accept this"'</i>, i have given you a link of a 100% Sunni contemporary biography claiming he was born in the Kaaba <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/01_ali_bin_talib.htm#Birth%20of%20Ali" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/01_ali_bin_talib.htm#Birth%20of%20Ali" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure that I accept that site as 100% Sunni. It doesn't SAY that it's Sunni. It accepts some Sunni views and some Shi'a views. It seems like an attempt at being all-inclusive. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>" <i>Most Sunni reject the claim</i>" is uncourced and uncourcable. You have not quoted one single Sunni scholar rejecting it. And you know it. And you also know that you are not supposed to say things that are unsouced. I leave it to the reader to judge you for claiming a thing you know you have no ground for doing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have cited one Sunni website that says Hakim ibn Hazm was born in the Kaaba -- and no one else <a href="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=1142" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=1142" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I believe that Islamonline is a major Sunni site. The complete lack of mention on other Sunni sites suggests that they don't accept it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"<i>as do academic scholars</i>" is the same. You have not quoted a single scholar, Muslims or not, that rejects it. You only have Non-Muslim scholars not <i>mentioning</i> it. That does not summ to "rejecting", it is "skeptical or dissmissive", just as my prefered version says.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, fiddle-de-dee. You haven't even READ any of those works and you presume to know what they mean? If they don't even mention it -- as they don't mention any number of Muslim myths, like the splitting of the moon, or the miracle of the birds and pebbles -- they reject it. It is not worthy of serious historical discussion. That's MY side in this conflict. Don't tell me what MY side believes. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>however, i do agree that a reference to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthplace_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_6654.html" title="Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> needs to be included.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>First Muslim?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I agree that we need a reference to some people beliving it was Ali, even though it is not the Abu Bakr article. However, i object to puting only the Shi'a pov in bracers, either all views are in bracers or none.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>They hired themselves out for labor and raided caravans.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>"and raided caravans" is Non-Muslim pov. If you want, you can add it to the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Muslim_view_of_Ali_8b11.html" title="Non-Muslim view of Ali">Non-Muslim view of Ali</a>. Otherwise it will open the door to disputed events in the main article, and we have the x view of Ali article to avoid that. The Muslim view is that <i>some</i> <b>Meccan</b> caravans where raided <i>after</i> the meccans having been warned by a Muslim, and in the context of war, specificaly war for resources, not as a "casual" way of getting their hands on random caravans wealth. That is the view of <i>some</i> Non-Muslim, and belongs to the "view of" article. However, i could settle with stating both versions on the main article, since there is a considerable non-Muslims holding that view. However, I vote for omittig the whole issue in this specific article, since it is not directly relevant to Ali, and include it in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Badr_04cf.html" title="Battle of Badr">Battle of Badr</a> article, since the caravan raiding is the prelude to the battle. If we are going to include both the Muslim and non-Muslim view here, then we need to do so in all Muslim biograpies, for consistancy, and that does not see optimal in my view. Otherwise, we could do a breakout article Caravan raiding befre Badr to exand on this particular issue, and link all Sahaba biographies to that article. But as i said, i belive the best is to included the non-Muslim view about the caravans in the Battle of Badr article, where it is already covered in great detail.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You admit it yourself -- they raided caravans. You just don't want it mentioned, because it makes the Muslims look bad. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"Shi'a believe that Ali was also prominent at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Uhud_51d2.html" title="Battle of Uhud">Battle of Uhud</a>, as well as many other battles."</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-sense, that is Muslim pov. If you imply that non-Muslim reject that, please give reference.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote the article on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Uhud_51d2.html" title="Battle of Uhud">Battle of Uhud</a>, following Watt, and he doesn't even MENTION Ali. The heroes of the day were Abu Dujana and Hamza. In Ibn Ishaq's account, Ali offers water to Muhammad. Yet in the Shi'a account, Ali performs prodigies of valor. This is just part of a general trend to paint Ali as the perfect hero, head and shoulders above everyone else. You can't just assert that he was brave, as if everyone knows it; we don't. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sunni sources:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ali played the role of a hero in the battle. His services were highly appreciated by the Holy Prophet and the Companions. Some Muslim poets composed verses in the honor of Ali. Extolling his bravery one of the poets said: "<b>There is no sword better than the sword of Ali; and there is no young man superior to Ali</b>." <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/13_ali_bin_talib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/13_ali_bin_talib.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Man, i hade forgot that quote, ill add it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, that source may or may not be completely Sunni. Lots of Sunni sites mention Ali's bravery, but they don't exalt him above all the other early Muslims. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>You removed the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_position.html" title="Hadith of position">Hadith of position</a> section.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Entirely unaccaptable to do so without motivation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's Shi'a argumentation, that's what it is, and reliance upon a very suspicious-looking hadith, that shows all the signs of being a late fabrication. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>However, Umar, the caliph who succeeded Abu Bakr, did restore the estates in Medina to al-Abbas and Ali</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Are you sure Madelung says that? What does he base it on?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Didn't you buy the book? Yes, I'm SURE he says it. I quoted it. He bases it on Bukhari, Khums, 2 <a href="http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0062.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0062.aspx" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and Ibn Hanbal, <i>Musnad</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not that it matters, if he contest it, and several other non-Muslims scholars agree with him, then we will need to refrase it to include that non-Muslims belive that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Given that I found it on a Sunni site, I think Sunnis believe it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Muslim view is that it was given to them only to govern as state property, not to own. And you know that. Ill remove your version of that until you have shown that there are more than Madelung holding that view, if he in fact holds it, and it is not your view of his view. I question your interpretation of his view, since there is no Muslim sources what so ever that claims it was given to them to own. If only Madelungs belives that, then it is no sufficient to have it as contested in the main article, we can in that case state it under the Madelung section of the non-Muslim view of Ali. Otherwise, we can start by saying Ali was, God forbid, a idiot, since lammens, and only him, belived so.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Some say that the sword that wounded him was poisoned.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I have seen no direct evidence for it being poisoned or not, so i have no stance in this issue. Ill stipulate that your prefered version is correct.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Treatment of the assassin.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Ill try refrase that so we both get satisfied with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Muslim view</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You totaly decapitated it witout motivation. unaccaptable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The supposed Muslim view was full of Shi'a-POV veneration of Ali.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>Sunni view</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You refreased the Uthman sentence. I support your version.</p>
<p>You also removed a big section from the Sunni view witout motivation. unaccaptable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Sunni view section is supposed to be for their view, NOT for you to set up strawmen and refute them. Also, trying to squeeze in ALL the arguments raised in the course of centuries of Sunni-Shi'a disputation is confusing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Shi'a view</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You remvoed sections from it witout motivation. unaccaptable.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Non-Muslim view</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You added this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most historians of early Islam, however, are not interested in judging Ali's character. Contemporary historical approaches stress economic, cultural, and ecological issues, not the role of "great men" in forming history.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That realy is to ambigous to add. What is that supposed to mean? That Muslims try to determine if he was a "great man", but somehow the non-Muslims dont care if he was a "great man" or not? What is a "Great man"?</p>
<p>Are you implying that Muslims are not intrested in "economic, cultural, and ecological issues"? What does that have to do with Ali? "<i>are not interested in judging Ali's character</i>"? That is pure non-sense, of course they get a a psycological judgment on Alis person. Did you think that they will dedicate their time and effort on every single aspect of him without trying to judge his character?</p>
<p>Zora, what are you trying to pull?</p>
<p>That non-Muslims do psycological profiles for all men in History, but not Ali?</p>
<dl>
<dd>NO, that the Great Man theory of history is Carlyle, is 19th century, is not currently popular among historians. Sheesh, why are YOU, who don't know anything about the subject, trying to tell ME, who has done historical research in archives, who has read extensively in history, what historians do and believe? YOU are the one who interprets history solely in terms of personalities, judged as good or bad. Historians don't do that. They really don't. Stop trying to mangle the other POVs to support your beliefs. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you are trying to say that non-Muslims dont regard Ali's character as a source of emulation, that goes without saying, that is as superficial statment as saying that "non-Muslims dont follow Sharia" in the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> article.</p>
<p>What we <i>do</i> need to do, is to add in the Muslim view section that all Muslims belive Alis behavior is a source of emulation, Shi'a in particular.</p>
<p>Zora, disambiguette and motivate that line, then we can add it.</p>
<p>You also removed the UN section of Nahj witout motivation. unaccaptable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is patently ridiculous to cite a Shi'a magazine as proof of what non-Muslims believe about Ali. Again, stop trying to rewrite your opponents' views. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a></dd>

<dd>Striver... I read both versions and I think on the whole Zora's version is better. I do need to read over it all again... but... Zora has a good academic tone... that is definitely superior in my book. I need to do more fact checking but from first glance she seems to approach this more neutrally. This is getting regrettably close a revert war. I would protect it right now but I won't since I wouldn't protect it on Striver's version and therefore my protection would be unfair. Striver, I think you're being less than reasonable in this. Witness pioneer isn't exactly the most reliable source... please... I think this whole thing is silly... and Striver, those sites... I don't think they help your case.

<dd>Dbachmann, im not writing just for fun. Im neither writing just to annoy people. I really and truly do not <b>understand</b> what specific issue that is bothering Zora. It does not help me to hear "its pov", "its bad" and so forth. I need to hear "This specific sentence is bad since it is not adequatly sourced".

<dd>That is what i mean with "specific and motivated". You write <i>where</i> the problem is and <i>why</i> there is a problem. What i do not prerceive as "specific and motivated" is: <i>"Zora has a good academic tone... that is definitely superior in my book."</i></dd>

<dd>That does not specify <i>where</i> she has superior tone. I can not possibly respond to that! I need to hear <i>where</i> and <i>why</i> she has a "a good academic tone", while i do not. I mean, sure Zora has a good accademic tone, and so do i, IMHO. "Zora has a good academic tone" does not tell me anything, its pure ambiguity in my book. This is a hot topic, down to every single word in every single sentanc, ambiguous statemants do not contribute to the solution.

<p>I don't want to go into this beyond the simple: Wikipedia doesn't do pov forks. There can be no articles about "Shia views" or "non-Muslim views" about anything. These titles are to be redirected to this article. Sorry, that's simple policy. If you want to branch out sub-articles, pick sub-topics, but give a balanced picture of various views on each one. You can take the material from the forks' history and compile them into something like Criticism of Ali or Criticism of Shia if you like, presenting all sides. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:54, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The deletion process is highly skewed in favor of keeping articles. When you have a claque of Shi'a voting as a body to keep Shi'a-POV forks, voters who feel intimidated by what seems to them a specialized subject, and no indication that this one article is part of an overall scheme to set up a POV fork for all major figures in early Islamic history, then you're going to get AfDs that fail. An AfD that grouped all the POV forks that Striver and Zereshk are creating might have a better chance of success. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:17, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora and gren グレン, i need specific reasons about why Striver's article isn't as good. gren グレン, you said that you prefer Zora's article. why? i haven't read any of these two articles (Zora's and Striver's), but i can tell you that i prefer Striver's because you didn't point out any of his errors (if there were any). Striver clearly stated Zora's errors and why he thought they were errors. Zora and gren グレン, if you want Zora's article to stay instead of Striver's, you have to give reasons because 1) Readers will be able to know what the errors were and why they were errors, and 2) Striver can fix his errors and know what kind of errors he made so nexct time he writes an article he will know what to avoid. if you just say that you prefer Zora's article, no one will no why but if you give reasons, then everyone will know that it was because of x reason. if i sound confusing, tell me in my talk page. <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahussain_0910.html" title="User:Yahussain">Yahussain</a> 00:43, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Administrators: It is first unlawful to out the shia view first Sunni islam is 95% ( by antimuslems istimates) while shia are 3% and offshoot shia( non shia in shia view) are 25( Ismaili, etc) Here most the editors are from the offshoot like Striver a nd Botonov, etc. This absurd. If you want to look your self in the mirror and see how beautiful you are then do that, but if you want to know the truth( encyclopedia) then you should not delete my editing which was reasonable ( if you really bothered to read) ( anon or adnanmuf) If you keep reversing my editing I will contact other media resources to devaluate your encyclopedia. As of now, the encyclopedia concerning Islamic topics should be named exotic and occult views of the world, not encyclopedia. for example The name of Ali is derived from God name? this is absurd I put that most names of God could become human names if you just take the Al- from the beginnings for example Halim is a man name Al-Halim is God name Ali is a man name ( by the way it was a name very prevelant in Arabia before Islam used by Infidels!! What about the topic Born in kaaba? Is Ali's all about just these few things you put. Please purge the Encyclopedia fromthese perversions, or I will see to it that your site is devaluated</p>

<p>Hi Zora,</p>
<p>First of all, Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali</a>&#160;: “most famous collection of Ali's speeches and letters is the Peak of Eloquence (Arabic: Nahj al-Balāgha).”</p>
<p>I did a quick search and find out that “surely, the likeness of this world is that of a snake: it is soft to touch, and deadly poisonous. The ignorant child is distracted by it, and the one with understanding and intellect is cautious of it. So turn away from what fascinates you in it, for how little of it stays with you. “ is quoted from the Peak of Eloquence, letter no. 68. It is a pretty famous saying of Ali and deserves to be included.</p>
<p>Would you please let me know what your concerns are regarding the quotes from Ali? Is it just the sources?</p>
<p>Thanks. P.S. I didn't delete Mazar-i-sharif reference. Somebody else did it. There can be more than one anon&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>An anon added a bit re Ali teaching a certain spiritual practice. I don't think that this can be stated as fact. From what I've read about Sufism and other such spiritual practices, a great many traditions trace their practices back to Ali -- however, since the practices became widespread many centuries after Ali's death, academics believe that it is much more likely that they are late inventions. Perhaps we should have a section on Sufism and Ali, in which both opinions (practices taught by Ali and practices merely attributed to Ali) can be laid out. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:46, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Quotes -- Three or four quotes is enough. Short quotes. If it's going to be too long, then it should be in Wikisource, not in the article. Enthusiasts tend to want more more more of their heroes and favorites, whether it's more quotes or more pictures of actresses, whatever. You may think that it will create enthusiasm for your favorite -- instead, it bores readers and makes them think less of your hero. Short and pithy is what's required. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:21, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I agree Zora. But I have another complain. You said many spiritual traditions such as Sufism trace their practices back to Ali. Its reason is that he had a very simple life style. While I think this was a very important characteristic of Ali, the article does not even have a hint to that. I think it is not fair. Even it does not mention that Muslims think that way. It is true because at least many spiritual traditions that stress on simplicity of life-style trace their practices back to Ali. Following, I have provided some evidence to support the point that he has a simple life. If not enough I can provide more</p>
<p><br />
1. The seventeenth-century theologian, Henry Stubbe in [An Account of the Rise and Progress of Mohammedanism, 1705, p. 83] writes: “He had a contempt of the world, its glory and pomp, he feared God much, gave many alms, was just in all his actions, humble and affable; of an exceeding quick wit and of an ingenuity that was not common, he was exceedingly learned, not in those sciences that terminate in speculations but those which extend to practice.”</p>
<p>2. Ali’s response to the people of Medina beseeched him to accept the mantle of Calipha: "I swear by the Creator of this Universe that had they not sworn unconditional allegiance to me; had they not manifested profound gratitude for my accepting their rulership; had not the presence of helpers and supporters made it incumbent upon me to defend the faith; and had Allah, the Almighty not taken a promise from the learned to put a check upon the luxurious and vicious lives of Oppressors and tyrants as well as to try to reduce the pangs of poverty and starvation of the oppressed and downtrodden, and had He not made it incumbent upon them to secure back the usurped rights of the weak from the mighty and powerful oppressors, I would even now have left the rulership of this State as I did earlier and would have allowed it to sink into anarchy and chaos. Then you would have seen that in my view the glamour of a vicious life of your world is no better than the sneezing of a goat". (Sermon—7, Peak of Eloquence)</p>
<p>3. "Indeed Allah has made it obligatory that the true and just Imams should lead their lives in a simple way and keep their souls under check so that they go side by side with the poor people, who may not suffer from a feeling of deprivation". (Sermon—204, Peak of Eloquence)</p>
<hr />
<p>I think you go astray if you trace all this to Ali. All the descriptions of Muhammad's family life emphasize his total disregard for luxurious food, clothing, and surroundings. In Ibn Sa'd, there's a tradition that Muhammad said that the only worldly things in which he took pleasure were women and perfume. I just finished editing the article on <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Dharr_fa6f.html" title="Abu Dharr">Abu Dharr</a>; there's another early Muslim who felt that spending money on luxury was an offense to God. Ali to some extent "stood for" the early, austere understanding of Islam, but he wasn't the only one who felt that Uthman and his relatives had taken a wrong turn.</p>
<p>But that's all irrelevant to the point that I was making re various Sufi orders tracing their teachings to Ali. Some went back to Abu Bakr, some to Ali. Is there a list at <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Sufism</a>, one to which we could link? If not, there should be. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:10, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks Zora, I was wrong in thinking that all this traces back to Ali. Thanks for correcting me. Unfortunately I just have an idea of Sufism and don't know much. Sorry for taking your time but Do you think it would be good to insert "All the descriptions of Muhammad's family life emphasize his total disregard for luxurious food, clothing, and surroundings. In Ibn Sa'd, there's a tradition that Muhammad said that the only worldly things in which he took pleasure were women and perfume." into the article regarding Muhammad? I couldn't find anything about the Muhammad's family life in that article.</p>
<p>-&gt; I changed my mind, it is not neccessary. Thanks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Zora, I have argued about Raids at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali/Raids" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali/Raids" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ali/Raids</a> . Your attention is appreciated.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAli_9d21.html" title="Edit section: Was Ali interested in Rulership?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Was Ali interested in Rulership?</span></h2>
<p>Zora, The sentence "Ali had a strong claim to the leadership, both as one of Muhammad's closest assistants and as his cousin and son-in-law. " implies that his claim for leadership was because of his closeness to Muhammad. This is against the Shia belief. He was not a FOND OF POWER AND RULERSHIP. But this sentence implies that he was. Moreover, in the other part of the article we read&#160;: " Ali at first refused. He is said to have been horrified by the assassination of Uthman, and did not wish to appear to be profiting from the situation. But his supporters persevered, and Ali finally allowed himself to be proclaimed caliph." This suggests that the only reason he didn't want to accept rullership was his fearing of appearing as being profiting by the assassination of Uthman. I think both these two sentences should be revised. My reasons of why Ali was not a fond of power:</p>
<p>1. Ali’s response to the people of Medina beseeched him to accept the mantle of Calipha: "I swear by the Creator of this Universe that had they not sworn unconditional allegiance to me; had they not manifested profound gratitude for my accepting their rulership; had not the presence of helpers and supporters made it incumbent upon me to defend the faith; and had Allah, the Almighty not taken a promise from the learned to put a check upon the luxurious and vicious lives of Oppressors and tyrants as well as to try to reduce the pangs of poverty and starvation of the oppressed and downtrodden, and had He not made it incumbent upon them to secure back the usurped rights of the weak from the mighty and powerful oppressors, I would even now have left the rulership of this State as I did earlier and would have allowed it to sink into anarchy and chaos. Then you would have seen that in my view the glamour of a vicious life of your world is no better than the sneezing of a goat". (Sermon—7, Peak of Eloquence)</p>
<p>2. Ibn Abbas says: "Once when I visited Imam Ali, he was mending his shoes. The Holy Imam asked me, 'What do you think will be the price of this shoe?' I said, 'It has no value at all'. The Holy Imam then said, 'By Allah! To my mind this torn shoe is more valuable than my ruling over the people provided I enforce truthfulness and eradicate the untruth".</p>
<p>3. When Imam Ali after assuming the authority of ruling over the people visited a city, he said, "I have come down to your city in my old dress, with this asset and this horse. If after a few days you find that I depart from your city in different clothes you should conclude that I misappropriated the public property".</p>
<p><br />
ALSO, I have added something to the part "Was Muhammad an imam?". Please have a look at it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But that's YOUR belief about Ali, that he's a perfect divine being with no human passions. It would be quite possible to use the existing historical evidence to depict Ali in an extremely unflattering light, as a conniver after power. I'm not particularly interested in doing so, but I see ample indications in the literature that he was human, fallible, and not at all divine. This article is an encyclopedia article; it is not Shi'a devotional literature. I don't see the passages you cite as particularly unflattering to Ali. They are unflattering ONLY if you start from the standpoint that he didn't have normal human emotions ... and historians CAN'T start from that supernaturalist standpoint. We're having similar problems with the contention that he never converted to Islam because he was a Muslim already. That's not anything found in the earliest historical accounts, not anything found in academic histories -- it's just Shi'a doctrine, that he could not have converted because that would have been to be imperfect BEFORE the conversion, and Ali must not be shown to be imperfect. We can put the "no amibition" into the article as a separate viewpoint (as we did with the "no conversion" POV) but we can't promote it as the only viewpoint. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:40, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Zora, I agree that not only Ali but Muhammad also was human and fallible. I only think that they had a connection with God in a PARTICULAR sense (which does not make them divine at all). The reference I added in the part "Was Muhammad an imam?" was only to show that “Imam” is not a mere title applied to 12 people; it has nothing to do with what we are talking here. There, I just wanted to mention that according to shia, being Imam is a position that some people can attain and not a title for a particular group of 12 people. It is all the matter of definition. According to the Shia definition Muhammad was an Imam. It is clearly true due to the way Imam is defined.</p>
<p>Anyway, here I have another argument. Let’s assume Ali was a perfectly human being. Isn’t it possible for a "human being" not to have interests in power and rulership? Isn’t it possible for a "human being" to disregard the worldly things? I think it is POSSIBLE.</p>
<p>Now we have a sentence:</p>
<p>“Ali had a strong claim to the leadership”</p>
<p>We both agree on it.</p>
<p>Your theory for its reason is the following: “both as one of Muhammad's closest assistants and as his cousin and son-in-law.” My theory is this: “He was not interested in the worldly part of leadership. He FELT a responsibility because he FELT Muhammad has set him as his successor. He felt the responsibility to preserve the society from straying from the Islamic values, to enforce truthfulness and to eradicate the untruth“</p>
<p>These are two theories. Either we mention both theories in the article; or we provide evidences for the both sides. The one with more weight is picked to appear in the article. Is that fair? We never know which theory is true but we can provide evidences for each of them. If you agree, could you please provide reliable evidences for the first theory?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that you're over-analyzing the "he had a strong claim" sentence. When I read it -- and I think that I may have written it, but I'm not sure -- it reads to me as if it were describing his merits in the eyes of the rest of the Muslims. That is, he was a possible leader because he had been intimately associated with Muhammad for many years, was one of his closest relatives, AND had been one of Muhammad's most trusted lieutenants. These were all the sorts of reasons that would weigh with tribesmen choosing a leader. That doesn't mean that Ali believed that these were his only qualifications, or that he didn't believe that he had a responsibility to carry out Muhammad's wishes -- or God's wishes -- in keeping Islam a religion rather than just an excuse for worldly rule. You're so far INSIDE the view of Ali's position as divinely ordained, and Ali as accepting it as a duty, that you can't see how it would look to someone who didn't hold these views -- as, clearly, most of the Muslims didn't. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Zora for your comment. The reason that I really do care about it is that I have seen many Christians criticizing Islam because of the political disagreements after death of Muhammad. They say that if Muhammad was really a true prophet, then he was at least able to train his followers to disregard worldly power. As you know, Jesus was not interested in worldly power. They say that Muslims were so much greedy of power that after death of Muhammad, they started fighting for power. They say that the main reason for these disagreements is that the only thing Muslims were looking at was “power”. This is what they say. I just want to put a hint in the article regarding Ali, that at least there were people with the view that: the glamour of a vicious life of the world is no better than the sneezing of a goat. Wasn’t I aware of that criticism of Christians, I wouldn’t stress on changing some of the sentences.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I added a sentence to the article saying that Shi'a believe that Ali was acting out of a sense of duty, not out of desire for power. Also, I wouldn't be too worried about criticism from Christians. It's not as if they weren't killing each other for power as soon as the Christians had any. The record after Constantine's conversion is dismal. Since I'm a Buddhist, I should probably add that Buddhists in power have killed with abandon too. It's a human thing, alas. I think one of my online friends came up with a "law" something like, "There is no belief so pure or so rational that it can't be degraded into utter nonsense by fuggheaded supporters". <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:41, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</pre>
<p>Although the controversy appears mostly resolved, I think the term "strong claim" has a legalistic connotation and should not be used here because there was no rule of succession to Muhammad's position, and in fact, no rule that dictated that there should be any successor at all, under which Ali could have made any "claim."</p>
<p>My revision, I think, more simply states the situation as it stood: many <i>believed</i> that Ali should succeed Muhammad. However, there was, objectively speaking, no rule, or a body of law, under which one could make a <i>claim</i> of him being a legitimate successor.<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyseaweed_1e60.html" title="User:Saltyseaweed">Saltyseaweed</a> 18:30, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pepsidranka, the past tense was used merely because the particular topic of discussion was what was happening during the succession struggle--it was meant to say at that moment, many Muslims believed Ali should succeeed. It is not meant to deny that many Shi'a still believe that; hopefully, the last revision will clarify that.</p>
<p>The sentence became a bit verbose to clarify who "he" is, between Muhammad and Ali. I think the last revision will make it clear. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyseaweed_1e60.html" title="User:Saltyseaweed">Saltyseaweed</a> 19:11, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It currently reads: "After the death of Muhammad, many Muslims believed that Ali should succeed Muhammad, as Ali was one of Muhammad's closest assistants, his cousin and son-in-law, and a powerful leader on own merit." I still think it seems awkward for it to be "believed", then "should succeed" and then "was". It goes from past to present to past. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 19:19, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about "After the death of Muhammad, many Muslims believed that Ali should have succeeded Muhammad, ...". <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 19:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think it's awkward, because we are discussing what the Muslims believed after Muhammad died but before Umar assumed the leadership. Remember, "should" is a past tense of "shall" and I think its usage in past-tense sentences is acceptable, much like how the word "would" is used. If we take your version, that would be from the point of view of the past, but after Umar assumed the leadership.</p>
<p>Any proofreader want to make a judgment? Zora? Or why don't we change "should" to "must" or "would"? But the meaning changes. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyseaweed_1e60.html" title="User:Saltyseaweed">Saltyseaweed</a> 00:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed the sentence to "Many of the early Muslims believed that Ali should have succeeded ..." Does that make it any clearer? Maybe there's a better phrase for early Muslims, meaning the Muslims of 632 CE? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:31, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think so Zora, "the early Muslim" is, I think, an ill-defined term. How about "immediately after Muhammad's death"? Does that narrow the timeline enough? Also, your revision of the preceding sentence muddles things up, because in your rendition, both Muhammad and Ali are referred to in 3rd person male pronoun (he/his).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also have problem with "should have" past perfect tense. By using the past perfect tense here, it preempts the following narration. To me, ". . . believed that Ali should succeed" sounds right, as "should" is the past tense of "shall." Nothing's wrong with " . . . believed that Ali would succeed" so what's wrong with should? <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyseaweed_1e60.html" title="User:Saltyseaweed">Saltyseaweed</a> 03:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term Rafidi is an arabic islamic political term that is used for specific people. Its first use was after the time of Zayd bin Ali bin AlHussein bin Ali bin Abi Taleb revolution and death. It is true it means refusers. Tose people had conditions on Zayd to fight with him at the time of the war when he did not accept their conditions they deserted him. The first occurence of their name after they met with Imam Jaafar AsSadeq the nephew of Zayd an dthey introduced themselves as the known rafidis. Jaafar cursed them. After that time many authors who hate Shia called them unjustly Rafidis. Many sunnis however like AshShahrastani in his book "al-Milal wa Nihal" "Sects and cults" states the difference between Shia and Rafidis although his definitions are not very welcomed by the shia.Even anti-shia talked about early shia at the time of Ali and shortly after. But now they use the term claiming that nowadays shia are rfidis rather than Shia, which for sure is unjust. To summarize, Rafidis is a derogatory description of Shia and shia never use it to descibe themselves. In addition it has never been used before the word shia to mean religio-political group of Islam. 129.130.124.101 03:41, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is also accepted by academic historians that the Shi'a sect as it is known today emerged only gradually, and that there WERE no Shi'a, holding all the doctrines accepted by Twelver Shi'a, just after Muhammad's death.

<dd>Abi and Abu are interchangeable and depend on their position in the sentence. I'm not sure when the correct useage applies for each so I won't comment on that. There <i>is</i> a disambig. page for Ali (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Ali (disambiguation)">Ali (disambiguation)</a>), so having his full name provides better understanding as to which Ali the article is about (since there are many other Ali's listed in the disambig. page). <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoa_2d5a.html" title="User:Stoa">Stoa</a> 19:42, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cunardo, you need to wait days, not hours. People have lives and stuff. Check out the situation with the disambiguation page. Someone may have decided that Ali deserves a disambiguation page, and then people can come here. That makes sense to me. There are other Alis in the world. As for Abi Talib rather than Abu Talib -- as I understand it, that IS the correct version, that the word changes in a new environment. After some initial confusion, we started using Abi Talib throughout WP and it would be a major task to change everything.

<p>There's a Cory Doctorow novel called <i>Someone comes to town, someone leaves town</i> (or something like that), available as a free ebook, and in it there's an account of a fictional discussion between a gung-ho community wi-fi enthusiast and a guy who works for the telco. The telco guy explains, "This telco is like a battleship. It weighs a lot; it has momentum. We're trying to change it, but it's slow. It's like trying to change the direction the ship is heading by tapping on the prow with your finger." Inertia of the installed base. If something is outrageously horribly WRONG we of course have to change the hundreds of articles necessary, but if it's just a matter of judgment, not universally accepted, then the work necessary to make the change outweighs any benefits from the change.</p>

<dd>It took me awhile, but I found a usage note on the subject.
<dl>
<dd><i>When the parent in a nasab is referred to by his kunya, the word abu becomes abi, e.g., Muhammad’s son-in-law was ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, ‘Ali the son of Abu Talib, or ‘Ali, the son of the father of Talib.</i><a href="http://www.sca.org/heraldry/laurel/names/arabic-naming2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sca.org/heraldry/laurel/names/arabic-naming2.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So I was wrong about Abu vs Abi, but I still think that we should be able to use <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> as the page title. It redirects here, and what I meant is that the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> page is not the disambiguation page. If Ali redirects here, then we can just use it as the page title (as it was for ages). The intro already has a link to a disambiguation page either way. Do you have any objection to moving it back to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>? The issue of how many pages link here is rather irrelevant to the discussion. There are 20 redirects to this page, and as long as they all point the same place then it doesn't make any difference. Whoever changes the name has to throw in an extra 2 minutes to change the redirects also. Currently there are hundreds of redirects from <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>, and only a few actually pointing to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 01:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the Manual of Style dictates that the most common name be used for the page. Now in this instance, there are many people named "Ali" who could potentially be called "Ali" in a given context and the audience would know who the reference was to. However, I'm inclined to say that of all the notable people named "Ali", Ali ibn Abi Talib is the most common. I'd support a move back to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>. If there was some sort of consensus to move it with "ibn....", I would suggest moving it to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abu_Talib_a9ac.html" title="Ali ibn Abu Talib">Ali ibn Abu Talib</a> as that seems to be how his full name is written in most English texts, as far as I can recall. Zora can correct me if I'm mistaken. I don't recall ever seeing <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> in a text designed for non-Arabic speaking people. It is probably the most correct, though that doesn't mean we must go with the most correct name all the time. Common names win over correct names the vast majority of the time. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 17:39, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Pepsidrinka that a general reference to "Ali" with no context is most likely to refer to this Ali. Even if there was a need for <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> to be a disambiguation page, this title <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>, or the other version <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abu_Talib_a9ac.html" title="Ali ibn Abu Talib">Ali ibn Abu Talib</a>, is an inappropriate title - most English speakers do not know the name of Ali's father, so this is a confusing and useless disambiguation. Ali (Caliph) or Ali (Shi'a Imam) or Ali (Caliph and Shi'a Imam) woulld seem to be the appropriate way to disambiguate. But I don't see any reason that <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> should be a disambiguation page. It seems like this page gets moved every few months without any discussion, and I don't see why we should have to wait a while to discuss it to move it back. It should stay at <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> until there's a consensus to move it somewhere else, which there clearly isn't in this case. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:49, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've moved it back, on the grounds that "Ali" was a name agreed to by consensus, and that the move was made without any discussion. If we come to a consensus that the page should be moved back to some disambiguated title, we can do that, but until then, it should stay here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I personally have not decided on which title is better "Ali" or "Ali ibn...", however I think if we do use his full name Ali should redirect here and Ali (disambiguation) should remain the dab page. This is by far and away the most important usage of Ali so we needn't nest it behind a dab page. I think the move back was a good idea because there was never any consensus for the first move. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:18, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora, can you please explain why you removed the following from the article. Thanks</p>
<p>Shia sources report the following quote attributed to Ali as a response to the people of Medina who asked him to accept the rulership <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>:</p>

<dd><i>I swear by the Creator of this Universe that had they not sworn unconditional allegiance to me; had they not manifested profound gratitude for my accepting their rulership; had not the presence of helpers and supporters made it incumbent upon me to defend the faith; and had Allah, the Almighty not taken a promise from the learned to put a check upon the luxurious and vicious lives of Oppressors and tyrants as well as to try to reduce the pangs of poverty and starvation of the oppressed and downtrodden, and had He not made it incumbent upon them to secure back the usurped rights of the weak from the mighty and powerful oppressors, I would even now have left the rulership of this State as I did earlier and would have allowed it to sink into anarchy and chaos. Then you would have seen that in my view the glamour of a vicious life of your world is no better than the sneezing of a goat.</i></dd>

<p>One, it's too long. We do not usually give extended speeches in WP. Two, it is historically dubious. No cite by an early chronicler, just pointed, in a vague way, to Shi'a websites. I have a strong suspicion that this will turn out to have been attributed to Ali centuries later. We have links to Shi'a websites. If people want to read this sort of material, it's there. I'm OK with re-telling Shi'a legends (or what I regard as legends) but not with extensive quotes of dubious material. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zora please do not delete the Jamal Confrontation and the Siffin Confrontation section in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s article because these two events were big things that happened after Imam Ali AS became a caliph. I did read a neutral website on the two events and then I wrote these two things in my own words. If I copied and pasted then these two sections would have been two to three pages long. So please do not delete it because of two reasons. Firstly, these two events were major events that happened when Imam Ali AS became a caliph, and, secondly, I spent a lot of time writing these two sections in my own words. Even thought I am a Shi’a I have tried my best to write these two sections in a neutral format. Thank You <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalman01_ae51.html" title="User:Salman01">Salman</a></p>

<dd>Salman, the article <i>already</i> has discussions of the events you want to discuss. You can't just write your personal essay and insert it into the article as if the rest of the article didn't exist. Your contributions have to be PART of the article. Take it one sentence at a time and if you want to add extra material, reference it. Be warned, we may take it out again, or move it to the Shi'a section. You often rely on Shi'a websites that do not give sources and include material that is not based on the earliest historians. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:04, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know the article does in the Caliphate section but not in detail. The Jamal Confrontation and the Siffin Confrontation were two very important events that took place when Imam Ali AS became the Caliph that is also the time when Shi’aism was founded. I e-mail those two sections to wikipedia and asked them to read it and tell me if they think the paragraphs are written from a Shi’a POV. So I am just waiting for their reply. I they say no, then I am just going to repost the two sections under Caliphate section of Imam Ali AS’s page and if they say that they think those paragraphs are written from the POV of Shi’as then I am going to write them again and try my best to be neutral and then I will post it.

<p>Events may be <i>important</i>, but they won't necessarily be discussed in great detail in the earliest histories. In Islamic history, the detail is often added later, by people who want to make a good story out of it. WP cannot retail those stories as historical fact. Salman, you aren't in the US to study history, but if you're going to try to write it, you're going to have to play by the rules of the historical profession. How about reading Tabari and Baladhuri, rather than relying on Shi'a websites?</p>
<p>I should also add that discussing a few of the events in Ali's life in excruciating detail and leaving the rest as generalities is bad writing, and it's boring to boot. You are not going to attract anyone to Ali, or to Shi'a Islam, with bad writing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 16:28, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It has been proven that Ali killed thousands of iranians that stood in his way, well you have to assume good faith, they probably deserved it for not forgetting about their language and culuture and converting to islam.

Its ok tho, it was not only him, almost every arab including the Imams that walked in persia in the time of the conquest has killed some persians and have had some persian wifes. So the shias don't have to worry about getting all the credit. Ironically it was the Caliphes that limited the amount of persian wifes an arab citizen could have, and if they had not done so there would be no persian women left after a few generations, so you have to give them some credit for thinking about the future. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpahbod_8cce.html" title="User:Spahbod">Spahbod</a> 22:22, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

See <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a>. This will create in-text links which are small and can reference a book and page number. Any time a Hadith is mentioned, or any fact about Ali's life, there should be a footnote to a reputable source. Undocumented Hadiths have virtually destroyed Islam, and people have created rumors which are spread as if they are of divine origin. If you can't find a good source of hadiths, not in website form, then they should not be mentioned and they should be t reated as false.</dd>

The websites you add are not good sources. If you find a source which uses (PBUH) and other honorifics, or refers to Ali as "his holiness Ali", then it has a bias and is not an academic source. You also deleted some of the 'uncited' tags without inserting anything. Al-Balagh does not appear to be a good source. Their website says nothing about who they are or where they get information.

<dd>the first narration is not directly related to this article, i am sure it's already present in other more relevant articles. the narration itself is fine although there are differences in wording as well as differences in context. the second narration is differed over according to minhaaj as-sunnah, some call it mash'oor and others not. the context is again also differed over, i.e. when he said it and what it was in relation to. the third narration i did not manage to find in al-musnad, and there is reasonable basis on which to consider it unsound until tasheeh is made. regardless, the sources you are giving for the actual narrative and contextualisation in the article are not reliable. you cannot present ahadeeth (which may or may not be sound) and then contextualise it yourself or through weak narrations. if you want to discuss this further, please use the user talk pages. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 06:17, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>with all due respect i think you are not understanding the issue. the narration/event of ghadir is mutawaatir but there are significant (and no, they are <b>not</b> minor) differences in the matn of the hadeeth, and so certain parts of the event are known to not reach that level of tawatur. if you do not understand mustalah al-hadeeth, you will not understand how a narration can be sound while certain extentions or variations will be unsound, or how certain parts of a narration will be mutawaatir while other extensions considered mawdoo'. there is no proof whatsoever that each and every person quoted was talking about the exact same matn, and there is reasonable evidence to show that certain areas are disputed. furthermore, shi'ite polemic sites are not independantly reliable sources unless they are stating what shi'ites believe. their words cannot be taken as fact. please review <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. it <i>is</i> the requirement of editors to ensure that the authority speaking on a matter is relevant, suitable, and reliable. we cannot unquestioningly accept the narrative of a website known for misinformation. quoting sunni texts does not matter at all because it has not been shown that they all report the exact same matn as shi'i sources report. please understand this. thanks. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 07:09, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>appreciating you for your valuable information, I disagree with you in some cases. 1- Shiite sites are reliable not only as Shiite POV, if they quote Sunni Hadiths in that case too. 2- I think we can find some quotations in the Ghadir sermon which almost all sources have narrated it with minor differences or at least we can put some part of it without quotation mark on the basis of Sunni and Shiite narrations. 3- We can put some parts with lower reliability and say what sources narrate it. Also we mention this part is less credible among Muslims or just credible between Shiites. 4- At the end if you want to help to edit this article write your favorite edition here.--<a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">Sa.vakilian</a> 07:33, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>only shi'ites tend to regard ghadeer to be <i>extremely</i> significant to the life of '<a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> because according to their versions it has certain implications. however, we already have the other article where all the versions can be mentioned. it is not approprate to replicate that all here as per WP:NPOV (undue weight). i would endorse a brief narrative of ghadeer containing a version which is acceptable to all. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 07:44, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>presenting an iraani press for a topic like this does not help the issue at all. we have already discussed the issue of tawatur (ad nauseum) and how the event and much of the speech is agreed upon but certain parts are considered either fabricated, unsound or not to the level of tawatur according to muhaddithoon. we have already discussed regarding the book of adh-dhahabi. it is not even mentioned on mainstream websites: whereas all of dhahabi's books are well known, printed in many editions by various presses and are traceable to him.</dd>

<dd>this is what i propose: i think what we should focus on is working on a narrative which we both find acceptable. i have no problem with the mawla narration being included in the narrative. give me a bit of time and i will propose a version and then we can work on the issues from there. how does that sound? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 14:58, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>if you think all of this has just been about the mawla phrase then you have misunderstood the issue entirely. the mawla issue is disputed over but i think it merits mention as there are credible sources saying it is sound. <i>however</i>, the context of it and the general narrative you proposed in the article is not currently acceptable due to its one-sided POV. certain parts are either irrelevant or generally highly dubious such as the passage afterward about ba'yah and 'umar's reported congratulation (as said before, i did not find it in al-musnad and it requires the relevant tasheeh) which is only found on non-reliable shi'ite websites and not considered to be authentic by sunnis. that passage of itself does not merit mention IMO, but give me some time to propose a slightly altered version. is that ok with you or not? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:16, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
