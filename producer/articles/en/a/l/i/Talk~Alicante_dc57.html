<p>The city of Alacant/Alicante has two official names. Alacant is the original Catalan one. The Spanish name Alicante was given by Franco. During this time Catalan language was interdicted. All villages got Spanish names and even family names were re-named. After death of the dictator the city became Alacant again but the Spanish name stayed official as a second hand name. Habitants of Alacant prefer the Catalan name because their mother tongue is Catalan. Because of this reasons, we re-named the German article in Alacant. You should re-name the English article, too. Best wishes Hanno Meissner</p>
<dl>
<dd>In en:wiki, with few exceptions, we use the name with which English speakers are most familiar, e.g. <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a>, not Firenze, although we mention other names in the beginning of the article. The name by which this town is known in English is Alicante. - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">Montréalais</a> 21:06, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, but in this case Alicante is not the English name for Alacant like Florence for Firence (in German we call it Florenz). Alicante is a name that was given by a dictator to supress Catalan inhabitants. Before the World War 2, only a small number of people went to Spain for their holidays so only a few people knew Alacant. After war more people visited Spain and during this time the official name was Alicante. Because of this, people in England got to know the city as Alicante. In the German Wikipedia we have a REDIRECT-connection from Alicante to Alacant. On this way elder people can find the article as Alicante and young people accustom to the name Alacant and get to know the city as Alacant. I think It's better. We shouldn't use names given by a dictator like Franco any more. We should forget them. Or dou you still know Litzmannstadt (it's the name Hitler gave to the Polish city of Lodz)? We should make the real names more popular. Best regards, Hanno Meissner</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that it would be preferable if English speakers <i>would</i> call it Alacant. However, we do not have the authority as encyclopedists to effect that change. There is some precedent for preferring a less well known title due to an older title's offensiveness, but as far as I can tell, that is only when the less well known title is still widely known. I'm prepared to debate the question, however. - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">Montréalais</a> 05:58, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you! I think it's an important point. Best wishes, Hanno Meissner</p>
<p><b>To Hanno Meisner</b></p>
<p><i>Habitants of Alacant prefer the Catalan name because their mother tongue is Catalan</i></p>
<p><b>Alicante</b> has got 316,178 inhabitants, 10% are from other countries likes Argentina, Ecuador and Chili. Other 90% are from Spain. Spanish alicantinian name "Alicante" his city because they speak spanish in 85%-90%. Only 10% of the spanish population of Alicante speak catalan. You can see the dates in www.gva.es or in other social studes. And the name in spanish isn't from Franco, it exist at 15th century, is so old than the catalan name. <i>From an alicantinian.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm agree whith this alicantinian. I'm an <i><b>alacantinian</b></i> Catalan-speaker, and the Catalan name of Alacant is older as its Spanish name, Alicante. But I'm not agree about the 10% of the population speaks catalan, it must be more exactly explained: the 10% speaks <i>commonly</i> catalan, but the catalan comprehension language is 85% of the population, and the 70% of the population knows speaks Catalan as billingual. By another subject, the name of Alacant cames from the arabic name of <i>Medina Laqant</i>, wich means "Lighting City" taked from the latin name <i>Lukentum</i>, and itselves taked from phoenician name of <i>Akra Leuka</i>. But the arabic population from Alacant (from 8th to 13th century) called it commonly as <i>al-Laqant</i>, wich means "the lighting", and when Catalan and Aragonese christians arrived in 13th century, changed the name to <i>Alacant</i>, Catalan name gave by the King James I "the Conqueror" of Aragon, in his own chronicles book <i>Llibre dels Fets</i> ("Book of facts"). But Alacant was ofered to the King Alfonso X "the learned" of Castille, who changed the name to <i>Villa Laqant</i>. Around 50 years after of it, Alacant returned to Aragonese dominion, under the Kingdom of Valencia. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanot_ef86.html" title="User:Joanot">Martorell</a> 11:17, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is not the same thing a language is able to speak that to speak it habitually. That great people in Alicante can speak Valencian it does not want to say that it is his language like your and I we can write in English but it is not our language either.</p>
<p>Anyhow the numbers that you give are not correct. According to the study of the Town hall of Alicante that can turn in <a href="http://www.alicante-ayto.es/ompv/home.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alicante-ayto.es/ompv/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alicante-ayto.es/ompv/home.html</a> It is not a 85 % the one that the Catalan understands, It is 81 %. And it is not 70 % those who can speak it, but only 28 %. In the city of Alicante, which is about that one speaks in this article, the majority of the people speaks Spanish, we like it or not, and there is in use more the name "Alicante" than "Alacant". It is not necessary to confuse what we would like with the reality.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're in truth. I would apologize for the mistaken that I've done. I probably was confused with another survey. Altough the catalan language was forbiden in Alacant until year 1975, it's gainning in more and more speakers since 1986. From the same study you give below, let's to see the table of percentages:</dd>

<p>It's clear there are an important recovering of catalan-speakers group in Alacant, and the latest data from the <i>Instituto Nacional de Estadística</i> of year 2003, gives the percentage of alacantinian catalan-speaker the 33% of alacantinian population.</p>
<p>And about the name, both name are widely known, and both are also official in the law here in Spain. It's meaning that in the maps edited in Spain by the Administation it's obligatory to use both names, in any language used. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanot_ef86.html" title="User:Joanot">Martorell</a> 23:16, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>VALENCIAN has not been spoken in Alicante for more than 60 years even before Francos times Valencian had disapered as a family language from the homes of Alicante except in some outsirks suburbs. Nowaydays anyone speaks in social life valencian you can only hear it very ocasssionaly when the people from nearby villages go for shopping at the weekends in high street but these people don't life in the city.Family use is only betweeen families coming fron valencian speaking towns but never between true Alicantinosa and it's use can not be more that 5-10%. About the figures that you have just given are not an expresion of the reality. It is true that the people have a general knowledge of valencian but it is because is compulsory to stady it at school or to became a civil servant even though is not spoken in the city more than english. We also watch the valencian chanel canal 9 which is broadcast in valencian and hear the valencian language in nearby towns like MUTXAMEL,CAMPELLO,LA VILA JOIOSA OR CASTALLA thats the reason because 22 speak it and 56 understands it but it doesn't mean that we use it as a every day language we also understand english but it doest't imply that we use it with our family or friends to speak each other.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE NAME ALICANTE "INVENTED" FOR FRANCO WAS THE NAME USE FOR EVERYONE TO CALL THE CITY AROUND 1940 BECAUSE AT THAT TIME ALICANTE WAS ALREADY SPANISH SPEAKING.this name is very old and it come up in Novels like Rob Roy by Walter Scott written at the begining of the XIX century. Just check it before telling lies.</p>
<p>In the web page of Alicante council www.alicante.es you can find objective information about the decline of the valencian language in Alicante. Summing up</p>
<p>1.Around 1880 it had disapered in the center and west of the city and the middle class didn't speak it anymore</p>
<p>2. Around 1940 had already disapered in the whole city</p>
<p>3. 2004 Valencian language is disapering as a living languaguage from san Vicente ,San Joan, Mutxmel y Campello where is still spoken but be sure that not for a long time as a result of his phisical union with Alicante.</p>
<p>Nowdays the valencian dictatorship impose us to stady valencian which used to be spoken here one hundred years ago but we dont't like to look back to the past we just look to the future and the freedom to stady in our mother toungue: SPANISH</p>
<hr />
<p>I would like to point out to the person above that the data you use cannot be right. I am not the one to refuse a scientific study (to which I havent looked at)but i can tell that until the spanish civil war the common language spoken in Alicante was catalan. My 100 year-old grandmother, who is spanish-speaking as she is from Melilla, do not know anything about stats, languages and all that stuff, however, when she tells stories (in spanish) from the times she was a child, she always turns to catalan when reproducing conversations. Its so significant, but if you wish real data, there is a book called "Alacant:la llengua interrompuda" written by Brauli Montoya, that deals with all that you are concerned. The author states that the real turning point was the civil war, after which catalan language was repressed. Un d'Alacant</p>
<p>I remind you that I am also imposed spanish not only as a simple subject at the school, but also as the only language of study in uni and college. Be a little tolerant towards your neighbours.</p>

Hello Anonymous! Valencian isn't a seperate language but a Catalan dialect. All other statements made by Spanish speaking people are politicals motivated. Centralists (an Spanish nationalists) fear of a too large Catalan population (8 mio). So they divide it in Catalans and Valencians. I think you aren't right that the language of the future will be Spanish in Alacant/Alicante. The Catalan speaking regions get more and more economic power. Today, Spanish speaking regions are dependent of Catalan speaking regions. Because of this economic power the Catalan language will get more and more power in the whole country as well. If the government in Madrid wants to keep Spain united for the future they'll have to grant the Catalan language a more powerful status on the national level than today. Maybe, in about twenty years, Spain will be constituted like Swiss as a country with different equal languages. I cannot look to future but I could imagine such a development. I am from Germany and because of this I am a neutral observer of the political situation in Spain. I'm sure that these points are very emocional an hard to accept for a Spanish speaking person like you. But please realize reality. Spain is a multi-ethnic country and not a homogeneous nation state Franco liked it to be. Every attempt to change these circumstances will lead to the collapse of the Spanish state. You should better be proud of the cultural wealthiness of your country and not deny it. I like Spain with all its languages: Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Basque. Best wishes from Germany!

<p>There is no need for a template about Alacant/Alicante. This does not fit within the way wikipedia is designed. Alacant needs to be a redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicante.html" title="Alicante">Alicante</a>. The article on Alicante is sufficient.

<dd>"I haven't said <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Google test</a> is the ultimate one, but it is certainly a rather fair one especially when it turns out that it reveals a 10,200,000 / 730,000 ratio.

I don't know why it gives this difference. Anyway, I have understood finally the troubles about using this template, especially about the talk pages. Ok. I'm sorry, I only wanted to give a solution to cities with more than one official name wich wouldn't have any preferencial use. Because if there aren't any English name for a city, why to use the most used name? This question is specially focused in the case of cities where exists an own language (in adding of the language's State), then it would be more closed to common sense using its name in its own language. It's the case of Alicante, a Spanish name, but Alacant is its name in its own language. Thanks and, again, sorry about the template, and about my poor English. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanot_ef86.html" title="User:Joanot">Martorell</a> 08:24, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second, legally, in Spain there are two laws that states the official term of Alacant as "Alacant/Alicante", one of these laws, a valencian autonomous law, says that at Alacant there is a linguistic predominance of Valencian Catalan over the Castillian Spanish (see <a href="http://www.gva.es/cidaj/cas/c-normas/4-1983.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gva.es/cidaj/cas/c-normas/4-1983.htm" rel="nofollow">Law about using and teching of Valencian</a> in Spanish, at the Title V, and article 35). The other law, a Spanish state law, states that the official names of cities on autonomous lands where there are more than one official language, it must respect the autonomous laws about linguistic guidelines. And about it, the Alacant City Council has accorded the official name in its bilingual form, so according both laws, the official name is "Alacant/Alicante", first Alacant in its order because its legal linguistic predominance. In its case, if it's not proper about using separate both terms througt a template, why not about to rename the article as "Alacant/Alicante"?. In the body text both names would be used randomized.</dd>

<dd>I'm trying to find this solution about no preferential use of any of both term, because it would be really an <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanot_ef86.html" title="User:Joanot">Martorell</a> 09:14, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Using one name instead of another in the English wikipedia does not abate the local legality of the latter. See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_convention_b251.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming convention">Wikipedia:Naming convention</a>:

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/l/i/Talk%7EAlicante_dc57.html" title="Edit section: Airport link">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Airport link</span></h2>
<p>Changed the link to the airport to the offical one as the one there was mainly an advertisement for cheap flights and car rental.</p>
<p>The real figures are that in the city of ALICANTE Valenciano is not spoken nowdays,only in the norther areas from PAIS ALICANTINO-ALICANTE'S LANDS- close to the border with Land of Valencia the Valenciano language is still spoken in some villiages.</p>
<pre>
The valencian goverment which rules EL PAIS ALICANTINO impose systematicaly the languages at schools and is compulsory to become a civil servant.If you go for example to Orihuela Costa you will hear only english and if you go to the city of Orihuela spanish but to hear valenciano the best place is the premises from left wind parties which here are control by catalan and valenciano bankers.
</pre>
<p>The imposition of Valenciano is an important tool to control the wealthy lands from ALICANTE where we pay very high taxes to Valencia and the pro catalan goverment which happens to be located in MADRID, all this money go straigh away to the pockets of the valencian and catalan rulling class and we recive nothing not even water which we need so urgently to go on growing.</p>
<p>And national movement of liberation from ALICANTE'S LANDS -PAIS ALICANTINO-is required, the english speaking comunity from Costa Blanca will be very hapy to join it because we suffer the opression from the Valencia goverment the only get the money so as to build their PALAUS at Valencia and they give us nothing.not even water, roads or a decent police service.</p>
