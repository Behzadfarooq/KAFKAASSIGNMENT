<p>Thanks for the info regarding journaling in Mac OS X Server in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComparison_of_operating_systems_a168.html" title="Talk:Comparison of operating systems">Talk:Comparison of operating systems</a>. I had seen a couple of sources suggest that the journaling feature would work with any filesystem, but I also saw some posts from BSD developers expressing skepticism that journaling could be done in the VFS without lots of help from the filesystem, and I couldn't find any actual Apple product pages willing to claim support for it on anything but HFS+, so that's why I summed up my findings as "maybe"&#160;:) . FWIW, I ran into the problem while researching for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_file_systems.html" title="Comparison of file systems">Comparison of file systems</a>, where it's more on-topic. (Actually I ran into a couple of these "theory vs. practice" problems, most amusingly when I noticed that ReiserFS claims a maximum file size of 1<a href="../../../e/x/a/Exabyte.html" title="Exabyte">EB</a> when it only allows volumes as large as 16TB.. their FAQ seems to only grudgingly acknowledge the existence of other practical limits on file size<a href="http://www.namesys.com/faq.html#reiserfsspecs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.namesys.com/faq.html#reiserfsspecs" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. And I'm suspicious that the NTFS claim of 16EB limits for both files and volumes might be just a <i>tad</i> on the optimistic/theoretical side.) <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESaucepan_785f.html" title="User:Saucepan">Saucepan</a> 20:48, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know you don't have anything to do with the edit war. Neither do I. I'm perfectly neutral. We simply have a difference of opinion. I don't think it matters who the guy works for, nor does it matter that he is planning to sell his OS one day. When he <b>does</b> sell it, that will be notable. Now, my opinion might make me a <i>fucking idiot</i> in your books, but it's what it is. In any case, I didn't revert your edits. I edited what you added. Isn't that how it works here?<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 22:55, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why are his sales plans notable? Why are you shilling for him? It's obvious why his team's doing it but I can't understand what you're getting out of it.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:11, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mate, the thing is, encyclopaedias can have a paragraph or ten pages about a person. It depends what they've done. Szeleney has made a hobby OS and now he's trying to sell it. That's of some interest but it doesn't merit his fucking life story! Dude, this is perilously close to my writing a page for myself in which I tell you that I'm trying to sell a novel. Are you not getting that? The guy is nobody much at present. Don't waste your time or energy stressing out over this thing. Move on and put yourself to better use. The page as I had it was a good compromise. It has some detail and the links that you put in. Let's leave it at that.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 00:03, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I agree that mentioning Mark Maifret should be happening in the article, I seriously question whether the paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Critics have claimed that security fixes take too long to be released after discovery of the problems, and that the problems are not always completely fixed. After Microsoft released patches to close 20 holes in their general operating system in February 2003, Marc Maifrett of <a href="../../../e/e/y/EEye_Digital_Security_1933.html" title="EEye Digital Security">eEye Digital Security</a> stated that "If it really took them that long technically to make (and test) the fix, then they have other problems.

</dl>
<p>Should even be in the article at all. Shouldn't that be in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> article? It's a pretty general comment about all of the patches they released for their <i>general operating system</i>, not just Internet Explorer, and the article is about Internet Explorer after all.

<p>Hi, I wanted to understand this some more. I can understand that if we have an article A, and 4 redirects A0-A3, and 1/4 of each of the articles that refer to A do so via redir A0 (repeat), then the ranking is split 4 ways (among A0-A3). What happens if all the links go direct to A, though - does it have any effect then?

<dl>
<dd>Well, links to redirects don't bother me so much, because, as you point out, a 'bot can fix them. The <b>far bigger</b> problem is people who link to a disambiguation page, and never bother to click on their links to see if they really link to the thing they intended to link to. A 'bot <b>can't</b> fix those. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:02, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lately you've been "improving" pages which make reference to Arran. The trouble is, you haven't been looking closely enough. I've just repaired an error you introduced at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arable_land.html" title="Arable land">Arable_land</a>, hopefully while leaving your intention clear. The thing is, the original poster hadn't confused Scotland and Ireland, he'd made a simple typo as between Aran and Arran (there's the Gaelic for you; and there's even more scope for confusion as between Aran island and the Aran islands further south, which I've carefully left ambiguous).</p>
<p>Anyway, would you care to go over your other recent corrections and see if you've installed any other misunderstandings like this?</p>
<p>At the risk of teaching you to suck eggs, you've moved some single central references to the points of the links, which will make it harder to maintain each of them (as we're now seeing - I'm not trotting after everywhere you've been), and also means that the individual places have more detail level distraction. I think it's working against the spirit of a proper reference site, but I'll leave you to think about the proper level to aim at. I'm sure you already know the deep copy problems you're bringing in here.</p>
<p>I hope that isn't too much in your face. PML (half Scottish and half Irish, so aware of some of these issues).</p>

<p>I am sorry but I need specific info as to what to click on to start the Disambiguation page for the term called False Friends. There appear to be multiple meanings.</p>

<p>Alistair, I do not appreciate immature, bordering-on-rude, little messages. I have been making edits for around a year now and had never seen the point of setting up a User ID. Your cheeky comments the other day, suggesting that as an anonymous user, my edits were somehow less "worthy", prompted me to set up this ID. In answer to your accusation that 'Considered' is a "sockpuppet", I cannot comment as I have no idea what you mean, however I resent the suggestion that my conduct has been less than honourable. Please stop acting like an immature little child and credit others with more maturity than you obviously credit yourself.</p>
<p>And on the subject of whether or not the UK is a country, I actually don't have a particularly strong opinion either way. My issue, however, is one of "NEUTRALITY". Do you understand the concept of NPOV? Whether you (or I) consider the UK as being a country is really beside the point.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact me again, please at least try to maintain an "adult composure" ... I do not appreciate snide, little suggestions from an apparently intelligent individual who should know better.</p>

<p>Alistair, I have had a good look around on the net regarding BHO's, and although they appear to manifest as spyware in some cases, I can't see how they can silently install themselves from websites. The only examples I have found of malware in the form of BHO's have been DLL's that have installed as part of other, downloaded software. Do you have any examples of BHO's self-installing from websites? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 20:30, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I challenged the apparent BeOS developer, who just deleted my challenge from his talk page within minutes. He claims to have developed StyledEdit, which was in fact developed by Hiroshi Lockheimer.... He's not in the credits, from PR2 to R5.1</p>
<p>Ah well. Clueless newbies to an OS, eh?</p>

<p>Apparently BeOS is based off MINIX, the Hobbit BeBox could run BeOS, and 4 uncredited students rewrote StyledEdit in DR7. Riiiight. If he changes to 1994 again, feel very, VERY justified in going back to 1990. <a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 01:53, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alistair, I would have to agree with the suggestion that it would be best to merge the two articles into <b>Far Eastern Air Transport Corporation</b> for different reasons.</p>
<p>As an Australian, <i>Far Eastern Air Transport</i> would mean the subject of Airline legal battles etc. between Qantas, Singapore, Air New Zealand, China Air, etc. Air transport is a common news item here. Also I think the full title looks professional. I'd also immediately support if you could amend.--<a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaeron_489a.html" title="User:Daeron">Daeron</a> 06:35, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tweaked a number of the mods you made to links for Jubal Early, but since I got only the ones in my watchlist, you may wish to duplicate this elsewhere. Histories of the Civil War almost never refer to the guy using his middle name. They sometimes say Jubal A. Early. The reason his page got named that [prior to your disambiguation, which was a good thing] was that some guy kept nuking edits to the original page and he started branching out and duplicating older versions with the longer name.</p>
