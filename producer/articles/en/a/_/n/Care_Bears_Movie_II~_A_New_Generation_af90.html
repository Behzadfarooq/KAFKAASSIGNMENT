<p>True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse are caretakers of the young Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins aboard the Cloud Clipper. As they are sailing along, a storm starts, and a red <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">dragon</a> blocks them in their way. But then, a rainbow takes them up to the sky, and, assisted by the Great Wishing Star, they begin the Kingdom of Caring. The Star soon gives the Bears and Cousins their tummy symbols.</p>
<p>Some time later, True Heart Bear, with stowaway Swift Heart Rabbit inside her bag, embarks on the Bears' first Caring Mission. Landing at a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp.html" title="Camp">campsite</a> on Earth, she meets a camper named Christy who feels she cannot do anything as well as her lead competitor, the boastful Camp Champ, save for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marbles.html" title="Marbles">marbles</a>. She attempts to run away from the site, and her friends Dawn and John follow suit. But the latter two end up being a little lost, until True Heart invites them both to come and take care of the babies back at the Kingdom of Caring.</p>
<p>When they arrive, True Heart decides to return to Earth to help Christy. A bell tolls from the Caring Meter; she and Noble Heart suggest that Dark Heart (the dragon they faced earlier on) has returned, and they will both try to defeat him again should he really strike once more. Dawn and John should never find out who he is, the two declare, and they insist that their human friends now <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babysitting.html" title="Babysitting">baby-sit</a> the orphan Cubs.</p>

Dark Heart, the film's villain.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the woods near camp, Christy meets Dark Heart (disguised in his human form), whom she falls unwittingly a victim to, and is later used by the villain as a tool to help him take out his evil deeds and destroy the Kingdom of Caring. He gives his apprentice the opportunity to do what she never could do before, even <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartwheel.html" title="Cartwheel">cartwheels</a>, but she has to do him a favour to pay him back: to capture every single Care Bear inside his magic red bag, and forever trap them all in some secret place. Once he has fulfilled the task, he will leave Christy alone.</p>
<p>Already aware of whom they will face, True and Noble move the Cubs to two new places: growing up, the Bears will reside in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Care-a-lot" class="extiw" title="wikt:Care-a-lot">Care-a-lot</a> and the Cousins will live in the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Forest_of_Feelings" class="extiw" title="wikt:Forest_of_Feelings">Forest of Feelings</a>. Meanwhile, without the Bears knowing it, Dark Heart is planning to capture the whole Family, from within his secret <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave.html" title="Cave">cave</a> beneath the camp, located inside an outhouse at the site. As he speeds off to Care-a-lot, Christy is showing off her new winning abilities before the other campers, posing as the new "Camp Champ".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Care Bear Family is getting ready to surprise True and Noble home from another mission. But then the Caring Meter goes awry, and Dark Heart has arrived to ruin their preparation. The Care Bears believe he is trying to have fun, but the Star and Heart Buddies are aware of his plan and drive him off. Soon after he stumbles near the Family, he morphs into his true form in front of them, a raging red cloud with glaring pink eyes. When he goes away, thanks to the Stare, True and Noble let the other Family members take care of caring while they are both gone to search for the villain.</p>
<p>Then the rest of the Care Bear Family spots Christy in a canoe without paddles in a lake. They come down to Earth to her rescue, but Dark Heart thwarts their operation, and soon takes some of the Bears along with him. Tenderheart, Brave Heart and Grumpy figure out that Dark Heart has made the Family disappear that way, and Christy has partnered with the villain. Tenderheart insists a conference be held inside the Hall of Hearts with the remaining Cousins. Joining them later are Friend and Secret Bear, along with Dawn and John.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Right at this moment, there are so few of the Family members left, all thanks to the alliance of Christy and Dark Heart. Upon the arrival of Christy's friends and their saviours, the Family, Cheer Bear included, finds new hope in getting rid of their villain.</p>
<p>Dark Heart's influence makes the campers ruin the entire place later that night. While Dawn and John help save their fellow camper, while the Family looks for their lost members inside the villain's cave. But Dark Heart himself catches them and soon put them in cages.</p>
<p>Finding Christy, Dawn and John tell her that, with their help, things will be back to normal soon, once they convince Dark Heart to stop hurting the Care Bear Family. But she refuses their offer; it has been too late for her to get back to what she was before. Only when she reveals the damage she has done with her villain has she finally paid him back. All three, as friends, set off to rescue the Family.</p>
<p>Dark Heart foils the Bears' plan to get his <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key.html" title="Key">key</a> and unlock the cages, and puts the other Bears and Cousins inside big <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby.html" title="Ruby">rubies</a>. True, Noble and the three campers have only arrived to see the Family's fate. But, for Christy, her bargain with Dark Heart has ended, thus making it hard to put his wrath to an end. She insists Dark Heart free the Family out of their prison, and at once he takes away her abilities for good.</p>
<p>Still, because Christy saved him earlier, he warns her to "Run and save herself" from the evil he is about to do. In an attempt to save everyone else, True and Noble use their Stare once more on his cloud, but while they do so, Christy is struck by a bolt of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning.html" title="Lightning">lightning</a> coming from it.</p>
<p>Using her marble-throwing skills, Christy lets down, with one of her marbles, a chandelier that has the rubies. After it crashes down, all of them return in action, joining True and Noble in the Stare.</p>
<p>As Dark Heart continues to rain down lightning, he suddenly notices that Christy has been hit and now lies motionless. Dark Heart's rage stops, and, transforming himself into a boy for the last time, he comes down to her, remorseful for what he has done. He implores the Care Bears to help "...bring her back from where I (he) sent her!", but they believe that there is nothing they can do.</p>
<p>Dark Heart grows angry, asking them what good all their love and caring is if it cannot save Christy. The bears listen, and implore anyone (presumably the audience) who cares to chant "I care!" with them. Soon, Dark Heart himself chants as well, and within a few moments, Christy is brought back to life. Cheers from the group are short-lived, for soon after, the quickly-collapsing cave is rid of all its bad reputation and vanishes altogether before turning back into an outhouse.</p>
<p>Overjoyed by the change of their new friend, who once was Dark Heart, everybody runs over to the lake to have a good time with him. Later on, the campers say good-bye to the Bears and Cousins, and the former Dark Heart promises to help make the camp a fairer and better place for campers, now knowing the importance of friendship and being a "Camp Champ" when it comes to being a friend.</p>
