They plan revenge on Walker for his recent brutal assault on Donut. Michael establishes that Walker attends a bar well-known as a police hangout and vows to handle the problem.</p>
<p>Later, Namond, Randy and Dukie express doubts about Michael’s plans for Walker but proceed regardless. Michael does not hesitate. Namond scratches Walker’s car and then lures him into an alley. Michael greets him with a handgun and orders him to turn around and kneel. He takes the ring that Walker is wearing and then splashes him with yellow paint.</p>
<p>Walker later characterizes the incident in the alley as a declaration of gang warfare against the police to his fellow officers. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Officer McNulty</a> is dubious of the story. McNulty finds <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a> hiding out in a diner when he goes for lunch. Bodie explains that the police activity has driven him in doors and McNulty reveals that it is the assault on Walker that has riled the patrol officers. He confides a dislike of Walker to Bodie because of his corrupt actions. McNulty is called away and the two joke together as he leaves.</p>

<p>Reverend Frank Reid and the Reverend recently stopped and searched by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas__Herc__Hauk_8f00.html" title="Thomas &quot;Herc&quot; Hauk">Sergeant Thomas "Herc" Hauk</a> attend a meeting with Mayor <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Carcetti_b001.html" title="Tommy Carcetti">Tommy Carcetti</a> to complain about Herc's actions. They try to persuade Carcetti to introduce a civilian review board for police complaints. Carcetti reminds them that the racial aspects of the incident will not go unexamined with both an African American commissioner and Internal Investigations Division commander. The ministers respond by stating that they believe commissioner <a href="../../../e/r/v/Ervin_Burrell_19c6.html" title="Ervin Burrell">Ervin Burrell</a>’s authority has been limited. Carcetti asks the ministers not to pre-judge the investigation of the complaint and tells them he takes the matter seriously. They leave disappointed but thank the Mayor for keeping an open door. After they are gone <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Wilson_9fe5.html" title="Norman Wilson">Norman Wilson</a> and Carcetti discuss the difficulty of their position. Wilson tells Carcetti that firing Herc will upset the police department but leniency will upset the black political infrastructure.</p>
<p>Colonel <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Cedric Daniels</a> and Assistant State's Attorney <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhonda_Pearlman_0159.html" title="Rhonda Pearlman">Rhonda Pearlman</a> host a meeting with the homicide unit. They ask for suggestions to pass on to the new mayor and state’s attorney. <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_of_The_Wire_de2d.html#Michael_Crutchfield" title="Police of The Wire">Detective Crutchfield</a> suggests improved witness protection and a pay raise, the latter is greeted with much enthusiasm from the other detectives. <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Freamon_2523.html" title="Lester Freamon">Detective Freamon</a> asks for more pro-active investigation and more time for preparation. <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_of_The_Wire_de2d.html#Ed_Norris" title="Police of The Wire">Detective Norris</a> suggests greater investment in lab work and technicians. <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kima_Greggs_8476.html" title="Kima Greggs">Detective Greggs</a> is exhilarated at the prospect of “a new day” but <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Landsman_%28The_Wire%29_9f09.html" title="Jay Landsman (The Wire)">Sergeant Landsman</a> is not drawn in.</p>
<p>Wilson meets with Deputy Commissioner <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rawls_e7a2.html" title="William Rawls">William Rawls</a> and gives him a memo from the mayor asking for community based policing and high end police work. Rawls asks Wilson about firing Burrell. Wilson explains that they do not have the political capital available and links this to the situation with the ministers. Rawls asks if they want Herc fired and Wilson tells him they do not want to interfere with the day to day running of the department. Rawls confirms that they are interested in the perception of the investigation and recommends assigning the task to Daniels as Herc’s new commanding officer.</p>
<p>Rawls meets with Daniels and passes him the investigation. He tells Daniels that in minor cases he can issue a summary judgement or pass the case to a trial board. Daniels is disbelieving when Rawls tells him to do the right thing.</p>
<p>The following morning Carcetti visits the department of public works and tells them to tow an abandoned vehicle that he noticed. He does not offer the location of the vehicle. This galvanizes the department into action. He offers similar instructions to the department of parks and recreation telling them that a constituent called and asked them to clean up a hazardous playground in her area but not giving any location. He repeats the trick at the water department. All three departments initiate a flurry of activity soon afterwards.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Davis_4c47.html" title="Clay Davis">Senator Davis</a> and Burrell play golf and discuss the summary judgement Daniels has issued. Burrell believes the punishment of two weeks extra duty is too lenient for the ministers. Burrell arrogantly suggests that he is the only person who knows how to play the game.</p>
<p>Carcetti has a disappointing budget meeting and learns that it will be difficult to muster the funds he needs to re-energize the police department.</p>
<p>Rawls introduces the policy change to his commanders and is met with pessimism from the patrol division commander. Rawls insists that they follow the Mayor’s orders. Daniels approaches Rawls after the meeting to request reconstituting the Major Crimes Unit under his command in the Criminal Investigations Division. Rawls approves Daniels suggestion. Deputy Commissioner <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Valchek_7483.html" title="Stan Valchek">Stan Valchek</a> tells Rawls that he is smart to support Daniels as he is likely to be the next commissioner. Valchek sees that this is the first time Rawls is aware of Daniels' nomination for commissioner and claims in an amused manner that there is no way for Rawls to become commissioner of the department in the city of Baltimore given it's <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> majority. Rawls finally understands why the delay in firing Burrell has occurred, he sees that Mayor Carcetti is looking for an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> to be commissioner of the department.</p>
<p>Daniels takes the acceptance from Rawls straight to Freamon. He tells him that he wants him to move back to Major Crimes and pick his own squad and lieutenant concluding by telling Freamon that “he is the Major Crimes Unit.” Freamon returns to the Unit headquarters and reviews the subpoenaed evidence that has been collected in his absence. As Freamon looks at the names in the file Carcetti is at a fundraising event with the very same people – <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politicians_of_The_Wire_cca7.html#Andy_Krawczyk" title="Politicians of The Wire">Andy Krawczyk</a>, Ed Bowers, Maurice Webber and Clay Davis.</p>
<p>Carcetti meets with the Western District patrol officers and announces the pay rise along with a change in focus. McNulty is dubious of his commitment to avoiding stat based policing but Carcetti insists that if the current command can not meet his request then he will replace them.</p>
<p>Burrell arrives at the Mayor’s office and Carcetti reluctantly agrees to see him. Burrell tells Carcetti that he does not mind his orders about strategy being countermanded and segues into a disussion about Herc’s punishment. He reveals that Daniels is planning to recommend sensitivity training and tells Carcetti that they will need to be more severe for the ministers. Burrell tells Carcetti that he can find a more convincing reason to fire Herc based on his history in narcotics that will appease the ministers and the rank and file. He tells Carcetti that his greatest asset is his ability to work with a mayor’s needs.</p>
<p>Carcetti meets with the department heads and hears reports of how they have acted on his requests for cleanup. He continues to encourage the public works department by claiming they have not resolved the complaint he received but congratulates the water department head when he reports that all hydrants are capped. He next hears from his budget adviser who has just learned that the school system is running at a 54 million dollar deficit. Carcetti is astounded at the news.</p>

Miss Duquette asks for examples unrelated to the corner and none are forthcoming. She asks for a volunteer for a trust fall exercise. <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_system_of_The_Wire_7762.html#Albert_Stokes" title="School system of The Wire">Albert Stokes</a> declines and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namond_Brice_f5ec.html" title="Namond Brice">Namond</a> reluctantly agrees once the exercise has been explained and Colvin gestures his support.

<p>Namond tells the story about what happened to Officer Walker to Colvin. Colvin tells Namond that he is making good progress and suggests that he is nearly ready to return to normal classes.</p>

The next morning Namond considers cutting his distinctive hair and his mother insists that he do so. He decides that he is still not ready. He also questions <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_level_characters_of_The_Wire_f406.html#Kenard" title="Street level characters of The Wire">Kenard</a> about the appropriateness of his haircut as they work on the corner.

<p>Omar and Renaldo continue to follow Slim Charles and wait for him at an intersection. Renaldo questions the logic of waiting at the same place where they lost him before and Omar reassures him that if he does not return they will start by following from his home the next day. Omar is proven right when Slim drives passed in his SUV. They tail him to a meeting with Proposition Joe. Omar is astounded that Slim is linked with both Marlo and Prop Joe. Renaldo insists he needs a bathroom break and Omar hands him a toilet roll and sends him to an alley.</p>
<p>Omar follows Proposition Joe to a meeting of the New Day Co-Op. He notices Fatface Rick and Marlo arriving and speculates that the Baltimore drug dealers have put all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Omar visits Proposition Joe at his electrical repair store with weapons drawn. He finds him meeting with Cheese and Slim Charles. Omar gives Joe a clock to fix. Omar accuses Joe of lying to him about the card game. He enlists Joe’s help in stealing from Marlo and threatens to inform Marlo of his involvement in the card game robbery if he attempts to double cross him.

He learns about Herc's traffic stop of Chris and Snoop and the discovery of their nailgun.</p>
<p>Bunk and Freamon visit Prez at the school. They explain that they have been to see Randy but as per Prez’s advice he would not talk to them. Bunk tells Prez that he is siding with the criminals and Prez asserts that he is looking out for his kids. Freamon is diplomatic and wishes Prez well. Bunk asks Prez for a little information and Prez reports Randy’s story about telling Lex to meet a girl at the playground.</p>
<p>Bunk and Freamon next visit the playground and search the area. Freamon notices the sealed vacant houses and identifies one door as having newer nails. He tells Bunk that they need a crow bar to open the house.
