<p>The following introduction is reminiscent of the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films:</p>
<p>A long time ago in Point Place, Wisconsin...</p>
<p>That '70s Show</p>
<p>Episode XXV</p>
<p>A New Hope</p>
<p><i>It's a time of upheaval for the Formans. Red's hours have been cut back at the auto parts plant, and his holiday job with "Bargain Bob" is long gone. Kitty struggles to make ends meet. And Eric is in the throes of adolescence...which sucks no matter what decade it is. Am I right? Anyway, right now Eric and his band of rebels are heading for a movie theater in Kenosha...</i></p>
<p>After seeing <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/Star_Wars_Episode_IV%7E_A_New_Hope_1317.html" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i> with the guys Eric sits in the kitchen telling <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Forman_3be9.html" title="Kitty Forman">Kitty</a> &amp; <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurie_Forman_fa50.html" title="Laurie Forman">Laurie</a> how cool it is, when <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Forman_6fb3.html" title="Red Forman">Red</a> comes in exclaiming that the he's going back to working full time at the auto parts plant because Ron Millbank moved back into town to reopen it. Kitty is overjoyed because they were very close to losing the house. Red then tells Eric that David Millbank, Ron's son, is coming to come see him, and Red wants him to act like he's his friend even though he isn't. The gang is hanging out in the basement and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Kelso_57e2.html" title="Michael Kelso">Kelso</a> is trying to get <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Burkhart_adc8.html" title="Jackie Burkhart">Jackie</a> to see Star Wars and he successfully does telling her that she's gotta meet him halfway now that they're back together.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Pinciotti_69f9.html" title="Donna Pinciotti">Donna</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Forman_1e02.html" title="Eric Forman">Eric</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Burkhart_adc8.html" title="Jackie Burkhart">Jackie</a>,<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Kelso_57e2.html" title="Michael Kelso">Kelso</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/z/Fez_%28That_%2770s_Show%29_a0ed.html" title="Fez (That '70s Show)">Fez</a> are in the basement taking about the time he once beat up David. It is now revealed that he had scoliosis and asthma as a kid. Kelso asks Jackie if she wants to go see Star Wars but she doesn't like space. Kelso then says that they have to meet each other halfway if they are going to start their relationship again. They leave and Fez is staying just to spite Eric and Donna. David comes down to see Eric, Donna, and Fez, he is more well built and healthy than anyone else. David takes an immediate interest in Donna telling her how much she's grown and asking about her short stories. Eric gets a little jealous and makes it clear that he and Donna are dating. Kelso is getting something out of the fridge when Laurie starts flirting with him again and asks if he wants to see her appendix scar to which he says he &amp; Jackie are back together but still looks.</p>
<p>David is sitting down reading one of Donna's short stories when she goes to get more but accidentally knocks a soda on him. She gets a towel and towels it up but Eric barges in and asks what is going on. The two begin to argue after David leaves about his intentions. Donna says he's just a friend and Eric says he's hitting on her. Afterwards, the guys are in the basement and Eric says that if he doesn't believe that David and Donna are just friends, she'll think he doesn't trust her. Fez suggest that Eric let David have Donna because "they look so nice together". Hyde says he's a romantic and advises Eric to choke David until his eyes pop out. Eric dismisses this because Donna would be upset at him. Kelso argues that girls like that. Giving the example of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Leia_Organa_9b1b.html" title="Princess Leia Organa">Leia</a> liking <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han</a>. Hyde calls Kelso an idiot because Leia likes Luke because she kissed him in the movie while Kelso states that it was "for luck". Eric then yells at the both of them because he has a "real problem". Fez then repeats what he initially said and Eric punches him.</p>
<p>Eric dreams that he's <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>, inside the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> initially being taught by <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obi_Wan_e593.html" title="Obi Wan">Obi Wan</a> (Red), not listening to him but, instead trying to make his <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber.html" title="Lightsaber">Lightsaber</a> work, causes Red to call him a "Jedi Dumbass". <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Hyde_2f7c.html" title="Steven Hyde">Hyde</a>) and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> come in and Han tells Luke that he saw <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Leia_Organa_9b1b.html" title="Princess Leia Organa">Princess Leia</a> with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> in his <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Fighter_13f3.html" title="TIE Fighter">TIE Fighter</a>. Chewy takes off his mask and it is <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Kelso_57e2.html" title="Michael Kelso">Kelso</a> in a suit. He complains that he isn't Han, but Hyde punches him and Kelso grunts like Chewbacca. The doorbell then rings and Kitty comes in dressed a a fighter pilot vacuuming with <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-D2_552c.html" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>. She answers the door and Darth Vader comes in with two Stormtroopers (<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Burkhart_adc8.html" title="Jackie Burkhart">Jackie</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/z/Fez_%28That_%2770s_Show%29_a0ed.html" title="Fez (That '70s Show)">Fez</a>). They take off their helmets, Jackie says that Eric should join the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Side_e591.html" title="Dark Side">Dark Side</a> and Fez states that they have free food. Princess Leia (<a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Pinciotti_69f9.html" title="Donna Pinciotti">Donna</a>) comes in and says that she and Vader are just friends and that Luke would like him. Vader asks Eric to give hm a chance and then starts Force Chocking him, to which Luke says "Look! Hello, he's choking me with his mind, here. That's, like, yeah. Evil."</p>
<p>In her kitchen, Donna is talking to Jackie. Jackie starts by saying that Kelso realised how much he missed her when they were broken up, and how it was the best thing she ever did. Donna tells Jackie about how she hates that Eric has become such a possessive macho jerk lately, to which Jackie tells her that that's a women's dream. Even Midge agrees before Donna reminds her of the feminist classes and books she's been reading.</p>
<p>Eric goes to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Forman_6fb3.html" title="Red Forman">Red</a> and Bob in the back yard, where they are trimming the hedges and asks Red if he could teach him a couple fighting moves. Bob tells Eric that he could take David because of his scoliosis and asthma. Red tells him to leave David alone because he wants to save his job. Red suggests instead beating up Kelso because he doesn't work for his dad. Eric then adds that he's making moves on Donna, which changes Red's mind. He starts by saying that the bridge of the nose is very vulnerable. Bob puts in the admission that he could hit David with a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjo.html" title="Banjo">Banjo</a>. Red questions first, why a banjo then where he'll get a banjo and Bob says that he's helping because he once say someone being hit with a banjo and that he was defeated easily. Red tells Eric that that is a dirty way of fighting and that he should hit David in the groin. Bob tells Eric that he could do that with a Banjo.</p>
<p>Kelso and Jackie are talking about what they could do that night and Jackie says that if he suggests seeing <i>Star Wars</i> again she'll leave. Kelso then tries using a Jedi <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_Trick_0b3d.html" title="Mind Trick">Mind Trick</a> to get her to go see Star Wars and she tells him he's weird and she's going home. <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurie_Forman_fa50.html" title="Laurie Forman">Laurie</a> is dong laundry behind them and overheard their conversation. She tells Kelso that she thought Star Wars was the greatest film ever and they start to make-out. In the living room, Kitty asks Red where Eric is and Red initially tells her he doesn't know but she pushes him and Red says that he's beating up David because he's been hitting on Donna and that it's no big deal. <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Forman_3be9.html" title="Kitty Forman">Kitty</a> opposes this at first, calling men <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neanderthals.html" title="Neanderthals">Neanderthals</a> but she is then reminded of a time when she and Red were at the beach and a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifeguard.html" title="Lifeguard">lifeguard</a> piched Kitty's bottom. Red beat up the lifeguard and she remembers Red standing over him with his eyes burning with intensity, his sun-tanned muscles gleaming like a bronze god, and is turned on, so they head upstairs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Pinciotti_69f9.html" title="Donna Pinciotti">Donna</a> and David are talking, when <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Forman_1e02.html" title="Eric Forman">Eric</a> tells David that he wants to fight him. Donna gets up and tries to keep Eric from David and tells him that David has no interest in me and that they're just friends. David tells her that he does and he thought listening to her and sharing ideas with her would get her to like him. Donna walks up frustrated that Eric doesn't trust her or respect her. David tells Eric that he's only here because his dad is only opening the plant until they burn off the inventory and starts to walk away. Eric tells him how much his dad is counting on that job and decides to tap him on the shoulder and punch him in the nose. David than stands up and starts breathing in the same way as <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> and tells Eric that he waill pay for that.</p>
<p>Eric goes to tell his dad about the plant but can't when <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Forman_6fb3.html" title="Red Forman">Red</a> is going to celebrate with <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Forman_3be9.html" title="Kitty Forman">Kitty</a> about good fortune. He goes into the living room where he tells Laurie and she says that it might not be the best time to say that she has dropped out of college. Eric is then frustrated because she is their parents' favourite. The parents then go to see <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/Star_Wars_Episode_IV%7E_A_New_Hope_1317.html" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars</a></i> where, during the attack on the Death Star, Bob says that <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke</a> is doomed; Midge asks if it is based on a true story; Kitty recognises <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Earl_Jones_71f2.html" title="James Earl Jones">James Earl Jones</a>'s voice and Red is unimpressed with it and he thinks that Eric is on dope until the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> explodes and Red looks impressed.</p>
