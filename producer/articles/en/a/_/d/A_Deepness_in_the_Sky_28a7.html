<p>The book deals with the discovery of an intelligent <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien</a> species on a planet orbiting the bizarre, appropriately named OnOff star, which spends 215 of every 250 years almost completely dormant, releasing almost no energy. During this period, the planet freezes and its fauna goes into <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernation.html" title="Hibernation">hibernation</a>.</p>
<p>The planet's inhabitants, named "Spiders" by the humans for their resemblance to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arachnid.html" title="Arachnid">arachnids</a>, have reached a stage of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technological_development.html" title="Technological development">technological development</a> very similar to that of Earth's humans in the early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Two human expeditions set out to trade/exploit the situation: the Qeng Ho <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trader.html" title="Trader">traders</a> (pronounced <i>[Cheng Ho]</i>, named after <a href="../../../z/h/e/Zheng_He_6e26.html" title="Zheng He">Zheng He</a> and his expeditions); and the Emergents of the Emergency, an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocratic.html" title="Autocratic">autocratic</a> culture that literally enslaves selected human minds.</p>

</dl>
<p>The Qeng Ho arrive at the On/Off star shortly before the Emergent fleet, several decades before the sun turns on, at which point the Spider civilization will "wake up" and continue its climb into a technological civilization. A reception held by the Emergents doubles as a vector to infect the Qeng Ho with a timed "mindrot" virus. The Emergents time an ambush to take advantage of the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>The Emergents take over, but the mutual losses force them to take the so called "Lurker strategy", in which they monitor and aid the Spiders' technological development, waiting until they build up the massive infrastructure and technological base that the visitors lack but need in order to repair their vessels: they have perforce to work together and wait for the Spider civilization to achieve a greater technological maturity in order to help them refurbish their ships.</p>
<p>The mindrot virus had originally manifested itself on the Emergents' colony world, and they now use it both as a weapon, and as a tool for mental domination. Emergent culture uses mindrot primarily in the form of a variant which technicians can manipulate in order to release <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotoxin.html" title="Neurotoxin">neurotoxins</a> to specific parts of the brain. An active <a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a>-type device triggers changes through <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamagnetic.html" title="Diamagnetic">dia-</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramagnetic.html" title="Paramagnetic">paramagnetic</a> biological molecules. By manipulating the brain in this way, Emergent <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager.html" title="Manager">managers</a> induce a state they call <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperfocus.html" title="Hyperfocus">Focus</a>, in which Focused persons become completely obsessed with a single idea or speciality, essentially turning them into brilliant <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_appliance.html" title="Information appliance">appliances</a>. Many Qeng Ho become Focused against their will, and the Emergents retain the rest of the population under <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_surveillance.html" title="Mass surveillance">mass surveillance</a>, with only a portion of the crew awake and not in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspended_animation.html" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a>. The Qeng Ho trading culture gradually starts to dilute this <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> régime, by demonstrating to the Emergents certain benefits of tolerated and restricted <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a>; the two human cultures merge to some extent over the decades of forced co-operation.</p>
<p>The book discusses some of the problems of trying to maintain an interstellar trading culture without access to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Faster-than-light.html" title="Faster-than-light">superluminal travel</a> or to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superluminal_communication.html" title="Superluminal communication">superluminal communication</a>. Time-measurement details provide an interesting concept in the book: the Qeng Ho measure time primarily in terms of seconds, since the notion of days, months, and years has no usefulness between various star systems. The timekeeping system, uses terms such as <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilosecond.html" title="Kilosecond">kiloseconds</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megasecond.html" title="Megasecond">megaseconds</a>. An interesting feature of the Qeng Ho's computer, and hence, timekeeping, systems is the "programmer archaeologists"<a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/04/0622246" class="external autonumber" title="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/04/0622246" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>: the Qeng Ho are packrats of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer programs</a> and systems, retaining them over millennia, even as far back to the era of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> programs (as implied by one passage mentioning that the fundamental time-keeping system is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_epoch.html" title="Unix epoch">Unix epoch</a>, retained for <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backwards_compatibility.html" title="Backwards compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>. This massive accumulation of data implies that almost any useful program one could want already exists in the Qeng Ho fleet library - hence the need for computer archaeologists to dig up needed programs, work around their peculiarities and bugs, and assemble them into useful constructs.</p>
<p>Only one concrete connection links <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i> with <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep_8cb9.html" title="A Fire Upon the Deep">A Fire Upon the Deep</a></i>: the character of <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pham_Nuwen_a40c.html" title="Pham Nuwen">Pham Nuwen</a>, the "Programmer-at-Arms", who appears in both books. Hints occur about the "zones of thought" mentioned in the earlier book; the story takes place in the Slow Zone, though Vinge does not explain the connections, and the characters in the story remain unaware of the zones' existence. The sun's inexplicably strange behavior, the unusual <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_system.html" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> (with only a solitary planet and several <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a>-sized <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamonds</a>), and the discovery of "<a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavorite.html" title="Cavorite">cavorite</a> mines" on the planet indicate the system originated in the Transcend, though its currently moving outward from the Unthinking Depths. Vinge's characters speculate that the Spiders descend from an ancient star-faring civilization, and that the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antigravity.html" title="Antigravity">antigravity</a> material and other strange artifacts have connections with that civilization. For readers of <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep_8cb9.html" title="A Fire Upon the Deep">A Fire Upon the Deep</a></i>, however, an alternate explanation seems more likely: the OnOff star is a probe sent by some Power to explore the Slow Zone and Unthinking Depths. In <i>Fire</i> when the Countermeasure activates, it draws power from the Tines' sun, which dims temporarily; and in the short story "The Blabber" an <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansible.html" title="Ansible">ansible</a> used in the Slow Zone causes a local star to go out for a short period, even though it should not be able to work at all. This suggests (though Vinge never makes this explicit) that something in the OnOff system (perhaps the massive diamonds) is Transcendent technology that can operate in the Slow Zone when supplied with massive power.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, Pham announces his plans to free all of the Focused in the entire Emergent civilization, and, if surviving that, to embark on a journey to the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Center_73b3.html" title="Galactic Center">center of the galaxy</a> to find the source of these strange artifacts. <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> reveals that he died during this journey, and that one of the god-like Powers re-assembled his body parts and memories to use as a puppet. The later novel also shows that Pham had misidentified the center of the galaxy as the likely source of the artifacts, as the outer portions of the galaxy were the ones with greater technological sophistication.</p>
<p>With this work, Vinge introduces "<a href="../../../l/o/c/Localizer.html" title="Localizer">localizers</a>" to his set of science-fiction concepts. Localizers comprise tiny devices which can contain a simple processor, sensors, and short-range communications. Vinge explores how intelligent control can use <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesh_network.html" title="Mesh network">mesh networking</a> of these devices in ways quite different from those of traditional computer networks, such as supporting.
