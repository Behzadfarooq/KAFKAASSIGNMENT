<p>The title is derived from <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Arnold_c28a.html" title="Matthew Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a>'s poem <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover_Beach_7ec9.html" title="Dover Beach">Dover Beach</a>. This excerpt of the poem appears at the beginning of the book:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p><i>And we are here as on a darkling plain<br />
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight<br />
Where ignorant armies clash by night.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">â€“ <cite style="font-style:normal;"><a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Arnold_c28a.html" title="Matthew Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> , <i><a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover_Beach_7ec9.html" title="Dover Beach">Dover Beach</a></i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This relates to the novel in several ways. The characters are indeed swept about, often against their will, by the "ignorant armies" of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Storm_3416.html" title="Green Storm">Green Storm</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>, on the "darkling plains" of the Great Hunting Ground.</p>
<p>Reeve references his choice of title himself towards the end of the book; the character <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimrod_Pennyroyal_95ca.html" title="Nimrod Pennyroyal">Nimrod Pennyroyal</a> writes a book within a book titled "Ignorant Armies."</p>

<p>Set six months after the events on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wren_Natsworthy_a627.html" title="Wren Natsworthy">Wren Natsworthy</a> and her father <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Natsworthy_b424.html" title="Tom Natsworthy">Tom Natsworthy</a> have taken to the skies in their airship, the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Haniver_db22.html" title="Jenny Haniver">Jenny Haniver</a>. After the apparent death of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalker_Fang_58ff.html" title="Stalker Fang">Stalker Fang</a> at the end of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infernal_Devices_6d1a.html" title="Infernal Devices">Infernal Devices</a>, General Naga has seized command of the Green Storm and has signed a peace treaty between the Green Storm and the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>, ushering in a new era of peace and trade.</p>
<p>Whilst Wren is enjoying life as an aviatrix, Tom misses Hester, and has been informed by a doctor that his weak heart means he only has a few years left to live. Meanwhile, the Lost Boy Fishcake is secretly repairing the Stalker Fang, coming to regard her as the mother he never had.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_Ngoni_da40.html" title="Theo Ngoni">Theo Ngoni</a> travels home to Zagwa and foils an attempt to murder the now Oenone Naga, General Naga's wife. Oenone suspects that the murder attempt was organised by factions in the Green Storm still loyal to the Stalker Fang. Theo is made commander of an airship that will secretly deliver Lady Naga back home to Batmunkh Gompa. While flying across the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahara_Desert_0002.html" title="Sahara Desert">Sahara Desert</a> it is revealed that one of Oenone's retinue is really Cynthia Twite, a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_agent.html" title="Secret agent">secret agent</a> for the Stalker Fang first encountered in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infernal_Devices_6d1a.html" title="Infernal Devices">Infernal Devices</a>. After murdering the pilot, Twite attempts to kill Naga but is foiled by Theo. She escapes from the airship before a bomb she planted explodes. Theo and Oenone are assumed dead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tom and Wren encounter a face from the past - Clytie Potts, a historian from London who Tom had assumed perished on the night MEDUSA exploded. She goes by a different name and claims to have never met Tom, but he is unsatsified and follows her to the cities of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>. Manchester has recently arrived and is encouraging the German cities to abandon the peace treaty and attack the Green Storm again. Here they also encounter Professor Pennyroyal, who assures them that nobody could have survived the destruction of MEDUSA. A young German soldier named Wolf Kobold, however, claims to have seen Potts' airship flying east towards the ruins of London. He tells them of how he was once forced to crash-land in London and witnessed strange activity. Wolf suspects there are survivors living in the ruins of London, who are working on something secret. Tom and Wren agree to travel with him in his predator suburb Harrowbarrow to investigate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hester_Shaw_cdaa.html" title="Hester Shaw">Hester Shaw</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrike.html" title="Shrike">Shrike</a> have been travelling the Sahara for six months, where they have a chance encounter with Theo. Following the crash, he and Oenone were taken as slaves by a desert town. Hester rescues Theo and shoots several guards. They escape onboard Hester and Shrike's "sand-ship", killing their pursuers. Theo tells them that Oenone Zero was taken north by a merchant called Napster Varley, and convinces the two to help him rescue her. They sell the sand-ship, buy an airship and travel north.</p>
<p>The Stalker Fang is demanding that Fishcake take her east, back to Shan Guo, so she can activate ODIN. They steal a limpet from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> (which, after the events of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infernal_Devices_6d1a.html" title="Infernal Devices">Infernal Devices</a>, is now ruled by warring gangs of Lost Boys) and travel east, eventually arriving at the mountain Zhan Shan in Central Asia. Throughout this journey, the Stalker faces an internal battle between its warlike side and the remnants of Anna Fang, resulting in a <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split_personality.html" title="Split personality">split personality</a>. Fishcake comes to love Anna and hate the Stalker Fang. Eventually Anna gains the upper hand, and Fishcake is delighted. After meeting with Sathya on Zhan Shan, they travel to Batmunkh Gompa to try and find Dr. Popjoy (the Engineer who created her) and force him to remove the Stalker Fang personality permanently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cynthia Twite has returned to Tienjing and informed General Naga of Oenone's supposed death. The General despairs and Twite becomes his own servant so that she can infiltrate his government and then topple his government from within.</p>
<p>Tom, Wren and Wolf travel across the Green Storm's frontline in Harrowbarrow. They are shocked by his violence when smashing through the line, but still take the Jenny Haniver westwards with him onboard. In the ruins of London they make a startling discovery - survivors are indeed living amongst the ruins, including two people Tom knew from his life on London: Clytie Potts and Chudleigh Pomeroy, who is the new mayor. They are welcomed into the community suspiciously, but Wren thinks the Londoners are hiding something from them.</p>
<p>Fishcake and Anna arrive at Popjoy's villa, but in killing his guards she reverts to her Stalker self, and the plan backfires as she makes Popjoy try and remove the Anna parts of her instead. He tells her he cannot, so she kills him and steals his airship to travel east to activate ODIN, accompanied by a miserable Fishcake.</p>
<p>In the ruins of London, Wren and Wolf make a discovery - the Londoners are concealing a new city called "New London", built to float above the ground using the Ancients' <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_levitation.html" title="Magnetic levitation">Magnetic levitation</a> technology. Wolf escapes from London with this knowledge, intending to return and devour it with Harrowbarrow.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Darkling_Plain_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Part Two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Part Two</span></h2>
<p>Napster Varley arrives in Airhaven, which is floating above the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>, and makes cautious attempts to sell Oenone. Hester, Theo and Shrike arrive shortly afterwards and attempt to buy her back, but they do not have enough money. Hester then finds Pennyroyal hiding in Airhaven, in disgrace and debt after a newspaper exposed him as a fraud. She takes what remains of his money and heads to Varley's ship to buy Oenone back. Pennyroyal realises what she is doing and rounds up a group of troops from Manchester to try and get there first.</p>
<p>Hester attempts to cheat Varley, but is discovered and has to fight her way out. She kills him and his men and escapes with Oenone when Pennyroyal and his troops challenge them. A fight ensues, and in the confusion Hester and her party manage to escape on their airship with Oenone. Pennyroyal falls from Airhaven, and is assumed killed, but instead lands in the rigging of Hester's airship and is begrudgingly taken on as a passenger. The five of them make it across no-man's land to a Green Storm airbase, where they are hailed as heroes. The airbase is soon attacked by the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>, however - at the urging of Manchester, the war has begun again. All of them manage to escape in an airship heading east except Theo, who turns back to recover a letter he had from Wren.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Stalker Fang and Fishcake arrive in Erdene Tezh, her old home. She begins assembling a powerful radio station to send a signal to ODIN.</p>
<p><a name="Part_Three" id="Part_Three"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Darkling_Plain_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Part Three">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Part Three</span></h2>
<p>Theo survives the attack on the airfield and, as the letter from Wren says she intended to explore the ruins of London, he treks east across the plains to find her. He is welcomed into the ruins by the community there and reunited with Wren, but brings bad news that the war has started again. The development of New London is pushed faster, the Londoners eager to escape before the cities of the west arrive.</p>
<p>The Stalker Fang has activated ODIN, however, and turns it on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>. Manchester and many other cities are completely destroyed, and the surviving cities flee west.</p>
<p>In Tienjing, news of Oenone's survival reaches General Naga. He realises Cynthia Twite had deceived him and confronts her. She is about to kill him when ODIN fires upon the city. Twite is killed instantly but Naga survives. He takes the shattered remnants of his government and flees to Batmunkh Gompa.</p>
<p>News of ODIN's destruction reaches the ruins of London. They have no idea it has been turned on Green Storm cities as well, and assume it is a new weapon of Naga's. Tom decides to take the Jenny Haniver east to talk to the General and tell him about New London, and how it will not destroy the earth. He sneaks away in the dead of night, leaving a letter for Wren, confident that Theo and Chudleigh Pomeroy will look after her.</p>
<p>In no-man's land, news comes to Harrowbarrow of the destruction of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>. Wolf is determined to carry on to the ruins of London, and tells his second-in-command that after the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixty_Minute_War_4c1d.html" title="Sixty Minute War">Sixty Minute War</a>, the creatures that survived best were cockroaches and rats. He believes that with the old cities gone, the time for creeping places like Harrowbarrow is at hand, and they continue east.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Darkling_Plain_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Part Four">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Part Four</span></h2>
<p>On the same night that Tom slipped away, Chudleigh Pomeroy died in his sleep. The new mayor appointed is Mr. Garamond, paranoid head of security who is convinced Tom has gone to tell the cities about New London, and that Wren and Theo are traitors. He orders them locked up, but an Engineer believes he is wrong and frees them in the night. They sneak away west through the debris fields.</p>
<p>Tom arrives in Batmunkh Gompa and is taken prisoner by the Green Storm. General Naga speaks to him, but does not believe him about New London. He does, however, believe that something is going on in London's ruins, and becomes suspicious.</p>
<p>Hester's party arrive in Batmunkh Gompa to discover that Tienjing has been destroyed. Shrike speculates that perhaps the Green Storm does not control ODIN; that it is instead in the hands of a third party, the Stalker Fang. Hester also learns that Tom is being held captive in the city, and goes to see him.</p>
<p>Oenone meets General Naga but he no longer trusts her, and hits her. He still believes ODIN to be a weapon of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a>, and since Oenone wanted the peace treaty, tells her it is her fault. He has her imprisoned and flies to the ruins of London with a fleet of airships.</p>
<p>Hester is awkwardly reunited with Tom. She frees him just as Pennyroyal comes back from the audience chamber with Naga; he tells them that Oenone has fallen from grace, and Naga intends to destroy London. Another blast from ODIN strikes just to the south, triggering the volcano of Zhan Shan. Shrike suggests they find ODIN's true ground station and destroy it before any more attacks occur.</p>
<p>Leaving the debris fields of London, Wren and Theo encounter Harrowbarrow approaching. They go back to warn the Londoners, just as the Green Storm's air fleet arrives. The Londoners demonstrate New London's levitation to Naga. He decrees that it is not a city, just a "Very large, low-flying airship" and he decides to help defend them against the approaching predator suburb.</p>
<p>Hester, Tom and Shrike fly towards Erdene Tezh, where ODIN's ground station is located. During the journey Hester confesses to Tom that she is Valentine's daughter, and he forgives her for betraying Anchorage. They fall in love again, but are interrupted by Shrike announcing that he has discovered a stowaway: Pennyroyal. As they decide what to do with him, the airship is attacked by Stalker-birds. Shrike defends the ship but falls from it, disappearing down into the mountains. The Jenny Haniver crashes on the shores of the lake at Erdene Tezh, and the three escape as it burns to ashes. Hester ties up Pennyroyal and leaves him in the bushes as she and Tom approach the house where the ground station is. The Stalker Fang (whos personalities have fused back into one) confronts them. Fishcake is with her and, bitter about their betrayal in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infernal_Devices_6d1a.html" title="Infernal Devices">Infernal Devices</a>, demands that Fang kill them. Tom has a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>, however, and she takes them into her house as prisoners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Theo and Wren are engaged in a sword fight with Wolf on top of Harrowbarrow, as New London flees through the debris fields. They manage to kill him and are rescued by General Naga, who takes them back to New London. Harrowbarrow still chases the young city, however, and the General sacrifices himself by flying his airship into its mouth in a <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a> attack, destroying both of them. New London escapes across the plains.</p>
<p>Shrike recovers from his fall into the mountains, and climbs out of a frozen lake, running towards Erdene Tezh. Fishcake discovers Pennyroyal in the bushes and frees him, telling him about the airship and how the keys are kept around the Stalker's neck. Pennyroyal realises he has no other way to escape, salvages an electricity gun from the wreck of the Jenny Haniver, and creeps towards the house.</p>
<p>Inside Tom has recovered from his heart attack, and Fang tells the two of them about her plans. She intends to fire ODIN on volcanoes across the world, blotting out the sky with volcanic ash and wiping out the Human race. She believes it is the only way to make the world green again. Tom pleads with the Anna side of her to destroy ODIN, and after an internal struggle the Stalker does so. Pennyroyal bursts into the hosue and attacks Fang with the electricity gun shortly after. He manages to kill her, but also sets the house on fire. Tom has another heart attack, and lies helpless in Hester's arms. She drags him outside as Pennyroyal runs to get the airship and get Tom to a doctor.</p>
<p>Onboard the airship, however, Fishcake puts a knife to Pennyroyal's throat and forces him to fly away, abandoning Tom and Hester the same way they abandoned him on Brighton. Hester sees him fly away, and understands. Tom dies in her arms, and Hester peacefully commits suicide to be with him in death.</p>
<p>With the Green Storm's armies shattered and the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktionstadtsgesellschaft.html" title="Traktionstadtsgesellschaft">Traktionstadtsgesellschaft</a> smashed, Oenone is appointed the new leader of Shan Guo. New London prospers, and Wren and Theo become air-traders. Fishcake returns to the mountains to find Sathya; he grows old and has children, and finds in his later life that he regrets leaving Tom and Hester. Pennyroyal tries to publish a new book about what happened at Erdene Tezh, telling the truth this time. He cannot find a publisher for it, however, and lives out his last days with an old girlfriend in a Traction City.</p>
<p>The final chapter deals with Srike, and how he arrives at Erdene Tezh too late. He finds the bodies of Tom and Hester, and takes them up into the mountains where he lays them down together. He watches as they decompose, and new plants and trees grow from their remains. He then shuts down into <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernation.html" title="Hibernation">hibernation</a>, and sees hundreds of years go past like minutes, he sees a girl putting a ring of flowers around his neck, and starts to slow his hibernation. He sees another girl, who thought he was just an old statue, and put flowers around him for luck, she says that her family have been hanging the flowers since her mother's mother's time, showing that he took two generations to slow his hibernation. He follows her down into a valley where her village rests, where he starts to decipher their language, and discovers that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traction_Cities_2d7e.html" title="Traction Cities">Traction Cities</a> are considered a fairytale. Cities no longer move except in stories, showing that some knowledege of <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal_Darwinism_922b.html" title="Municipal Darwinism">municipal Darwinism</a> has lived on, and airships still exist, powered by <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_levitation.html" title="Magnetic levitation">magnetic levitation</a>.</p>
<p>They ask if he is one of the Machine men out of stories they have heard, again showing some memory of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalkers.html" title="Stalkers">stalkers</a> ,they ask Shrike what he is for, and he tells them he is a Remembering Machine.
