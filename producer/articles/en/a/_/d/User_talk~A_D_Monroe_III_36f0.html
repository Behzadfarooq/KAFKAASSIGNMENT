<p>Thanks for the note. I made the edit in a bout of random date and year updates, when I get into a fit finding random biographical pages and then adding their birth and death dates to the appropriate pages. So I have no idea what I added. &#160;:) Nothing important though, I'm sure... and in fact, whenever I do that I wonder about the value of adding a minor ballerina's birth to a year page, and whether it's better left off. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 01:26, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Thanks for sharing your opinion at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>. But I am afraid in any case if you're well-informed with the situation when you cast your vote I would recommend you to reconsider. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:36, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll replying here, rather than on your talk. If you're interested in my views, you'll look for them. If not, the less said the better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure you're informed on what the names <i>should</i> be, but I don't see how that matters. Wikipedia can't lead changes in people's perception, it must only reflect current perceptions. You're very insistent of your views, but even if you're right and everyone else is wrong, by definition of the purpose of an encyclopedia, you're still wrong. Doesn't it bother you that so many are against your views? You can't force agreement, but you can easily force resentment. By continuing to push your single-track views, your can get a reputation of being a disruptive irritant, where anything you request triggers hostility. You're doing your own cause a disservice. Please, relax and wait for the mob to die down. --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 17:16, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm here, and you know your opinion is important to me.</p>
<p>The reason why I cared about whether people who's cast a vote are well-informed was because the issue has been brought up at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_0623.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)</a>, and the outcome was, I must have to say, quite different. I understand Wikipedia is a test ground for participatory democracy, but that does not equal to mobocracy. While everyone's opinion has to be respected, everyone has to be well-informed and be rational in making every single decision. And that's the true meaning of this free encyclopedia. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:07, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for responding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that in Wikipedia, as in other democracies, people vote who aren't informed. But who decides who is informed? Would you have started this particular talk if I agreed with you on CFD?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree that there may even be a mob mentally against your views; some of the comments of your detractors are less than accommodating. But, remember, the mob didn't always exist; it's been created by your own actions. You push, they push back. The harder you push, the harder they will push back, and the mob grows every time. Again, you can't force agreement, only resentment. If you really care about your views getting accepted, please, lay off for a while. Idle mobs disintegrate. --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 22:54, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes I am not the one to decide. Not anybody. What I can do is to facilitate. I put up a list of relevant articles, discussions and precedants so that people can read a little bit more about the issues before making a decision. Thanks for the suggestion of idling for a while. I have tried to do so, but the categories kept got listed by others. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 14:30, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you've edited the StarCraft storyline page recently, and you've done a good job.</p>
<p>Do you think you could tackle the StarCraft Prequel page as well? I haven't the faintest idea how to write a proper introduction to that page.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. It's done. Actually, the existing introduction wasn't that bad; I just added a couple sentences. I think the {{cleanup-context}} note could have been removed before. Still, the other StarCraft articles could use a similar treatment, perhaps even the same verbiage. I'll leave that to others, though. I've done enough StarCraft for now. --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 19:05, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I looked over the VFD results, taking them as a whole, and concluded "The result of the debate was move and replace with redirect". This is what I did, the redirect being from 10000000000000000 to 11th millenium and beyond, the data (such as it was) going onto the 1000000000000000 (number) article. I also disagree with this, but I did it anyway, because the VfD was about 16 days old.</dd>
<dd>(I disagree because it seems to me that someone entering 1000000000000000 is not thinking of a date but a number.)

<dd>It's important to understand why you thought the results were for redirect. You haven't explained your reasoning. The votes were 13 to 5 for deletion; is counting the votes not important? Why is "because the VFD was about 16 days old" important? I and others think something has gone wrong with <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_1000000000000000000_1235.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1000000000000000000">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1000000000000000000</a>. --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 00:46, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking over everything that transpired, it seems I accidentally contributed to this mess. While <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_1000000000000000000_1235.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1000000000000000000">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1000000000000000000</a> was going on, someone brought up <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000000000000.html" title="1000000000000">1000000000000</a> has having the same issues as <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000000000000000000.html" title="1000000000000000000">1000000000000000000</a> (note different number of zeros). I "fixed" the lower-numbered article by redirecting it; I was preparing to put it up for VFD (or rather, RFD) when the VFD on the higher-numbered article was closed. In retrospect, that was a mistake. Some people didn't notice the difference between the two articles, and thought I'd moved an article while it was under VFD -- a pretty disruptive act. Others thought that this is what I wanted for the higher-numbered article, even though I'd voted "strong delete". Some even accused me of violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I'd never intentionally do that. Meanwhile, further confusing things, an admin (<a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">jnc</a>) deleted and protected the lower-numbered article.</p>
<p>So, sorry for all the confusion. I'm trying to set things right again. --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 01:37, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Love your site.</p>
<p>I have recently made some edited (and thus far unchanged) corrections to an article entitled "Crisis on Infinite Earths." I, in fact, draw a comic book for Marvel and am an amateur comics historian.</p>
<p>I also included a 5 line "speculation", based on my reasoned assertion about the genesis of the story behind Crisis, and an upcoming series yet to be completed called "Infinite Crisis."</p>
<p>The following users...</p>
<p>Dyslexic agnostic</p>
<p>Tverbeek</p>
<p>...have continually, over the past few days, removed certain comments, despite the fact that at WORST, my comments do not detract from the article in any way. They simply disagree, but instead of contributing an opposing opinion, they remove my contribution.</p>
<p>And they have asked me to stop putting up my "lame" comments.</p>
<p>I don’t intend to. My understanding of the mandate site leads me to believe there is a place for my brief contribution and that the users above are being petty and abusive.</p>
<p>However, should you feel the text of my contribution to be inappropriate for the site, I will remove them myself. But I would like this point clarified if possible.</p>
<p>here is the statment in question:</p>
<p>" As Crisis on Infinite Earths, in an effort to clear the perceived mutli-universal clutter, became the ultimate multi-universal story, Infinite Crisis seems to be posed as an answer to the perception on the part of some fans and editors alike that the DC Universe, and comics in general, has become too dark and "gritty" to the detriment of the stories, and thus, will be the ultimate dark and gritty series that could, potentially, leave the DC Universe a happier place.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen."</p>
<p>My comments would of course, be edited after the series is completed.</p>
<p>The two users have been abusive and condescending and have not been responsive to an attempt to compromise, particularly Tverbeek, who I feel is operating under the illusion that he is the primary custodian of this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've tried to keep up with the disputes, but it's moving faster than civil tongues can follow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My first advice is to become a <a href="../../../r/e/g/WP%7EREG_a086.html" title="WP:REG">registered user</a>. It's easy, useful, and will make needed discussions on talk pages easier to follow. It will also remove the (pointless) classification of registered and unregistered editors. (BTW, this isn't <i>my</i> site -- it's just as much yours.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, there is a policy in Wikipedia about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. There may be some issue with your edits because of this, though this isn't clear-cut.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mainly, however, all the above should have been brought up by any of the editors you encountered, and should have been discussed on the articles' talk pages. The fact that they didn't is the reason things got out of hand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've started to encourage those editors to do just that. Since there is no police in Wikipedia, and no "right" or "wrong", this may take a while.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime, I'd recommend browsing in other areas of Wikipedia, and letting things cool off a little.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there are more specific issues I can help with, just let me know.</dd>

<p>There are several censors/revisionists on Wikipedia who are determined to delete or gut anythign they personally do not agree with or like. One of these is an editor named Demiurge whose relentless attempts at censorship, blocked only when he is caught red-handed by third party Wikipedians, continues unabated. Please review his attempts to delete my additions to the Tim Pat Coogan wikipage. Evidently he is not the only one.</p>
<p>Demiurge is an Irish censor and a Catholic apologist who has attempted to delete edits to pages as various as Ante Pavelic, Tim Pat Coogan, pre-Code (related, ironically, to movie censorship in the USA by the Catholic church), Eamon de Valera (refugee policy during WWII), and many others. Is this individual going to be permitted to censor, delete, edit, sanitize, gut, or whatever he cares to do, with no one stopping him??? He has just blokced my sourced and cited additions to the Wikipage of Tim Pat Coogan.</p>
<p>I do not have my own computer so I am using a rental, but if you wish to contact me, please email me at karas_peter@yahoo.com (my friend's email address). I would like to receive a valid reason for his abusive attempts at censorship regarding his "pet" issues.</p>
<p>Thank You, 70.19.67.28 22:31, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a very black harbinger for Wikipedia, and its helplessness to block abusive editors, and certainly administrators (which Demiurge is not yet, fortunately, but he will certainly attempt to become one). 70.19.67.28 22:23, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Are you a university graduate engineer?</li>
<li>Please indicate in which of these engineering disciplines you obtained your degree:

<li>Electrical engineering</li>
<li>Environmental engineering</li>
<li>Mechanical engineering</li>

<li>In what year did you obtain your degree?</li>
<li>What attracted you to participate in Wikipedia?</li>
