<p>The article summarises "Dance" as "a satire on English political and cultural life in the mid 20th century." The series includes satire, but that's only one of its strands, and by no means the chief one. I'm not sure how one would do justice to its complexity and subtlety in a one liner, but feel that this brave attempt falls short. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountersubject_0a75.html" title="User:Countersubject">Countersubject</a> 15:38, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not only is satire not the chief strand, it is not even a minor theme. Satire exposes and mocks vice and folly; this is very far from the tone of the series: it is more often inquisitively and tolerantly comic. I'll attempt a change that I feel is slightly more accurate.</dd>

<dd>'Satire is amusing only incidentally, if at all, and has or used to have a moral intention, to expose vice and folly as a means of correcting them, in theory at least. [...] the word is at its most precise in a literary context, referring to the works of the classical writers and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Swift_100b.html" title="Jonathan Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pope_8096.html" title="Alexander Pope">Alexander Pope</a>. In recent years almost any old TV show put together in a jeering or mocking or generally 'irreverent' spirit gets called satirical or a satire. The same thing happens to any reasonably diverting novel that treats of some particular environment, like an advertising agency or a school. In my opinion this is all mistaken. Let Anthony Powell put t he point in the course of his remarks on <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Firbank_3c08.html" title="Ronald Firbank">Ronald Firbank</a>. Powell describes "an inept, not to say fatuous form of contemporary criticism to which Americans are peculiarly subject", and goes on:</dd>

<dd>ADTTMOT contains portraits of people Powell knew and met, but not all of the characters were based on actual people.

<p>I thought Sillery was a depiction of Maurice Bowra?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Although Powell often strenuously denied that he was a portrayal of Maurice Bowra, readers have frequently associated Sillery with him. However, he certainly <i>wasn't</i> a portrait of FR Leavis: if anything, Quiggin is a closer likeness to Leavis. --Waring 07:10, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a discussion that has entertained several Oxbridge high tables. In his journals AP admits to Sillery being partly drawn from the Oxford don FF 'Sligger' Urquhart; however he says the principal source was Prof. Sir Ernest Barker, the political scientist and Fellow of Peterhouse College, Cambridge.

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As the AP Society researchers point out Powell was very clear that, contrary to widespread Oxonian belief, the model was not the noted wit and string-puller, Sir Maurice Bowra, one time Warden of Wadham College.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Waring is almost certainly correct about Quiggin who A N Wilson has described as "A conflation of Powell's two enemies, CP Snow, author of Corridors of Power, and FR Leavis, the implacably influential literary critic and don".

<dd>There are some remarkable similarities also to AP's nephew-in-law, Harold Pinter, the gloomy left-wing dramatist, although AP naturally denied that he was the main source. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalliol_0e19.html" title="User:Balliol">Balliol</a> 20:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Two questions about Sillery and his world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quiggin calls him "Professor Sillery" (p. 175 of <i>A Question ...</i>) but in the next line Sillery makes "a deprecatory gesture in our direction to suggest his own unworthiness of this style of address". In other words, he isn't a professor, and only someone from a different planet (that's how Quiggin is portrayed in this episode, more or less) would address him as such. Am I right there? Or is he called Professor somewhere else as well?</li>
<li>Is it Oxford, or just "the university"? When I read the books, I imagined it as Cambridge, but that's probably because I went there. Is Oxford named? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 13:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good questions which I have put to the experts on the AP discussion list. My own assumption was that Sillery either held a minor chair or was a professor emeritus still accorded the title, like say, Prof. Jonanthan Riley-Smith at Cambridge today. From memory Spurling (in her Handbook/Invitation to the Dance) is silent on Sillery's precise status. He is said not to publish research.</dd>

<dd>It is indeed Oxford, where AP was up at, ahem, Balliol, but like Eton it is not named. Internal evidence (eg the motor accident) and AP's journals support this. Which is not to say that nothing has been drawn from Cambridge though. -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalliol_0e19.html" title="User:Balliol">Balliol</a> 14:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to your queries the scholars on the Powell discussion list observe that while Sillery is nowhere else described by the author as "professor", Sillers adopts an equally self-deprecating attitude when granted a peerage. However Dr Clarke from Canberra University raises two questions:
<dl>
<dd>1. Is it likely that Sillers could have got a chair on the strength of one book, even at Oxford in the 1920s?</dd>
<dd>2. How would an Oxbridge undergraduate in those days have addressed a professor at an informal gathering?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Nonetheless Spurling (who appears to have cleared her material with Powell) does list him as "Professor Sillery" in her 'Handbook/Invitation to the Dance'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>Dr Clarke adds that Quiggin's "faux pas is probably due to the much wider application of the title in the United States (Associate Professor, Adjunct Professor, Lulubelle Z. Furtwangler Professor, etc., etc.) than at Oxbridge. He naturally assumes from past experience that anybody of Sillery's position and influence would have professorial status."</dd>

<dd>While Oxford, like Eton, is not named in the text Rhodes scholars are.</dd>

<p>My thanks to those who responded! In reaction to Dr Clarke's questions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. You could become a don without writing even one book, but to become a professor I suspect you would need more than one. Bowra (to take a name that crops up in this context), whatever else he did, spent a good deal more time writing books, some of them about his subject, than Sillery appears to.</dd>
<dd>2. In the case of a real professor you would indeed say "Professor Sillery", I guess, until you learn to, or are encouraged to, adopt a more familiar form.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But it is true (I was trying to remember if this was so) that Sillery "adopts an equally self-deprecating attitude when granted a peerage". Therefore, admittedly, his reaction to Quiggin's form of address doesn't prove that he wasn't a professor. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 12:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks to 79Spirit for some useful additions to the entry. I have however taken the liberty of reverting two of the amendments in line with the research, usually regarded as definitive, into the Dance character models by Dr Keith Marshall and Julian Allason, which have been extensively discussed. Bobby Roberts was in fact a source for Books Bagshaw rather than Peter Templer. While Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller was originally believed to be the character model for Widmerpool Powell was clear that this was not so and subsequently admitted that Widmerpool was based upon Denis Capel-Dunn.
