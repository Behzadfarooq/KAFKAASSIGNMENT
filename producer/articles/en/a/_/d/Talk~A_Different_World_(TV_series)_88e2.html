<p>Much as I love the trivia, a lot of it is not about the show, but rather the actors from the show and their individual careers. An example: Trivia related to both <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelman_College_b9b8.html" title="Spelman College">Spelman</a> AND the show should count; however, trivia about <a href="../../../k/e/s/Keshia_Knight_Pulliam_1453.html" title="Keshia Knight Pulliam">Keshia</a> — who made only a couple of guest appearances and never as a potential Hillman student — going to Spelman just doesn't belong. Can't we work together to cut this back? I'll make the first cut.<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 00:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC) (<i>Revised slightly for clarity of wording</i> <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 06:18, 25 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>(FYI, to the well-meaning person who changed my spelling, I know it looks odd, but Spelman with one L truly is correct. I've now linked it so that you can see for yourself.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Personally, on talk pages I consider it better practice simply to add your correction as a separate line under the original message (it can even be phrased as a question if that's more comfortable). That way, if it's correct, the person is informed, and if it's incorrect, the person isn't made to seem less informed than s/he really is. Just one person's opinion.<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 06:18, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Update: You may not agree with ALL the cuts I made ... while I think the Pulliam trivia cut is most defensible, other cuts were a finer line. I just don't want this to turn into a mirror of IMDb by repeating every bit of trivia about each actor. I left in actor-related trivia that highlighted connections among actors on ADW or that related to differences between the actor and the character (e.g., Jasmine Guy actually is a singer, Cory Tyler actually is a dancer), but cut actor-related trivia along the lines of "Glynn Turman was considered for Han Solo" or "Marisa Tomei won an Academy Award." It's just already such a long article, and those items have nothing to do with the show at all, much as fans may take pride in them as evidence of their good taste. If anyone reverts the article, PLEASE compare the two editions, as I made some other minor fixes that I think should stand. Among other things, I cut the Trivia into sections for easier editing.<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 00:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Before I get started: Kudos to the person who added the "1970s connection" section! Terrific idea and a meaningful addition, as this was an easily overlooked hallmark of the show, much like Cosby Show's use of jazz singers.)</p>
<p>After seeing that a lot of the trivia cuts I made were restored by other editors, I decided to try a different route and organize the trivia into subcategories: Notable episodes, Character-related trivia, Cosby connections, Connections among the actors, Actor-related trivia, Other trivia. In the process, I restored some items to which people seemed to be very attached, such as the item on Turman that someone had re-added after I cut it previously. I think this approach makes the section more readable and lets readers and editors decide about the relevance of the actor-related items as a group. This way, even if we ultimately leave in those items, anyone who considers them tangential to discussion of the show can simply move on to another category.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of work needed. For one, some of the more list-oriented trivia sections precede more narrative sections, and I think this makes for difficult reading. People not interested in the lists may well stop reading at that point, not seeing that further on, a more traditional article style continues. As another cleanup matter, the new division of the "other trivia" section results in some subsections appearing far above or below other subsections that are closely related. It took so long to do the cutting, pasting, and rearranging that I haven't the energy to do the next step right now. Additionally, the DVD box seems out of place so high up in the article; could someone check out other TV-show articles and see where such a box is typically placed?</p>
<p>More importantly (my opinion, of course), the article presently only touches the proverbial "tip of the iceberg" with respect to the social relevance of the show. The AIDS episode receives one sentence. That's better than not mentioning it, clearly, and at least it's toward the beginning, but there's a lot of material out there about how Debbie Allen, Bill Cosby, and others had to fight to get that episode shown. The "<a href="../../../a/c/q/Acquaintance_rape.html" title="Acquaintance rape">acquaintance rape</a>" episode likewise receives only a little mention here and there, and I didn't see any mention AT ALL of the episode involving use of "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">the n-word</a>", which was a landmark episode in its own right. There doesn't appear to be mention of an episode I think is less acknowledged, the one in which Freddie urges a professor to consider adopting an older child after hearing him lecture on how hard it is for older and/or African-American children to find adoptive homes.</p>
<p>Just a few thoughts that come up ... oh, and one more: <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_channel%29_ac4d.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon</a> is presently promoting a Hillman Reunion week for next week (beginning <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, 2006) that will feature numerous actors from the show, apparently as their characters. This event will include Lisa Bonet, who's usually conspicuously absent from nostalgic gatherings for either ADW <i>or</i> Cosby Show. We need to find somewhere to work that in. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 02:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the "Hillman College Reunion" online interview <a href="http://www.tvland.com/nickatnite/shows/differentworld/hillmancollege/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tvland.com/nickatnite/shows/differentworld/hillmancollege/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Debbie Allen says that the HIV/AIDS episode was the first one done by <b>any</b> show in prime time, period. Do we have an outside source for that?

<p>I started out trying to fix them, but they're too numerous for a quick fix ... misspellings of character names or titles, poor grammar and typos, non-encyclopedic presentations of information ("can be seen in syndication at 2 pm and 4 pm on your local station" vs. "can be seen in syndication, twice daily in certain markets"). I know it's all silliness to begin with, as it's fictional, but Wikipedia typically takes an encyclopedia-style approach even with whimsical material like this. I'm trying to avoid just reverting the edits, as some information has been added, but it's hard when so much error is introduced. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 01:19, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm thinking about creating A Different World characters page similar to the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_the_City_characters_7eda.html" title="Sex and the City characters">Sex and the City characters</a> page with the link under the Cast section header. This will reduce the size of the page. Also, I think an episode guide is needed. Once that's created, the Hillman College Reunion can be merged into that.

<dd>WOW. A characters page such as you describe would be a terrific move. As for an episode guide, this should be done slowly ... so many articles end up with associated episode guides that are lousy. I've seen everything from each episode having a one-line article (waste of bandwith, even just in theory) to practically a play-by-play synopsis ("Prison Break" episodes especially), which is not encyclopedia. However, as I've said, the current article doesn't do justice to many of the notable episodes, so I'm for the idea in general. You might look at TV.com (with all of us bearing in mind the need to avoid just "ripping off" what the people over there have done). The IMDb version doesn't have enough to go on; I had to go through the whole episode set there and migrate the cast page by page through some 144 episodes, marking who was in an episode and who wasn't. --<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 07:04, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed! This list is going so gangbusters, I've occasionally hit an edit conflict because RedRollerskate and I were editing the same season at the same time! Thanks for the addition. I've also now gone in and moved up the "Notable episodes" section within the article. We still need to add some material about "If I Die Before I Wake" and the episode where Ron and Dwayne get into a fight over a slur. (Seems like the episode is "Cat's in the Cradle," but I persist in thinking that title must have gotten mixed up with the previous episode's title, which is something like "Just Another Four-Letter Word." There's no other explanation for the weird title.)<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 03:20, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, Lord ... please <b>don't</b>. NOT all trivia is worthy trivia from an encyclopedic point of view, though <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a> might enjoy these additions. One reason this article kept getting tagged with "cleanup tags" is because it already had <i>too much</i> trivia. It has taken weeks of work by several people to be able to integrate the trivia to the degree we have, and adding things like Kevin Bacon connections will just drag the article down — it's not as if Bacon had ever even appeared on the show. There are different web sites for different purposes, and I feel certain that several of them would enjoy the lists you're proposing — Nick at Nite's message boards, TV.com, etc. Just please, don't add these things here; surely there's something more encyclopedic that such a fervent fan as yourself can contribute.&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 03:18, 21 October 2006 (UTC) (P.S.
