<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Global_Threat_dbed.html" title="Edit section: History 1997-2000">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History 1997-2000</span></h2>
<p>Originally formed in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> in 1997, the band relocated to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in 1998, where it has been based ever since. The original band members were Bryan Lothian, Brett Threat, Westie, and Tubby Tim. In 1998 the band recorded and self-released their first EP, “The Kids Will Revolt Against All Authority” on Crack Rock Records. Soon after, Mike Graves and Pete Curtis joined the band (on drums and guitar respectively) and AGT began playing live shows in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. During this period, the band met Mark Unseen (a member of Boston punk group <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Unseen_8457.html" title="The Unseen">The Unseen</a>), who would become a major supporter of the band before later joining it himself. Mark re-released the “Kids...” EP on his ADD Records label in late 1998. Subsequently, Mark became a member of AGT in 1999, when, during a weekend of gigs in New York, the band's van broke down and Mark offered them transportation on the condition that he be allowed to join the band. The group accepted and Mark took up dual vocal duties, with both he and founding member Bryan singing during live shows.</p>
<p>In 1999 they released the “What the Fuck Will Change?” EP as well as a split 7" EP with <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken.html" title="Broken">Broken</a>. Both these releases saw the band progressing towards the more frantic and relentless streetpunk style for which they would later become well-known. "What the Fuck Will Change?" was later re-released as the band's first full length LP on Step-1 Music, including new material as well as re-recorded songs from "The Kids..." EP. During this time Johnny joined the band on rhythm guitar and AGT embarked on a tour of the U.S. East Coast and South. Unfortunately, the band was involved in a three-car accident in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, in which their van was rumored to have been driven into a lake, forcing them to cancel the remaining dates of the tour. 1999 also saw the release of the "Who's to Blame?" split 7" EP with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_End_c2f7.html" title="The End">The End</a> on Anarchist Records.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, AGT secured a record deal with GMM records, which would release the "Until we Die" LP (a version of which was also initially released on Rodent Popsicle Records), which the band had recorded at the same time as the "What the Fuck Will Change?" material. That winter, after a weekend of shows, original member Brett Threat was either fired from or quit the band (which, remains unclear), and would subsequently move back to Maine and form the punk band <a href="http://wastekrew.cjb.net" class="external text" title="http://wastekrew.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">USA Waste</a>. The band then played a few shows with Johnny on bass, before he too quit the band to form <a href="http://wastekrew.cjb.net" class="external text" title="http://wastekrew.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">USA Waste</a> with Brett. AGT then recruited long-time friend and previous musical collaborator <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabe_Crate_453e.html" title="Gabe Crate">Gabe Crate</a> (a.k.a Gabe Asturd) to join the group on bass. In November, Mark Unseen played his last show with AGT, having decided that being in two bands was too much. Mark Unseen still occasionally joins the band at live shows to resume secondary vocalist duties.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Global_Threat_dbed.html" title="Edit section: History 2000-Present">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History 2000-Present</span></h2>
<p>In 2000, the band set out on an East Coast tour with the short-lived <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>-based hardcore band The Statistics. However, The Statistics left the tour after only two shows, leaving AGT to finish the remaining dates on their own. The band also recorded the “In The Red” EP this year, and “Until We Die” was released on GMM Records. The band also set out on its first national tour with <a href="../../../a/w/k/Awkward_Thought_03d6.html" title="Awkward Thought">Awkward Thought</a>. This tour was also joined, at points, by The Krays, Truents, <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxic_Narcotic_a506.html" title="Toxic Narcotic">Toxic Narcotic</a>, and The Flatliners. Shortly after the tour, Gabe was either fired from or quit the band in a comparably ambiguous episode to that involving original bassist Brett Threat's leaving the band two years earlier (one explanation is that AGT simply began playing shows without Gabe, neglecting to inform him that he was no longer in the band). In 2001, AGT carried on as a three-piece with Pete on bass, Mike on drums, and Bryan on guitar and vocals, playing numerous shows in Massachusetts and New York City. The band also recorded a split 7" with <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxic_Narcotic_a506.html" title="Toxic Narcotic">Toxic Narcotic</a> before touring with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Casualties_2db5.html" title="The Casualties">The Casualties</a>. For this tour, John Curran joined the band as the new bassist and Pete returned to guitar. In December, AGT recorded their 3rd full-length LP “Here We Are,” which was released on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punkcore_Records_6923.html" title="Punkcore Records">Punkcore Records</a>. During this time, Bryan began playing guitar as Pete Curtis prepared to leave the band and move to L.A. Around this time, Pete Curtis and former member <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabe_Crate_453e.html" title="Gabe Crate">Gabe Crate</a>, coincidentally also about to leave the Boston area, became involved in a violent altercation with one another at a party and decided to punch each other in the face for a while, allegedly inspiring the lyrics for a future bonus track entitled "Dude, Fuck," written by Pete about Gabe's shortcomings.</p>
<p>In 2002 Pete played his “last show” with the band before leaving for L.A., apparently becoming emotionally overwhelmed during the show and openly weeping. “What the Fuck Will Change?” was also re-released this year on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punkcore_Records_6923.html" title="Punkcore Records">Punkcore Records</a>. 2002 also saw the band embark on another U.S. tour with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Casualties_2db5.html" title="The Casualties">The Casualties</a>, as well as a U.S. tour with <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defiance.html" title="Defiance">Defiance</a>, for which Pete rejoined the band. The band also recorded the "Earache/Pass The Time" EP, released that year on Rodent Popsicle Records.</p>
<p>In 2003, the band toured the West Coast with Josiah Steinbrick of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavens.html" title="Heavens">Heavens</a> and <a href="../../../f/-/m/F-Minus_4986.html" title="F-Minus">F-Minus</a> and formerly The Statistics playing guitar. They also toured the East Coast with Clit 45, with Pete once again rejoining the band on guitar. For the remainder of the year, AGT would continue to relentlessly tour the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2006 the band recorded and released their latest full-length album entitled "Where the Sun Never Sets" on BYO Records. Many consider this album to be the bands most musically complex and innovative achievement, while also maintaining the original political and musical aggressiveness for which the band has always been known and respected.</p>
<p>A Global Threat completed its last U.S. tour, with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_Anywhere_bbb3.html" title="Strike Anywhere">Strike Anywhere</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bane_%28band%29.html" title="Bane (band)">Bane</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Is_Hell_6efb.html" title="This Is Hell">This is Hell</a> on October 30th 2006 and is currently touring Canada with the band <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wednesday_Night_Heroes_9430.html" title="Wednesday Night Heroes">Wednesday Night Heroes</a>. The Current line up includes Brian on vocals, John on bass, Mike on drums, and new official member and old friend Rufio, who has played guitar for the last three AGT tours, as well as playing for numerous other punk bands, such as the Unseen, Defiance, and bass for Clit 45 on their 2005 US Tour with The Lower Class Brats.</p>
<p>The band is preparing for a tour with <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxic_Narcotic_a506.html" title="Toxic Narcotic">Toxic Narcotic</a> side band Mouth Sewn Shut, California street punk natives Career Soldier, and Austin, Texas born street punk band <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lower_Class_Brats_2ff1.html" title="Lower Class Brats">Lower Class Brats</a>.</p>
