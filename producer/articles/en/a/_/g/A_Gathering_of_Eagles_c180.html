His abrupt manner and often cruel-seeming decisions alienate those closest to him, a situation that does not resolve until the day his wing undergoes a repeat inspection--and passes.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The Inspector General of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Air_Command_6b3b.html" title="Strategic Air Command">Strategic Air Command</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Major General</a> "Happy Jack" Kirby, played by <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_McCarthy_%28actor%29_bee6.html" title="Kevin McCarthy (actor)">Kevin McCarthy</a>) lands at Carmody Air Force Base near <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, home of the 904th Strategic Aerospace Wing. Accompanied by a thirty-man inspection team, he demands that the Air Police take him directly to the command post and there announces an Operational Readiness Inspection. As the inspection continues, General Kirby receives a score report from a member of his team. With this in hand, he calls the commanding general of SAC at his <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omaha%2C_Nebraska_e00c.html" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha</a> headquarters and soberly informs him, "It doesn't look too good so far." The general agrees and, without further ado, summons to his office his new aide, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Jim Caldwell (<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Hudson_18bb.html" title="Rock Hudson">Rock Hudson</a>) USAF, who at the time is conducting a tour of visiting dignitaries through the central alert room of SAC. Colonel Caldwell reports to his boss's office, and General Hewitt (<a href="../../../l/e/i/Leif_Erickson_d40a.html" title="Leif Erickson">Leif Erickson</a>) coolly informs him that the wing commander at Carmody "didn't have what it takes" and must be replaced. Hewitt offers the job to Caldwell, who enthusiastically accepts.</p>
<p>To Caldwell, this is a highly enviable career move, one made more auspicious when he discovers that his good friend and Korean War buddy, Colonel Hollis Farr (<a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Taylor_%28actor%29_ae73.html" title="Rod Taylor (actor)">Rod Taylor</a>), is the wing vice-commander. Barely able to conceal his excitement, he telephones his English wife Victoria (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Peach_e416.html" title="Mary Peach">Mary Peach</a>) to tell her the news.</p>
<p>Soon after he arrives, noting a number of problems in the wing that indicate a low state of training, he institutes measures that Col. Farr immediately questions--restoring a seven-day alert cycle that isolates flight crews from their families, freezing all promotion recommendations, and making it clear that no member of the 904th may consider his job secure. This includes the Base Commander, Colonel Bill Fowler (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Sullivan_%28actor%29_79c2.html" title="Barry Sullivan (actor)">Barry Sullivan</a>), who, as Caldwell soon learns, drinks heavily. Eventually, Caldwell forces Fowler to retire early, and tells him straight-out that his drinking is the cause. He also alienates a maintenance officer by telling him that he must learn to delegate authority--and when that officer applies for a transfer, Caldwell refuses to act on it. Farr protests that Caldwell is "going out on a limb," to which Caldwell replies with a biting rhetorical question, "What's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>Caldwell's harsh policies soon alienate even Victoria, who has befriended Fowler's wife. Eventually, morale at the upper echelons goes from bad to worse. First, Bill Fowler shoots himself, under circumstances that could be accidental but probably are not. Then, after Farr gives leave to a squadron commander whose unit is not in good shape, Caldwell asks the air-division general to replace him. He says, "I inherited the most popular vice-commander in SAC--but one who will not assume responsibility!" He then sharply contradicts Farr's rosy approval of the wing's performance during a post-mission critique of B-52 aircraft commanders as a prelude to informing Farr that he is fired. This almost causes the final breach between Caldwell and his wife, especially since gossip has had Farr and Victoria drifting into an affair--a rumor to which Caldwell lends no credence, but one that Victoria has heard, leading her to think that she is in some way responsible for Farr's impending dismissal.</p>
<p>Soon after, while Caldwell visits Fowler in a San Francisco hospital to snap him out of his <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depression</a>, he receives a call from the operations chief saying that "an unidentified <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-135_264c.html" title="KC-135">KC-135</a>" is "on final approach, no emergency declared." Suspecting another ORI, Caldwell orders the officer to notify the battle staff at once. Caldwell cannot return to base fast enough, however, and Farr must assume command in his absence. In this capacity, Farr makes a key decision: to launch a B-52 which cannot produce full power on one of its engines, a violation of peacetime flight safety regulations, because "We're simulating wartime conditions."</p>
<p>After another B-52 must abort its mission, General Kirby's "score" of that mission will make the difference between passing and failing. Kirby confronts Farr about the decision, and Caldwell immediately defends it, stating he would have made the same call. But Kirby surprises both by saying that he, too, would have done the same, and that he will <i>not</i> score the mission as an abort. Tellingly, he actually smiles at Caldwell as he says this. Caldwell congratulates Farr in a manner strongly suggesting he will retain Farr as his vice-commander, saying that Farr has finally learned "how...it feels out on that limb" and "might actually get to like it out there". Victoria, for her part, realizes the value of Caldwell's policies--especially when General Kirby wants to see <i>her</i> about the base's Family Support Program.</p>

<p>This film depicts the operations of a typical Aerospace Wing (nuclear bombers and ICBMs) of the Strategic Air Command during the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>. One anonymous commentator at IMDb stated that he was a member of the wing where filming took place (see above), and vouched for the authenticity of Air Force procedures depicted in this film.</p>
<p>Four commentators have left entries at the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turner_Classic_Movies_cc46.html" title="Turner Classic Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> database entry. Each one claims to have been in SAC during the period of history depicted in this film--and one man states that he was not only stationed at Beale AFB (see below), but also flew the <a href="../../../t/-/3/T-33.html" title="T-33">T-33</a> "chase plane" and worked with Rod Taylor (who, as Col. Farr, is depicted as flying the plane when Col. Caldwell has to break off air refueling because of a broken fuel line). These men criticize the film for the following errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Force senior <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-commissioned_officer.html" title="Non-commissioned officer">NCOs</a> (holding the rank of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_Sergeant_8941.html" title="Master Sergeant">Master Sergeant</a> or higher rank) would not actually hold tools.

<p>The number of the 904th, and the name of its base, are both fictitious. The actual base used in filming, Beale AFB, is located near Sacramento, not San Francisco.</p>
<p>The term "Operational Readiness Inspection" was actual terminology in the 1960s applied to exercises evaluating the combat readiness of units to carry out their nuclear mission. One of the TCM Database commentators vouches specifically for the ORI as depicted, and also for the Minimal Interval Take-Off sequence (in which Cols. Caldwell and Farr witness B-52's taking off fifteen seconds apart on average).</p>

<p>This film received relatively weak critical reviews and did poorly at the box office. After more than forty years, opinions vary widely as to the causes of the poor reception. The period in which this film was released is notable for the release, one or two years later, of a number of films that were decidedly unsympathetic to the US military (<a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Strangelove_67b2.html" title="Dr. Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fail-Safe_%281964_film%29_a12d.html" title="Fail-Safe (1964 film)">Fail-Safe</a>, etc.). These films appeared to much greater critical acclaim and box-office reception.</p>
<p>This film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Effects in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963_in_film.html" title="1963 in film">1963</a></p>
