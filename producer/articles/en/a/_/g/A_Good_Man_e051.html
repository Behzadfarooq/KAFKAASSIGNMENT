<p>Sheridan Montgomery Hensler was born in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown%2C_Pennsylvania_da00.html" title="Newtown, Pennsylvania">Newtown, Pennsylvania</a>. He entered the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> after graduating from high school. During his 12-year naval career, he rose to the rank of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Petty_Officer_3b0f.html" title="Chief Petty Officer">Chief Petty Officer</a>. His duties included working in the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_shop.html" title="Machine shop">machine shop</a> of several ships, including a deployment to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> aboard the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Oriskany_c3a6.html" title="USS Oriskany">USS Oriskany</a>. He was <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorably_discharged.html" title="Honorably discharged">honorably discharged</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> and soon found civilian work as a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonry.html" title="Masonry">mason</a> outside of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>Sheridan met his wife, Shirley, at a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">biker bar</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. Shirley was a bartender and was being harassed by someone whom she would later describe as "a bad man". Her future husband (a <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular.html" title="Regular">regular</a> at the bar) stepped in on her behalf and tossed the troublemaker out into the street. The bar's other patrons were thankful to be rid of the pest and started calling Sheridan by the nickname "Buddy". The name stuck and soon he and Shirley were dating. They <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elope.html" title="Elope">eloped</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/k/Elkton%2C_Maryland_4d26.html" title="Elkton, Maryland">Elkton, Maryland</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. They have two children and one grandchild and currently reside in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bally%2C_Pennsylvania_bfd7.html" title="Bally, Pennsylvania">Bally, Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Good_Man_e051.html" title="Edit section: Buddy's unique talent">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Buddy's unique talent</span></h2>
<p>One day in the late 1970's, Buddy was working on a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retaining_wall.html" title="Retaining wall">retaining wall</a> at a remote rural worksite. A <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_bear.html" title="Brown bear">brown bear</a> wandered into the worksite, presumably lured by the smell of the workers' lunches. Rather than flee to safety, Buddy took his sandwich (he says it was "a nice Italian <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoagie.html" title="Hoagie">hoagie</a>... I'm still upset about losing it") and managed to lead the bear away from the worksite. After getting to a safe distance, Buddy threw the hoagie towards some nearby woods. Buddy says he still doesn't know why, but the bear went after the hoagie instead of the human and was not seen again. His co-workers said that it was one of the strangest things they had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>After getting home that night, Buddy told Shirley about the incident. Shirley, after giving her husband an appropriate tongue lashing for his foolish actions, pointed out that Buddy had always had a way with animals. He always liked animals, from the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squirrel.html" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a> that he used to feed from his bedroom window as a child to the <a href="../../../g/e/c/Gecko.html" title="Gecko">gecko</a> that he kept as a pet on board the USS <i>Oriskany</i>. With the decline of construction during the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carter_administration.html" title="Carter administration">Carter administration</a>, it was decided that it was time for Buddy to do something different. He eventually enrolled at <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucks_County_Community_College_4847.html" title="Bucks County Community College">Bucks County Community College</a>, majoring in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>.</p>
<p>After getting his <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associate%27s_degree.html" title="Associate's degree">associate's degree</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, Buddy re-entered the workforce. He quickly found a position at Ash Research, a small biotesting company located in <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easton%2C_Pennsylvania_f6e2.html" title="Easton, Pennsylvania">Easton, Pennsylvania</a>. His early assignments involved handling a wide variety of animals, including <a href="../../../c/i/c/Cicada.html" title="Cicada">cicadas</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stingray.html" title="Stingray">stingrays</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a>. It quickly became apparent that Buddy had more than just a knack for working with animals. He seemed to have an almost-<a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathic.html" title="Telepathic">telepathic</a> connection with all sorts of creatures. His mere presence was usually enough to calm even the most distressed test subject.</p>
<p>His talent is something akin to that of a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_whisperer.html" title="Horse whisperer">horse whisperer</a> although it is by no means limited to only one species.</p>
<p><a name="Professional_struggles_and_successes" id="Professional_struggles_and_successes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Good_Man_e051.html" title="Edit section: Professional struggles and successes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional struggles and successes</span></h2>
<p>Buddy's gift has proved to be a both a blessing and a curse. His superior work with animal test subjects has been a major factor in the development of improved <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appetite_suppression.html" title="Appetite suppression">appetite suppression</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoking_cessation.html" title="Smoking cessation">smoking cessation</a> products.</p>
<p>While becoming an invaluable member of his department, his "star" status became a point of contention with some of his fellow scientists. On one notable occasion, former Ash Research employees Rick Hsu and John Fisher attempted to discredit Buddy's research findings by being <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistleblower.html" title="Whistleblower">whistleblowers</a>, prompting an <a href="../../../f/d/a/FDA_274c.html" title="FDA">FDA</a> investigation. A four-month search came up with no findings, thus clearing Buddy's name. A pair of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawsuit.html" title="Lawsuit">lawsuits</a> subsequently filed by Buddy and Ash Research were settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Despite these past incidents, Buddy has remained positive and upbeat. His unique gift remains of great use to the entire company, although he admits that <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retirement.html" title="Retirement">retirement</a> is not too far away. "Shirley has been on my case to clean the gutters. I don't know about you, but I'd rather get paid for doing that sort of thing."</p>

<p><i>"I have worked with a lot of people in my career. A few of them made me want to go on vacation and not come back to work. Most of them have been decent workers and upstanding individuals, but they don't come any better than Buddy Hensler. That is a good man... that is a fine man."</i> - Dr. Matt Egbe</p>
