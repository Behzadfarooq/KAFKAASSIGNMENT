<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Great_Day_92f1.html" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h2>
<p>After taking another trip to Carthage and returning to the school, Aelita talks to Jeremie about her not being human, unaware that Sissi is recording their conversation. On top of that, the data they had retrieved from Carthage takes over the Supercomputer and starts running return trips over and over.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The episode begins in <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Carthage" title="Lyoko">Carthage</a>, where <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a> is accessing <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xana_%28Code_Lyoko%29_66e8.html" title="Xana (Code Lyoko)">XANA's</a> data. With Aelita are the other three members of Team Lyoko. <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Stern_94b0.html" title="Ulrich Stern">Ulrich</a> is eyeing the Data Stream surrounding Carthage and warns that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Mantas" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Mantas</a> are about to hatch. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie</a> asks Aelita to stop so he can take over. Aelita protests, but the Mantas then emerge, forcing her to terminate her studies. Jeremie brings up the Vehicles and everyone hops aboard. While waiting for Jeremie to open up one of the Data Tunnels, the gang rides away. <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a> and Ulrich banter, discussing the Mantas' gender. Odd says they must be females, considering their attitudes. <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a>, who is taxiing Aelita on her Overwing, asks Jeremie if she has to listen to Ulrich and Odd. Jeremie says, "Sorry Yumi, but you can't always choose your friends!" At this point, Ulrich chooses to jump from his Overbike and onto a pursuing Manta. He unsheathes his katana and stabs the monster through its Eye of XANA. This effectively destroys the monster, but leaves Ulrich with nothing to stop him from hurtling into the Data Stream. Odd, upon seeing his friend's distress, dives down rapidly and catches Ulrich on the tail end of the Overboard. Ulrich thanks Odd as the Data Tunnel opens and everyone leaves <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a>.</p>
<p>With the data collected, Jeremie thinks he can develop an antivirus for Aelita. He tells this to the group as they emerge into the Lab.</p>
<p>When they get back to <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html" title="Kadic Junior High School">Kadic Junior High School</a>, it's late at night. Yumi goes to her suburban home and Ulrich and Odd retire to their dorm. As Jeremie and Aelita talk in a hallway about Aelita's alias, they are being spied on by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a>, who records the conversation on her Minidisc player. Sissi picks up some smoking gun evidence when Aelita talks about not being fully real.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Lab, the computer screen turns on suddenly.</p>
<p>The next morning, on Tuesday, everyone is getting ready for school. Jeremie's alarm clock wakes him up with a morning radio broadcast, "It's TUESDAY! No, you're not dreaming, at least you're not dreaming anymore. It's going to be a great day here on Sky Radio and I am going to keep on talking to make sure that you don't fall back asleep." Jeremie turns off the radio and prepares for his morning routine.</p>
<p>At Yumi's house, her <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Yumi.27s_parents" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">father</a> has the kitchen radio tuned to the same station Jeremie was listening to. The DJ announces a new release song from "The Subsonics" and rock music emanates from the speaker. Yumi downs a bowl of rice while her father scolds her sternly for staying out so late the previous night. He asks if a boy is involved and Yumi leaves without answering, serving to further anger her father.</p>
<p>At school, Yumi talks to the gang about her continuing conflict with her parents. Jeremie tries to cheer up Yumi, telling her it's going to be "a great day", citing the earlier radio broadcast.</p>
<p>Later during the class periods, Jeremie is confronted by Sissi, who makes him listen to the recorded conversation. She threatens to enlighten her father, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Jean-Pierre_Delmas" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Headmaster Delmas</a>, to the minidisc if Jeremie doesn't tell her what he and his gang are up to.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Suzanne_Hertz" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Mrs. Hertz's</a> science class, Jeremie tells Odd and Ulrich about Sissi's threat. Ulrich says he has a plan for how to deal with this. Odd adds his spiel, but is promptly drilled by Mrs. Hertz for talking in class. She asks her pupil the ratio of moles to mass in an Oxygen atom, followed by the pigment utilized by plants for photosynthesis. Odd doesn't know the answer to either, so Mrs. Hertz provides the answers. She then asks the wildcard another question, who is the dumbest student in the eighth grade. Odd replies weakly, saying it is him. Mrs. Hertz heartily agrees and begins her lesson plan.</p>
<p>After class, Ulrich is waiting in the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Gym" title="Kadic Junior High School">Gymnasium</a>. Sissi, dressed in an exercise uniform, enters and thanks Ulrich for agreeing to teach her <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencak_Silat_e0a4.html" title="Pencak Silat">Pencak Silat</a>. Ulrich says it is nothing and teaches Sissi some basic stances. As Sissi tries to keep up with Ulrich, Odd and Jeremie finger through the girl's belongings to find the minidisc. Unfortunately for them, they are caught red-handed by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Herv.C3.A9_Pichon" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Hervé</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Nicolas_Poliakoff" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Nicolas</a>, who parade them to Sissi. Sissi gloats, asking Ulrich if he thought his gang could outsmart her. She then announces that this is the end of the line and orders Ulrich to spill the beans under threat of giving the minidisc to Headmaster Delmas. Ulrich, Jeremie and Odd maintain silence. Sissi leaves for the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Adminsitrative_wing" title="Kadic Junior High School">Administrative Wing</a>. In the Headmaster's office, Headmaster Delmas listens to Aelita talk about being a virtual person. The Headmaster tells Sissi, who is sitting on his desk, that this is strange indeed and decides to call the Della Robbias (Odd's parents). Fortunately for Team Lyoko, the white bubble of the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel_%28Code_Lyoko%29_dd59.html" title="Time travel (Code Lyoko)">Time Reversion</a> sweeps over the school, the Headmaster's office and the city.</p>
<p>Jeremie's clock radio blares the Sky Radio announcer's spiel as Jeremie puts on his glasses. At first, Jeremie sees nothing wrong. But suddenly, he realizes that it is Tuesday morning again and that something is <i>very</i> wrong.</p>
<p>Yumi realizes what is wrong as well and uses the opportunity to avoid her father's censure. Listening to the rebroadcast of the Subsonics song, she hurries downstairs, downs her bowl and rushes out the front door before Mr. Ishiyama can get a word in edgewise.</p>
<p>Out on the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Courtyard" title="Kadic Junior High School">Quad</a>, Ulrich sees a second chance to get at Sissi. He confronts her at the arches and asks her to join him in practicing Pencak Silat.</p>
<p>In class, Mrs. Hertz is drilling Odd on atomic and biological sciences again. When she asks Odd how many moles are in an Oxygen atom, Odd remembers the answer from later that day. "32 moles per atom, ma'am," Odd says sunnily. The class stares at Odd. Taken aback, Mrs. Hertz asks Odd to identify the plant pigment that enables photosynthesis. Odd replies with the correct answer, Chlorophyll. Shocked, Mrs. Hertz stutters at Odd and tells him to keep up the good work. Paul Gaillard and some other students gape at a beaming Odd.</p>
<p>In the Gym, Ulrich and Sissi are going through the basic stances. Ulrich asks Sissi if he can talk to her about something, and Sissi responds in the affirmative. In the locker room, Ulrich listens to Sissi's minidisc and says, "Oh, it's worse than I thought. Jeremie and Aelita, for some strange reason, they think that they are virtual people!" Sissi asks why this is so as Ulrich continues his inspired masquerade.</p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">Factory</a>, Jeremie discovers that the data they recovered from Sector 5 allowed XANA to take control of the Supercomputer's Time Reversion feature. Jeremie locates the activated <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">Tower</a> and says, "Oh no. It's starting again!" On the computer screen, Jeremie watches a simulated model of the globe. The prodigy helplessly observes the Earth's seven continents, Oceania and Greenland spin backwards as the planet reverts back to Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Jeremie slams the reset button on his clock radio before the Sky Radio announcer can get beyond, "It's TUESDAY!"</p>
<p>Yumi moves even faster this time around and leaves her father scowling.</p>
<p>In science class, Mrs. Hertz and two students, Tania Grandjean and Thomas Jolviet, are in the front row of the room, gaping at Odd and giving him frightened looks. Odd is actually teaching the class, lecturing enthusiastically on all the details of the process of photosynthesis. Mrs. Hertz says, "Odd, keep this up and <i>you'll</i> be teaching the class instead of me." Odd says slyly, "Oh no, Mrs. Hertz. I could <i>never</i> be as smart as <i>you.</i>" He gives his goofball grin.</p>
<p>This time, the gang goes over to the Factory immediately after class. Aelita, Yumi, Ulrich, and Odd enter Lyoko's <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Mountain" title="Lyoko">Mountain Sector</a>, where they are confronted by a squadron of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Hornets" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Hornets</a>. Aelita and Odd jump off the path, landing on another path below while Yumi and Ulrich continue to fight the Hornets on the upper ridge.</p>
<p>At school, Sissi is in Headmaster Delmas' office. The Headmaster has already been made privy to the minidisc and is dialing a number on the conference phone. Headmaster Delmas asks Mrs. Della Robbia if Aelita is Odd's cousin. Mrs. Della Robbia says no and adds that she's never heard of Aelita before. Headmaster Delmas hangs up and, to Sissi's delight, decided to take action.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Yumi is devirtualized by the Hornets. Ulrich jumps off the edge to meet up with Aelita and Odd as the Hornets pursue.</p>
<p>At school, Headmaster Delmas is talking to Mrs. Della Robbia over the phone. He asks her if Aelita is Odd's cousin. Mrs. Della Robbia says no and adds that she's never heard of Aelita before. Headmaster Delmas hangs up and, to Sissi's delight, decided to take action.</p>
<p>In the Lab, the time reversion is starting again. Yumi walks up to Jeremie. Both of them watch North America, Central America and South America sail backwards and Jeremie says, "If only I had more time!" Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India and Asia follow suit as Yumi says, "Relax Jeremie. You're about to get another day." The white bubble emits from the holsophere and swallows the Earth, the Universe and the Time Stream, reseting it all to Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Jeremie slams down the reset button on the clock radio and checks his desktop computer, only to find that Aelita has been left behind in Lyoko. He turns to leave, but finds Sissi blocking his path. In an unnatural voice, Sissi threatens, "DONT' MOVE A MUSCLE!" A close-up reveals her optical pupils to be Eyes of XANA. The megalomanical virus has reached down into his bag of tricks and launched a new variation of a tactic he had used in Season 1 (See <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagued_%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_bc35.html" title="Plagued (Code Lyoko episode)">"Plagued"</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swarming_Attack_%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_1eaa.html" title="Swarming Attack (Code Lyoko episode)">"Swarming Attack."</a>). XANA has possessed a human being.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Aelita has been hiding from the Hornets the whole time, but her friends can't help her until Jeremie virtualizes them.</p>
<p>XANA-Sissi drags Jeremie to the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Boiler_room" title="Kadic Junior High School">Boiler Room</a>, where she is confronted by Odd and Ulrich. Sissi yanks a metal pipe from the furnace system and attacks Ulrich. As Odd furtively escorts Jeremie back to the Lab, Ulrich and Sissi spar with the utility pipes.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Aelita is suddenly frightened as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Scyphozoa" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Scyphozoa</a>, previously seen only in Carthage, emerges from a cave and captures Aelita. It begins to drain her memory with its tentacles. Yumi and Ulrich enter Lyoko. The sight of armed warriors frightens the Scyphozoa and it retreats into its cave. Ulrich cuts off the tentacles, freeing Aelita, while Yumi attempts to hit the monster's Eye of XANA with her metallic boomerang fan. She misses the small target and instead cuts a gash in the monster's casing. It disappears from view. Now, the only obstacle between Aelita and the activated Tower is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Tarantula" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Tarantula</a>.</p>
<p>In the school's Boiler Room, Ulrich tells Sissi that she's not herself and appeals to the real Sissi, asking her to fight XANA's presence. XANA-Sissi responds by saying, "ACTUALLY, I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER!" Ulrich knocks the minidisc player from XANA-Sissi's body and it shatters on the floor. XANA-Sissi glares at it, but cuts her losses and continues fighting Ulrich.</p>
<p>In Lyoko, Ulrich and Yumi begin hacking away at the Tarantula's life points. In a double-team fighting move, Yumi uses her metallic boomerang fans to slice off the Tarantula's laser-equipped forelegs. The incapacitated monster roars in pain as it sinks to the ground. Ulrich then dives in and stabs the monster's Eye of XANA with his katana. The roaring monster explodes behind the group as Aelita deactivates the Tower, just moments before Sissi was going to kill Ulrich with her metal pipe. When the Tower deactivates, XANA's hold on Sissi is broken and his ghost evaporates. Returning to her senses, Sissi sees her shattered and useless minidisc player on the floor and bewails its loss.</p>
<p>The next day at the arches on the Quad, Jeremie theorizes that jumping back in time increases XANA's power. He also points out that now, XANA has enough power to possess humans. The group concludes that from now on, they would have to limit Time Reversions, no matter how difficult that will be.</p>
