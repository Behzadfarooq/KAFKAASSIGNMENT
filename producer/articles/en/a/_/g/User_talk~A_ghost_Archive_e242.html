<dd>Couldn't disagree with you more strongly on this one. Mrs. indicates a married woman. During the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Right Movement</a>, Ms. was established to simply mean a woman, with no designation of marritial status, past or present. Miss continued to be used to designate a (usually young) that had never married. These terms can be fluid, based on the preference of the woman.</dd>

<dd>However, in Western English-speaking cultures, <b>refering to anyone by nothing more than their surname is normally a mark if disrespect</b>. The only exception is within military organizations (which are by nature de-humanizing) or certain Eastern cultures (where clan names is a mark of honor). <b>Using surname only is considered to be de-humanizing.</b> It devalues the individual. This is why the American Psychiatric Association trains therapists to require abusers to refer to victims by their name. I'm sure that you have no desire to devalue Ms. Schiavo. Since your straw polls favor using either Mrs. or Ms. by a wide margin, change your "policy".

<dd>Because you can't tell the difference between two seperate users. I changed the reference of Ms. to Mrs. because, <i>as you yourself said</i>, Mrs. indicates a married woman, which Terri Schiavo was. I was for Ms., personally. Apparently style guides say last name only, though I find this dubious. That's not the point, the point is that my talk page is not a place for your garbage. And don't give me orders. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 06:06, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's fine, apology accepted. I changed Ms. to Mrs. because that was the overall consensus. I wanted Ms. for uniformity in abbreviation (Mr., after all, having two letters) but apparently I was outvoted, and Michael &amp; co. refer to her as Mrs. Thus, Mrs. We can't have Mrs. in one article, Ms. in another. Which is why Viriditas asked me to change it. His assumption, I believe, is based on style guides, not on any want to dehumanize (though he is correct in his assertion that in formal writing it is last name only, first name and last for disambiguation, first name for familiar references; I have never seen a <i>formal</i> paper, be it an essay, encyclopaedia entry, or what-have-you, where, for example, Mr. Friedman would be used over Milton Friedman or just plain Friedman.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 06:39, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Really? Can you provide a link to this formal style? Maybe it's just a national thing, but I've always seen it the other way round here in Canada. That is, journalists use Mr./Mrs./Ms., whereas formal writing uses only the surname without the title. To recycle my previous example, a news reporter would say Mr. Friedman, whereas a critical paper (whether that criticism be bad or good, note, I'm using it without connotation here) would make use of only Friedman, as in "In Friedman's editorial in the New York Times..." <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 07:45, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some of your claims that the unjust judge followed the law I think are incorrect, but I maybe should not have stated my view as fact, because it was hotly disputed. I think I will mull on that concept where the encyclopedia doesn't take sides...</p>

<p>Hi. I just returned from vacation and thought I'd take a quick look at the TS page and TS Talk page and was...speechless. I'll try and take the time to read up on all the carryings-on. In the meantime, has there been any action on the mediation front?--<a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMia-Cle_7091.html" title="User:Mia-Cle">Mia-Cle</a> 20:57, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I'll keep plowing through the incredible amount of verbiage on the TS talk page and then head over to the request for mediation. (I may take a moment to respond to something Mr. Watts said about a traffic court case he has.) I took a quick look at the government involvement and will get back to it. (I noticed a little something that was missing -- after JEB acted, Schiavo immediately filed suit against Bush for violating Florida's constitutional separation of powers, <i>Schiavo v. Bush</i>. Then the court decisions. There's no transition between Bush's action and the court decision. Always nice to know who is suing whom for what.)--<a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMia-Cle_7091.html" title="User:Mia-Cle">Mia-Cle</a> 00:10, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ghost, I'll leave the re-revert alone for now. I didn't know when I saw Ed's edit that he was mediating, and as a matter of fact, it was fully an hour <b>after</b> his edit that he put anything on the talk page. Granted, it was still before my revert, but I hadn't seen his note before I reverted. His version isn't up to the standard we've held for quite a while on this article, but I'm willing to hold off fixing it while we settle other business. <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckecho_ef43.html" title="User:Duckecho">Duckecho</a> 14:48, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't take your reverting of it personally, particularly once I realized the purpose of Ed's presence. I saw his edit and reverted it immediately as a drive-by before I saw his Talk post. I once reverted one of your edits with regret, too, but felt (and argued) strongly at the time that it (your edit) didn't belong, and it wasn't personal, either. You must have agreed as you never complained. Even GW thinks I'm fair, so I guess I'm doing something right. Yeah, as seen by the most recent "Talk" post, the campfire approach isn't effective.

<p>It's the mediator and the terms I object to. The presumption of some seems to be that the article should straddle both positions -- find some sort of middle ground. I don't agree. Our side is objective, largely concerned with the facts. Theirs isn't. Far from being indulged, editors such as NCDave should be resisted fiercely. He is not trying to build a decent article, but rather trying to bias what's there to his extreme POV. In any case, I've disengaged from the article. -- Grace Note</p>

<p>Hi Ghost, thanks for your note, and I appreciate your effort to seek a resolution. First, regarding Duck's page, every editor has the right to remove personal attacks, and particularly personal attacks made against themselves. My perception is that Duckecho has struck up an inappropriate attitude to that article. He's made only 218 edits to the main namespace, most of which have been to that page. His first edit was to remove the POV tag, inserted because the dissenting diagnosis wasn't mentioned, with the edit summary: "It's [the judge's] rulings that count," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13569229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13569229" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> which runs counter to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and which shows a strong POV from a new user. He has been warned by two admins about his efforts to stop other editors from editing it, unless approved by him. His response when I objected to his revert of my recent edits was to refer to me as "Madam," and to say that he's been winning prizes for his writing since before I was born. That he has now used his user page to launch personal attacks on a number of editors confirms to me that he's a problem user.</p>
<p>As for joining in at the mediation talk page, thank you for asking me, and I'll certainly take a look, but I wouldn't (as things stand) want to be part of mediation. My only interest initially was to respond, as an admin, to complaints made to me by Gordon and Duckecho about each other. When I looked at the page, I saw it needed a copy edit, which I did, and which was immediately reverted, confirming my view that there's something going wrong at that page. If the other editors are your friends, I hope you'll advise them to allow normal editing to resume. Just because they don't approve of a particular edit doesn't necessarily mean it's not a legitimate one. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:40, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your reply. First, I can only repeat that editors have the right to remove personal attacks from any page in Wikipedia. User pages are not exempt. As to your point about POV, having a POV is not a problem (we all have them), but it can't be allowed to affect editing to the extent that it has on this page. Regarding the number of edits a person has made, this gives an indication of their experience, though I agree absolutely that new editors should be treated as equals. But when they attempt to undermine the work of others, and even stop others from editing, there's clearly a problem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I read a suggestion from Fox 1 on the mediation page that the Schiavo editors should adopt a zero-tolerance policy regarding personal attacks, and I strongly encourage you to sign up for that. I'd include <i>ad hominem</i> comments and snide remarks too. If you look through the archives, you'll see a toxic wasteland of personal abuse, which continues to this day, and yet I see you defending two of the editors responsible for it. These personal attacks are among the worst things editors can do on Wikipedia, in my view, because they poison the talk pages, which drives good editors away, and leaves the ones with the strong POV behind, because they're the only ones who care enough to dig their heels in. Badly written articles are the result. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:29, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you're not aware of how unpleasant the personal attacks on that talk page have been. During one 24-hour period, I was called an arrogant cuss, a jerkoff, an arrogant arse, f**%!ng $$sole, and accused of trolling, among other things. If you look through the archives, you'll see the same level of personal abuse going way back against a number of editors, some of whom have told me they're reluctant to speak up about it in case they're targeted. This isn't permitted on Wikipedia, and it has to stop. What's needed is for people to put their energies into improving content. I'd be happy to work with you on that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:08, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's certain types of behavior I want to exclude, not certain editors. The talk pages need to be kept free of the kind of abuse I'm talking about. At any moment, a new editor could arrive, take a look at the talk page, and decide not to get involved with Wikipedia after all; or one of our regular editors might be put off from contributing to the article. The page ends up almost ghettoized because of the toxic atmosphere, and that harms the article.</dd>

<dd>I took a look through the mediation archives today, and even after reading them, I can't see what the issues are. There's nothing wrong with the article that two experienced editors couldn't sort out between them in a few hours. I see the problem as stemming from a failure to abide by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Some of the questions raised on the mediation pages show a failure to understand them, and that's why I wonder whether the newness of some of the editors might be a factor here. If those editors are controlling who else gets to edit, then it becomes a big factor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example, this sentence in the intro violates NPOV: "She briefly lapsed into a coma, then passed into an irreversible persistent vegetative state (PVS) as determined by more than a half dozen neurologists ..." I don't think any of our editors with a strong grasp of NPOV would write the sentence that way. The PVS was a disputed diagnosis. The issue split America in two. And yet our introduction is written as though there was no dispute at all. The PVS diagnosis was by far and away the majority one, and it was supported by the courts, and the sentence should be written to reflect that, but the other diagnosis can't be ignored. Another example I saw in the archives was a discussion about whether something is true if a court says it is. The answer is no. We give space to POVs depending on how prevalent they are in credible, published sources, and we don't present POV as fact just because a court has endorsed it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those are just two examples of issues causing unnecessary problems stemming from a failure to understand NPOV. I'd be interested to know whether you agree with any of this, although please don't feel obliged to continue with the correspondence. I won't take offense if you're fed up with it, or if you'd prefer it not to continue on your talk page. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:03, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm requesting that you back off and stop stirring things. FuelWagon seems to be trying to sort himself out so the last thing he needs is you winding him up again, and if I want to remove my name from the mediation because I think it's silly (or for any other reason), that's my business. You seem happy to go round in endless circles, but others aren't. No one attacks you for staying in it, so don't attack others for leaving. Editors have told me they're reluctant to edit Schiavo because of the snide remarks they find about themselves on people's talk pages. All it does is add to the poisonous atmosphere. You're keen on telling others to look at what you call the "man in the mirror," so I hope you'll try taking your own advice. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:48, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I glanced over your bit on the talk page about presenting ID as a philisophical idea. I'd like to work with you on this, while I, llke the majority of the eitors detest ID as a scientific theory, I personaly subscribe to the general concept philosphically (stacked deck). I think it'd be an intresting article to write on. Any ideas?--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 30 June 2005 20:14 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I've noticed for a bunch of people who share similar beliefs, we disagree far to much and far too loudly &gt;.&gt; My first encounter with ID was simply as an philosphical conjecture that maybe life's complexity suggests a guiding hand.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 30 June 2005 21:03 (UTC)</p>

<p>I point out that I've offered compromise after compromise, so it should hardly come as any surprise that I'm willing to compromise. You'll find that FW is the one being intransigent and insisting on a specific text. However, per your request, provided no reverts are made of my revision of the 60% section at 20:04, 21 Jun 2005 and my placement of both sections into subsections at 20:07, 21 Jun 2005, I won't revert those edits. This compromise will be fully in line with the nuclear option: the democrats agreed that as long as they don't filibuster, the Republicans won't pull the nuclear trigger; likewise, if FW (or a sock puppet for him) doesn't revert my edits, I'll have no need to propose new compromise language. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 20:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've stated that the subject of Subarticles was resolved 4yrs ago. I've been on for 3months, so yeah, ImaNewbie. Hell, I don't even know what CSS is. Much less how to fix it for TOC formating. And I'm guessing that I'm in the vast majority of Wikipedia users on that. That's why the treatment of newer users in the discussion over templates and subarticles deeply troubles me. Aren't we supposed to try to understand and respect each other? And if someone is doing it "wrong", shouldn't we gently educate them by offering alternatives? I don't enough of this going in the articles, and to see experienced Users doing the same is disheartening, to say the least.--<a href="../../../a/_/g/User%7EA_ghost_d2de.html" title="User:A ghost">ghost</a> 5 July 2005 04:55 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the TOC on that artivle is a bit far down, or to put it another way the lead section is a bit long. I think ideally the TOC would start about where the "related documents" box does now.

<p>I removed the comments you made in the voting template page re subarticles because I felt they were leading to potential voters and were not entirely neutral, since you are an active voter. If you want to restore the comments thats fine but I would have to voice my disapproval underneath. Its like in the real world there are laws about not soliciting voters at voting booths within a certain radius, and there are laws about releasing the early poll results in the eastern states so it doesnt influence western state voters, same concepts. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 6 July 2005 04:40 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Ghost. I just want to say that I really did appreciate your efforts to compromise recently about the word "eventually". I was too busy to send a note to your talk page. I also appreciate your efforts to show respect. I can see that you're upset about recent events, and I'm truly sorry - but I won't be hypocritical and pretend that I'm equally upset. I think that if the behaviour on the talk page improves as a result of this - and it already has - it can only be good.</p>
<p>I saw your message to patsw on his talk page, but I don't think he has been on Wikipedia since, so he probably hasn't seen it. I hope he'll be back. Of course, I <i>would</i> hope that, wouldn't I, since he shares my POV! But sincerely, I can say that I am happy with <i>any</i> editor of <i>any</i> POV who remains polite, and tries honestly to argue on the talk page why he thinks the article should include certain facts, or why he thinks a particular wording shows bias.</p>
<p>I'm puzzled that a recent edit summary by another editor should have annoyed you so much, when there have been much worse edit summaries on the Terri Schiavo article and talk page. It seems that <i><b>I</b></i> was the only one who was upset by such edit summaries as "Everything you need to know about NCdave's cognition", or "Creating a sandbox for the kids to play in while the adults work on the article." Even a summary such as "reverting Don Quixote" is - to my mind - far more offensive than "this is silly" (which did not seem to be directed at anyone in particular). However, I applaud your loyalty to your friends, so I won't ask for a comment. If you feel it's none of my business, you're probably right. I just mention it because it's actually something I've been wondering about for quite some time. Thanks again for your recent support! Ann Heneghan 19:55, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think what is needed here is <i>very</i> close adherence to NPOV. By that, I don't simply mean "be neutral", but adherence to the particular type of neutrality we have on Wikipedia. We don't give our opinions or our interpretations of the facts, we give the facts and let the reader interpret them. Where the facts are disputed, we give both sides and make clear <i>who said what and when</i>. Where an area is very disputed, it's often best to stick to quotes, or even to external links. I would rather see a link to an external article critical of Dr Hammesfahr than an analysis on Wikipedia. And I <i>certainly</i> don't think we should be throwing around words like "charlatan" - that is always an opinion, unless it is part of a direct quote (then it's still an opinion, just the source's rather than ours). Sorry if that is all rather too general, I don't know the subject and until (if) Dr Hammesfahr gets back in touch with me I don't know what else needs to be changed in our current article -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 10:40, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
