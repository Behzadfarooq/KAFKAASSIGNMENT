<p>Hello, Ghost. I saw that you were back, just before Christmas, and I meant to welcome you back and to wish you a Happy Christmas. (I presume I can do that without offending you? The term "Happy Holidays" doesn't come easily to me, but I'm prepared to use it when necessary! I seem to remember that you referred to yourself once as either pagan or agnostic — I can't remember which.) But I've been at the computer less than usual, recently, and it's now after Christmas Day. So, can I wish you a very happy Christmastide? I'm glad you're back, as (1) you were one of my nicest opponents(!) and (2) I was wondering if something had happened to you. I appreciate that you're very saddened by what has been happening in your absence, but since we're on different sides on that issue, I won't make things worse with lengthy comments. Just a couple of things to let you know: (1) I've changed my user name. I had a lot of nasty stalking incidents a few months ago, with threatening messages either from unregistered I.P. addresses, or from accounts created specially to target me, and saying that someone was going to find out my home address and harm me. (2) I'm now an administrator, with lots of votes and kind words from people who disagree with my POV, but still trusted me. (3) I've been doing less work on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a> recently, but still keep it on my watchlist. I also work on some linguistics or literature articles. (4) I finished the degree I was working on during the Terri Schiavo battles, but I have now started work on a doctorate, so I'll still be disappearing and reappearing regularly. (5) NCdave hasn't been back. I think he disappeared (without a word) before you did. Gordon looks in occasionally, but he has a job now, and is spending less time on Wikipedia. I'm delighted for him.</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best for 2006! <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:57, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is depressing to see that I could put together as good a case as I did, yet all it does is lead me to getting rubbished for doing it. It makes you feel kind of helpless. Maybe its better to get out of the system, when the corruption can't hurt you anymore. I still like my User:Zordrac/Poetlister page though, but I suspect that eventually the powers that be will chop it to pieces. I just feel helpless when people like <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> can run around bullying everyone - Antaeus swearing his little heart out and abusing people, with Lulu just reverting everything and controlling everything, and yet nobody does a thing to stop them. And not only does nobody stop them, but then you get admins like <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">User:David Gerard</a> jump in and back them up and then the whole set of admins come in to back them all up, totally ignoring all evidence. So that even in an open and shut obvious case, nothing can be done. Even in the most obvious case imaginable, its hopeless. And then what can you do? Just leave, put it aside, and go and do something else. Because this just isn't worth it. And then even while you're gone, they keep finding new and ingenious ways to hurt you, vandalising your pages, making up more lies about you. I can't even make little edits anymore.

<p>I'm sorry, but the intro to the article is factual, well-crafted, and well-supported, despite whatever you or anyone else may think of it. The article defines the topic using the every words of not just the leading ID authorities, but the group from which ID originated and is still driven by.</p>
<p>To say that ID is anything other than that it's the concept that "certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection." <a href="http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is an excerise in denying the obvious. You'd going to have to explain away mountains of evidence, not least of which is the endorsement of that definition by every leading ID proponent (by the simple fact of their status as fellows of the Discovery Institue).</p>
<p>ID is what it's leading proponents say it is; if you have a problem with that, take it up with the Discovery Institute, not me. I only insist that we report what they say. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:28, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with being an idealist as long as one recognizes that reality falls far short of ideals (and I know you know that). I often look at things from an ideal perspective, especially in work. As an IT manager in a really, really large and hated government agency, I always come up with, or pass along from my employess, ideas on how we could really be doing things better. But, as I'm a few rungs removed from the top, have not succumbed to the corporate culture, refuse to use jargonistic slop in my writing, and won't get involved in asskissing, these ideas (while loved by my immediate superiors) get crushed by the corporate types at the top. Not, of course, that that stops me. New month, new idea, new headaches for the <i>les fromages grands</i>.</p>
<p>Oh, I found it amusing that HP used the term intelligent design. We purchase HP/Compac laptops and PC (we have no choice, it's a government-wide contract), and I'm not overly impressed. In fact, HP decided to get cute recently: we ordered a few thousand laptops, with 512Mb Ram in a single stick. They sent us laptops with 512Mb alright, but in two 256Mb sticks. Caught with their hands in our wallets, they pronounced it to be a mistake and then offered to replace the first stick with a 512, giving us a total of 768 for each laptop. I'm guessing they've read too many stories about government incompetence and figured we'd be too dumb to notice. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 22:06, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Re HP's "Intelligent Design": LOL. Yeah, I thought that was classic too. Proof that you can use Google to prove anything, no matter how stupid. Do you think this means that we could use the Kitzmiller ruling to go after HP's advertising as it is clearly unintelligent? Hmmmm..... *touches little finger to corner of mouth*--ghost 22:20, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that might be a good idea. HP's advertising just doesn't make me want an HP. (Imagine, "got an HP dude?". It just doesn't work. Besides, when I hear HP I think steak sauce, no computers)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I really preferred the contract we had with Dell (their service was really good, at least for us), but they were underbid by HP's intelligent low-ball bidding scheme. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 22:35, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sun Tzu, perhaps? Plato said "The first and best victory is to conquer self." which is similar. I personally have often used the maxim; All control except self control is an illusion, and I have no idea who said that, either. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 17:10, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for offering to help with the <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15%2C_2003_anti-war_protest.html" title="February 15, 2003 anti-war protest">February 15, 2003 anti-war protest</a> article. If you are streached for time then probally the most helpfull things you could do are Check the wikicode of the references (some appear not to work correctly) and convert any remaining inline ref's to bottom of the page ref's also check for any spelling, grammar and punctuation problems especially Comma splices which are apparently a problem though I have no idea what they are!</p>
<p>A slightly bigger job is to move any information on demonstrations that is limited to a short line with just name, place and number into tables so that the text flows better (E.g: "There was a demonstration in Budapest, Hungary, of 60,000 (SW estimate)[4] and a demonstration in Warsaw, Poland of 10,000 people"). This probally needs conceltation about how best to do it. If you have any suggestions please raise them on the talk page.</p>
<p>There are lots of other suggestions about what needs to be done to the article on its <a href="../../../f/e/b/Talk%7EFebruary_15%2C_2003_anti-war_protest_67db.html" title="Talk:February 15, 2003 anti-war protest">talk page</a>.
