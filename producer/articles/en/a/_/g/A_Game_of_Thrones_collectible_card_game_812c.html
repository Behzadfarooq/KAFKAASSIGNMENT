<p><i><b>A Game of Thrones</b></i> (or AGoT, for short) is a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collectible_card_game.html" title="Collectible card game">collectible card game</a> (CCG) produced by <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_Flight_Games_7572.html" title="Fantasy Flight Games">Fantasy Flight Games</a> (FFG), based on the <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_3dd5.html" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> (ASoIaF) series of novels written by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_R._R._Martin_adce.html" title="George R. R. Martin">George R. R. Martin</a> (GRRM). The first set, Westeros Edition, was released in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and the game has since won two <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_Awards_17db.html" title="Origins Awards">Origins Awards</a>. The game's primary designer is Eric Lang and the lead developer is Nate French.</p>
<p>In the game, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_%28game%29.html" title="Player (game)">players</a> assume the leadership of one of the great houses of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html" title="Westeros">Westeros</a> vying for control of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#King.27s_Landing" title="Westeros">King's Landing</a> and the Iron Throne. To achieve their goals, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponents’ plans with intrigues of their own, and make brazen power plays to win the support of the realm. Players have at their disposal mighty armies, scheming <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtiers.html" title="Courtiers">courtiers</a>, game-changing events, and many of the unique characters and locations that make up GRRM’s ASoIaF <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> setting. Sudden reversals of fortune are as common in the game as they are in the series. As <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Lannister_cee8.html#Cersei" title="House Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a> says in the first novel, "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."</p>

<p>Some great houses featured in ASoIaF are not represented as individual Houses in the AGoT CCG, but still appear in the game. <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Tully_c211.html" title="House Tully">House Tully</a> is present in the game as a subset of their allies, House Stark. House Lannister and House Baratheon both feature numerous <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Tyrell_c0a2.html" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a> cards, and several significant House Tyrell characters were featured as promotional cards. House Tyrell also features prominently in the A House of Thorns expansion, as does House Bolton to a smaller extent. Other lesser houses such as House Umber (Stark), House Florent (Baratheon), and House Clegane (Lannister), also appear in the game, in service to the Great Houses to which they are sworn. Several <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Frey_31b6.html" title="House Frey">House Frey</a> cards also make an appearance, primarily as neutral cards. At this point, no <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Arryn_81ca.html" title="House Arryn">House Arryn</a> cards have appeared in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to the noble houses, the AGoT CCG also features many other factions present in AsoIaF. These include the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night%E2%80%99s_Watch_1b50.html" title="Night’s Watch">Night’s Watch</a>, their enemies the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night%27s_Watch_c07c.html#Wildlings" title="Night's Watch">Wildings</a>, the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organizations_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_e679.html#The_mountain_clans_of_the_Vale" title="Organizations in A Song of Ice and Fire">clansmen of the Vale</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/e/Maesters_of_the_Citadel_61f8.html" title="Maesters of the Citadel">Maesters</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#The_Seven" title="Westeros">Septons</a>, the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights.html" title="Knights">knights</a> of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsguard.html" title="Kingsguard">Kingsguard</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_b543.html#Beric_Dondarrion" title="Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire">Beric Dondarrion’s</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_Without_Banners_a186.html" title="Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood Without Banners</a>.

<p>Each player supplies his own deck to play the game. A deck consists of a <i>House Card</i> or <i>Alliance</i> to represent the player's faction, an optional <i>Agenda</i> that modifies his faction, a plot deck that consists of exactly seven <i>Plot</i> cards, and then a main draw deck of at least 60 cards consisting of <i>Characters</i>, <i>Attachments</i>, <i>Locations</i>, and <i>Events</i>.</p>

<p>Each House card represents one of the main factions involved in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Five_Kings_eca0.html" title="War of the Five Kings">War of the Five Kings</a> emulated by the AGoT CCG. Each House provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various playstyles to interact within the same game. The House card selected will often restrict cards allowed in the remainder of the deck, by limiting cards that are marked as being allowed solely for another House.</p>
<p>Characters, Locations, and Attachments often have a House affiliation, and often are used in decks running a matching House card. Some cards have no House affiliation, and such neutral cards may be used freely in any deck. Cards with House affiliations other than the chosen House card may be used, providing the card itself has no restriction, but require an extra expenditure of resources to bring them into play.</p>

<i>Heir to the Iron Throne</i> agenda card</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Introduced in Valyrian Block, any deck using a House card (but not an Alliance card) may use one Agenda card. Agenda cards either modify the rules for building the player's deck, or grant an in-game advantage, typically at the cost of some other disadvantage such as requiring extra power to win, reduced card draw, or limiting claimed power.</p>

<i>Stand Fast!</i> Plot card</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Plot cards are generally regarded as the defining feature of the <i>A Game of Thrones CCG</i>. Unlike the shuffled and randomly drawn resource deck, at the beginning of each round, each player chooses a new plot card to be revealed, which will have an effect on the round to be played, allowing for a strategic element to an otherwise random game.</p>
<p>Plot cards indicate the base amount of gold available for the player to use to bring new cards into play during his <i>Marshalling</i> phase (indicated by a number within a gold coin), a base initiative value to determine the order of play for the round (indicated by a number within a diamond), a base claim value to determine the scope of the effect that player winning a challenge (indicated by a number in a silver disk), and a text box detailing any other effects or restrictions on the plot card, including any <i>traits</i> that it might have.</p>
<p>Most plot cards are designed with built-in trade-offs, sacrificing high claim for low income, or some other game mechanic drawback.</p>

<i>Eddard Stark</i> Character card</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Character cards represent the unique characters from the <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_3dd5.html" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> novels, such as <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddard_Stark_52cc.html" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a>, as well as generic individuals and massed groupings (such as armies) that can be found there. Generally, characters are the main focus of a deck as they are the principle card type used to participate in challenges, and thus collect the power tokens necessary to win.</p>
<p>Attributes of a Character card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be proceeded by a black flag if the character is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the character is <i>endless</i>, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral characters will have no shield), artwork depicting the character in the top half of the card, a strength value (represented by a number on a stylized tapestry or a nondescript shield in the middle of the left side), zero to three challenge icons (a red axe represents <i>Military</i>, a green eye represents <i>Intrigue</i>, and a blue crown represents <i>Power</i>) arrayed in the bottom half of the left side, and a text box in the lower half of the card. Throughout the Winter block, some cards were printed with a black crow icon in the bottom left corner to indicate the character is <i>Doomed</i>. It is unknown if such characters will appear again.</p>
<p>Within the textbox may be <i>traits</i>, <i>keywords</i>, other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent roles or groups within the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, such as <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords.html" title="Lords">Lords</a> or Dothraki. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group characters together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of characters.

<i>Kingslayer</i> Attachment card</div>

</div>
<p>Attachments are a cards that are used exclusively to modify other cards. An attachment may not be in play unless it is attached to the proper type of card, typically a character card unless the attachment itself says otherwise.</p>
<p>Attributes of an Attachment card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be proceeded by a black flag if the attachment is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the attachment is <i>endless</i>, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral attachments will have no shield), artwork depicting the attachment in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.

<p>Within the textbox may be <i>traits</i>, <i>keywords</i>, other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels.

Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that attachment such as Setup, which allows the attachment to be played at the beginning of the game unlike normal attachments.</p>
<p>Occasionally, game effects can cause cards to become face-down attachments attached to specific other cards. These function the same as normal attachments, except they are treated as having no names, no text, no gold costs, no House affiliations, and are discarded if they are ever forced to leave play.</p>

<p>Each player participating in an A Game of Thrones game uses two decks - a 7 card <i>plot</i> deck and a 60+ (40+ for draft) card <i>draw</i> deck of <i>characters</i>, <i>attachments</i>, <i>locations</i>, and <i>events</i>. During play the <i>draw</i> deck cards will often end up in other game play areas including the <i>discard pile</i> (cards discarded from play) and the <i>dead pile</i> (cards that were killed or are marked with the Deathbound keyword). Typically, players are only allowed three copies of any particular card (as determined by the card name, regardless of card type or game text similarity) in their <i>draw</i> deck, and only one copy of any particular card, by name, in their <i>plot</i> deck, but these restrictions can be modified by some other cards, such as the Twins agenda.</p>

<p>A player must earn 15 power tokens between their House card and characters in play to win A Game of Thrones. Numerous cards in the game can change the amount a player or his opponent are required to earn in order to win. Generally, power tokens are earned by winning challenges against an opponent, but some cards allow a player to directly claim power for his House card or characters in other ways.</p>

<p>Introduced in the Winter block was a way for a player to be eliminated from the game. If at any point, a player had five or more cards with the Doomed icon in their dead pile, they would be immediately removed from the game.

<p>At the beginnning of the game, each player shuffles their <i>draw</i> deck, and draws the top 7 cards, with an option for a <i><a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulligan.html" title="Mulligan">mulligan</a></i> given to each player to shuffle and draw a new hand. From this initial hand, each player is able to select up to 5 gold worth of characters, locations, and attachments with the Setup keyword, but no more than 1 card of any type with the Limited keyword, from their hand; these cards are placed face-down until all players are ready to reveal their initial cards in play. Once all cards are revealed, players draw cards again until they each have 7 cards in their hand again.</p>

<p>The game is played through repeated rounds until one or more players meets the winning condition, or all but one player has met the elimination condition. Rounds are divided into 6 phases, with each phase allowing players to alternate actions that affect the game state in some way.</p>
<p>The first phase every round is the <i>Plot</i> phase. Each player selects one unused plot from his <i>plot</i> deck, and all players reveal their chosen plots simultaneously. Initiative values from plot cards and other resources are tallied, and the player with the highest initiative chooses which player will go first in each phase of the current round. The textbox effects of plots are then resolved in the order chosen by the first player.</p>
<p>In the second phase, the <i>Draw</i> phase, each player is allowed to draw two cards from their <i>draw</i> deck.</p>
<p>Although divided into turns for each player, the <i>Marshalling</i> phase is a single phase for all players. At the beginning of each player's turn in the Marshalling phase, the player counts all income from plot card and any other resources available. The player is then able to bring new resources in the form of characters, locations, and attachments into play by spending the gold. Some events and other triggered effects also require the payment of gold, and unused income is not carried over into other rounds, so resource management is important.</p>
<p>The fourth phase is the <i>Challenge</i> phase. As with the <i>Marshalling</i> phase, each player has a turn to initiate challenges against other players. Generally, players may initiate one each of <i>Military</i>, <i>Intrigue</i>, and <i>Power</i> challenges each round, but several cards can allow exta challenges to be initiated or deny certain challenges at all. Challenges can be initiated in any order, and require a player to <i>kneel</i> one or more characters with an icon matching the challenge type to begin the challenge. Then, the player being attacked may kneel one or more characters to attempt to oppose the challenge. Once all player actions are taken, the player with the highest total strength in the challenge wins. If the defending player wins, nothing special occurs, but if the attacker wins, then the defender suffers losses depending on the type of challenge initiated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Military - if the defending player loses, he must <i>kill</i> a number of characters he controls equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot.</li>
<li>Intrigue - if the defending player loses, he must randomly discard a number of cards from hand equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot.</li>
<li>Power - if the defending player loses, he must remove a number of power tokens from his House card equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot, and place them on the attacker's House card.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the fifth phase, the <i>Dominance</i> phase, each player counts the total strength of all controlled characters that are still <i>standing</i>. The player with the highest total wins dominance that round, and claims 1 power token for his House.</p>
<p>The <i>Standing</i> phase is the last phase each round, and each player changes each <i>kneeling</i> card to <i>standing</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Game_of_Thrones_collectible_card_game_812c.html" title="Edit section: Common game terms and rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common game terms and rules</span></h3>
<p><i>Kneeling</i> and <i>standing</i> are the two possible game states for each card in the game. <i>Standing</i> cards are upright, and are ready for use to pay for effects, or to initiate or defend challenges. <i>Kneeling</i> cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side, to indicate that they've been used to pay for an effect, or to initiate or defend a challenge. Some game effects are able to <i>kneel</i> cards (changing them from <i>standing</i> to <i>kneeling</i>) or <i>stand</i> cards (changing them from <i>kneeling</i> to <i>standing</i>) in order to manipulate the resources a player has available.</p>
<p><i>Unique</i> cards represent the special individuals, places, items, and happenings in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Unique cards may not be played if the player already has a copy of that card in play, or if a copy of that card can be found in the player's dead pile. Unique characters, locations, and attachments may be placed with copies that are already in play to serve as <i>duplicates</i>. Duplicates may be discarded to save the unique card from being killed or discard.</p>
<p><i>Triggered Effects</i> are a type of game effect that a player chooses to use in order to change the game state in some way. Triggered effects are indicated by a bold name of a phase (one of <i>Plot</i>, <i>Draw</i>, <i>Marshalling</i>, <i>Challenges</i>, <i>Dominance</i>, or <i>Standing</i>) or <i>Any phase</i> to indicate when the effect may be used. Another timing word that may precede a triggered effect is a bold <i>Response</i>, which indicates that the effect may only be used in response to another occurrence in the game. <i>Triggered abilities</i> are a subset of triggered effects, and are specifically triggered effects that are written on cards currently in play.</p>
<p><i>Passive Effects</i> are game effects that have no bold timing restriction indicated, but instead happen whenever certain prerequisites are met, such as a character coming into play.</p>
<p><i>Constant Abilities</i> are game effects written on cards in play that have an ongoing effect on the game state.</p>
<p><i>Influence</i> is indicated on various characters, locations, and attachments in the game by a number on a scroll in the textbox of the card. In the Valyrian block, influence was introduced as an additional resource to manage, requiring players to kneel one or more cards with a specific total amount of influence to pay for an effect.</p>
<p>Normally, once a game effect has been initiated, it fully resolves without an interruption. However, once an effect is begun, there is a chance for specific effects to <i>Cancel</i> the initial effect. If the effect is cancelled, all costs stay paid, use limitations remain, but the effects do not occur.</p>
<p><i>Kill</i> means removing a character from play, and placing that character in the <i>dead pile</i>. Kill effects only work on characters, including other cards that are currently functioning as characters, but other cards can be placed in the dead pile through various game effects, such as the Deathbound keyword.</p>
<p><i>Discard</i>, when occurring without the modifier <i>from hand</i>, means to take a card that is in play, and place it in the <i>discard pile</i>.</p>
<p>Generally, whenever an effect targets a card to be killed or discarded, players are given a chance to <i>Save</i> the card from the effect, either by discarding a duplicate of the targeted card or by using another game effect. If a card is saved, it is not removed from play, and it is not considered killed or discarded.</p>

Usually the cards can legally be included in any deck, but some are marked with a skull icon to indicate they cannot be included unless special rules are in effect for that tournament.</li>

<p>There are several different official tournament types sanctioned by FFG. In the <i>Classic</i> format, players bring their own decks, which may include cards from any set, as long as the card is not on the banned list. In <i>Standard</i> format, players bring their own decks, which may only include cards from the most recent blocks. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of August 2006</a>, only cards released since Valyrian block are legal in Standard format. In <i>Limited</i> format, players instead build their decks at the tournament, using provided draft packs (in <i>Limited - Draft</i>) or starter decks (in <i>Limited - Sealed Deck</i>) and booster packs.</p>
<p>Aside from the restrictions on usable card pool, FFG places no limits on how Night's Watch volunteers organize the tournaments.</p>

<p>The cards for the AGoT CCG are organized into numerous sets and expansions that can be mixed together and used interchangeably. A <i>block</i> consists of a <i>base set</i>, up to two <i>expansion sets</i>, a <i>premium starter</i>, and often one or more promotional cards.</p>
<p>Within a base set and and expansion set, the cards will be divided into groups based on their frequency of appearance, with rare cards being included the least frequent, uncommon cards slightly more frequent, and common cards being the most frequent. Also available in regular and premium starters are a specific number of fixed cards that always appear in that packaging.</p>
<p>Typically, a base set consists of 240 cards available in either <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starter_pack.html" title="Starter pack">starter decks</a>, consisting of a mix of fixed cards and a random assortment of other cards, or <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booster_packs.html" title="Booster packs">booster packs</a>, consisting of 11 randomly sorted cards, of which 1 is rare, 3 are uncommon, and 7 are common. Booster packs are generally shipped in groups of 36, creating booster boxes. Expansion sets typically contain 150 cards, and are only distributed as booster packs similar to those of a base set. Premium Starters consist of two or three pre-built decks of fixed cards, typically reprints from earlier sets, but also introducing 10 new cards as well.</p>
<p>Also available are <i>draft packs</i> which consist of 1 <i>draft</i> card, 5 <i>plot</i> cards, 6 <i>house</i> cards and 8 <i>locations</i> that are generally useful to any deck, and allow for a more level competitive field during <i>draft</i> tournaments.</p>
