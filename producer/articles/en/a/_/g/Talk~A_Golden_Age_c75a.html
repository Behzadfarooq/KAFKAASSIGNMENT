<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/g/Talk%7EA_Golden_Age_c75a.html" title="Edit section: Controversy Re: Tahmima Anam, The Awami League and the Daily Star">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy Re: Tahmima Anam, The Awami League and the Daily Star</span></h2>
<p>The novelist is the daughter of Bangladeshi Daily Star editor Mahfouz Anam. The paper is perceived by some Bangladeshi's to lean politically toward the Awami League[<a href="http://www.banglacricket.com/alochona/showthread.php?t=17961" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.banglacricket.com/alochona/showthread.php?t=17961" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] and has aligned itself with the party in the choice of Caretaker President [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6096212.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6096212.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] in the upcoming elections. This is a point to note given that the history of the Liberation War is contested by the Awami League and the Bangladeshi Nationalist Party. Briefly, the Awami League is considered to be the party of Liberation. Secular and left wing. This is the Anam tradition. However, the Bangladeshi Nationalist Party and the Jamaat I Islam are more right wing and revisionist, seeing the Liberation War as a conflict against the Pakistani military junta and not necessarily Islam, which held the erswhile united Pakistan together.[<a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/07/16/d40716110177.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/07/16/d40716110177.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1575704.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1575704.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] Anam's approach to the war is bound to be from an Awami League perspective.</p>
<p>I believe that readers should be aware of the authors background as it is relevant to the topic she chose to write about. It is only because of her fathers political influence that she is able to get this book published. <i>In any case, politically aware Bangladeshis are aware of (and sick to the teeth with) the scism between AL and BNP re: the Liberation War. However, non-Bangladeshis are not. But they should be, in order to get a well rounded view of the topic.</i></p>
<p>I agree with Ragib that usually an authors family history should not be relevant but given the subject topic and the authors father being a part of the political establishment, people should know something of this. The authors father fought on the side of the Awami League during the conflict and this should also be noted for the sake of objectivity. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a supporter of the Awami League or being 'Pro-Liberation'. I am myself of the 'Pro-Liberation' persuasion. However, it ought to be declared.</p>
<p>I also question the neutrality of moderator Ragib since we have clashed on numerous occassions and he is an ethnic Dhakaiya (as is the author) and I am a Sylheti. Why is it that Asif Saleh always runs to Ragib? In addition, it should be noted that Asif Saleh, who previously edited this profile, is also a journalist for the Daily Star and can hardly be considered neutral!</p>
<p>I feel that the nexus of Daily Star-Awami League sympathisers are attempting to silence the other viewpoints of the Liberation War (there were two sides, you know!) and are attempting to obscure the authors latent Pro-Awami League stance on the Liberation War. The war is a fantastically divisive issue (as are all civil wars) in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>I would like this matter to be adjudicated by a totally neutral (Non Bangladeshi) moderator. Many thanks.</p>

<dd>Please keep your racist comments to yourself, and behave logically. This is an article on a novel. What you "think" or "Feel" about the author's father (!!!!) really doesn't matter. A blog is a suitable way to vent your anger against the author, her family, or any other party, but this is an encyclopedia which has to maintain a certain standard. BTW, I was not born in the Dhaka district, city or division, so stop using that as an adjective, or otherwise, I'd consider it as a racist epithet which you seem to be very fond of. Your behavior has reached the upper limits of my patience, and you are completely free to put a note to any other admin related to this (request to any such person: please email me and give me a few days to respond since I am checking my mails on an irregular basis).</dd>

-If moderator Ragib is neutral why has he welcomed Tahmima Anam to Wikipedia? Is this something modz do for all members or certain members they are aligned with?</p>
<p>-Why does Asif Saleh of Drishtipat always turn to Ragib 'the neutral' in times of need when they disagree with edits?</p>
<p>-Ragib has written blog entries for Drishtipat. Please clarify the relationship between mod Ragib and Drishtipat and whether you are related/acquainted outside wiki.</p>
<p>ps. As you well know Ragib, Sylhet and Dhaka are regions of Bangladesh and it is no more racist me calling you a Dhakaiya than you calling me a Sylheti. Please grow up and grow a brain cell.</p>

<dd>Dear Anon 87*, where exactly have I written a blog entry *for* Drishtipat? I have also welcomed at least a thousand other editors, and would have welcomed you if you had created an account. Not all people see others through hate-filled lenses. You continuously write the statement "I am a Sylheti". I have time and again informed you that I wasn't born in Dhaka region, yet you are using it as a racial epithet. I will not reply to your rant until you can come up with something coherent. Thank you. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 06:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>it's hard to pick a point about in the long 'lecture' of this guy. So Ragib Bhai, just ignore him. I learned about Tahmima Anam in January 13's onno alo of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prothom_Alo_7858.html" title="Prothom Alo">Prothom Alo</a> and greatful to her for The Golden Age. There she was described as Sonar Meye (The Golden Girl) and there is not much doubt. Tahmima did not wrote this book just because of her fathers political belief. Central part of her Ph. D. Covered <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>. She had to spend almost two years in Bangladesh for that, when she took interview of numerous war fighters. She also worked in the set of <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tareque_Masud_2313.html" title="Tareque Masud">Tareque Masud</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matir_Moyna_3909.html" title="Matir Moyna">Matir Moyna</a>. The plot of her novel also came from a true story of her grandmother. What more to say.<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarif_Ezaz_5326.html" title="User:Tarif Ezaz">Tarif from Bangladesh</a> 11:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just as a disclosure, Ragib has never written for Drishtipat blog. There was entry posted by dp authors for the good work that is being done by him in terms of promoting Bangla wikipedia. He has commented on that entry as clarification. Commenting on a write up and writing "blog entries" is totally different. Anyone can comment in a public blog and that does not mean he/she is affiliated with the blog. This is pure common sense. -- DP blog Admin</dd>
