<p>Sam:</p>
<p>Things have been very quiet here, but I'm on a Luther and the Jews sabbatical. Would you archive the page, save the current discussion? I'm afraid that Paul pushing the issue will make things busy again.</p>
<p>I also want to take up your suggestion for reorganizing the lead section. I liked your basic idea. Could we open a new discussion (or reopen one) on that notion alone?

<dd>I've made the changes I suggested. I would hold off on going back to the intro until any discussion on the latest changes occurs; I'm not sure it is good to put too many sections in play all at once. I'm not particularly adept at archiving, but if no one else takes a stab at it in a day or two I'll try to figure out what needs to be archived and what needs to stay. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 19:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam, I would expect that the section will be reverted and so you may wish to monitor this and maintain the revision even if the predictable users try to revert. We have conceded much to them, and have invited reasonable discussion in the spirit of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> so I believe it is only appropriate for the revision to stand since there were no reasonable responses made to it. I'll help support it as well, but of course we will wish to be mindful of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.Ptmccain 20:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Take a look at it now Sam. I've removed all labels. I would appreciate your support in getting this text on the main page. We have shown good faith and have compromised and accomodated concerns of a few editors. Plenty of time was provided for discusssion. It is obvious that we are not being treated with good faith but only with hostility. That is inappropriate. Ptmccain 00:43, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sam, I'm concerned that you continue to use the language of a mediator on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMartin_Luther_78ef.html" title="Talk:Martin Luther">Talk:Martin Luther</a>. As I said before, there is no mediator on that page. It's important to stress that; I recently watched another case deteriorate because of a similar misunderstanding. Although I accept that your intentions are good, I feel you're encouraging what amounts to trolling. What you refer to as the situation between Ptmccain and Jayjg is, in fact, a situaton between Ptmccain and just about every editor who has tried to edit the page. He has engaged in vandalism; page blanking; repeated personal attacks; repeated 3RR violations; repeated <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations; has sent threatening e-mails; and either threatened to, or did, post another user's personal details. He is not a good-faith actor. Any points he makes that are decent will be listened to, but in part because of your presence, he is acting out, which means it's difficult to grasp what he's saying, given the low signal-to-noise ratio. CTSWyneken <i>is</i>, I think, editing in good faith, but he has a very strong POV, and has admitted that editing articles about Martin Luther falls within his job description. There is therefore a tricky situation on that page, which has made it hard to write anything close to a neutral, and well written, account of Martin Luther's influence. Editor burn-out has been high (the highest I can think of on a low-profile page such as this), because of absurdly convoluted discussions about trivial issues, and because of personal attacks. It's therefore important not to do anything to pander to the person most responsible for the unpleasantness.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to write to you in this way, because I do completely accept your good intentions, but as I say, I recently witnessed a similar situation elsewhere go badly wrong for the same reasons. I hope you don't mind me raising the issue with you. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've said it before, I'm just another editor. If you want me to say it again or in any particular way I am happy to. If people want mediation, they should agree to it, as mediation is not possible without a desire to have a resolution from all parties. I happen to think mediation would be a good idea, but everyone will have to come around to that view for themselves (or not).</p>
<p>I do happen to be an editor who is "moderate" in the sense that I don't always agree with anyone among either "group". My experience so far has also not been that any one person is to "blame" for the tone, but, rather that many participate and that it feeds on each other, but I truly believe it will only sort itself out if people focus on the text, assume good faith til it hurts, and use discussion and dispute resolution techniques instead of revert wars. In the meantime, I'm going to weigh in with what I think, and everyone can take it for what they will. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 23:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That you even identify two "groups" is indicative of the problem. There is the Lutheran group opposed by a variety of individuals with very different views and different backgrounds. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, I'm not sure why you call this one a "low-profile" page. I came across this one because I regularly look at the FACs for what I think of as important historical articles, and Luther struck me as quite an important one. You can't understand the next 200 years of European religious disputes and wars or the ultimate emergence of nations without understanding something about Luther, Calvin and the reformation, and I don't think you can adequately struggle with contemporary philosophy or theology without addressing his views on grace. I think of this one as quite high-profile. I'm not sure whether that makes you feel any better about the burn-out. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 00:52, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a low-profile page in the sense of not getting much attention from editors.

<dd>Broad question in response to my own broad statement, but Western philosophy struggles intensely with questions of determinism and free will, and Grace is one way out of what is otherwise a dualistic box. On a different topic, I noted that you never had any thoughts in response to my comments about the citations in the first paragraph of "Luther and Antisemitism". I'd be interested in your thoughts (probably best put on the Luther talk page rather than here, of course). <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 13:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll be at the page again, working at paraphrasing the Schaff quoted material and eventually working on diversifying the citations there.

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>Thanks for the compliment. There was one quote from Samuel Johnson about poets that I thought would be good for the page. I'll find it, but how do I submit it? I can keep my eye out for other quotes as well (I find those the easiest). Is it possible to store quotes so that they automatically come up? That way I could contribute a bunch at once, which would make it enormously easier. I assume for poetry that we'd need to have something published before 1923 for copyright purposes, right? Other than that, I have no ideas at present, but if I get any, I'll pass them along. What could you use help with? I'm running across some interesting poets as I do the year pages, but I haven't been spending enough time reading through some of the individual poet articles. I was surprised to see quite a few died in World War I. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 00:00, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Sam,</p>
<p>So you're reading Against the Day? Thanks for the comment on that page. How do you like the book? I've never read Pynchon (just got interested in contributing to that page), and for the first time I'm tempted, although with a book that size I get afraid I'll be swallowed up by it. When I read James Clavell's Shogun (just as long, not nearly as daunting) as a teenager, I barely got up from a sofa I was laying on for the seven days it took to finish the book. With Pynchon I might die of starvation, the book propped on my chest. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:52, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm trying to give Pynchon about an hour every night -- it's great stuff. V and The Crying of Lot 49 are both favorites of mine; I haven't tackled Gravity's Rainbow and didn't get as excited about Mason Dixon or Vineland. But Against the Day, so far, is right up there with V in my book, and I've got to say I think the collection of references is a great way into the book. But you can't sit down and read through and get as much out of it - it really needs to be tackled in smaller chunks. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 20:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Category:Racist people is standing at about 90% in favor of deletion, so I hope you aren't going to take that as a precedent just because there is still doubt about it getting deleted.

<p>Your argument is a council of despair. Following your approach, as soon as there is one bad category in a field, perhaps kept as a result of a campaign by an organised group or just by chance as to who happened to be around that day (and we might be talking about two or three people out of seven or eight) that means unlimited bad categories can be created in that field and all of them must be kept forever. I think that is so self-defeating. Let's create more precedents that go the way we want, not start voting for things we actually oppose. Can't you see that your approach can also rob other users of motivation. Please don't let the side down with this defeatism. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumahoy_3c13.html" title="User:Sumahoy">Sumahoy</a> 03:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ideally, we would see the community work for NPOV in everything; where, as in this case, the community has consistently decided to permit a series of categories with all kinds of difficult POV questions and risk, I think it is best to have all of the POVs aired. It's not just one category - if it were just anti-Semitism, I could write off it off as an exception and aberation. But the religious hate categories have been embraced across the board. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 03:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>You inspired me with your additions. I've been going through the list of American poets, adding their birth/death years on that list and then taking all but the most minor and adding births and deaths to the years in poetry list, but I kept finding that I couldn't add birth years for those who died in the late 19th century -- now I can do that and don't have to go back to the task just to add the birth years. It would probably be good to get the 18th century up all at once for the same reason, but I won't start that till I'm motivated.</p>
<p>I've become fascinated by <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Byron_c0e1.html" title="Lord Byron">Lord Byron</a>. I found this Web site that gives a chronology of his life, and it's fascinating. It also makes me want to find out more about him. If not "mad" he was certainly "...bad and dangerous to know", although the chronology makes it seem as if the women around him were more dangerous to him. He was also thunderously successful. He sometimes performed real kindnesses, but I also hear (elsewhere than in this chronology) that he could be cruel. If you're interested, here's a link:</p>

<p>That's odd, since to me it appears as though <i>you</i> are changing the subject matter of the "proposal" to fit <i>your</i> version of things. The notion that anyone <i>must</i> be notified in deletion debates has been brought up at pretty much all the XfD process talk pages and on the Pump at some point (note: it is for you to satisfy yourself of this - I am not going to dig through hundreds of pages of archived talk just to please you). Whether or not it has <i>specifically</i> come up at CfD is irrelevant, and to suggest that its "perennial" status does not apply to CfD in this respect smells awfully like a <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">lawyer</a> has stepped into the ring. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 23:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's precisely why I undid your edit. It is unsupported <i>in your opinion</i>. Hence, it is POV.

<dd>Yes, I disagree that the content is indispute. For it to be in dispute means that there is more than one malcontent user with a valid objection.
