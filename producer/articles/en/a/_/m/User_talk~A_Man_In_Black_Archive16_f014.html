<p>You have a great eye for detecting what is necessary and what isn't (aka cruft), so I was wondering if you could review the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedrun.html" title="Speedrun">Speedrun</a> article. It's at a staggering 77KB and I know it could be trimmed down a lot. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 19:36, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, it seems as though there's more approval of having a mere discussion topic on <a href="../../../b/u/l/Talk%7EBulbasaur_5097.html" title="Talk:Bulbasaur">Talk:Bulbasaur</a> in regards to your recent comments on WP:PCP than actually bringing Bulbasaur to a second FAR. I suggest, then, you bring the topic to Bulbasaur's talk page and have brainstorming sessions and discussions with everyone else on how to improve the Pokemon FAs and GAs. It may be overkill to put Bulbasaur through FAR right away. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">(I appreciate talk!)</a></sup></b> 03:11, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>no not really, at least i hope not&#160;:D neways, i was wondering if you'd weigh in on my proposal at <a href="../../../p/c/p/WT%7EPCP_5d8a.html#Species_uniformity" title="WT:PCP">WT:PCP#Species uniformity</a>, while i have a sinking feeling typical of my dealings with you, i <i>would</i> like some more input, and the subject has stagnated. I'm sure by now u've realized i like people to be as comprehensive as possible in their opinions - particularly if they're going to disagree with me&#160;;) and i suppose the questions i'd really like you to answer are how easy is it to implement? do you feel it makes useful improvements to the page? why/why not? what is the potential for negative server effects intrinsic to templates? are the {{<a href="../../../p/o/k/Template%7EPokePage_9d12.html" title="Template:PokePage">PokePage</a>}} instructions comprehensive? what should be the balance between less-pretty editing and coming closer to a real encyclopedia? what is the real potential for vandalism? is it any greater than other templates? i know you prolly will, but please look at the <a href="../../../e/e/v/Eevee.html" title="Eevee">Eevee</a> evolutions and their histories for a sample of how this <i>may</i> work. i (mostly) copied this from my request at Raven's Apprentice's talk page, but he's said he wants to see <i>your</i> reaction first (sighs). i'm only bothering you with this because it seems you're back... if the realworld is still preoccupying you, a friendly note on my talk page that u don't have the time is all i ask. thnx! -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 06:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i'm responding here b/c the PCP talk page has become very lengthy and i'd like to discuss one on one your concerns. I know i stated that i'm done with this, but i really feel it would be good for the encyclopedia as a whole. We agree on boilerplate prose (will remove it from {{<a href="../../../p/o/k/Template%7EPokePage_9d12.html" title="Template:PokePage">PokePage</a>}}), we agree on serverloads. You seem take issue with using small amounts of text in articles for consistency and professionalism. What are your thoughts, I wonder, about the widespread common use of {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../d/e/t/Template%7EDetails_302f.html" title="Template:Details">details</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../s/e/e/Template%7ESeealso_fc56.html" title="Template:Seealso">seealso</a>}}, and others, like those found on DAB pages and such? I've been accused of going against a norm, but in fact I'm expanding on a practice already encouraged in other areas. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ŒñŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅŒùŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 16:10, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey MB, I was wondering if you could please check out the List of MegaMan Battle Network viruses and see whether or not it's applicable for deletion in your eyes, and if it is, to delete it. I once put a proposed deletion notice on it for various reasons, but the creator of the article removed it for (legitimate) reasons, however, I really don't see how this page can get better if it continues down the road it's been going. The page is almost nothing but a bunch of headings, and where there is information, it isn't encyclopaedic (it's like a game guide), and there are users around who constantly add more headings, but no information (and even one in particular who continuously adds headings which are inapplicable to the prescribed title; ie. things that aren't viruses or things that are already listed on another page, and a heading for a completely different series). Thanks a lot. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 20:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again MB. Got a little problem with two other pages that needs to be dealt with. Both involve moving articles. In regards to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_Battle_Network_%28video_game%29_6cbc.html" title="Mega Man Battle Network (video game)">Mega Man Battle Network (video game)</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_Network_Transmission_c2c1.html" title="Mega Man Network Transmission">Mega Man Network Transmission</a>, both need to be moved so that their titles follow the format of all the <i>Battle Network</i> pages on Wikipedia ("MegaMan" as one word, as opposed to "Mega Man"). For the former, I had originally already moved it, but another user has since moved it back. I've tried moving the pages (the first one for the second time), but I keep getting an error message that says that pages by those titles already exist (I suspect some sort of redirect problem). Could you please move the pages to the proper titles? As they currently stand, they're causing lots of unnecessary link redirects throughout the <i>Battle Network</i> pages, which could otherwise be avoided if these two pages are in-line with the rest of the titles on Wikipedia. Thanks a lot. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 02:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Moved. Turns out MMNT was a cut and paste move from way back, so I did a history merge, too. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:24, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>MB, upon looking at the edit history of the user who moved the page, it turns out that he/she has moved all the other <i>Battle Network</i> pages as well (See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/TJ_Spyke" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/TJ_Spyke" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/TJ_Spyke</a>). I think something needs to be done about this to prevent it from happening again; the user's causing a lot of redirect problems by doing this. I'll leave it up to you to move the other pages back to their proper places, as I'm in a hurry right now. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 02:51, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay then. I wouldn't mind so much if the moves/changes were causing so many formatting/redirect problems, but since they are, it's a real problem; we do have to take into account the fact that we're not only dealing with the game pages here (there are individual character pages, etc. as well, so there are massive repercussions). I do also believe there has to be a certain consistency among all the articles, given that it seems very awkward given that both the anime/manga spell it as "MegaMan" (which would look very strange side by side with game pages as "Mega Man"). In the end, if we do settle on "MegaMan", I also think we need to rename the "Mega Man Battle Network characters" category as "MegaMan Battle Network characters" to correspond to the "MegaMan Battle Network" category (currently the former is the only <i>Battle Network</i> category that is not consistent, but I've never been able to change it since I'm not familiar with the process to rename a category) --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 03:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>We've reached a quick consensus. The titles will be spelt as "Mega Man" for the game titles, but the anime pages (NT Warrior and its corresponding media and release pg) will remain the same. Since I still cannot move the pages due to that error, I'll leave it up to you to put the pages into their proper spots (if they're not already), while I start going through the individual character pages to fix up the wordings and links. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 22:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Okay, here's how it stands. I've went through the individual character articles/anime page/character list and fixed all references to the game. I successfully moved both the character list and the first game to the new titles, but the rest of the games that are still spelt as one word I got the same error as before. I also edited both the Mega Man game template and the Battle Network template to reflect the changes, but the individual templates on all the game pages may be redirect links now, and need to be replaced. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 23:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Edit 2: Oh, the category "MegaMan Battle Network" also needs to be renamed "Mega Man Battle Network". (Is there a way we can do this without having to go through all the individual articles and changing the category after it's been renamed? Once it's been renamed, do all pages under the former title get noted under the new category title, or do we have to change the category name on each page manually afterwards? --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 23:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know a happy little campaign was fought to remove fair-use images from the pokemon episode lists. I made one little comment and left it at that. However, even though I know you have your own opinions about how things should be done... i was wondering if you had actually ever read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Fair_use_images_in_lists_0269.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Fair use images in lists">this</a>? One of the image-wanters had provided it, and I thought it odd you never voiced a response. Now, admittedly I care less about this than whether we merge <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weedle.html" title="Weedle">Weedle</a> with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weavile.html" title="Weavile">Weavile</a> or use boilerplate text for boilerplate information... but what about consensus? isn't that what wikipedia is about? If the consensus was to start allowing censorship then you would just have to suck it up. So why don't you on this? There are a lot of people who did a lot of work finding all those stupid little pictures, and to say they can't have them, when wikipedia says they can isn't very sensical. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ŒñŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅŒùŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 22:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Broad? I don't know... it seems to be specifically referring to free-use images in lists. What other applications does it purport to affect? And since when are factions simpler for <b>interpretation</b> of global policies than consensus? Wikipedia is <i>built</i> upon consenus. And that was not a "poll" about the popularity of <i>enforcing</i> <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, it was just one of several discussions that presented both interpretations of #3's use of "adequately" and #8's use of "significantly". Rather than whether FUC is <b>popular</b>, it shows your <b>interpretation</b> of FUC is in the minority - therefore the people who agree with you need to seek to argue more effectively, rather than force your opinions through your edits.

I really have no goal. I'm only asking you to reflect upon your stance regarding FUC images, seeing as how your interpretation has affected several aticles within the PCP while the precedents would consider your interpretation erroneous. You said that their was no consensus at this this dicussion?

In which case if you reviewed the arguments themselves you would see that a "No consensus" conclusion was premature at best, and glaringly inaccurate at worst. On the other hand, if you were saying the initial discussion i linked to you had no consensus, perhaps you missed the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Fair_use_images_in_lists_0269.html#Move_to_dismiss" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Fair use images in lists">move to dismiss</a> section.

<p>I want to know why you seemingly went against a consensus that agreed epiguides could have pictures (or rather, the lack of consensus that <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> could forbid them). And the quoting above wasn't an attempt to be selective. You said there was no consensus, i said there was, you then somehow disagreed saying there <i>was</i> consensus, i rebutted with an example saying <i>you</i> were the one saying there was no consensus - not me (the "I'm not sure how..." wasn't exactly relevant to the point i was making, that's what ellipses are for), you then apparently get annoyed with how i quoted you, i get annoyed thinking you're being condescending..... sigh.... ok starting over... read the first sentence of this paragraph again, and then also look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_episodes_%28season_1%29_5bb6.html" title="Talk:List of Pok√©mon episodes (season 1)">Talk:List of Pok√©mon episodes (season 1)</a>. if you agree and it's Ryulong who really wanted the images out of the lists then i only wonder why it seems you supported him b/c looking at the history it seemed you reverted an edit so he wouldn't have violated 3RR by removing the images over and over. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ŒñŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅŒùŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 06:52, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i'm going to assume good faith in that the people opposing the proposal aren't doing so just becuase they want their images, but because they genuinely feel that the images in lists contribute significantly (which is what FUC is about), just like i'm assuming good faith that those who support the proposal think that removing the images is in the best interest of wikipedia, and not just power-hungry admins. Cburnett, Angr, Quadell, Y|yukichigai, and Jkelly are the 5 of the 14 who oppose the prop for "not written right" reasons. (Peregrinefisher agrees with both the "Oppose section" and Cburnett which is illogical) The rest cite the above opposal section (except H2P reasoned very poorly), and at least provide explanations, which is more than the two people in "Support" say. In your favor, the best vote would be 7-7, but this is a third discussion and it has consistently ended with people feeling that images in lists contribute significantly enough to the articles to pass <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. if you read the talk page at the epiguide i linked above you'd see that i have a stipulation, the scene must show something <i>significant</i> from the episode (for example <i>The Totodile Dual</i> should prolly show Ash and misty battling with the Lure Ball in the background - as opposed to just a pic of the Totodile, or Ash, Misty, and Brock fishing) -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ŒñŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅŒùŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 08:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just wanted your take on the discussion there becuase of our past diasgreements about FUC. I think the editors who really wanted images in the pokemon epiguides were done a gross injustice because those removing the images were going agianst wiki consensus, and the discussion at PCP only lasted five days with relatively few poeple weighing in on such a controversial decision. Like i said, <i>I</i> don't care if there are images there or not, but it doesn't <i>seem</i> like you and Ryulong had the right to remove the images since there were obvisously people who <i>did</i> care and their interpreatation of <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> numers 3, 5, and 8 are in the clear majority. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ŒñŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅŒùŒ±œÄœÄŒµœÅ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 09:45, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My take is that dozens and dozens of images isn't going to be okay pretty much ever, given the tacit length limits on articles. (There's no way any article could have sufficient commentary on every image.) It would take some inspired and <i>case-specific</i> arguing to move me from that point. Whenever I get involved in any similar discussion, that's going to be my stance, but it's usually a big mess and I don't really like fiddling with episode lists unless they're utterly dire.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At this point, there is one clear consensus: <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">WP:PCP</a> pretty much as a whole doesn't feel that the Pok√©mon episode lists benefit substantially from having an image for each episode, or even images for exceptional episdoes (especially given the lack of a clear definition for exceptional). There's no other clear proposal that has gained consensus, and I haven't removed any images from any other episode lists. (I even helped the Yu-Gi-Oh guys get their images working, since I'm going to end up butting heads with them over more important issues.)</dd>

<dd>Other than that, picking apart the hows and whys and what got us to the current status quo doesn't do anything to benefit the encyclopedia.

<p>no offense taken, sorry if this was bothersome for you, i was really more just curious. however, i think it wrong to say that PCP as a whole felt that way since only six ppl participated in the actual discussion.

<dd>Oooooooooh, okay. I see. Reliable sources and no observation and that. In that case, do me a favor and delete the following pages.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the card lists can go, as the website only lists a few. I thought <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zane_Truesdale_3af5.html" title="Zane Truesdale">Zane</a> used more than just two monsters, I saw all his episodes and could have sworn it, but I guess since it isn't on the official site I must be wrong. Oh, and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Atticus_Rhodes_9941.html" title="Atticus Rhodes">Atticus Rhodes</a> isn't on the 4Kids site, so I guess he must not exist. And Aster, Sartorius, Amon Garam, Johan, oh, the Minor Characters page, 4Kids doesn't have them, so how can we source that page? We could say, watch the anime, but I forgot that isn'y allowed.</p>
<p>If you're going to be like that then all those pages should rightfully be deleted. I've tried to explain to you before, but you didn't listen: the official Yu-Gi-Oh! site gives little to no information. <a href="http://4kids.tv/yugiohgx/|" class="external text" title="http://4kids.tv/yugiohgx/|" rel="nofollow">see for yourself</a> how much info you can find on the show, hm? It's all games and card tips, nothing helpful really. Please try to have an open mind about this. The official sites for Yugioh are useless for the show. Fansites and direct observation are the only reliable sources we have because the official ones are not reliable. They call Zane's card "Cyberend Dragon" and Jaden's "Elemental Hero Blade Edge".</p>
<p>My point? We can't use the official site because it is not accurate nor reliable. Can you please try to understand that? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 17:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We do have sources, we have the episodes. I frankly don't care what Wikipedia's policies are on direct observation, that's all that works for Yugioh. If you want, I know of a site that can give you links where you can watch every episode on-line. As far as I'm concerned, that's all you need, and in this case it's all we have. And as far as fansites go, I'd trust Janime or Yu-Jyo over 4Kids' site any day of the week, because they have proven far more reliable. I don't see why this is so hard for you to accept. If we only go by the official site, then we might as well delete all the Yugioh Gx pages now because there'll be little to nothing left. This is the situation here, direct observation is all that works for this show, and if you won't accept that I'll find someone else who will. Hell, if I have to I'll take this to Jimbo Wales' talk page myself and plead my case. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 06:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You shouldn't write articles based on direct observation of the anime because direct observation is colored by your perception, which will inherently have certain biases. For one, you'll tend to assume that things that are important in the anime are actually important in the real world. Additionally, there will be no content save plot summary (which we ideally don't do on Wikipedia except to support other content) or personal interpretation/analysis (which is original research).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think you need to reassess your priorities. Set aside the primary sources for a moment and go see what you can find in the way of reliable secondary sources. Write articles based on those sources.

<p>Hey. I've been working on cleaning up the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Evil_9d23.html" title="Resident Evil">Resident Evil</a> articles. So far I'm working removing needless trivia and trying to reduce the fancruft/biography/plot summary on the most of the characters pages. I'm doing this in order to merge them, since many supporting characters in the series don't really warrant stand-alone characters. Admitedly I've created most of these articles a year or two ago, even though my original intentions was to cover only recurring main characters like Leon, Jill and the Redfield siblings.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's what I've done so far. I rewrote <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_STARS_members_in_Resident_Evil_42f3.html" title="List of minor STARS members in Resident Evil">List of minor STARS members in Resident Evil</a> from a real world perspective, covering most of the events of the game in real world order and mentioning retcons when they occur (especially whole Edward/Kevin thing). Here's a comparison to how it was before. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_minor_STARS_members_in_Resident_Evil&amp;diff=96613053&amp;oldid=95667664" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_minor_STARS_members_in_Resident_Evil&amp;diff=96613053&amp;oldid=95667664" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>I'm going to the same for subsequent <i>Resident Evil</i> games and create the following articles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters in Resident Evil 2 - covers the Birkins (including William, whose primary role was in RE2 and was only a supporting character in RE0), Chief Irons, Ben Bertolucci, HUNK, Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Characters in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis - covers Carlos, Nicholai, Mikhail, Tyrell, Murphy and Dario. The Nemesis as well if he isn't covered in the Creatures page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Characters in Resident Evil Code: Veronica - covers the Ashfords (especially Alexia and Alfred), Steve Burnside and Rodrigo.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Characters in Resident Evil 4 - covers Ashley, Luis, Hunnigan, Saddler, Krauser, Salazar and Mendez.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what to do with <i>Resident Evil Zero</i>, which only features three new characters (Billy Coen, James Marcus and Edward Dewey, whose already covered in the STARS list). Four if you're willing to stretch things and consider the Young Man in the White Robe as a seperate character from the older deceased Marcus. Nor do I know what to do with unseen characters like Ozwell E. Spencer that never appeared in a single game, but form part of the backstory. That could be resolve later. I'm intend to leave recurring characters' articles alone for now, working only to rewrite them from a real world perspective.</p>
<p>The Movies and Outbreak characters articles could all be merge into their respective list, perhaps leaving <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_%28Resident_Evil%29_a1b9.html" title="Alice (Resident Evil)">Alice</a> as a stand alone article if enough critical commentary can be added about her character. The problem is that I don't know much about these incarnations of the franchise other that what I procured from secondhand sources. I have no intentions of seeing the Resident Evil films. But we'll solve that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would appreciate any suggestion and input from you. Jonny2x4 22:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like you're right on the right track.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Random thoughts:
<ul>
<li>Try and organize lists in real-world ways instead of in-universe ways, when you're reorganizing. Characters in RE0 is better than STARS members. (I realize why the latter's organized that way, granted.)</li>
<li>Think about trying to merge games' lists of characters into the game article. I tried that with MGS3, and it didn't work out, but RE tends to be a little slimmer in story.</li>
<li>See about dismantling the monsters list. Try moving the ones that are characters (Nemesis, Nosferatu) to the characters list, and just neglect "Zombie spider" and "Zombie elephant" and "Mutant plant." - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:59, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well you just gave me an idea. I won't even bother making a RE0 characters page since there's only two new characters (not counting Edward) and there's not much to say about them without reiterating the plot of the game. So I'm gonna have <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Coen_ec68.html" title="Billy Coen">Billy Coen</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Marcus_b30a.html" title="James Marcus">James Marcus</a> redirect to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Evil_Zero_1610.html" title="Resident Evil Zero">Resident Evil Zero</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_STARS_members_in_Resident_Evil_42f3.html" title="List of minor STARS members in Resident Evil">List of minor STARS members in Resident Evil</a> could be transformed into STARS members in Resident Evil or Characters in the original Resident Evil and we could move Barry and Rebecca there, and possibly Spencer and the Trevors (if we go with the former route). Chris, Jill and Wesker would retain their stand-alone articles for the moment, along with Leon, Claire and Ada.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the creatures, I originally intended to segregate Nemesis and Nosferatu into the creatures list, since they're mostly considered enemy characters by the designers rather than standard human characters. However, I could see your argument for Nemesis, since he's prominent enough in the plot to consider him a full fledge character and Alexander is both, a human character and an enemy creature (Nosferatu), even if he doesn't appear as a human in the game. Besides, Resident Evil 4 blurs the line between humans and monsters with characters like Mendez, Krauser and even the Ganados themselves. I still think some of the more unique creature designs that aren't just overgrown zombified animals or insects like the Chimera, Hunters and Lickers deserve some sort of coverage at least.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Japanese <i>Biohazard</i> websites (as well as Resident Evil Archives) do feature some commentary about characters and creatures in the game, especially the website about the REmake. They're mostly just commentaries about designs, but sometime they offer insight about the development of characters/creatures and we could use that as reference.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I already done doing the rought draft of each list and I'm still open to your suggestions. Jonny2x4 05:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I merge almost all the articles into lists and a did a job cleaning up <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Resident_Evil_2_ccc1.html" title="Characters in Resident Evil 2">Characters in Resident Evil 2</a>. It still needs a bit of work. For example, I'm probably gonna to replace the hand-drawn conceptual artwork of Annette and Marvin with screenshots, since it doesn't reflect the CGI style that was used to officially promote the game.</p>
<p>Also, if the list doesn't get merge into one covering the series as a whole, then I will need to replace the Birkin and HUNK renders with screenshots as well to reflect their depictions in <i>RE2</i> (rather than their depictions in later games). Most of these descriptions ended up being shorter than I've imagined when I trimmed them down and I think I can still improve on them. The out-of-universe perspective seems preferable for the RE games, since many of these games often contain alternate scenarios depicting the characters dealing with the same situations in different ways (well at least the first three PS1 installments did) and it's hard to describe these differences in scenario from an in-universe perspective.</p>
<p>Anyway. Leave me your feedback on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Resident_Evil_2_ccc1.html" title="Characters in Resident Evil 2">Characters in Resident Evil 2</a> as I begin to work on the others. Jonny2x4 07:00, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your last edit, I'll say that my own concerns about the template and the "standard" you proposed are irrelevant, both in an edit summary and on your talk page. This is because neither involves discussion with other editors, in your project or mine.</p>
<p>At the moment, I have greater concerns about your conduct. You didn't contact our project when you started discussion of your proposal, so some of us were left unaware. We were told about it when someone had split the MK template in two.</p>
<p>Now, you are attempting to change the template yourself, and you seem to prefer causing an edit war, instead of discussing your proposal with us. All you've done is give your own point of view in justifying your changes, without giving guidelines for further alterations, and rejected anyone else's opinion completely. I didn't respond to the comments you've left at WP:MK, because you've said nothing to alter my opinion.</p>
<p>If you laid out your guidelines, in full, on the WP:MK talk page (it's hard to tell what the final guidelines are in the lengthy discussion at WP:CVG), and allowed us to discuss them, then I will have no problem with the consensus. Until you do, I will continue to revert any changes you make to this template. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobWill80_8bec.html" title="User:RobWill80">RobWill80</a> 16:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it's hard to inform anyone when I'm not aware of their existence. I let you guys know as soon as I realized that the project existed and was active; there are so many Wikiproject tags for more-or-less dead projects that I find myself ignoring them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, the standard is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_Navboxes_2230.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games/Navboxes">here</a>. (It's tagged proposed since there's some discussion about when/if to include upcoming games, and what color to make it of all things.) It lays out the hows and whys of the standard appearance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the decisions are arbitrary (centered text, blue color, spacing, bullets as separators), defined only to have a standard appearance in at least video game articles. Some of the things have reasoning behind them, which I hope is amply described there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm curious, though, why you haven't voiced your objections at <a href="../../../m/k/_/WT%7EMK_e15f.html" title="WT:MK">WT:MK</a>. There's one single objection to the changes I made there, made by a different user. You say the style change hasn't gotten consensus at <a href="../../../m/k/_/WP%7EMK_1b62.html" title="WP:MK">WP:MK</a>: it hasn't gotten any <i>response</i> at <a href="../../../m/k/_/WP%7EMK_1b62.html" title="WP:MK">WP:MK</a>.

<dd>Forgive me if I try to be brief. It's very early in the morning here, and I haven't slept yet. It's understandable that you didn't know of any active projects connected to WP:CVG when you made your proposal - It's not as if any of us are being paid to be here, are we? Now that I know why we weren't told, I don't have a problem with that part.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll read over the current proposal sometime today. I didn't respond to your comments at WP:MK because the previous discussion of the MK template split (which I was involved in) raised issues brought up in your proposal (that's how we were told). I believe that the main concern we had was over the ease of navigation, so the changes were reverted. I still have the same concerns about your proposal. Other WP:MK members may still share this opinion, have other issues, or are not bothered. That's why I've asked you to discuss your plans for the MK template with (the rest of) us before you proceed.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Personally, I agree with the aesthetic changes you're proposing, but I disagree with the severe limit on links in the template. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters_63a6.html" title="List of Mortal Kombat characters">characters</a> article you linked to was a good start, but it does no harm to link to some more categories that are related to the series, if only to make navigation more convenient. That's all that I'm prepared to say while I'm half-asleep, but if you have any more questions for me personally, I'll respond when I'm able to. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobWill80_8bec.html" title="User:RobWill80">RobWill80</a> 07:16, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What links do you think should be in the template that weren't in the standard appearance version? Linking categories is usually problematic; it's a one-way link, since categories don't usually have navboxes.</dd>

<dd>I'll reply to your main question at <a href="../../../m/k/_/WT%7EMK_e15f.html" title="WT:MK">WT:MK</a>, because this is what we should be discussing with the project. I will say that linking to categories shouldn't be too much of a problem. I think that most of our categorised articles usually have navboxes. If that fails, there is always the "back" button in web browsers. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobWill80_8bec.html" title="User:RobWill80">RobWill80</a> 21:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, I was referring to categories (as in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Category%7EWhatever_c730.html" title="Category:Whatever">Category:whatever</a>), not categorized articles.

<dd>I knew what you meant. I don't see a need for navboxes in the category namespace. Like I said, our categorised articles usually have navboxes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll pick some article names at random, just to explain what I meant (so you don't need to repeat your arguments here). Say if I was reading the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_Kombat_%28series%29_29e0.html" title="Mortal Kombat (series)">Mortal Kombat (series)</a> article, but I wanted to go to the article on <a href="../../../l/i/u/Liu_Kang_65db.html" title="Liu Kang">Liu Kang</a>. I could use the navbox to go to the "characters" category. Once at the category page, I don‚Äôt need the navbox, because I know that I want a character article. If I clicked on the wrong category, I use the web browser's "back" button. Once at the Liu Kang article, the same navbox is on that page to ease navigation.</dd>

<dd>Okay, let me repeat that first line for you: "I'll pick some article names at random, just to explain what I meant (so you don't need to repeat your arguments here)." In other words, don't read too much into the specific articles that I mentioned, because I wasn't assigning any value to them. I was explaining the process of selecting a category (or a list of articles, if you wish) in a navbox to get to another article. Fair enough? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobWill80_8bec.html" title="User:RobWill80">RobWill80</a> 07:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe I wasn't clear. How do you know what member of the category you want? Either you know the name of the category member, or you need the context of a list or umbrella article. A bare list of category members isn't very helpful.</p>
<p>Some of the same problems apply to linking to a category as to linking directly to the members of that category, but I was simply pointing out how those problems still apply to the specific case. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You misunderstood me when I was talking about linking to categories. At this point, you reset the page indent to comment. I wanted the discussion to move on to WT:MK, so my reply was addressing the misunderstanding <b>only</b>, by using the names of specific pages to clarify.</li>

<p>I think the latest additions to your talk page sum up how the community is viewing you. Stop being so obsessive on the rules (especially on anti-fancruft and fair use images, of which are countrvesal in their own regard) and start actually contributing to the community.

<dd>I humbly disagree with Dynamo here. We need to be harder on fair use images than we are now, because if someone does sue us, we are going to be in the press again and for the wrong reasons. <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> is not negiotable.

</dl>
<p>Pardon me, but I must decline the bulk of this advice.</p>
<p>I've noticed that there are a lot of people who disagree about both the issues of fair-use images and use of plot summary. (Let's discard terms like fancruft; the stigma on these terms means they are useless for civil discussion.) Some aren't ever going to be convinced; such is the nature of volunteer project politics.</p>
<p>I have, however, in the past been successful in convincing users that fair-use images need to be used with caution. (Ask <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bread_c594.html" title="User:The Bread">The Bread</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Bread_102a.html" title="User talk:The Bread">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Bread_e88c.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Bread">contribs</a>) or one of the <a href="../../../t/v/s/WP%7ETVS_4679.html" title="WP:TVS">WP:TVS</a> users whose name I've forgotten). I have also been successful in convincing users that an out-of-universe perspective minimizing unneccessary plot summary (ask <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckiller</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deckiller_d5af.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deckiller">contribs</a>) and Jonny2x4 (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonny2x4_9667.html" title="User talk:Jonny2x4">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jonny2x4_d6fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jonny2x4">contribs</a>)). While I'm still successfully convincing others, then I'm reasonably confident that my arguments have some validity.</p>
<p>As for the rest, I really do need to spend more time writing; it's easier to spend short sessions doing merges and cleanup than totally rewriting articles, so I've been doing more of the former than the latter. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:24, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_Archive16_f014.html" title="Edit section: Animal Crossing Series Template">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Animal Crossing Series Template</span></h2>
<p>In re the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Template%7EAnimal_Crossing_series_63c3.html" title="Template:Animal Crossing series"><i>Animal Crossing</i> Series Template</a> and the template <a href="../../../a/n/i/Template_talk%7EAnimal_Crossing_series_41ea.html" title="Template talk:Animal Crossing series">discussion page</a>.</p>
<p>First off, reverting an edit that changes (name wise) <i>Animal Forest</i> to <i>D≈çbutsu no Mori</i> when there is a discussion about that change going on is not a minor edit.</p>
<p>I said in my edit summary to see the Animal Forest talk page about that discussion. Or rather, I suppose the <a href="../../../d/%C5%8D/b/Talk%7ED%C5%8Dbutsu_no_Mori_cd93.html" title="Talk:D≈çbutsu no Mori">D≈çbutsu no Mori talk page</a>. Instead, you simply reverted the edits. If you wanted to undo the (GameCube) that was left back in, or fix it so that there was no redirect, that would be one thing. But you simply went and reverted the edit, and you marked it as a minor edit. It wasn't a minor edit. Minor edits on templates are fixing &amp;nbsps, not changing anything that is a matter of contention--even if the other party is wrong. If there is a conflict about something and you are changing it, it isn't a minor edit.</p>
<p>It also appears that the "(GameCube)" issue hasn't been settled as I thought it was. I spent time trying to talk to you about the (GameCube) issue which you have been so intent on reverting. You stopped replying to the conversation, but were still active on Wikipedia and even made some edits on the template in question. I waited four days and then made the edit. You reverted it the same day. I've tried to discuss this issue with you, but you seem to not want to talk about it. You've made up your mind--you're right and I'm wrong. You don't seem to want to listen to me or respond to my questions, which makes it very hard to get anywhere. I've responded to what you said, but the discussion has stopped there really--you just rephrase what you've said before.</p>
<p>I'm really tired of this really minor thing which has been turned into an edit war. I don't get it. I agree with your position--there really is only one thing in the world called "Animal Crossing". You can find all of the points I've made on the talk page--I linked to it at the top like you wanted. Obviously, it's a difference of opinion that isn't going to be settled. I'm going to continue to believe that people can and will be confused for all of the reasons I mentioned, and you're going to believe that they won't be.</p>
<p>But I still don't understand why you've turned this into a revert war. If I'm right, and it's not there, users will be confused and can't find what they're looking for. That's bad. That's why I'm fighting for it. If you're right and it is there, then there is one extra word in the template. What is so bad about that? It's not worse than confused users.</p>
<p>I'd really like to see this dispute resolved, and I'm pretty sure that that involves discussion. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 08:51, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>I've created four game-specific since I last talk to you. They are:</p>

</ul>
<p>So far, they only contain the main human characters from each game and I haven't gotten around to adding the enemy creatures Nemesis and Nosferatu yet. I also merge all of the Outbreak-specific characters into the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Resident_Evil_Outbreak_45b1.html" title="Characters in Resident Evil Outbreak">Outbreak list</a> and all the useless movie characters into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_the_Resident_Evil_films_34b8.html" title="Characters in the Resident Evil films">Characters in the Resident Evil films</a>. I experimented with the idea of merging all four game-specific lists and (the STARS members list) into one article, but came out it around 36-38kb long. I'll trim down the two creatures list next.</p>

<dd>He does make one good point, which is that game news sites of all sorts are horrid at getting the game plots right.

<dd>Doesn't his rant miss the fact that Tiger had good reason to cook up anything to promote the Game.com late in its life?

<p>I'm not gonna take a side either way, but tjstrf is right in respect to how Gamespot and IGN can fuck up alot in regard to plot summary of games. Snake Soup and MGS:TUS get the plot down pat because they are MGS fanatics (same applys to all other game fansites) IGN and Gamespot get it wrong because they cover all games. It presents a problem, in regard to plot summary you know that MGS:TUS are right, but IGN is reliable. What to you go with? It's definately a good argument for using primary material to source plot summary unless WP:RS is changed in regard to plot summary <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bread_c594.html" title="User:The Bread"><font color="#FF0000"><b>‚Ä†he Bread</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Bread_102a.html" title="User talk:The Bread"><sup><font color="#3FFF00">3000</font></sup></a> 03:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest that Wikipedia should cover the plot in only broad terms, unless the plot is itself a subject of commentary. It suffices, for example, to say that MGS3 has a complicated plot about the Cold War, the origin of Big Boss, and predecessor to Metal Gear, set in late 1960s, without explaining it point by point.

<p>I have been told that Sites that provide episode summaries are acceptable, and episodes can be used as long as I'm careful to use a Neutal POV. Tokyo TV is NOT a fansite, it's an official site. It IS a third-party source. Your second argument is void.</p>
<p>As for the first...okay, personal interpretation is not allowed, my own imput isn't...but my data can't be accepted on the grounds it's not commentary or analysis? You're contradicting yourself. If I am to provide commentary or analysis of a subject in an article, I'm violating the Neutral POV rulings. Make up your mind.</p>
<p>Honestly, it seems like you're just looking for excuses now. I have two sources, both of which I've been told are acceptable by the Help Desk, one of which is an official site, and even if it is now required, if I recreate the article I will be following Benten's example and citing episodes for specifics. Really, you have no stable grounds to refuse me. I have two reliable, acceptable sources and can provide citations. What more do you want?

<p>First, it would not be a recap article, the information would simply be taken from episode summaries and the episodes and written in an encyclopedic manner. Second, I've explained before that the site is not a fansite, it is an official site.

<p>Um, the Blue-Eyes page seeming like a game guide may be due in part to it being part of a game. As it is, there really aren't any official sources as we've all covered before. That's the main reason I want this to end, we've gone over Yugioh's lack of sources countless times and it's gotten us nowhere.</p>
<p>It's bad in particular for the original Yugioh, because now a lot of the Yugioh pages carry GX info and have ditched the old series, so finding reliable sources for any of the original articles will be a pretty lost cause. For example, tyoe "Blue-etc Dragon" into Google, it's mostly places you can buy the card.</p>

<p>Actually, hold on. I may have something, although I don't know if you would consider it reliable. What about the Bekcett Yugioh/Anime collector magazines? Both are officially published sources that give information on Yugioh (although the one obviously gives more info than the other).

<dd>Don't worry about official, and look outside of fan-oriented publications. I don't know the quality of the Beckett magazine, but see what info you can find that's about the <i>real world</i>, not the fictional one. These articles are sorely lacking in real-world info, and the sort of sources you want will probably be talking about the real world. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once again you make no sense. Real world? What real-world information, Yugioh isn't real world info. But, to be quite honest, I don't care anymore. I've explained to you time and time again Yugioh's lack of reliable, non-fan-based sources, but you don't seem to be listening. So...edit and delete whatever you want. I don't give a crap anymore. I've tried to find you reliable sources but you continue to find reasons to discredit them or just outright ignore my efforts, so...whatever. If you hate the Blue-Eyes page so much delete it like you have so many others.</p>
<p>As a final note, I notice at the top of your talk page you mention that people yelling at you is becoming common. I'm wondering if you've ever thought about why that it. To be honest, you're an Admin, good for you. But I remember all the trouble you've caused on the Yugioh pages for no good reason, and when I look at your contributions, I just see removal of content and justification of it on talk pages. Removing content on articles, sourced or not, does not improve them. So try something different one day, and instead of just blindly quoting some Wiki-policy to defend such removals, see if you yourself could find sources and improve articles yourself. Because in all honesty, it makes me a little sad that I look at an Admin's contributions and see a sea of removal and reverts.</p>
<p>But, if our history has taught me anything you've just shrugged off everything I just said. Now don't think I'm trying to have the last word, if you reply, I'll read it, but I don't plan to reply back. Simply put, you're like a Cop: You're just trying to solve the problem by avoiding it and ignoring the cause of the problem. Just as slapping people in jail doesn't stop crime, removing unsourced content isn't going to make sources magically appear. Consider that next time you delete content. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 17:07, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hoo hah, wow. This series of debates around a game card have become so drawn out that I feel like butting in and providing my input as both a supporter of the community and a former Yu-Gi-Oh casual fan. I'm gonna try to work out some logic for the parties involved as Erik the Mediator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll get the not-so-relevant stuff out of the way first. The yelling detail at the top of the talk page was put there in September 2005 (I checked), so it was more or less a humorous note from a long time ago. As for Black's contibutions, I've always been under the general impression that that's what an admin does and is supposed to do. I'll explain; It seems to me that administrators, as users versed in Wikipedia's labrynthine (and too lengthily written IMO) policies, are given the power to revert and delete based on those policies, and they are meant to cite those policies in such edits. Other administrative activities include handling templates with esoteric syntax. Whereas standard users such as Drake Clawfang and myself are the ones who actually create the content of Wikipedia. Users create while Admins destroy; that might be a controversial way of putting it, but I think it's accurate. It's like two sides to the same coin, and both sides are necessary to create good articles. Can anyone honestly point me to an Administrator who creates content just as much as he removes it? I don't think so, because I don't think that would be an Administrator who does his duties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think A Man In Black has a reputation for replying rather curtly and to-the-point to those seeking input from him, and in my opinion he does not add enough explanatory text to back up the points of his reply, only bothering to do that when the discussion draws out and turns harsh. See how I reply to posts on my talk page to see how I think responses should be like. But he is <i>extremely</i> well-versed in those densely-written policy pages such as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Don't think I'm going out of my way to defend AMIB, though; there were several points in the past when I was legitimately irritated by the administrative things he does, such as speedily deleting several fourth-generation Pokemon articles when Diamond and Pearl were released months ago even though it was obvious those articles would be recreated shortly afterward, but those sentiments never last long because I would come to realize how it perfectly conforms to policy. So, I always think AMIB's edits are made in good faith; whether he views the efforts of users like Clawfang as good faith all the time is for him alone to address.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, now for the actual relevant issues being debated here. I was somewhat startled and taken aback when I first saw separate pages on <a href="../../../b/e/w/BEWD_5952.html" title="BEWD">BEWD</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Magician_1270.html" title="Dark Magician">Dark Magician</a> on Wikipedia some time ago. Separate articles on game cards? I really don't think that could possibly work out, main reason being that a game card from a card game is most likely based on something that violates No Game Guide. Wikipedia, unfortunately, is the sort of environment where even a separate article on a Pokemon like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charizard.html" title="Charizard">Charizard</a> is iffy. Charizard is one of the most famous Pokemon, and, I might add, had a trading card that was as notable then as the BEWD is nowadays. Charizard is a character who has made notable appearances in several, various media forms, such as video games, anime and movies, manga, merchandising, and the Pokemon card game, while BEWD is a playing card whose dragonic depiction is only also seen in the anime from time to time. So if Charizard is so hard to source and work with that it can't even be a Good Article, what chance do you think the Blue-Eyes White Dragon game card has for being a full encyclopedia article? All this is what I would use to defend my personal stance that game cards shouldn't have separate articles, and my stance wouldn't be any different if AMIB and his policy mongering weren't around. Drake, you can prove me wrong if you can provide a link to a trading game card article for any card game that has reached Good Article status.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Drake Clawfang had come to me to discuss this subject instead of coming to AMIB, I would have advised him to merge all separate articles on YuGiOh cards into a single List of notable YuGiOh trading cards. The casual reader of Wikipedia would rather see that than separate pages on separate cards for a card game. Let's not forget; Wikipedia, as a general encyclopedia, should accomodate <i>casual</i> readers from the internet in general. For YuGiOh fans, it should be the YuGiOh wiki that has separate pages on separate cards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's a little saddening to see two good-faith users coming to blows over this subject simply because both have slight issues with assuming defects in each other's conduct (I say that as a neutral third party), so I came here to provide my input to see how well I can restore logic. I hope you two read all this carefully, as it took me a friggin' hour to type. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup>(<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">Appreciate</a>|<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_Keepers_dd6d.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator/Keepers">Donate</a>)</sup></b> 22:31, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yu-Gi-Oh, as all fictional works, has two realities: the fictional reality, where Chazz and Yugi go on adventures, and the real reality, where they're entertainment works and such that children enjoy. What role do these subjects have in the latter world? The info about the fictional reality is only useful for this project insofar as it lends context for the info about the real reality.</p>
<p>Merging the cards is a good start, but the ultimate goal is to add more info about the real reality, about what publications in the real world are saying about these anime and manga series and card games in the real world. This isn't the sort of thing you can learn from watching the episodes, and it's the info you're always going to be missing if your only sources are plot summaries or the episodes themselves and if your only content is plot summary.</p>
<p>I see that you're deciding which cards are important enough to mention on the "Notable Yu-Gi-Oh cards" list. How are you deciding this? How are you going to justify which cards are important or not without just imposing personal opinion? The answer, again, is <i>reliable sources</i>. Find the cards publications are writing about, then use those publications to write the article. Don't impose your own personal opinion; that's not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> but it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:09, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The matter you raise of the two realities, then, gives birth to the problem that what's notable in the anime is not notable in the real game. Blue-Eyes and Dark Magician are very important in the anime, but real, pro players could care less. In real-life, the notable cards are Monarchs, Cyber Dragons, Searchers, etc. So in the real-life reality, I doubt there's a lot to go on with the written sources for that because no one who plays professionally cares about Blue-Eyes and DM. They're considered useless noob cards and the only people who have them are the ones who collect them for fun. Conversely, those cards that are important in real life often have very little relevance to the anime. If you ask a pro what a Searcher or a Monarch is, they can snap out an answer. As an anime fan, and they'll be be like "huh?" It's an odd paradox to be sure, but the cards that are important to the anime aren't to the real game and vice-versa, with the lone acception of Cyber Dragon, who is played in the real world because of his effect and not his connection to yin and yang and what-have-you.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not offering this as an excuse, I agree entirely that there are two ways to designate a card as notable. The problem lies in those ways being radically different. The anime characters typically play cards to symbolize their character or because they're cool. Real duelists play cards that are powerful and win. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 06:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

So there's the further problem of the real-game being marketted according to what's being done the anime.</p>
<p><br />
You missed the third way, the <i>only way that matters on this project:</i> the card is important enough to have been the subject of comment in reliable publications. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As mentioned, there is the Beckett Yugioh Collector Magazines that frequently give articles on deck-types and commonly played and sought-after cards.

<p>Um...I fail to see what that has to do with the sourcing issue.</p>
<p>Anyway, as a further note to your previous reply, sources aside for what is notable, just because a card is sourced does not, in turn, make it notable.

<dd>Canon is not the most important attribute in identifying fighting games. Tekken 6 exists in hypothetical form only, with no final name, release date, or playable demo. You crammed a bunch of unimportant in-universe stuff into the template (Devil Gene? Mishima Karate?), which is what categories are for.</dd>

<p>The Pink Floyd reference that you removed from the trivia section is substantiated in a number of places, and the <i>Animals</i> symbolism forms the foundation for much of the film. If it's sources you are after, simply add a fact tag, but as it stands, this piece of information is in the process of being moved into a section of its own. It's not anecdotal in any way but a key metaphor in the film. ‚Äî<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 07:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, we're on the same page. See my comments on talk. It's just that a cite request works better in some situations. As for a new section, it could easily be put into a new homage section, but we are really dealing with thematic exposition, so I'm still trying to put these things together. If you remove anything else, could you comment it out and leave a msg on the talk page?

<p>It's kind of amazing that I can't find an admin when I need to, I have to go down lists of them... anyway, I have a rather peculiar situation I'd like your input on. Basically, this user contacted me, regarding some questionable admin actions and his blocking. He's still banned, and his appeal was shot down, <i>also</i> possibly under expedient circumstances. My questions are twofold- one, can you be blocked for the following action: calling a mod a 'blowfish' (I am not making this up) and then adding a page to your user space entitled 'black list' and put the admin's comments you disagreed with there? That was as far as I know the only infarction. Secondly, how would I go about bringing this up to the proper people? See, the caveat is that this all happened on the <i>Hebrew</i> wikipedia, and out of the blue this user found me and asked me to help (maybe he thinks that since my name is David I'm Jewish and <i>know</i> Hebrew?). He's got a substantial case, actually, from what I can make out, but I really have no idea how to proceed, as Arbitration/mediation on another language wiki seems rather absurd.</p>
<p>P.S. 101 KB talk page? Mayhaps you should archive it some time, just a thought.</p>
<p>Oh, and just thinking about what you said all that time ago on Wikiproject Halo- you were right. <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>D√•vid ∆íuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 21:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
