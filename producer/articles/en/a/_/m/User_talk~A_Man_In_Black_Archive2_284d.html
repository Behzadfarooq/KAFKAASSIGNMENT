<p>I've been away recently and have just now had a chance to review your revision of the iPod article. I still don't like it--I believe criticism sections are an important part of any article about subjects that attract controversy--but it's a lot better than it was before, and while the article is still absurdly pro-IPod, at least it's not a total whitewash anymore. I appreciate the effort you've taken to alleviate my concerns, and I'm not going to start an edit war about this.</p>
<p>(I trust you'll be doing the same regarding the criticism sections in the articles about <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike%2C_Inc._7cbe.html" title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a> now, too. Looking forward to it.) --<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">PHenry</a> 05:15, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>May I ask why it is so important to you that this article, alone among all the thousands of articles on Wikipedia, not have a criticism section? It's becoming increasingly difficult for me to assume you're acting in good faith here. You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PHenry&amp;diff=14717439&amp;oldid=14717409" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PHenry&amp;diff=14717439&amp;oldid=14717409" rel="nofollow">told me</a> that you'd "rather see ugly Criticism sections gone whereever possible," yet as far as I can tell you've never tried to eliminate or integrate criticism sections on any page anywhere <i>except this one</i>, where you've deleted it at least four times after at least two people have tried to start it. As every editor except you seems to support--or at least tolerate--the existence of this section, I'm restoring it <b>again</b>. If you intend to continue pursuing this particular white whale, I suggest taking the matter directly to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RFC</a>. --<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">PHenry</a> 22:34, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why haven't I moved onto other articles? If you must know, I got sidetracked onto a Wikiproject, where <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="PokÃ©mon">the only relevant criticism section</a> cannot be logically integrated into the text of the article is a less awkward way. I fiddled with some drafts of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, but I decided not to take on another contentious issue when I was in the middle of arguing for a major merge project.</dd>
<dd>Two people? I haven't noticed anyone but you start a criticism section, save for someone who started a section about the supposed non-randomness of the random shuffle feature of the iPod. I wasn't even the one to revert that.</dd>
<dd>Right now, I don't feel like fighting the status quo on dozens of heavily-trafficked articles while I'm busy fighting the status quo elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>You seem to be under the impression that I'm trying to eliminate <i>criticism</i> of the iPod. I don't own one. I don't wish I owned one. I don't have any love (or hate, for that matter) for the iPod. What I <i>don't</i> like is having any negative POV sequestered into one little corner of the article, and I also don't like vague, unsourced "criticism."</dd>
<dd>If you want to know why I'm still watching this article, it's because this is a clearcut example of an article where a Criticism header is inappropriate. All of the criticism is criticism of topics dealt with elsewhere in the article.</dd>
<dd>You still haven't answered the specific point about the <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> article; why not criticize the battery life and non-replaceable battery in the context of the battery? Why not note the lack of support for certain formats in the same place as the mention of what formats it does suppport? Why not talk about the vertical monopoly in the context of the ITMS (as the grand majority of iPod users use un-encumbered AAC or mp3 files, which don't enter into a monopoly of any kind)? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 23:18, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, Man in Black, you may have noticed that I've been nominating various webcomics for deletion. Most of them are going through the process as normal, but 2 have had various sock puppets. You seem to know your webcomics better than I do, and have voted both ways in the nominations. If you have the time, I'd like you to take a look at these two.</p>

<dd>I appreciate this heads-up, and I'd appreciate if you could keep me in the loop on any future nominations you make. Most of these webcomics aren't very significant, but some of them are and just have bad articles. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 05:57, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your comments, I only asked for your input on the ones which had sockpuppeteering going on. I do value your input to the discussions, but am wary of setting up a list as such, in case:
<ul>
<li>I am accused of electioneering</li>
<li>It turns into a hitlist for extreme inclusionists (see <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>But if you just check the latest <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_September_30_3572.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 September 30">Afd page</a>, and scroll down, you'll see numerous webcomics listed. I will be going to university soon, and my wikipedia time will probably fall along due to lack of internet access for the first few weeks, so there might not be any in the next few weeks. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:10, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>I have a slight problem with you merging the pages. Although I do agree ones like Panther Caroso, Aparoid Queen, and some others are ok, I do not agree that Krystal and the Aparoids shoudl br relegated to the page. Krystal was a <b>major</b> character in Adventures, and the aparoids are the <b>major</b> enemy in Assault. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbrand_4de8.html" title="User:Thunderbrand">Thunderbrand</a> 00:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Krystal is borderline; she isn't unto herself an encyclopedic topic, but that list may not be the place to merge her. As for the Aparoids, if you'd rather, you could just delete them from that page and redirect <a href="../../../a/p/a/Aparoid.html" title="Aparoid">Aparoid</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Star_Fox%7E_Assault_737f.html" title="Star Fox: Assault">Star Fox: Assault</a>, while adding any plot info that isn't already in that article.</dd>
<dd>I was pondering a "List of main characters in Star Fox" or somesuch, or lists by affiliation, which would solve the Krystal problem (as well as my ambivalence about the lesser members of the Star Fox team, Wolf, Gen. Pepper, etc.) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:10, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I cleaned-up the <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near_Vertical_Incidence_Skywave_c190.html" title="Near Vertical Incidence Skywave">Near Vertical Incidence Skywave</a> page to make it appropriate for Wikiepdia. I removed the Wifi stuff, and added a simple explanation of what NVIS really is.</p>
<p>basically, NVIS is a radio propogation mode that is especially useful in communicating over the horizon in circumstances where VHF isn't useful. Sometimes you want to communicate with a station on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortwave.html" title="Shortwave">shortwave</a> thats too far for groundwave and too far for traditional skywave. This is called the <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skip_zone.html" title="Skip zone">skip zone</a>. So, basically, NVIS allows you to communicate into the <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skip_zone.html" title="Skip zone">skip zone</a>. This is useful for emergency or mmilitary applications.</p>

<p>I think you're taking this too far - or not far enough, perhaps?<br />
Maybe both. Going so far on a guideline that few follow (and thusly, this should be a blockable offense, yes?).<br />
And not going far enough because you succumb to a group of users (Final Fantasy) who want to keep their character articles.<br />
And, of course, you're going light. I hope you're going to go after the PokÃ©mon articles, or one may feel that you're biased. --<a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:18, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>started</i> with the PokÃ©mon articles. (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Johto_Gym_Leaders_ba71.html" title="List of Johto Gym Leaders">List of Johto Gym Leaders</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hoenn_Gym_Leaders_1278.html" title="List of Hoenn Gym Leaders">List of Hoenn Gym Leaders</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Orange_Islands_Gym_Leaders_a5c2.html" title="List of Orange Islands Gym Leaders">List of Orange Islands Gym Leaders</a> were all merged by me, and I've got a proposal to knock out the majority of the nn people, places, and things on the PokÃ©mon world into lists or the source works pending.) Right now, I'm picking off one-sentence stubs and other easy merge candidates, while working on some really tough cases (the Metal Gear list, for example) to cut my teeth on doing major merges like this.</dd>
<dd>The only reason I haven't taken on the FF articles is because I'm not knowledgeable about several of the games, and because, well, it's going to be a metric fuckton of work because there are a bajillion FF stubs, and the FF Wikiproject seems to be doing a fairly decent job of cleaning them up on their own without me butting in.</dd>
<dd>Were I to butt in, I'd have to establish that I knew what I was talking about (no mean feat, because I don't, as far as most of the FF series minutiae goes) and <i>then</i> have this same argument with anyone who wanted to defend this or that article on a minor subject. <i>Then</i> I'd have to go through the rigamarole on who does or does not transcend the source work (no question that Cloud and Aeris do, but does Tifa? Does Squall? Does whoeverthefucktheprotagonistofFFXisIcan'tremember?) I know this is true because it's exactly what happened with the PokÃ©mon projects.</dd>
<dd>Right now, my only major bias is my comfort level with the subject matter. It's just your bad luck that I can converse intelligently on Nintendo-related fancruft, rather than Gundam or Harry Potter. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:30, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Implied in your comments is "...and leave the stuff I'm working on alone!" With all due respect, no. I'll get to other things in due time, but I'm going to continue to make reasonable efforts to appropriately deal with articles on subjects that I feel are not encyclopedic subjects unto themselves.

<p>I don't get it. Are you trying to accuse me of hypocracy here? I'm mostly picking on things I like, rather than going out of my way to nail other fandoms as "unimportant and non-notable." There's more cruft than I can take on all at once, so I'm covering things as I come to them.</p>

<dd>Probably not.

<p>I am merging these articles because articles about characters who haven't transcended their source material are inevitably lists of trivia, substantive duplication of the article on the source material (the John Galt/Atlas Shrugged argument), or unexpandable stubs.

<dd>Yes, and you cannot enforce a guideline. You have zilch for an argument of why these articles should be merged. View this: Guideline | Policy. One side is enforcable, the other side is not. Those exceptions are exceptions because they reach a certain size and quality. Just like Lakitu did. If WP:FICT is enforcable, then that would make anyone going against it going against policy.

<p>I was asked by Alink to look into the wp:fict criteria. I thought points #2, #3, and #4 were OK. I found #5 to flatly wrong - we don't set artificial limits on the sizes of our articles like that.

<dd>#5 seems to be more an argument against splitting off plot summary subpages, something I haven't seen anyone do...well, pretty much ever.

<p>Hi there. You voted on the above AFD to "delete and redirect", which I'm not sure is actually possible. Did you mean delete the page and recreate it as a redirect? If so, I thought you may wish to clarify that. I've just commented on the AFD myself, and happen to think it should simply be deleted outright, for reasons stated. Thanks!

<dd>You're thinking of "delete and merge," which is incompatible with the GFDL unless a history merge is performed. "Delete and redirect" is a common vote, and implies "Delete and [replace with a] redirect." I don't really see any need to clarify; any admin closing an AFD is going to be familiar with the typical votes. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:07, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I certainly wasn't thinking of "merge and delete"; I specifically asked you if you meant "delete the page and recreate it as a redirect". From this note I gather that that is, indeed, what you meant. It is an unusual vote, correctly used only when the editor believes that the history of the article preceding the redirect should, for some reason, be destroyed. I have sometimes seen editors combine vote shorthands in uncommon ways that do not express what they actually meant, and a friendly note seeking clarification sometimes does help to clarify things. Finally, you may wish to note that there are three ways of satisfying the attribution requirements of GFDL when "merge and delete" is performed; a history merge is just one, and the most laborious, of the lot.

<ul>
<li>Well, the history merge certainly is the best known, probably because it is intuitively what you might expect has to be done. It's also a pretty crappy way of having to spend an evening though, I'd imagine! A second way is to do the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Decide on all the bits from Source Article (SA) that you want to merge in the Target Article (TA).</li>
<li>Go to the Talk page of TA, and create a subpage (much like you create an archive page). Title it something suitable, like "Article History of SA". Copy and paste the history of SA on that subpage.</li>
<li>Merge the stuff from SA to TA; in the edit summary, write that this edit is a Merge from SA, and the attribution history of SA may be found in [[Talk:TA/Article History of SA]]</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>You can do this because GFDL merely requires that attribution is preserved; it does not compel attribution to be preserved only in the history logs. It is arguable that a good edit summary as in 3 goes some way in preserving a record of sorts in the logs, anyway.</dd>
<dd>The third and IMHO best method manages to find a balance between the very correct but very laborious history merge method, and the acceptable but perhaps not fullproof Talk page copy-paste method. It is as follows:
<ol>
<li><i>Move</i> the article from SA to some article R, R being a suitable title of the closer's choice. R should be a page that has not existed prior to the move, and which will serve as a useful redirect to TA.</li>
<li>Delete the now formed redirect page at SA.</li>
<li>Merge the content of R into TA in the usual manner (ie. such as when you do "merge and redirect"). Once you've finished the merge into TA, make R a redirect. In this way, you preserve attribution history and also leave a useful redirect at R. R's history has the advantage of being a real history page, such that one may look up the individual edits of any user who made contribs to SAâthe inpossibility of which is the one weakness of method 2 above (copy-paste).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>There is actually a fourth wayâthe simplest, but I'm not quite sure of its compatibility with GFDL yet. I'll tell you about it when I am&#160;:).

<p>Other precendents show that the main article is under the stage name, not the real name. See the singer, Pink, Madonna, Sting et al.</p>
<p>I would like to change it back, but am writing you first for your thoughts.</p>
<p>I would like to change it back to "Natasha" article disambiguating to "Natasha (radio presenter)" and put the main text there, and redirect "Natasha Desborough" to "Natasha (radio presenter)". That makes sense since her listeners know her by that name, "Natasha".</p>
<p>Let me know what you think given the precedents.</p>

<dd>In general, it's a bad idea to have parenthetical names if you can at all avoid it. It's one thing to use an obvious stage name when that's the only name the person goes by, even in their private life, but in this case she's just using her first name as an on-air name.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think about it this way; the real name preferable to the stage name with a parenthetical if a news story about something happening to her would use her real name instead of her stage name. If she were in a car accident, for example, a newspaper story about her would probably say, "Natasha Desborough, known to BBC Radio 6 listeners as 'Natasha,' was struck by a rabid emu..." or even just "Natasha Desborough, noted BBC Radio 6 presenter..."</dd>
<dd>That said, I'm not strongly invested in this argument. I'll leave it to your discretion; if you're not moved by this argument, I have no objections to a revert. You're clearly more knowledgeable about the woman in question to make a judgement call. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:34, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I take your points. Thanks for your thoughts. I have seen a lot of articles with parentheses after a name or title to disambiguate. I agree that it's better without it, if possible. I'll not jump to change it without thinking it over in light of what you counseled. Sometimes, radio broadcasters do not broadcast their surnames and, to the public at large, the surname is unknown, at least in a first pass, for superficial privacy reasons. I'll work it out.

<dd>Actually, that's a point I hadn't considered. Well, let me add another exception to my rule of thumb; if the presenter is not a public figure and is known to the public only by the radio persona. That's a variation of the news rule of thumb; if she weren't a public figure at all, it'd be reported "Noted BBC Radio 6 personality Natasha was devored by enraged raccoons today..."</dd>

<dd>Well, there's currently an ongoing dispute about the article, and even the nom felt the content issues were more important than deletion/not-deletion. Normally, if it was just the nom and a bunch of keep votes, I'd close it as a well-meaning nomination made for the wrong reason, but I wanted to check with you first. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:47, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>On further reflection, I just object to the content (how it reads like a how-to and could be dangerous)... I should be concentrating on that. I can see now that the article itself shouldn't be deleted... I don't object to you speedy keeping it now.

<p>I get both (a) alarmed that somebody's editing my comments and then (b) mildly offended by the suggestion that I edit other people's comments, plus indulge in personal attacks, when I was just editing my own comment?

<dd>Then again, after thoroughly reading your second comment on my talk page, I'm thoroughly offended. It would do you well to tone down your language, even when speaking to users who have in fact commited a faux pas. It might also be a good idea to at least check the user's contributions and such before using that tone on them. And, crucially, when not satisfied with other people's behaviour, either (a) provide people with links to appropriate policy in a cool and friendly voice or (b) speak in your own name, not in the name of the community. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 10:52, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was a joke. I'm aware you were editing your own comment, and no, I'm not a bot nor overly literal. I just figured anyone commenting on an RFAr could do with a little bit of cheering up, but the joke fell flat.

<dd>Looks like it's a linkspammer all right, but it seems to be a linkspammer adding useful links.
