<dd>I still don't think it's a good list.

<p>I noticed you added a table to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash_Ketchum_64c1.html#Ash.27s_Pok.C3.A9mon" title="Ash Ketchum">Ash Ketchum#Ash's Pokémon</a>, and, while I like the idea of reforming those horrid bulleted lists of Pokémon, I'm not sure a table is really that much better, visually. Have you seen what <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> was doing in <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Rocket_187c.html#Jessie_and_James.27_Pok.C3.A9mon" title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket#Jessie and James' Pokémon</a>? Something about that style of chronological paragraphs with alternating anchor images seems to me to be somehow more encyclopedic than bulleted lists or tables.</p>
<p>I'm still of two minds on this one, though; any thoughts? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 05:58, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Paragraphs are more encyclopedic, but the Pokémon that they own needs to be made clear. My idea has the same goal, to be more encyclopedic, but the only difference is that the text is just in a table. It's an improvement on before, and it looks nicer than my earlier work, such as on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brock_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_ba6a.html" title="Brock (Pokémon)">Brock</a>'s article. <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Rocket_187c.html" title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a> certainly looks good, but my main issue is that it fails to make all the Pokémon clear at a glance - something that the unencyclopedic lists did do right.</dd>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>How about one or two customizable fields, where you can fill in both the name of the row and the value for the row?</li>
<li>It's sort of plain.</li>
<li>It doesn't allow for a caption other than the character's name.</li>
<li>You can't customize the image size.</li>
<li>Age, height, and weight aren't going to apply to many, many characters, and in general it's not important information.</li>
<li>The title is outside the box, not inside it, which bugs me.</li>
<li>If you're going to show it off, you might want to make a temp page with some examples (I suggest Mario, Solid Snake, Cloud from FFVII, and Andy from Advance Wars, for a good variety.)</li>

<dd>Customizable fields - I have no problem with that, if you wish to add it, then you can.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I based it off of the contents of the FFVI templates. This would be my first template, IIRC.</dd>
<dd>Well, is there a way to fix that?</dd>
<dd>Read above.</dd>
<dd>There are a lot of eastern characters that have age, height and weight available, especially in games like Castlevania. Also, that's why the info should be there - better to the side than right in the middle, right?</dd>
<dd>Well, that's how FFVI's was, so that could be changed.</dd>

<dd>Are you kidding me. Goethean has a provable anti hindu bias and yet Zora/Gothean etc have not pointed out a single statement of mine which has a anti-muslim bias or proves I am pushing POV or hindutva agenda. They have been talking generalizations "shades of grey/black and white" etc but no precise quotations from my writings to prove there point. If you don the robes of an admin and decide to take an action, like deleting a very well researched article, you need to make sure you have enough knowledge on the subject to not appear a partisan.</dd>

<p>I fear you are right; its like trying to get the Orange Order <i>not</i> to march down the Garvaghy Road (my apoligies to the O.O.).

<p>Later: His response proved you right (again). Its always highly amuseing to see the way people of a certain calibre deal with facts.

<p>Okay, you were right. Somehow, he convinced himself that he destroyed my argument point-by-point without manageing to assemble a single factual peice of evidence (must have spent at lotta time at 1600 Pen. Avenue recently ...). I willingly concede that I used tempermental language while doing so, but only because his nasty remarks set me off. I know, I still should have chilled.

<p>The UK postcode articles are partly a navigation thing. See the London areas for a fully completed example. If you link in from a town page then the information will not seem like a big expansion (section of the town you've been reading about, or in rural areas a group of communities).</p>
<p>The template covering the postcode region (e.g. CM, RM etc.) allows investigation of the postal structure for adjacent areas. Users can also end up following through to information having started with the postcode instead of the town.</p>
<p>As a particular example, redirecting CM4 to Ingatestone is not appropriate because it neglects sizable communities such as Blackmore (some distance away) or Margaretting (in a different borough). Although the number of words was low the information was significant.</p>

<dd>Oh, so those were supposed to be disambig pages to all the communities those postcodes cover? Then I suggest you recreate them as proper <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> pages, rather than as standalone articles.

<dd>Yes, but no... it was also a form of navigation structure: the template allowing sideways jumps through the postcode structure - I didn't originate the postcode structure, but I expanded it a bit, and linked it to the town and village articles (and vice-versa) to make it more useful. It's more than just disambiguation. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauls_893d.html" title="User:Mauls">Mauls</a> 20:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Why not make the postcode entries dab/redirects, and add the postcode navbox to the articles for the cities?

<p>Hi there MiB, your comments about Yakov Liebermann made me think a little about these things. The reason that I voted keep for the bus stop and the dorm, is that I do not believe that these issues need to come to AFD, not necessarily that I believe that we need articles about on these things. The dorm should definiately be merged into an article on archetecture of whatever university it was, with a redirect, unless there is so much verifiable material that splitting it out makes sense, but that is better done in a different forum. Likeise the bus stop should definately be redirected to whatever the next level article is, until it outgrows it with verifiable information. I think most public buildings have relatively little information about them that is not original research, so most of them will appear, if at all, as part of a higher level article. Since WP is not a repository of sources, I wouldn't see the point in listing every public building if the only information we have about them is that they exist. The amount of verifiable material about each building will determine whether an article can be written, or whether it should be merged. Does that help? It isn't that I want endless stubs about un-interesting places, although I don't think factual articles about places in which I am not interested do any harm. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 15:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deleting 80% of an article that is being considered for deletion before the prescribed five day lag time amounts to a one-man "speedy deletion" action without a consensus for such. Whether the article or portions thereof are encyclopedic or unencyclopedic is precisely the verdict that is being hashed out over those five days.<br />

<dd>A list of channel users is transient and wholly unencyclopedic. You're going to find having that list there makes the article only more likely to be deleted.</dd>
<dd>Likewise, there's no rule against editing an article on AFD, and in the exceedingly unlikely event this article is kept, that list will need to be removed anyway, as transient (and thus unencyclopedic) and vanity. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:24, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hey. Just wanted to thank you for jumping in an injecting a little impartial rationality into that discussion. It was getting downright ugly in there. I just hope you've got time to see this thing through to the end (ALWAYS a good day on the wiki when cooler heads prevail). Anyway, in the hopes that you are still involved, I'd just like to forward you the suggestion that I proposed there. I propose that, for the moment, we just talk about merging the RSoD and the XB360SoD ANYWHERE (you already saw my proposal to narrow this down to just those to, which seems to have been well recieved), since this insanity seems to be over whether they should be merged at all or not. Although that would require future discussion, I think it would at least quash the worst arguing here.

<dd>I was and still am tempted to do some statistical analysis that shows that what's happening isn't consesus and isn't healthy, or even to show it <i>is</i> consesus so I'd feel ok about letting it go. But if I did get that first result, so what? I don't suppose that would make the hypothetical non-representative sample any more inclined to compromise. It just seems wrong, and I don't even have any special feeling about schools. To me, they are just the same as any other article. Hence the problem, I guess.<br />

<p>I have a problem over at Simon Wessley. UserL84.9.60.246 and user:The One Click Group, a name linked with the content of the page, are insistent on inserting POV and defamatory text. I reverted to a stub a couple of times but was accused of vandalism so I spent osme coniderable time fixing some of the worst excesses. The user is still reinserting the disputed text, thoguh by copy &amp; paste not reversion. I have now reverted it more than three times over the history (though to different versions), and they are still doing it.</p>
<p>An example of their "improved" version: "Professor Wessely has stretched the meaning of the English language while attempting to explain that ME although a ‘real’ illness, is often first imagined. He has trodden the tightrope of confusing semantics with the balance of Blondel and the focus of a train spotter."</p>
<p>As I said to the guy who accused me of vandalism, in Wikipedia terms, a stub is better than a defamatory rant, IMO, but as I say I have tried to clean it up and this user (I think they are almost certainly one and the same) is still adding what I can only describe as shit. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Wessely&amp;diff=28338748&amp;oldid=28338274" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Wessely&amp;diff=28338748&amp;oldid=28338274" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Wessely&amp;diff=28338748&amp;oldid=28338274</a> - this is a paragraph-level copy &amp; paste reversion. The user will not seem to allow anything other than the "authorised version" (i.e. their view). I don't want to get nto an edit war over an issue on which I hold no strong opinion, but I'm stuffed if I'm going to let a soapbox get past!

It's an informal guideline, two-and-a-half years old, and never cited in my experience. But it's a good guideline and I see no reason not to cite it. In sum, where there is no obvious reason to delete, keep redundant material.</p>
<p>This springs from the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temperance_organizations.html" title="Temperance organizations">Temperance organizations</a> vote. There is no rule which states redundance in a category demands an article of the same name's deletion. Yes, WP:DP suggests merging, but this case isn't one of A article duplicates B article. That temperance organizations has become a cat actually demands, to my mind, that the main article be expanded, not deleted or merged. We don't delete Mars, JFK or Oman based on redundancy in the cat. Of course, one can argue redundant but also <i>useful</i> material should be kept, as your note suggests. But AfD isn't about clean up. Temperance organizations in-itself could be an eminently useful page.</p>
<p>I'm not an inclusionist at all (if you've look at my votes) but this is the one delete criterion that I disagree with and that I believe policy and guidelines are less than straightforward about. I only note this to you because I noted something similar on the AfD sub-page after your comment and because I've seen you at AfD.

<p>I object to your premature closure. The standard AfD notice encourages editing of the article while the discussion is in progress. Improving an article during AfD does not automatically result in a "speedy keep." The fact that in this case the article was improved by moving it to a better title doesn't change this. I request that you revert the closure edits which you made in the AfD discussions and allow the discussion to continue. I feel that I've been taken advantage of, and that in effect you've punished me for finding additional information about the school. I wouldn't object to <i>delaying</i> closure, but I do object to <i>accelerating</i> it. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:28, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ah yes - you're right - the listing didn't state that it was completely fictional fictional character, so to speak. I voted merge because I thought it was a real mortal kombat character...

<p>...Discrimination against geocities users????</p>
<p>I just think that as soon as that page has the relevant information, the host shouldn't matter. Judging a website simply by its host is as lame as judging a person merely by his/her looks! Oh oh oh, perhaps you think I made up everything that goes on my site? Than what about stuff like serebii.net and psypoke? They make stuff out! The "SARS" thing about "The Ice Cave" was completely made up, and the mods in wiki tried so hard to maintain that info on he "banned episode" page. But anyway, seriously, do you think I could have just made those whole composition out?? You know that my English is not that good, and for goodness sake who would make up stuff like that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Wikipedia's policy on reliable sources</a>. Psypoke and Serebii aren't much better that Geocities, and your site fails to conclusively show that that is the reason the epside wasn't run. (If it did, we wouldn't cite your site but instead the reliable sources you cited.) The current wording specifically states that it hasn't been conclusively shown why the episode wasn't run, and mentions several common speculative reasons why that might be the case. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>1. Since they are not much better, why do their links appear on the palette?</li>
<li>2. No Original research--"so long as what they say has been published by a credible publication." I have not made it up/ it is not a rumour/ it cannot be controversial, not uninformed/ not misled/not pushing an agenda/not sloppy/not relying on rumor and suspicion, or insane----because it was EXACTLY what CBW had wrote.</li>
<li>3. "and as primary sources only with great caution"&lt;--This means, personal sites are NOT 100% disallowed in wikipedia.</li>
<li>4. The official reason for The ICe Cave was indeed released, accoarding to <a href="http://pkmn.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://pkmn.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://pkmn.co.uk</a> (in the episode guide) which was the reason from UK. "SARS" was indeed made up by serebii.net because they did not recieve the information.</li>
<li>5. I agree that <a href="http://hk.geocities.com/poke124mon282" class="external free" title="http://hk.geocities.com/poke124mon282" rel="nofollow">http://hk.geocities.com/poke124mon282</a> is sloppy and insane, but I am not putting this particular link on the page. 2 of the 3 links I put were EXACTLY what CBW wrote, and that the remaining one was a translated Japanese version of one of the articles, and the translation was done by COMPUTER, instead of by hand. THere will NOT be biased or extreme opinions or personal opinions or personal alteration in the translated page, as I said before, is done by COMPUTER.</li>

The other thing I want to say is that I'm surprised that you, as an admin, are restoring an article that's been through an AfD without waiting for the review results, and also that you're willing to undo another admin's deletion. Neither of these things is exactly conducive to good relations. If Ta bu had felt it was within the deletion policy simply to restore the page as a redirect, he wouldn't have nominated it for review. AfD <i>does not control content</i>. It simply controls which pages i.e. titles exist and people voted that this one should not. If you are voting to delete pages based on the current content, then you have seriously misunderstood the deletion policy. If the current content is the only problem, but otherwise there are good sources available, the title's not inherently POV, and it could in principle be encyclopedic, then the content should be rewritten, but the title shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:25, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where do you get the idea that a redirect has to go through a separate process? Read the policy: "Deleted pages can be restored, by administrators, if and only if there is support on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>, or the page was speedily deleted out-of-process." What you are trying to argue is that (a) a page goes through AfD and people vote to delete it, (b) it is deleted, then (c) someone comes along and re-creates it the next day as a redirect, and so therefore (d) there has to be a second vote at RfD? No, that is not how it works. I did not speedy any redirect. I re-deleted a page that SPUI recreated against consensus. Ta bu is an experienced admin, and would not have nominated the page for deletion review had be been able simply to recreate it as a redirect. So he agrees with me that there needs to be a vote. As for who is the bully here, I am having to respond to posts from you and SPUI on your talk page, his talk page, and on the review page.

<dd>I see Ryan Norton enthusiastically supported your adminship nomination last month. You may want to wait to discuss this with him, if he is someone whose views you respect. As he put it recently, AfD has "precisely nothing" to do with the contents of a page, but is a vote on whether the title should exist. I don't have time to look for the diff now, but I remember him saying it, and I'm sure he'll confirm if you contact him. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:45, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it's all how-to advice on how to perform Shadow's different moves, and what guns and vehicles can be found.

<dd>As I am new to closing AfD discussions, I felt it prudent to err on the side of caution. Merging is an issue of editing, and requires no AfD discussion. And my perception (perhaps incorrect) is that Transwiki-ing requires Admin access, of which I am in short supply. Thus, I interpreted the "merge/transwiki" votes as "keep" votes since the article cannot (so far as I'm aware, though I could certainly be wrong) be merged and transwikied without being "kept", however briefly. If this is an erroneous approach to take, please let me know. I am certainly open to revising my decision if I've made it in error. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 00:07, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
