Similarly to how the WP:CMC collaboration works to elevate articles to Featured Article status, the primary goal of this new project is to coordinate group cleanup efforts on articles, copy editing, condensing, and providing citations where needed. The secondary goal is to remind good editors that there are other good editors who have the same goals.</p>
<p>This will also help prepare articles for Wikipedia 1.0 assessment, a project I am currently working on pulling together for WP:CMC.

<p>you know it's just my luck... every time someone does something to an article that I'd like to discuss with them, they put up a wikibreak sign.... basically i question your removal of the images at poke ball. the latter part of the article is used to discuss the variety of Poke Balls out there, and offer information on specifically notable balls (e.g. Master Ball). The images are used for the purpose of eliminating redundant prose, "This ball is green on top and white on bottom," and illustrating the evolution of poke balls themselves throughout the series. Perhaps with a more detailed intro parapgraph under <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokeball.html#Varieties_of_Pok.C3.A9_Balls" title="Pokeball">"Varieties of Poké Balls"</a> you would find the images more appropriate? My final point is that Wikipedia claims no policy on the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html#Photo_montages" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">use of montages</a> and this article is drastically reduced in quality by the removal of these images. Your statement of "variations on a theme" sounds familiar but i couldn't find it on the policy pages about photos, perhaps you could help me out. I'll give you a few days to respond with ur POV before I change it back, but because you removed the images instead of just commenting them out, if there are a lot of edits made I may put the images back sooner. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 19:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I'm around. The Wikibreak is over.</dd>
<dd>That article needs major cleanup. There's no need to be describing every single Pokéball in explicit detail in that article; we don't need a field guide to identifying Pokéballs, but instead some encyclopedic summary prose explaining that there are many types with <i>a few</i> representative examples.</dd>
<dd>This is also a copyright/fair-use issue. We need not to have dozens of fair-use images when one and some prose suffices. <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> is clear on this, and <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, unlike many other rules, isn't flexible. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:18, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>would you concede that a full paragraph for "Master Ball" is necessary? It seems to be one of the most notable. That, along with the notes section from "GS Ball" seem to me to be the only information worth keeping. Are you also then proposing that instead of a table, just describing in prose the differences in poke balls brought about by each generation is adequate? I understand your point about a "field guide", but remembering that Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia - there's no reason why one can't discuss a topic in an in-depth manner. For example take a look at <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seagulls.html" title="Seagulls">Seagulls</a>. The gallery at the bottom does indeed represent a "field guide" to seagulls. While more specific information about each gull is located on its own page, types of Poke Balls do not merit their own articles, so a table is introduced to represent a list. Would you be satisfied with a "See also: List of Poke Balls"&#160;? and tansporting the tables there? I never thought it neccessary because it's not quite expansive enough that i feel it slows load times down. Assuming a table of poke balls is of encyclopedic value (I am, but <i>you</i> may still not) the second question is of fair-use. You directed me to <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> and after reading through the list of requirements I found that the images <i>seem</i> to meet all the requirements. I say seem, because there are a couple reuqirements that may be subjective, and another I don't completely understand. Your main disagreement with me seems to be #3. "The amount of copyrighted work used should be as little as possible... Do not use multiple images... if one will serve the purpose adequately." Again I cite that "field guides" serve an encyclopedic value for visual comparison and the images maintain their relevancy because the article discusses each of them. For example, one could write that, "typically different pokeballs feature different colors on the top and remain white on the bottom." Insert a pic of the standard poke ball, a hyper ball, and a safari ball. "However occasionally the entire ball can become differently colored." Insert a luxury ball pic. Seems adequate enough for standard balls, but then we have to go on about how poke balls in the anime and movies can vary widely (Crystal Ball, "Chansey Ball"). And write prose and <i>still</i> use many of the pictures. Then when a speficic ball gains some notoriety another paragraph needs to be worked in there. But what if someone writes the paragraph, just tagging it on the end? Is this alright because it's the newest data? Or should it stay grouped with other poke balls from its generation? It just seems like the tables are the best way to maintain the data and present it in an easy to read format. In regard to <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> number 5 seems met, and 8 seems to be another point of disagreement we may still have. Also, number 6 is the one I don't quite get, perhaps (if unmet) you could further explain it. Finally, asking the test question, "Can this image be replaced by a different one, while still having the same effect?" I find myself saying no, when talking about how the giant stone poke balls were used to capture the giant claydol, if i wanted to illustrate just how big these balls were (giant to someone could be 7 ft high), there is no other adequate image to use. BTW, I'm fairly certain the Johto Balls (like this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HeavyBall.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HeavyBall.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) were created free content, but they may have been cut out of the TCG cards (i don't know enough about the TCG to make this assertion). Additionally, the screenshots are technically taken from different episodes and movies so I believe that having one image from each is not considered "too many" - please direct me to a discussion if i'm wrong.

<dd>We just don't need a list of every single Pokéball. It's overly specific info of interest only to hardcore fans. We should certainly describe them in general terms, but all of these are variations of a single design so we only need one design. The Master Ball doesn't need a full paragraph (unless it's way more important in the manga or something); it's just another Pokéball in the games only you only get one per game and it always works.</dd>
<dd>The giant stone Pokéballs are exactly what we <i>shouldn't</i> be describing in detail. They appear in exactly one episode of the anime and never appear again. They're nothing but trivia.</dd>
<dd>As for free content, a dozen images of Pokéballs, from any source, is not going to be acceptable, no.

<p>so you don't feel the mentioning of the stone poke balls in the context of variance or orgins of poke balls is signficant? in fact the idea that ancient pokemon were of gigantic size is expressed in <i>two</i> episodes. in an article about the poke ball i don't get how its orgins (however little mentioned they are) <i>aren't</i> important. i concede though the mentioning of the "chansey ball" is prolly the most trivial entry in "Other Poke Balls." I realize you are coming from the perspective that you'd like to keep cruft out as much as possible and fiction comes under more attacks than other categories (you like merging, check out a majority of animal species), but for comparative purposes the mentioning of different pokeballs seems justfied. Were the number ever to get unmanageable i would agree with you, but as of yet there are relatively so few that it's very feasible to discuss each one, and explain it's differences in a table. Again, I cite that Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not paper</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Also, while considered a poor argument, i'll reverse the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_test_7449.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon test">Pokémon defense</a> to ask if <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seagulls.html" title="Seagulls">Seagulls</a> can post a dozen images birds that are prolly of no interest excpet to a few avid bird-watchers or locals, then why not the same for Poke Balls? <i>Many</i> pages, and even real encyclopedias, offer images of differences within a group. The only time a full list can't be propagated is when the amount is too cumbersome (I would not agree that a page on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Kennel_Club_2a94.html" title="American Kennel Club">AKC</a> should have pictures of every recognized breed, and since each breed, say under <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrier_Group_51d6.html" title="Terrier Group">terriers</a> has its own page - images of all the different terriers is not appropriate either). Perhaps we have a difference of opinion as to how much encyclopedic value an image can add to an article. Personally I find images much more helpful than someone's personal view of them. An article on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Gogh_78b2.html" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a> would lose much encyclopedic value if his paintings were removed - I don't care <i>how</i> well they are described in prose. To me, "information important only to hardcore fans" includes detailing every time Beedrill made an appearance in the anime, likewise how many people really care how many eggs the <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphin_Gull_d2f8.html" title="Dolphin Gull">Dolphin Gull</a> lays? They aren't apparently notable for being either endangered or having an unusual number of eggs. I understand the guidlines proposed in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> are strict, but as a notable aspect of the game variations in poke balls are important to discuss in detail - along with the history and symbolic significance gleaned from the anime and movies. (also the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9_Ball_f5df.html#Most_common_Pok.C3.A9_Balls" title="Poké Ball">Master Ball</a> entry discusses it's significance outside of the world scope, along with its appearance in the anime) -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 06:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, it'd be nice to know the Pokéball's origins. Making up an origin based on conjecture from two episodes isn't going to cut it, though.</dd>
<dd>Also, those images in the seagull and terrier articles are <i>free</i> images. These are not free images. The rules are much stricter for fair-use images.</dd>
<dd>The problem with "gleaning" info from the anime and movies is that much of it is listing one-off objects or conjecturing based on things implied or mentioned in passing.</dd>
<dd>The Master Ball section is exactly the sort of cruft that article just doesn't need. Suggestions on what Pokémon to use it on? A mention of a one-off appearance in the anime (with no reference to what episode, of course)? Discussing using a glitch to duplicate it?</dd>
<dd>It's not important to discuss <i>every variation</i> of the Pokéball in detail. Instead, it's important to write an <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">encyclopedic overview in summary style</a>, aimed at a lay audience and drawing from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Right now, this is a highly detailed description of every variation of Pokéball, aimed at a fan/enthusiast audience and drawing from the anime/manga/games.

<p>I apologize for a late reply, i've been ill, and don't have much time even now. I can cite the master ball episode as easily as anyone who knows about serebii, but i don't think that's the main issue. the origin isn;t made up, and there <i>shouldn't</i> be conjecture. This is why just listing the appearance of the balls and relating the info said in the anime is what's been done. I was saying that this info is useful for people who want to know it. And again, if the mention and casual overview of each ball is included in the article, WP:FU allows the use of those images, as detailed in my first reply to you. I wasn't using seagulls as an excuse for the images but as defense against your "field guide" argument. Poke ball is meant to be a centralized discussion of <i>all</i> things poke ball, little detail is <i>supposed</i> to go in each "Notes section" especially if it's one time info (the crystal ball the girl uses in <i>Secret of the Unown</i>) those "one-off" references are most pointedly aimed at the "Other Balls" section? that section <i>does</i> need cleanup, and i'm not sure if images should be included there (except maybe having a sub section of it titled Early Poke balls for critical analysis - the fact that while early pokemon were consistently huge - the anime has shown <i>two</i> methods for containg them). The master ball entry as cruft is an opinion - i could state that listing every weakness and strength for the fire type on <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quilava.html" title="Quilava">Quilava</a>'s page is "not needed" (and i have - in vain). The fact that it is often used on legendary or rare pokemon is an established fact that would not meet with any serious disagreement. the two pokemon mentioned are not recommendations, but examples of rare legendary pokemon (reread the paragraph) - their names are easy enough to remove though. The glitch (again not saying to do it, or even <i>how</i>, barring an argument that this is FAQs-ish) caused a phenonmenon (that's a little over-the-top) in the real-world - people exploiting it specifically for that purpose, this is not disputed and accepted as fact. I was under the impression that a fictional subject's effects in the real world were worth mentioning in an article. You have constantly been referring to the list as "important only to hardcore fans/enthusiasts" except for the "Other balls" section i can't agree that someone who has just bought the game would not find this information appealing. Or even a layperson who decided to look up the article. Again - the argument of cruft is fallacious, especially since <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFancruft_4a77.html" title="WP:Fancruft">there is no policy or guideline</a> concerning it. Only things that fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> are excluded, and I'm trying to eliminate them, maybe i haven't been doing a good job. Sentences that tell the locations of all the hidden Poke Balls in RBY are definitly FAQs-ish and How-to, but those things are all aggressivly removed. You'll have to provide a better arguement than "cruft" and specifically mention a policy or guideline that states why listing what a small group of items in a video game do is not allowed in Wikipedia especially if the use is to demonstrate the evolution of those items in the game over time. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 17:28, 18 September 2006 (UTC) PS, I won't be home until much later today, so i'll prolly respond tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>"There's a great difference between telling people how to best play a game and describing real-world impact."</i> - we are in complete agreement here. I actively remove prose written in this article that says things like, "You only get one Master Ball in the game, so when playing RBY you should save it for the battle with Mewtwo." Apparently you don't see anything better with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is the games' rarest Poké Ball. In the original games... there was only one to be found. Since ..., there have been ways to get additional Master Balls, but the player still only finds or is awarded a single ball.... Master Balls are so rare and powerful that they are normally used to capture the rarest of Pokémon, like Mewtwo or Lugia."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm at a loss due to confusion. That <i>is</i> what people have done. It is not something even remotely likely to be disputed, but if you'd like i could point to the hundreds of FAQs out there telling people to do that and the logical sense that it makes as proof. If this is not what you're talking about then pls better explain y you feel I'm happy with this article "telling people how to best play a game" and i don't understand what "describing real-world impact" is.</p>
<p>In response to your second statement - WTF is wikilawtering? My use of citing Wiki guidlines and policies in my defense? I feel the artice (a large majority anyways) as is <i>does</i> serve as an encyclopedia article. You feel it doesn't. I'm not trying to flash them in your face going, "SEE! SEE! lemme do what i want!" I'm offering them up for a re-reading so you can try to understand where i'm coming from. I've been giving lengthy explanations about my thoughts on the matter and you seem to write them off with a few sentences, largely ignoring any points i've made. you don't give any examples - just your opinions. I've gone through and added the names/numbers to episode references like you mentioned were lacking (ironicaly i missed the Whiscash one still), but i don't think that's your main concern. The rewrite tag has been up there for a <i>long</i> time, and i haven't removed it because i agree it is still in need of work; many prose sections could be completely rewritten - a few of them have, references should be added, and the tables are still "under contsruction". <i>No one</i> seems to interested in writing about it on the talk page, even whoever put that tag up, i haven't bothered tracking down who it was to ask them their thoughts, maybe i will.(added 9/27/06)<b>of course it was you why am i not surprised? lol well you must admit that the page has come a long way from its humble beginnings...</b> <i>Please</i> give examples of highly specialized fandom, and if it's the list of pokeballs - re-read my previous arguments and <i>respond</i> to those. I think it may be best to move this onto the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Talk%7EPok%C3%A9_Ball_b109.html" title="Talk:Poké Ball">talk</a> page as anyone else editing it could take advantage of it. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 15:34, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Basically, I don't see any value in a "field guide" to Pokéballs, especially given the utter lack of a basic encyclopedic overview. It's of interest to fans only, many entries can only be game-guide-only info, and such a list cannot be sourced save to direct observation of the games/anime/manga. I removed the images because they needed to be dealt with immediately, but the whole list desperately needs to be removed and replaced with a prose <i>summarizing with examples</i>, instead of listing every single variation. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:12, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to refrain from re-adding to the article for now because I'd like to avoid an edit war over this and both of us are coming fairly close to the 3RR as is, but what exactly is your problem with Metroidvania being listed as a Genre (or, more correctly, sub-genre) for this game? Adding that Megaman ZX is comparable to Metroid and more recent 2D Castlevanias and explaining how would only serve to repeat information in the Metroidvania article. Furthermore, the term is something which has seen use in both print media and in online media for comparing games using a gameplay formula like the one seen in this game.</p>
<p>Adding the tag doesn't take up space and DOES provide a wealth of information about similar games.

<dd>No, OR would be me making UP a genre like Metroidvania. Like I said, Metroidvania has been used fairly often to describe 2D platformers that fit into the basic concepts of Super Metroid and the more recent 2D Castlevanias, mainly consisting of a one main contigious map and powerups which allow the player to eventually progress farther and farther through territory which they've not yet covered.</dd>

<dd>Please read the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroidvania.html" title="Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> article before you continue to discount the edit as OR. It's been thoroughly fought over already and is quite well sourced, something I'm pointing out for the second time. I'm not the one who pointed this game out as fitting into that category, and again... after the links I posted in the edit history I don't see how this game doesn't fit into the general <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroidvania.html" title="Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> description. Again, I'll restrain from edit warring with you for now as I'd like to reach a consensus or at least a mid-way agreement on this... but that seems hard when you don't appear to be investigating any of the information I've presented. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 06:47, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a simple process I use to identify OR. I ask, "Who said that (such and such fact) is true?" If the answer is "The Wikipedia editor who added it," then it's OR. If it's someone else, then that someone else should be cited. In this case, the person applying the term seems to be you. If you can cite someone describing the game as a "Metroidvania", then add it to the article and cite it. Until then, please don't. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the "unnecessary duplication," I <i>strongly</i> disagree. If the game is often compared to similar games in reviews, the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_ZX_8837.html" title="Mega Man ZX">Mega Man ZX</a> article is <i>definitely</i> the place to mention this. We should be concentrating more on what has been said about this game rather than on direct observation of the game itself.

<dd>I kinda agree with the edit summaries A Man in Black has said in the article. The term is in no way official and is a fan made classification, and shouldn't be called an actual "genre".

<p>No your thinking of Peachs art. I jsut dont like her current art because even in game (mario hoops) her face is different then any past art, and not to mention her skin has more color. I know she may be in her sports outfit but before long her Strikers art will come out and who knows how shell have changed then.</p>

<p>I wouldnt say extremly minor, if the only thing you dont like about the Hoops art is the fact shes in her sports clothes then I think you should let it slide cause I'd rather show current character design then past. But I guess I'll just leave it up to you cause I dont wanna keep editing it to do that over and over again.</p>

<p>Dude, I want to make a complete database style thing for the TCG, like of all the sets and promos. Tell me why you dont want to do that?? I mean why do you have a problem for that anyway?? I just find it unbelieveable that you would be so against having all the sets going back to the base set and promos too. I mean theres articles on here about gym class and bananas. Why can't there be pages on here about them. And I don't want it just to be the new sets as already on there. The new sets suck. I mean why is this just such a problem to have them on wikipedia?? It seriously blows my mind you wont allow them on here...</p>

<dd>That's an admirable goal, but it's not part of this project. If you want to make a database of all the cards, feel free to find some hosting and go ahead and do that.

<p>I just want a total database of all cards on here. I see lots of individual databases that are like only for the older cards or new cards. I want a total one. And what do you mean by hosting anyway? Im just confused to what your alternative would be. Like I just think that this has to be somewhere on wikipedia or something. and you say encyclopedic overview. I see bands pages all the time, and i just was gunning for something similiar to that. Like you go to an album page of a band, you will see all the songs and everything. Why cant we do that same format for all the sets involved in pokemon tcg, both nintendo and wizards eras? you get what im saying here, cause with that kind of mentality of what your saying, shouldnt we delete all the album pages of bands or at least their older album pages?</p>

<p>fine but can you please point me in a direction on where to put this stuff. Like I know theres some wikipedia sister projects. I know of uncylcopedia. thats it though.

<p>nothing really seems to fit that as i tried saying before. nothing even close. tell me where it says that in there. a quotation would be good. cause there is nothing in there at all that comes close to not allowing a checklist besides the title 'collection of information' which is actually contradicting what an encyclopedia is. Each set is in themselves important in one way or another and should not be glossed over.</p>

<dd>All right. Well, I've removed the parameter from the template, as well as on the episode pages themselves.

<p>I don't want to pull out a discussion, but why do you keep posting the TMT alert over the article's trivia? It has alredy been greatly shorted and cleaned up, and I really don't think that it should be still considered as too much. Other characters, and even in other videogames, has larger Trivia section but are mostly ok. Honestly, do you really think that it is still too much trivia?</p>

<dd>I don't know why there is so much trouble with Trivia sections, they are everywhere, in videogames, anime, manga, even in films. And Leon's Trivia is alredy way too short, specially compared to before, where it was about the double of its size. I've tried to clean up the trivia so that the TMT message wouldn't have to be there anymore, but it seems like you would like the whole Trivia section to dissapear, which, in my opinion, wouldn't be right.
<dl>
<dd>Trivia sections are bad. They're just miscellaneous info crammed into a section, with no thought to organization, importance, or relevance. If you want to keep the facts currently in the trivia section, I suggest finding more-relevant places to put them in the article.

<p>What do you mean. What about we write a summary about the episode based on the image. I see alot of episode guides that has 40 - 20 images. Which the images make the episode guide look pleasant. <b>FULL OF COLOR</b>, the images described whats happening in the episode, but the summary helps with that.. but why are their images in enyclopedia's? What is so bad about the idea about seperate episode pages. I personally will keep a watchfull eye on the pages.

<dd>Making an episode guide look pleasant is not sufficient reason to be using so many fair-use images. This is not a fansite, but instead an encyclopedia that is made specifically to be freely redistributable. (That's the "free" in "Wikipedia: the free encyclopedia.")

<p>Then why do the other episode lists that have images aren't considered fan sites???</p>
<p><i>Huge, malformed list removed</i></p>

<p>That's the second time you've posted that list to my talk page and I'm still unmoved. No, those pages shouldn't be using images that way either, for the same reasons.

<p>I am not sure how to source fan reactions other than fansites, which you claim to be bad sources, but I think the popularity of an anime is based on part by the realization of the fans feelings of how it was edited by foreign distributors. Oft times than not a series will notice a change towards the way the fans wish to see it if possible including edits such as swithing opening and closing themes. This not only shows the following an anime has, but the response by the distributor to make the fans happy. So in order to source fan reaction how does one go about doing that when a)fansites are not viable sources, and b) the article itself says no to add more external links, and c) without trying to show favoritism to one fansites over the mountain of others? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadzar_8b22.html" title="User:Shadzar">shadzar</a>|<a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadzar_3516.html" title="User talk:Shadzar">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shadzar_9f1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shadzar">contribs</a> 04:53, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Minority viewpoint being pushed over general reception. When you're saying "fans" there, you're saying "internet- and import-savvy" fans, which is a small fraction of the fanbase for any series that is successful in the mainstream.

<p>I didn't say I agreed with the responses in the English adaptation editing and response to section, but it does exist, and from what I was told fansites do NOT make good sources for the very reason you mentioned. While English adaptation is the only one shown on this English site, should others appear for other languages I am sure those who have been trying to prevent vandalism will surely protect their content from distorting the facts solely to the side that has been shown. So without the opposing side view or knowing where it resides then how can both sides of the arguement for the critisism to the edits be presented? If the "fans" are opposed the the editing methods made doesn't that reaction represent enough to show how the market adapts to the fans needs? Likewise for those who are not fans of the show wouldn't their view of the editing be indeterminate of the show or books since they do not follow it? Kinda like the review that stated the movie Final Fantasy The Spirits Within was just like the video game which was a biased opinion rather than neutral since he didn't seem to know about the different version of the Final Fantasy series, or their premice being the same for ALL <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing games</a>. As I said I enjoy the filler anime episodes even though they are not canon to the manga but didn't entirely remove all the content cause I didn't feel it didn't belong. Just try to find out where the line is drawn on opinions and critisisms. MAybe instead of destroying all the content int he article it would be helpful to those who are making it if something were placed on the talk page (if even a link to the proper section of Wikipedia that describes use of opinion) so that the article can be made better for all readers, experienced in the topic, and casual readers alike.

<p>Here are the sections you have deleted. I've bolded anything that has to do at all with fan opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>===<b>Criticism</b> of anime adaptation ===/<br />
- By the time the Sasuke Retrieval arc ended (episode 135), the anime was at a point where it was quickly gaining on the manga, its source material. At the conclusion of this arc, the anime immediately switched to anime-only filler episodes to allow the manga to broaden the gap once more. <b>Many fans were disappointed because of the lack of significant plot and character development in the filler saga.</b> However, had the anime's production schedule overtaken the release of the manga's storyline, the plots of the anime could have completely differed from the intended plot of the manga, or would have been cancelled completely, both of which have happened to several other manga-adapted anime series (for instance, <i><a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurouni_Kenshin_8316.html" title="Rurouni Kenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></i>). Most of the filler arcs are stand-alone stories, with a few being several episodes long, unlike the adapted manga arcs which can cover roughly thirty episodes.<br />
[...]<br />
===Editing and <b>reaction to editing</b>===/ - Leading up to the series' English-language premiere, <b>a number of fans expressed fears that it would receive a treatment similar to that of <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Piece_aa17.html" title="One Piece">One Piece</a></i>, which was <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Piece_anime_adaptions_e9e7.html#Censorship_and_Editing" title="One Piece anime adaptions">heavily edited and Americanized</a> to a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_rating_system.html" title="Television rating system">TV-Y7</a> rating for broadcast in North America.</b> [Comment: This is a commonly accepted opinion, as well, and could easily have been worded so that it is stated as a fact]. Surprisingly, <i>Naruto</i> was aired with a TV-PG rating in the US and a PG rating in Canada. -<br />
- Many elements that <b>were expected</b> [Comment: Again, I'm only bolding this for your benefit of the doubt; in comparison to other Toonami dubs, this may very well be fact instead of opinion] to be edited out of the broadcast version were left intact, including references to <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and mild sexual situations, Japanese cultural differences, mild language, and even blood and deaths were still evident.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The manga was treated just about the same.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The uncut broadcast of <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_Z_eb3c.html" title="Dragon Ball Z">Dragon Ball Z</a></i> featured these same elements, but they are still rare among Toonami's other series. In addition, the opening music and scenes for the show in the first two seasons was changed significantly, but the background music during the episodes remained the same. They have since switched to one of the Japanese themes for the third season, but still use a different set of scenes. The uncut DVDs contain the original credits for each episode. -<br />
- Cartoon Network also made some extra edits in addition to those done by Viz Media, which is evident of the fact that Canada's YTV network contained fewer alterations. These are fairly minor, such as toning down the amount of blood and other injuries. The accidental kiss between Sasuke and Naruto was also edited out for obvious reasons (though it is made clear that it happened), but later shown during a flashback during the Land of Waves arc. -<br />
- The first uncut box set, which was released on July 4, 2006, contains no edits, with the original vocal themes completely intact, as well as the opening theme, "R*O*C*K*S", being subtitled. The dub was left unedited for the DVDs, and thus has a few instances of harsher dialogue, with Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi saying "bastard" and "damn" on occasion, Sakura saying "hell yes!" and the word "kill" being used more frequently. -<br />
- Several small token edits have appeared in the North American manga, the most notable being the removal of <a href="../../../n/e/j/Neji_Hyuga_96b4.html" title="Neji Hyuga">Neji Hyuga</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manji.html" title="Manji">manji</a> and replacement with the cross that was used in all versions of the <i>Naruto</i> anime to avoid confusion with the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">nazi</a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">hakenkreuz</a>. The English version of the Naruto manga was left more intact than the anime, but was still censored to fit a younger audience. -<br />
- The UK version shown on Jetix is the US TV version with extra edits, in spite of the fact that it's shown during prime time. In general, these edits remove the following: portions of the violence and references to violence (i.e. someone threatening to kill someone else), references to smoking (including an old man smoking a pipe), weapon usage, and nudity (in the form of Naruto's Sexy Jutsu and Harem Jutsu). To edit scenes, Jetix either cuts a scene completely, does a momentary freeze frame to avoid showing an offending scene, or crops a scene to cut off the items in question. -<br />
- The UK version of the Uncut DVDs was released by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga_Entertainment_7c3a.html" title="Manga Entertainment">Manga Entertainment</a>'s UK branch on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a>, 2006, under the title "Naruto: Unleashed". In this release, UK-orientated subtitles are used containing various British-centric naming conventions, such as "Art of [jutsu]" for the techniques instead of "[jutsu] Jutsu". The use of "sensei" is also replaced with "Mr." or "Ms." and Ramen is referred to as "noodles", unintentionally creating some humor when Naruto's pass-times, most of which involve Ramen-in-a-cup, are referred to in the subtitle as "<a href="../../../p/o/t/Pot_Noodle_fa58.html" title="Pot Noodle">Pot Noodle</a>". <b>British slang is also used in place of more common terms, such as Sakura telling Naruto to "stop giving Sasuke evils" (slang for a dirty look) instead of just telling him to quit staring.</b> -<br />
- The UK version also contains the "Sponsorship" cards from both the opening and the ending, which are usually edited out of English DVD releases, the card inviting viewers to "Tune again next week!" and a full set of English credits.</p>

<p>That's all that should have been deleted, and for the most part, that could have been reworded. There was no reason to delete those entire sections.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that you are against cruft, and I support that. However, there is a huge difference between cruft and information. UK dub edits may have been cruft on the Italian Wikipedia, but this is the English Wikipedia. This deals with all primarily English speaking countries, not just the United States.</p>
<p>Again, I endorse your determination to wipe cruft off the face of the earth, but I (and at least two other users) feel that you're getting a bit overzealous about it. Next time you want to delete entire sections, can you at least bring it up on the relevant talk page first? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 06:03, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The dub edit lists were ridiculously overdetailed original research (albeit not a bulleted list). Once you're looking at X and comparing it to Y instead of looking at published sources' commentary on the subject, you're heavily into the realm of original research. Additionally, "However, had the anime's production schedule overtaken the release of the manga's storyline, the plots of the anime could have completely differed from the intended plot of the manga, or would have been cancelled completely, both of which have happened to several other manga-adapted anime series (for instance, <i><a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurouni_Kenshin_8316.html" title="Rurouni Kenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></i>)" is pretty speculative. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In other words, the differences between a dub and its original series, no matter how obvious (The similarities in music, manjis being replaced by crosses, etc), are still considered original research? And pointing out that uncut DVDs were released does not confirm that there were changes in the dub? Or, more prominently, the releases of uncut DVDs are not worth pointing out in the least? I'm sorry, but can you please explain how none of that can be on the article? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 06:21, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Manjis being replaced with crosses is an obvious change?</dd>
<dd>My point is that you need to stick with what the sources say, instead of drawing your own conclusions from direct observation. It'd be fine to rewrite that section, but it needs to be based on published sources instead of direct observation, to avoid inadvertantly pushing a POV by focusing on trivial or unimportant changes. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I see. I'm really sorry about misunderstanding your edits. Still, can you mention what you are about to do on the relevant talk page before saving a large edit like that?

<dd>Hey, don't sweat it. Time spent explaining an edit like that is never time wasted.

<p>I shortened the story section so it now fits entirely on one screen. I also replaced the image you wanted replaced. Many of the details which aren't important to the plot have been removed, including referencing important characters such as three of the four Fiends. <b><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman"><font color="orange">Sir Crazyswordsman</font></a></b> 23:21, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not just length, I'm finding, it's style. I hate to be moving the target around on you, it's just that this plot summary is deeply unsatisfying and I can't entirely explain why.

<dd>Deck and I looked at it a bit more and did a bit of reworking. Also I replaced the image which you never crossed out.

<dd>I can also understand your "brilliant prose" thing. This is more of a relative term, and what is brilliant to one person may not be to another. I don't want to make the prose sound too, well, for lack of a better word, high-class, as the article is targetted towards the average human being who doesn't know anything about the game. That's why I aim for comprehensiveness, however, I tried to be as concise as I possibly can. If you've played the game, you know I left out a large fraction of minor trivia, and I eliminated more and more as well as lengthened short sentences. I'm actually in the middle of a technical writing course right now. <b><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman"><font color="orange">Sir Crazyswordsman</font></a></b> 04:54, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
