<p>TI removed all the specualtive information, and you're sitll tno staisfied. there is ntohing abotu these two sentences: "It's important to note that despite the game's title, the game does not take place in the Ultimate Universe. Also, there is no word that it definitively takes place in the Earth-616 universe or the X-Men Legends universe." And they do belong in the lead, as they are detials as important as the original Marvel Legends name. Please, the original speculation you ahd a problem with was removed, and nwo this was just good reorginazation. Please refrain from reverting this reorginzation again without a valid reason. And callign ti "spoeculation" is no longer valid.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 01:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you offer any <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a> for your claims?

<dd>Common sense does not need an attirubatable soruce. Now your edits elsewhere, i agree with. I only have a problem with you removing thsoe two indispouutable facts. Is there anything that points to the contrary of these statements? No, there is not. Stop beiong so obstinate and reverting valid remarks. I'll tell you what, if you feel otherwise, ptu the "coitation needed" tag on. that way, the facts remain where they belong and they are ntoed in tyhe way you feel they should be.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 01:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They are not indisputable, given the number of people who keep claiming that it's "obviously" 616 or "obviously" Ultimate or "obviously" neither. We do not speculate here on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Please take the time to correct misspellings and typos in your talk messages.

<dd>Yeah, i agree with that. The sentence however states that there is no word on who's right. It does not say it obviously takes place in such and such, it says there is now word that gives an answer either way.What you are removing is the compelte opposite of that statement.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 01:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't work like that. We don't say "Well, we don't know if such and such is true, or if such and such is true." We just omit mention of any of them. It's not a controversy; it's non-debate, since continuity is such an unimportant topic that no reliable source has commented on it. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Blâ™Ÿck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you may be right there, however, the reaosn we leave it up to the community is because neither of us can come to an agreemenet, and rtaher than escalate a dsipute, we trust the rest of the community to recognize it and remove it if ti is apporpirate. i ahve affixed {fact} tags to the statements, so they stnad otu as needing a source. Now, trust the community to either find a soruce or remove it, and step out fo the issue to avoid escalating a dispute.

<p>What are the reasons given for why Consolitis was deleted?

<p>Ok, maybe the "basically" isn't needed, but let's be honest, Charizard really DOES resemble a typical cartoony dragon design, doesn't he? He looks a little bit like Dragonite even. Plus note that it says he RESEMBLES a dragon, not that he IS a dragon. Also most dragons in media are usually the size of a T-Rex when grown, so "medium" for Charizard seems appropriate. I know there isn't an official source, but let's not be too legalistic. It's just an impression on Charizard's basic form, after all. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintenboy01_b256.html" title="User:Nintenboy01">Nintenboy01</a> 21:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would be helpful to notify the user who uploaded any image on their user talk page after doing this, definitely warning them to produce an actual source and provide fair use rationale; this wasn't done when Image:Gon (Tekken 3).jpg was tagged. There are a lot of people who don't actually watch edits in images, so it's fairly likely that a user will not notice any impending deletion until after the image is removed.

<dd>For what it's worth, I object. His outburst on his talk page after he was blocked shows that he has no good faith toward the project. There's nothing he could add further to the arbcom proceedings at this point anyway. He would just keep rehashing the same points ad naseum, and continue to attack other editors.

<dd>Newyorkbrad was the first person I contacted. He referred me to you. Before I read your reply I received another message from FAAFA and decided to decline that editor's request. The subsequent message speculated in a manner that would have generated a cloud of doubt over my integrity if I had complied with the request and if the message's contents became generally known. My personal politics have no bearing whatsoever on my administrative decisions and I wish to protect my reputation for impartiality and fairness. Due to that circumstance it would be more appropriate for FAAFA to petition someone other than me to follow up on any alternate suggestion.

<dd>He's a real peach, ain't he? He hasn't figured out that you're supposed to burn your bridges AFTER you cross them. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 04:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I doubt he burned any bridges or say anything insulting or even controversial. Rather, I suspect he speculated on the politics of Durova rather than just an appeal to fairness. I suspect he fundamentally misunderstood Durova's interest in getting his block partially lifted. An insinuation such as "we liberals need to defeat the neocons" would be enough to make Durova uncomfortable as it implied an association that doesn't exist. Even implying that there would be a bridge that could be burned would probably make her uncomfortable so I wouldn't even speculate that even though I know what you were trying to convey. That kind of appeal would me feel uncomfortable. I applaud her decision regardless of the actual concerns. If FAAFA is reading this, I encourage him to e-mail the information to any active arbitrator (list at <a href="../../../a/c/_/WP%7EAC_3d3c.html" title="WP:AC">WP:AC</a>) with the request to forward it to the arbitrators' mailing list. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 08:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes we do have that article, but this is a comprehensive list of the DAX firmwares which are increasingly popular. The official site for them is at <a href="http://www.dark-alex.org" class="external free" title="http://www.dark-alex.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dark-alex.org</a> with all versions avaliable for download.</p>
<p>Yes it's homebrew, but it's also firmware. As far as I'm concerned, it is and should be in the public knowledge under the main PSP article. Until it's decided otherwise properly, it should not be removed, as it is becoming quite a large sub-section. <a href="../../../h/u/d/User%7EHuds601_94db.html" title="User:Huds601">Huds601</a> 19:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's Dark-Alex's site. That's not the kind of source I mean. We need some sort of publication to cite, to use as a reference to write the article.

<p>In which case for now you mark the item in question as needing to citate it's sources, not remove it from the article. How can it be citated if it's not there and noone knows it needs them?

<p>What, are you stupid or something? Do you even have any kind of grasp on the PSP community? Because of people like DAX, Fanjita, HarleyG and others, people like Rockstar have gone to great lengths to secure exploits in their games. Sony have released firmware updates soley because DAX has found exploits within the firmware. Because of DAX CF, the PSP is now almost entirely customisable within OE, waves, volume bars, icons, backgrounds, anything. And it's all made to work specifically for DAX CF. Stop removing the section. You say you want citations, and as there are none, you remove it. So I revert it and add a citation banner to ask people to help find some, as should be done. Yet you still delete it for something else. Your making yourself look silly, and anyone with any kind of idea about the PSP community would leave it there. Can I also point you in the direction of this. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6397797.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6397797.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6397797.stm</a> The BBC have done a news report on Fanjita, DAX and HarleyG about how they have exploited the PSP and created custom firmwares.

<p>Incase you can;t be bothered, heres what I mean. This is from the BBC article...<br />
<br />
The drawback of this early firmware is that it won't run the latest games, but this problem was quickly overcome by Dark Alex, who wrote his own firmware, called Dark Alex's Open Edition, with the help of a fellow hacker known as Booster.</p>
<p>With this firmware installed, the PSP is completely unlocked, but also has all the features of the latest firmware.</p>
<p>Within days of the release of the Noobz team's downgrader and Dark Alex's Open Edition firmware, Sony updated its firmware, fixing the flaw which makes unlocking possible. <a href="../../../h/u/d/User%7EHuds601_94db.html" title="User:Huds601">Huds601</a> 19:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ran across something a few days that I'd like an admin's opinion on.</p>
<p>It's in three parts:</p>

<li>The edits by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESTEALTH_RANGER_d205.html" title="User:STEALTH RANGER">User:STEALTH RANGER</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a>. He's added a large section on "Captain" as used in fiction and prose, effectively doubling the article's size. It reads as OR to me but I would like a second opinion before either tagging it or out right removing it. I <i>think</i> he created it in order to support part 2.</li>
<li>List of Superhero Captains created and predominantly edited by the same user. It smells of OR and blatant fan cruft. I'm not sure if tagging it will do any good or if it should go to AfD.</li>
<li>The same user is adding a link to his "list" to various article as well as a non-existent category: Category:List of Superhero Captains. One that really worried me is his insistence of having a link to his list on the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_captains_bfd8.html" title="Category:Fictional captains">Category:Fictional captains</a> page. I <i>had</i> removed that, with an appropriate edit summary, but he just added it back, with no comment.</li>

<dd>With this reasoning you could delete half of Wikipedia. Speedy deletions are only for obvious cases, AfD is for the rest. This was article was around for some time, edited by many different editors, and none of them disliked it enough to splash a {{delete}} on it (by the way, this template exists for a reason, so that at least two people verify speedy deletion conformance).

<dd>I'd compare it to unreleased, still in production movies. I've seen them in templates. I see no danger in allowing the new Ratchet and Clank into the template.<br />
What is the template for? Grouping articles by subject.

<dd>The template is for directing users to the core topics of the article series. The games are the core subject; promotional trailers (which is all R&amp;CF is) are not core subjects.

<p>I know this question isn't really appropriate, but do you know whatever happened to HighwayCello? He hasn't been on the editing circuit since late last year.

<dd>Yeah, it's been noticably different without him. He just vanished from the face of the Earth... Maybe Skeletor (see AMIB's user page link for info) had something to do with it?

<p>You have decided to delete Internet troll squads article on the grounds that it is "an attack paper" and OR. Could you clarify the following. (1) Was it attack against whom? Putin as AfD nominator claimed? Obviously, the artice did not attack Putin, since he was mentioned in this article only ones and as a third party. (2) What original research are you talking about?. The article was clearly based on multiple sources. This is obvious from the list of references. <i>No one of this discussion participants challenged the reliability of any specific references using any reasonable arguments</i>. How can this be OR? Moreover, <i>there is already a similar article in Russian Wikipedia</i> (a link has been included). The article has nothing to do with "conspiracy theories", since <i>such "Internet squads" are well known to exist in China, as was noted by one of the discussion participants.</i> Yes, the title was possibly bad. Then, let's rename the article or denote it as <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. Furthermore, <i>there was no consensus on deletion of this article among editors</i>. If you suspect foul play during the voting (as you said), let's just rename the article and improve it.

<p>On the "Personality" section on <a href="../../../c/i/e/Ciel_%28Mega_Man_Zero%29_7dd7.html" title="Ciel (Mega Man Zero)">Ciel (Mega Man Zero)</a>, I think the first section, which mentions Ciel as compassionate, should be taken out, my reasoning being that I believe it's directly copied from a mega man fansite, "Ciel Network" I think, the other sections deserve to remain in the article, the first two are backed up by the games, thus offical information, the last one, involving the potential feelings from Ciel to Zero, there is a crapload of images on the internet showing this pairing (it's fanart), the <b>sheer</b> amount of them means it has enough merit to be in the article. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBassxForte_6b93.html" title="User:BassxForte">BassxForte</a> 16:32, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
