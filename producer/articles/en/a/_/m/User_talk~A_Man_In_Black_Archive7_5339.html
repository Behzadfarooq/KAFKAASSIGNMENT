This has alleviated my concerns with the illustrated images and one I feel comfortable with implementation.

<dd>These seem to be personal views that are irrelevant to the workings of the encyclopedia. The first is paticularly nonsensical as the design is retained in the format of blue and white. Retaining the design is a minor issue but one I contested in view of image issues I discovered and ammended. The previous design (which is exactly the same minus line breaks and the like) doesn't fullfill the need of sheltering the images in a way suitible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second quibble is perhaps pressing and I will attempt to do something about this, although its a fairly baseless argument, one that doesn't hold in observations of article space. Your arguments seem to pertain to asthestic views, which doesn't hold in any relevance. My edits to the template were to ensure complete readability with all editing purposes and keep the template as useful on a long term basis. Its in line with the consistent nature of all character templates used across projects. All follow this essential format so its already been previously established. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandall_Brackett_fd50.html" title="User talk:Randall Brackett">Randall Brackett</a> 00:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a lot of long words and absolutely no meaning whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let's simplify. Your design sucks. It uses vertical alignment, which made reading top-to-bottom (the way a tall box, like an infobox, is read) difficult. It removes the borders when all of the other CVG templates use borders. It changes the color from the standard CVG color for no reason I can figure out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You haven't addressed any of these points, just answered with a lot of obfuscation, with references to "image issues" you haven't detailed and "complete readability" when you haven't answered my own <i>specific</i> readability points. I can break things down to discuss each of them individually, but the last time I did that, you conceded all the points then went and forked the template anyway. I'm a bit fed up. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:17, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think you've succeeded in arguing yourself into a corner where you cannnot but simply conceed this really isn't relevant to Wikipedia on a number of matters, but I'm not concerned about the attitude. I'll copy and paste what I noted on <a href="../../../k/y/o/Talk%7EKyo_Kusanagi_bdb1.html" title="Talk:Kyo Kusanagi">Talk:Kyo Kusanagi</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Its difficult to describe what I observed into words. When the infobox was implmented earlier, the images didn't mesh into the template and looked unnatural against it, as if it didn't belong. It, however, looked fine on most renders. I changed the template, taking away the bolded lines and devisions. It looks suitible across all articles now and I feel its a great comprimise, something AMIB and I can be happy upon.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Upon earlier inspection of the template, which was derived from the CVG infobox, the original formatting was created with the intent to house box art and the like. With character images being more variable and can be implemented in various manners across the wiki I thought this minor change was suitible. I also retained the blue and white design, signifying its relation to the CVG project as this was a note raised by A Man In Black earlier. I'm pleased to say this is a great solution.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I think the syntax of the template should include the designs established by all of the other templates across the wiki merged with what we have currently. You're objections are noted. I'll attempt to ammend them with code from other designs but I've seen no problem with the edits and they were certainly productive. Wikipedia is really not about doing things your way, as I think you must have realised after all this time. Prohibiting input from other editors and callaboration destroys the point of a wiki. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandall_Brackett_fd50.html" title="User talk:Randall Brackett">Randall Brackett</a> 00:29, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your reply was at <a href="../../../k/y/o/Talk%7EKyo_Kusanagi_bdb1.html" title="Talk:Kyo Kusanagi">Talk:Kyo Kusanagi</a>? Oooookay...</p>
<p>It's not a compromise AMIB can be happy with. It doesn't use borders and it uses vertical alignment. Those are the only substantial differences, and one is inconsistent with the other CVG templates and the other negatively impacts readability. Address these points please.</p>
<p>As for "drawn images not meshing," you are the only one who has reported this. I'm inclined to believe that it is an issue limited to you alone. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Okay. Your concerns are noted but I've no idea how they affect the template's usefulness to the encyclopedia: <i>It doesn't use borders and it uses vertical alignment. Those are the only substantial differences, and one is inconsistent with the other CVG templates and the other negatively impacts readability.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Address them for what, exactly...? I'm not concerned about your quibbles if they don't improve the template's value to wikipedia. I'm not concerned about anyone's problems with it if its purely being reverted to accomplish a personal preferance. I made my edits in view to improve said usefulness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, what makes you think I'd ever support the idea of disallowing the variable point of the wiki? If there's a policy with backing where it permits the ownership of template space and the uniform design in your view I'd certianly like to see it. I surely must have missed something here.

<dd>I am being consistent. I'm being consistent with all of the other character templates; in the borderless design while retaining the format of the CVG templates. Vertical alignment is used to keep the template in its current design inline with above (if there's a policy or some sort of concensus citing where the direct design is rquired I'd like to see this).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you refer to "blithering", I'm sure you're familiar with the fact that complaints about a template being adressed is not probmatic to the procedure of editting. When you can freely admit that the reverts on the template were assisting in a way the latter doesn't, I don't really see how the complaints can be taken seriously at all. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandall_Brackett_fd50.html" title="User talk:Randall Brackett">Randall Brackett</a> 01:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consistent with which character templates? If you're referring to the old character templates, I don't see any reason to be consistent with largely inconsistent and now-replaced character templates, when the alternative is to be consistent with widely-used templates with a similar purpose and origin.</p>
<p>As for vertical alignment, consistency isn't more important than readability. I'd be happy to replace a a less-readable design with a more-readable one and to blazes with consistency. Vertical alignment makes the template significantly less readable.</p>
<p><i>I'm sure you're familiar with the fact that complaints about a template being adressed is not probmatic to the procedure of editting.</i> This is blithering.

<dd>Okay. I still don't see how that's a problem. In your examples, you deliberately placed the data aligned horizonally. In the template example you used the "br" commands.

<p>This is how vertical alignment works.</p>
<p>When you have top vertical alignment, the left-column field would appear aligned with the top of the right-column field, as with "topalign" above.</p>
<p>When you have center vertical alignment, the left-column field would appear aligned at the middle of the right-column field, as with "cenalign" above.</p>
<p>When you have bottom vertical alignment, the left-column field would appear aligned with the bottom of the right-column field, as with "botalign" above.</p>

<dd>I disagree with your evaluation. There is nothing different from the three edits I made on my talk page compared to the many obnoxious remarks made by your friends. There is also no justifiable way to say that I would try to get attention on my talk page when the people disrupting me with self-admitted personal attacks intiate the conversation. It is at best a guess on your part, and you have deliberately imposed your own POV in the determination that my edits to my talk page are any more or less a redefinition of clarity "if not exactly neutral". Therefore, it appears that you are acting only as an editor and friend of the others rather than as a neutral party in an aministrative capacity. Ste4k 04:51, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes your friends. By injecting a POV judging for yourself whom is or is not making an "annoying" comment when the facts are clearly equal, you are "siding" with others.

<dd>You are only stating your personal opinion and are not specifically supplying any reasons for it. It is therefore only baseless opinion. If you cannot explain what makes my edits obnoxious even only to you, then how can I justify considering your opinion in any way? You say, "the edits were obnoxious" but you fail to say how or why you think so. I say that AF and NS's actions are obnoxious too. You deleted the evidence and willfully refused to investigate it. Direct question: Are you actiing in an administrative capacity or are you just irritated by something you don't want to look into? Ste4k 05:11, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unlike in article space, I am allowed a certain amount of discretion as to what I deem disruption and how I deal with it. I am exercising that discretion. I think your actions are obnoxious and disruptive, whereas I don't see the actions of the articles you are trying to rile as disruptive. This is indeed acting in an administrative capacity, but I'm not currently interested in the actions of other editors unless you're somehow making a case that your actions are mitigated by the actions of others (and you haven't done much to convince me of that).</dd>

<dd>Yeah, ever since those first merges that's been one of my major quests: clean up garbage and morph things into encyclopedic articles. Lists provide a key stepping stone, in my opinion.

List of Star Wars devices and similar lists, 3.) <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_Technology_of_Star_Wars_8693.html" title="User:Deckiller/Technology of Star Wars">User:Deckiller/Technology of Star Wars</a> (as they would say in the theater, coming soon).</dd>

<dd>Just to jump in here. I have tentatively concluded based on a comment on my talk page she left reading in part "Hi, it's me the unprofessional bored sitting at home lady again;" the series of petty melodramas she has been involved in since she's been here and a history of what can only be described as bizarre edits and nonsequiter comments on talk pages that she likes to "stir up the pot" here to add some excitement to her life. It sounds like a almost like a kind of passive-agressive trolling, albeit perhaps she doesn't realize that's what she's doing. An RfC may be appropriate, but not feeding the trolls may work also.
