<p>Dear Administrator: I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are. The world owes you. I owe You.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>I think the vast majority seem to be in favor of merger for the 'M article. You said to drop you a line so... here I am. As an added request though. When you do the merger (perhaps merging all three into a single glitch article) could you remove that rediculous image from the 'M article?

<p>Drop me a note when you're done rewriting this. I saw the version you just posted, and it had me pondering what's appropriate for a list or not.

<p>Contrast <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuchsia_City_532d.html" title="Fuchsia City">the article as written</a> with User:A Man In Black/Poketasks/Merge/List of places in Kanto. I'm ambivalent; I really feel the context is an aid to understanding and that places in Pokémon are way down the list of notable subjects, but this list would have 12-15 items on it, all about that length or so. (Note that some of them would be breakout <i>See Also</i>s, similar to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_items_de9a.html#Pok.C3.A9_Ball" title="List of Pokémon items">List of Pokémon items#Poké Ball</a>.)</p>

<p>*sigh* Someone went and spun off the Professor Frink listing from the big Simpsons character list, and it has all the problems I see with fancruft. It's a collection of useless, contextless factoids. The events of one episode (the hamburger earmuffs), his lab phone number, a one-off joke about how computers have improved in the last several decades; after the first two paragraphs, there's little that gives you any understanding or context, but instead random fannish factoids.<br />
There's a point where minutae starts to obscure the meaning, and when you're talking about, say, a less-important one-off setting in a long-running series, there's a point where more data starts to turn into less meaning. Fancruft isn't just articles about things that don't bear encyclopedic mention; it's also data that doesn't contribute to understanding.<br />
This is partially why I was disappointed (and also somewhat bemused) by the outcome of the Poképrosal; instead of coming to some sort of conclusion about <i>why</i> all the Pokémon articles should be kept, they were simply kept by default when everyone interested in establishing consensus went and actually worked on them for a bit. (Would that that would happen more often on Wikipedia.) The only downside is that a fairly silly standard (all Pokémon are notable) for notability was established by default, in the face of some fairly strong opposition to that idea.<br />
While the notability of this or that Pokémon is water under the bridge (and, with the benefit of hindsight, the Pokémon species are better off as individual articles because there's really no better way to have them on Wikipedia other than cutting them down to <b>extremely</b> terse lists), it's not a standard that's reasonable when talking about every single person, place, and thing in the Pokémon world. It's one thing to have said "We're keeping (say) <a href="../../../b/e/l/Beldum.html" title="Beldum">Beldum</a> as a standalone article because it serves such-and-such purpose, despite the fact that it meets no standard of notability whatsoever" but it's another thing entirely to say "<a href="../../../b/e/l/Beldum.html" title="Beldum">Beldum</a> and all Pokémon-related persons, places, or things of equal or greater notability merit their own articles."<br />
Fuchsia City, for example, is mentioned <i>in passing</i> in Pokémon Adventures, appears in <i>one episode</i> of the Pokémon anime, and isn't very important except as just another town in the games it appears in. It fails the Professor Frink standard of notability miserably, especially since the city itself is generic personalityless background in the anime/manga and has little claim to fame in the games other than its proximity to a more interesting place (the Safari Zone). Even if you can write an article's worth of things about it (and a significant amount of that article is episode synopses, I notice), <i>it just doesn't bear its own article.</i></p>
<p>Okay, done arguing about notability. Without the Safari Zone stuff (which belongs in a <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safari_Zone_c004.html" title="Safari Zone">Safari Zone</a> article or listing) and the two-paragraph episode synopsis of ep 32, this article boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Fuchsia City</b> (Japanese: セキチクシティ Sekichiku City) is a fictional city located in southeast <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanto_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_f874.html" title="Kanto (Pokémon)">Kanto</a>, a region in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> world, and its motto is "Behold!

<dd>There would be a lot of entries (10ish?) in this list and, including the anime info which is important, would make for a very large page. I do agree with the principle of a merge but not the practicalities of it. Can we find a better way to merge them?

<p>Hey! It's me again! Good job of cleaning up some of the Metal Gear articles. While not perfect (good thing you have a factual checker like me), it helps condense some of the crap that Wikinoobs keeps adding. With that in mind, I have the following proposals in mind:</p>
<p>First of all, I think we should merge The Philosophers, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Patriots_a888.html" title="The Patriots">The Patriots</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosopher%27s_Legacy_47ba.html" title="Philosopher's Legacy">Philosopher's Legacy</a> into one article. At the very least, I don't think <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosopher%27s_Legacy_47ba.html" title="Philosopher's Legacy">Philosopher's Legacy</a> really belongs into a seperate article, since it's basically it's just extending info covered there. <i>Jonny2x4 03:38, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I think they should just be merged into their respective games. You can't really understand what's going on with the conspiracies without a full plot summary of MGS2 and MGS3, so let's put them with the full plot summaries of MGS2 and 3. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:57, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. There's enough backstory material about the Patriots/Philosophers to justify its own article. I just think it should merge into article, rather than three as it is now. And since we're talking about merging, we could merge the <a href="../../../s/3/_/S3_Plan_424e.html" title="S3 Plan">S3 Plan</a> too if it hasn't already been already. Jonny2x4 01:39, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, one article about the Philosphers, the Patriots, and their various machinations, at most. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, I think we should make a List of locations in the Metal Gear series and merge <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Heaven_0ee0.html" title="Outer Heaven">Outer Heaven</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanzibar_Land_478a.html" title="Zanzibar Land">Zanzibar Land</a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Moses_Island_46db.html" title="Shadow Moses Island">Shadow Moses Island</a>, the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Shell_0c8c.html" title="Big Shell">Big Shell</a>, <a href="../../../t/s/e/Tselinoyarsk.html" title="Tselinoyarsk">Tselinoyarsk</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groznyj_Grad_a3c9.html" title="Groznyj Grad">Groznyj Grad</a> into it. I'm not too sure of merging Zanzibar Land and Outer Heaven, since these are actual sovereign entities in the game and not just mere locations. <i>Jonny2x4 03:38, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Almost all of those should probably be merged into the games, too. There's not much to say about those locations save for the events of the games set there.</dd>
<dd>Outer Heaven should probably be merged into <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Boss_bf61.html" title="Big Boss">Big Boss</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28series%29_968c.html" title="Metal Gear (series)">Metal Gear (series)</a>, because of its iconic role.

<dl>
<dd>I disagree on both counts. Some of the locations have an established backstory and history besides the events that transpired during the games. At the very least, we could describe the unique characteristics of each place without bloating down each of the game's articles. Jonny2x4 01:39, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Generally, that backstory is the same as the backstory of the game they appear in. I think possible Outer Heaven is too much to merge, but there's not much to say about, say, Shadow Moses, the Big Shell, Zanzibar Land, or Tselwhatever besides the events of the respective games. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And finally, I think the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genome_Soldier_c5b0.html" title="Genome Soldier">Genome Soldiers</a> (as well as the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurlukovich_Mercenaries_1092.html" title="Gurlukovich Mercenaries">Gurlukovich Mercenaries</a> for that matter) are a distinct enough presence from <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Boss_bf61.html" title="Big Boss">Big Boss</a> to warrant a notice. I think we should do a List of enemy units in the Metal Gear series and have the Tengu Commandos, Solidus Snake's Private Army, KGB, GRU and Ocelot Unit. <i>Jonny2x4 03:38, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>They're cannon fodder, with only a "Well, they came from foo, work for bar, and protect foobar" to say about them. I really think they belong in the respective game articles. The only reason I merged the Genome Soldiers into <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Boss_bf61.html" title="Big Boss">Big Boss</a> is because that info belongs in a general section in the Big Boss article about his genetic legacy.
<dl>
<dd>Maybe so, but the Genome Soldiers article contained info about the backstory, as well as a description of each type of Genome Soldier encountered in the game, which you decided to ommit when you merged the article with Big Boss and I think it should be restored in some form or another. Likewise for all the zako characters. Even if they don't have an established backstory, a list could still be justified. Jonny2x4 01:39, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The only difference among the types of Genome Soldiers is the color of their uniforms. I deleted if for the same reason I've deleted the exact age, height, and weight of the characters: it's trivia, serving little purpose.</dd>
<dd>There's even less to say about the other units. I even AFDed the Gurlukovich Mercenaries articles. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me know what you think. Jonny2x4 03:38, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, I'd rather see info in the game articles themselves, unless it's something that can't reasonably be handled in one game article (the Metal Gears, for example) or including it in the game articles would bloat those articles too much (the lists of characters). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:57, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>True. Although, I think a lot of the stuff I propose deserve their own articles and could prevent the game articles from bloating in the future (as well as discourage new users from making their own articles). Please consider it seriously though. Not that I need your permission, but your assistance would still be appreciated. Jonny2x4 01:39, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I appreciate you seeking my input.</dd>
<dd>Honestly, I don't think there's a lot of value in documenting the obscure backstory facts and every place and organization separately. In rewriting the Metal Gear articles and the character articles, I think I've deleted about a half-dozen plot summaries of each Metal Gear game, and any separate article tends to attract that sort of useless bloat.</dd>
<dd>That said, I'm not sure how to handle groups like the Philosophers/Patriots. Their backstories are told as grand reveals at the end of the game, and making it hard to explain what's going on in MGS2 and 3 without cramming a LOT of detail into the end of the plot summary. I'd rather not have a separate article about the information delivered in that dramatic reveal, though.&#160;:/ - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I'm noticing some issues with an attempt to merge the Mewtwo articles I made a while back, so I'm hoping I can get some feedback as to what to do. What I'm doing now is making a crisp writeup about Mewtwo's anime character and putting it in the main page, keeping the rest of the stuff from the Anime article in the Anime article. Afterwards, if you think it'd work, I can dismantle the anime page and shift its information into the First Movie and Mewtwo Returns movie articles. What do you think? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 18:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After thinking about it over Easter, I find that the page should stay, but should just be tweaked a bit. But I'm now implementing full-page rewrites into the Movie articles, so I think all this Mewtwo business will be wrapped up. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 18:00, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I finally got the time to scrupple with these nasty articles, and I've went and cleaned up all of them. As for merging, those articles are now too large to be realistically inserted into Wily's, but I've removed all the cruft and laudible information. As for redirects and the like, I've taken your lead and redirected such minor characters like <a href="../../../g/u/t/Guts_Man_7abb.html" title="Guts Man">Guts Man</a> to the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Master_c55f.html" title="Robot Master">Robot Master</a> article.

</ul>
<p>I can't say I'm particularly happy with them in principle, but I feel they're better than similar individual articles on each listed item.

<dd>No, I know why you made them, but I'm of the thinking that, usually, big lists of objects or "characters" with little personality or backstory aren't very encyclopedic. That said, I was the one who made <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_items_de9a.html" title="List of Pokémon items">List of Pokémon items</a>, so I know that lists like that are better than the alternative. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:37, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now back to the failings you speak of, we must ammend that. What about these articles needs improvement...? I'm paticularly worried about List of Mega Man weapons. I'd really be pleased to extrude that to featured list status. I have to insert fair use rationale on the images, but that still leaves the content.

<p>Why did you take down the article I worte on the Duck King? I provided enough backstory and information, that he should have his own page.

<dl>
<dd>My point is he did more in Fatal Fury, than he did in KOF, he's been in way more games there as well. The information on him should not be just limited to King of Fighters, which mine has info from both game series that he appeared in. Would you put <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geese_Howard_f912.html" title="Geese Howard">Geese</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Krauser_c7a4.html" title="Wolfgang Krauser">Krauser</a> and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Big_%28Art_of_Fighting%29_3cf6.html" title="Mr. Big (Art of Fighting)">Mr. Big</a> in minor lists because they only appeared in KOF96 (with Geese only being refrenced in later games afterwards)? Besides Megaman Zero said and I cut and paste: <i>Until someone is willing to evicerate their laziness and actually fleash each character out, they will remain in list format. Its about high-time someone desisted adding trivia and actually wrote about the character.</i> and <i>Expand the articles, and they'll be moved back out to namespace.</i> and that's what I did. (BackLash 04:31, 21 April 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm not entirely sure that is the right list for Duck King; eventually the majority of the minor characters will be merged into lists. If you'd like to start doing a list for minor/supporting characters of Fatal Fury, I'd be all for moving Duck King there.</dd>
<dd>Quibbling over which list this character should be merged into, most of these characters <i>just don't bear expanding</i>. Duck King's article is stretched near to the breaking point and it's still one page of overbloated prose and a fugly infobox.

<p>I'm afraid you're the one in the wrong here. There isn't a need to take a closed result to deletion review when you're not disputing the result. There was an obvious consensus to keep the article for a variety of reasons, and that was entirely fair enough. And that was all that needed to be, and should have been, said on the matter.</p>
<p>MfD is a process that relies on consensus. If I went in, closed the MfD and deleted the article because I disagreed with some of the keep votes, I'd be justifiably hung, drawn and quartered. What I very much object to is you doing effectively the same thing - closing it because you disagreed with some of the votes, not because of the consensus that was already there. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:41, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An article can be speedily kept ONLY if one of the following holds: ... 4. the nomination was clear-cut vandalism or WP:POINT and nobody disputes this or votes to delete it anyway (since calling a nomination vandalistic does not make it so and actual POINT-making AFD nominations appear far less frequently than accusations thereof).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this AFD, Hirudo had voted to delete the page, so closing it as a speedy keep does not appear to have been in accordance with the relevant guideline. It's no big deal, but just something to watch out for in the future.</p>

<p>The template is missing the fighting style, as with all of the templates on the list page. I'm advocating we utilize the smaller CVG-designed infoboxs for list format due to the more compact design of its extrusion and multiple nature.

<dd>Well its a wiki. I'm strongly rooted in the use of both templates for different purposes. It is not as if I am asking you to do all of the template extrusions yourself. As with the variable nature of so many various designs possible, I tend to think that design is overused and doesn't draw attention. I don't venture out of the box too often, but I think its not a overly negative task to request we work together and bend on this.-<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 04:32, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Firstly I have to profess that I have absolutely no idea why I am writing this. I noticed you editing the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> article and after viewing your user page and reading your introductory dirge I felt the need <i>(read curiosity)</i> to ask you a question.</p>
<p>You talk of the difficulties you would have with matrimony, and I have to ask... if you found a woman who was in ever way your equal, who shared your same level of hygien, appearance (though definately feminine), weight, grooming rituals etc, etc, etc... could you ever love such a person? The reason I ask is not to insult, but because I am indeed fascinated with people who it may be plain to see are not the most beautiful in our world <i>(Which I do not consider myself part of such an echilon)</i> and whether they actually seek out those who are of similar quality or expect someone of better quality instead. You appear from your introduction to be a person of reality, who is not afraid to be honest about themselves which is why I believe you should take this in the manner it was written, in genuine interest in the response. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 06:49, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We-e-ell, that pretty much constituted the shock of my life! heh. Now I'm not asking you to change what you wrote or apologize, but I'm just hoping that someone like Jimbo Wales doesn't come along and relieve you of your adminship on account of uncivil language. (I'm concerned that someone might actually do that, as I've always liked your level-headedness and great editing work otherwise) <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 18:49, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It'd be smart for sure, but I guess your point is that very long plot summaries are something to avoid like the plague. I admittedly have given articles like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Golden_Sun%7E_The_Lost_Age_3308.html" title="Golden Sun: The Lost Age">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a> story write-ups that aren’t exactly the image of brevity (though I’ve certainly tried to shorten it in the months after), so it actually kinda hit close to home. By the way, what was there previously has been enshrined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Erik_the_Appreciator/Erik%27s_Rationale" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Erik_the_Appreciator/Erik%27s_Rationale" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 00:45, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It came mostly from some very frustrating efforts to try and get the scene-by-sceneplot summary out of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, including a partial rewrite I forgot to save anywhere. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:51, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, it's been vandalized three separate times already (and by two separate people at that). It's clearly riling people up and persuading them to dump their stuff onto your userpage, so unless that's the effect you want, I would advise changing it a bit. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 01:10, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
