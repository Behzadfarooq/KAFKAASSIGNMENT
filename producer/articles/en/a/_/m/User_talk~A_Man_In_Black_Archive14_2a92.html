<p>I'm aware of your (imo extreme) pickiness about sourcing, and wondered your opinion on the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VII_f2ee.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a> featured article and it's use of sources. They do include gaming magazine references and an undergrad paper from Stanford, but the plot, setting, characters, and story are all referenced to the game itself. (A few references also apparently are derived from official databooks.) Further, as the game cutscenes are not a printed medium, they are actually referenced to notes in the article which give the quotations from the script used to back the article's description. (Bear in mind, this is a Featured Article.) Is this, in your opinion, an acceptable system of reference and verification? If not, would the sections be better left unverified? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 02:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a philosophy about primary sources. They're empty calories. They can be useful to flavor the staples (secondary sources), but you shouldn't be sucking them up when you can have something healthier (so, to use the video game example, if you can describe the gameplay using reviews or other similar secondary sources, do so), and they can't sustain anyone (an article that is sourced only to primary sources is probably describing a non-notable topic).</dd>

<dd>Does that make sense? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:17, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For notability, of course. For verifiability? No. From this example for instance, a magazine saying that Cloud was ranked as a first-class SOLDIER member is inherently less reliable than the game itself saying he was. The magazine authors just played the game after all, their memory is not certified as being better than the wikipedia author's is, and the wiki author could very well have typed the quotations while looking at the game window. (and no, that's not original research any more than typing the quotes in from a book would be)</dd>
<dd>The purpose of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is to ensure the accuracy of articles. In the case of real-life subjects, saying that scholarly secondary sources are the best is a perfectly good standard. We wish to strive for objectivity and neutrality and avoid subjectivity, so we attempt to avoid non-neutral sources like hate blogs or self-published information, and we wish to ensure that the people we cite know what they are talking about, so we cite scientists and governments rather than the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Enquirer_cab4.html" title="National Enquirer">National Enquirer</a></i>. In the case of a fictional subject though, the fictional universe is not subjective, rather being objectively determined by the author.</dd>
<dd>In <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_c5af.html" title="Alice's Adventures in Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>, for instance, <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mock_turtle_soup.html" title="Mock turtle soup">mock turtle soup</a> is made from <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mock_Turtle_899a.html" title="Mock Turtle">Mock Turtle</a>. Now, you could find a published cookbook, a chef, or some other citeable professional expert and discover that mock turtle soup is most definitively NOT made from mock turtle. But would it even make sense to cite that in the article on the Mock Turtle? Of course not. Instead you cite the book, which verifies quite nicely that within Wonderland, Mock Turtles are the basis for Mock Turtle soup. In an article on Wonderland, the professional chef is not an expert, instead, it's the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Hearts_%28Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland%29_cd7f.html" title="Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)">Queen of Hearts</a>. Or to be more precise, it's <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Carroll_a8ad.html" title="Lewis Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>, speaking through the persona of the Queen of Hearts.</dd>
<dd>Basically, when it comes to establishing the real-world <i>notability</i> of a fictional article, I believe we should obviously stick to real world reliable sources. But when it comes to verifying the <i>accuracy</i> of a fictional article, I'll take the primary source over a 3rd party commentary anyday. The only thing I can think of that would be more reliable than the primary source for accurate information on a fictional universe would be a published interview with the author in which he explicitly stated a correction to the primary source. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 02:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, you (accidently, I'm sure) ignored my second question. Which was whether or not using direct quotations from the game in reference tags was <i>stylisticly</i> acceptable, and if not what should be done with them. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 02:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I favor secondary quotes to avoid the inevitable evaluations that people end up making, where it goes from "Cloud is a member of SOLDIER" to "Cloud is an atypical member of SOLDIER". I'd rather cite secondary sources to avoid doing OR-ish editorializing, and this doubles as a hedge against speculation, OR literary analysis, and similar essay material. What using secondary sources instead of primary sources does is that encourages us to write summaries, because what is written about FFVII or any other fictional work is more likely to be a summary. That way we don't get undue weight on unimportant details, we don't push interpretive theories, and we just generally don't end up with all the problems you tend to see when personal observation is used as a source.</p>
<p>Part of this is an explicit rejection of "fictional universes." Not every work of fiction makes a "fictional universe," and exceedingly few works of fiction have aspects that are significant artefacts in the real world, independent of the works in which they appear. Superman has a life separate from the work in which he appears. He's appeared in many works in many different forms and media, he's a symbol of America and of DC Comics and of comic books and of superheroes, and there's a great deal said about Superman that is not description of the works in which he appears.</p>
<p>Contrast this with <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disgaea_characters.html#Laharl" title="Disgaea characters">Disgaea characters#Laharl</a>, the protagonist of Disgaea, a video game (and its spinoff anime and manga). Laharl, too, has appeared in a several games a manga, and an anime. However, the first game, manga, and anime are all telling different versions of the same story, and in the games after the first Laharl is merely appearing as a mascot of or reference to that first game. Laharl is a part of the first game; you can't talk about him without talking about that first game, and anything that is said about Laharl is talking about that first game. Most fictional characters (and nearly all fictional places and things) have no role, place, or being in the real world save as parts of the works in which they appear.</p>
<p>Once you start accepting "fictional universes," there's the natural desire to describe those universes as though they were...well, universes. People want to fill in all the corners, mistaking <i>fictional stories</i> for <i>descriptions of a world.</i> Disgaea (using my example from before) isn't a history, it's a <i>story</i>, and it's not a source for anything. Any summary of events, descriptions, settings, objects, that's all plot summary, even if it isn't in the traditional this happened then that happened then the other thing happened form. It shouldn't be mistaken for description of any thing.</p>
<p>As for Alice in Wonderland, my question would be, why are we noting the mock turtle soup pun if no reliable source has ever mentioned it? If a reliable source has mentioned it, iour business is to reflect what has been written about Alice in Wonderland instead of writing our own (however inane) personal observations. If no reliable source has ever mentioned it, then clearly it's a trivial detail that doesn't bear mention in an encyclopedia, which should be synthesizing secondary sources.</p>
<p>As for the Final Fantasy VII styling, I don't think it's ideal, but I also don't feel like it's a fight worth fighting. Final Fantasy VII is clearly a subject with a great deal of commentary in secondary sources, and I'm not going to fight with users doing a lot of good work synthesizing those secondary sources over the plot summary section.</p>

<dd>On the subject of including fictional universe stuff as a whole, I might be inclined to agree with you if it weren't for the fact that the articles already exist, those that aren't are being written as we speak, and will presumeably continue to be written at an ever-faster pace. At some point down the road, we might decide to create some sort of official wikimedia project for covering fiction, or at an even more extreme junction we might even decide to speedy delete all unreferenced articles older than <i>x</i> days and deal with them that way. But until then, they exist, and they are in tremendously widespread use online. If you've ever looked at <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?ns=all&amp;limit=1000&amp;month=09%2F2006&amp;wiki=enwiki" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?ns=all&amp;limit=1000&amp;month=09%2F2006&amp;wiki=enwiki" rel="nofollow">the top 1000 pages</a>, you'll notice that there are at least a dozen character articles right there on the list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are never going to be able to afd <b>everything</b>, and doing it sporadically just annoys people. Especially in cases where the article that was deleted was well-written, informative on the subject, etc. The attempt at merging the information is often far worse than the previous article. As a particularly heinous example, the recently deleted List of attacks in One Piece was partially replaced by the god-awful <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franky_Schematics_82e3.html" title="Franky Schematics">Franky Schematics</a>, for instance. Where the previous article was merely badly written and not referenced to an outside source, the new one is even more in-universe, speculative, far worse in its style, and equally ill-referenced. So while I support deleting some cruft articles, I only support deleting those cruft articles which are badly written, as deleting well-written cruft seems to me to be utterly counter-productive to actually improving the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 05:12, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vandalism, hoaxes, vanity, ads, lists of quotations, directories, and image galleries are also being added all the time. No, I'm not going to be able to clean up everything, but that's not any reason not to keep trying. (I do have a windmill on <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_Cruft_e13d.html" title="User:A Man In Black/Cruft">User:A Man In Black/Cruft</a> for a reason.) I convinced <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckiller</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deckiller_d5af.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deckiller">contribs</a>) that merging such articles is a good idea; from there he merged a great deal of Xenosaga cruft, and then went on to help found <a href="../../../w/p/f/WP%7EWPFF_e152.html" title="WP:WPFF">one of the most strongly mergist (and productive) fiction Wikiprojects around</a>. Even if everything I've done with <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">WP:PCP</a> or in helping with <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> or many other less-important cleanup and merge tasks didn't count for anything, then at least something good has come of trying to clean things up.</p>
<p>Usually I don't bother well-written cruft save to merge it up. There's always a worse case to deal with. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dude, you might find yourself getting increasingly 'yelled' at because you <i>rampage</i> articles without first contributing to an existing discussion on those articles. Your removal of the MJ-12 documents, which had previously been hosted on the page about them, is fine and good, as that's what three of those of us working on that page had agreed to, but we'd agreed to put them in Wikisource, with a link at the bottom of the page, since clear transcriptions are hard to come by (and some of us had put a lot of time into editing those). Could you kindly revert your change temporarily, copy that text with its formatting, and host them in Wikisource with a link? Or at least explain your oh-so-autonomous decision on the MJ-12 talk page? Thank you. -- Kosmocentric 20:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's talk here, then, since this isn't just about Deus Ex. (RFM is a big pain in the butt, frankly, and it's fairly inactive.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is paramount. Our foundation is the sources we use, and articles are only as useful as the sources we use. No amount of being interesting or being useful or being popular or being well-liked or handwaving or vowing to revert until a page goes to AFD can overcome that. You're going to see me removing unsourced claims pretty much on sight, with the notification that the claims are problematic being the removal itself. I will warn you now; if it's not a trivial claim (with trivial claim being interpreted in the narrowest possible fashion) and it doesn't have a ref tag next to it, consider it tagged for removal. <small>While it's reasonable to make a an exception for cases where there's such a massive body of work on the subject that referencing it is superfluous (grass is green, birds have wings, usw.), I don't work with many articles like that and we're not talking about articles like that.</small> I freely acknowledge that I'm not omniscient in this respect; feel free to revert any such thing I remove citing a lack of sources <i>as long as you provide a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to support the assertion.</i></p>
<p>Similar to this is how I feel about advertising. <i>We're not here to be the first people to report on something.</i> While we may have other lists of mods with nothing but a brief description and a link, that isn't a reason to keep even more advertising links. If a mod is so noteworthy as to be mentioned in reliable sources independent of the mod's makers, then by all means let's write an article or article section based on those sources. If there aren't any sources, why are we allowing the mod's makers or fans to use Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">sandbox</a>?</p>
<p>This is only tangentially related to issues of plot summary/setting detail, which is a separate discussion (although expect me to be saying "nontrivial coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject" a lot). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:10, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting point. However, longstanding convention allows uncontroversial plot points to be sourced directly to the work in the absence of other sources.

<dd>As a rule, it's not a good source to be using. In this case, however, there is encyclopedic information to be related, and the story is needed to lend context. In the absence of a secondary source, we use a primary source for uncontroversial claims about the subject. Such primary sources can't establish importance, but they can be used for simple, uncontroversial claims in the absence of any alternative secondary source. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The funny thing about that category is that I don't see a way to check out if the category has really been emptied for four days or not.

<p>Hi, I;m not yelling at anyone.</p>
<p>My understanding is that it is considered civil to discuss an issue with an article before marking it for deletion.

<p>And then going to follow the discussion, apparantly someone tried to erase some comment and now I've been accused by some australian guy, who does appear to only show up to say nasty things, of being some other user. So that's once someone accused me of actually being the artist, and now being accused of going under another name and deleting someones comment, even though I've actually been really open to answering and taking criticism and advice, that is when I'm not being told to not comment at all.</p>
<p>I was really excited to do this first article and was emobldened by all the talk of civility, but frankly, a lot of people here seem like territorial nuts and very few people seem to want to actually help. i don't know what to think at this point.

<p>Hi Man in Black -</p>
<p>I was wondering if I could get some advice, it is being incorrectly asserted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dennis_Calero_940f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dennis Calero">here</a> by User:Ughmonster that I am operating two different accounts (this one) and apparently <a href="../../../4/2E/1/User%7E4.18GB_a5d1.html" title="User:4.18GB">User:4.18GB</a>. Is there a way admins can determine the IP addresses etc of the different accounts in order to clear my (and User 4.18GBs) names? I havent contributed (via a <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b>) to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dennis_Calero_940f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dennis Calero">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dennis Calero</a> discussion and dont intend too as I dont know enough about the subject. I did, however, revert the deletion of a <b>Delete</b> comment by User:70.19.97.253, I should also say that I originally marked the article (pre-AFD) for a speedy deletion on the grounds of notability concerns. Any advice would be appreciated,</p>

<p>Thanks very much MIB, I wont post further in that AfD as I think it will only continue the problem. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgleyDJ_85d5.html" title="User:MidgleyDJ">MidgleyDJ</a> 19:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
First off, my assertion was more along the lines of "well, you're accusing me of this...isn't it odd that the same thing seems to be happening on the other side." But of coure, Midge neglects to mention that he clearly began the tirade of accusatons. Am I blameless? Of course not. But he's the more experienced user and I felt he was acting like a bully and I'm not the only one.</p>
<p>And I think it bears scrutiny that on the one hand Midge admits that he knows little about the subject yet was very quick to mark the article for speedy deletion and clearly cared enough to come back to this subject and put in his two cents. Why so often if for no other reason than he had decided at some point this article shouldn't exist and to heck with anyone who disagrees.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming that Midge is a bad guy and he does a lot of admirable work on wiki, but a even a cursory examination of the discussions on his page make it clear that this isn't the first time he's become embroiled in some sort of minor contraversey over a hasty decision to delete or mark an article for deletion without giving it due thought.</p>
<p>ManinBlack, you've been incredibly helpful, and I appreciate the fact that you think it best to simply let problems like this get quashed, and I don't disagree. But surely, it's also clear that wiki seems to be rife with people for whom this is a hobby to which they donate an inoridinate (and perhaps innappropriate) amount of time and that somehow makes them feel overly territorial.</p>
<p>I suggest, and I hope you agree in spirit, the wikipedia rules seem designed to welcome new users and not bog them down in dogma or only allow users whose point of view matches those already contributing. Wiki is potentially a resource of near-infinite space and length. There should be room for everybody. --Ughmonster 01:55, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi MIB, User:Ughmonster has also posted this on my talk page, I'm unsure why, but presumably because he thinks this is somekind of witch hunt on my part. I havent lodged any complaint about Ughmonster's apparent use of sockpuppetry in the deletion discussion in question. I'm unsure why he continues to persue this issue. I've not even participated in the Denis Calero deletion discussion except to revert his/her removal of a comment by <a href="../../../4/2E/1/User%7E4.18GB_a5d1.html" title="User:4.18GB">User:4.18GB</a>. Finally, I strongly disagree with his/her assertion that my talk page is an indication I'm embroiled in anything. It shows I've been actively involved in a number of articles and little else. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgleyDJ_85d5.html" title="User:MidgleyDJ">MidgleyDJ</a> 03:34, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wish Midge had read the comment above or on his own discussion page before looking on the Dennis Calero deletion page buecause we have since "made up": " I will, however, apologise for not notifying you of my adding speedy delete tags to the article, this is clearly not the ideal approach, and I'm endevouring not to make that mistake again."</dd>

<p>I have elected to refrain from further comment but I just wanted to point out that this happened. --Ughmonster 13:59, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Basically? A screen capture from a random YouTube video of undetermined origin is not sufficient source nor would it ever be a sufficient source unless the image or the video was somehow iconic and in and of itself a subject of commentary. I'm left the image, tagged, because I meant to also tag it as a replaceable fair-use image and either forgot to or got distracted. It really just needs to go, and I'll take care of it when I'm not on an extremely limited desktop. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>thanks for a prompt response. i took the image from <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Alanguilan_98ba.html" title="Gerry Alanguilan">Gerry Alanguilan</a>'s website <a href="http://komikero.com" class="external free" title="http://komikero.com" rel="nofollow">http://komikero.com</a> and the YOUTUBE video is attached to the blog of his site. I still dont understand the meaning of <i>"iconic and in and of itself a subject of commentary"</i> for the subject matter (image). Does the subject (Leinil) needs a specific pose for his shot to make it look iconic? what about the word "commentary?" <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBloodpack_3533.html" title="User talk:Bloodpack"><span style="color:#fff;background:#800">†B<span style="background:#a00">lo<span style="background:#c00">o<span style="background:#d00">d</span>p</span>ac</span>k†</span></a> 14:58, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm curious about your reasoning as to why policy doesn't apply in this case. The 3RR policy is rather unambiguous on this point, and judging by the talk page, consensus supports this. I think you're a good editor, and as a fellow admin, I would advise against such actions even if policy said nothing about them, because they create the appearance of a conflict of interest. If you had brought the matter up on IRC or at the noticeboard, I and other admins would have been happy to handle the situation. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 08:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will not touch the Misty article again with anything that is religious or secular although I did not add any of those categories. I merely attempted to add something that says she advocated freethought.</p>
<p>I agree with you when you say this: "Religion is not once mentioned in this article. Religion is not once mentioned in this series. Religion is not once mentioned in any Pokémon game, anime, or manga"</p>
<p>Could you provide some secondary source confirming that religion is not mentioned in the show. Again, I do believe that is true, but Brandon wants a source for that assertion.
