<p>My apologies for the edit warring, there. I simply didn't condone the rollback and lack of descriptive eidt summeries in article construction. Since you strongly dispute some of my edit and related reasoning, I suggest we adhere to 1RR and bring relelvant discussion to talkpages. Inquiring for third opinions is also preferable.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize. I really would like us to work together on this. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandall_Brackett_fd50.html" title="User talk:Randall Brackett">Randall Brackett</a> 03:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough.</dd>
<dd>As for image sizes, I've been trying to get to a standard width of 200px on pretty much everything; a little less for tall images and short articles, a little more for short images. If you're pushing everything to the border, you're often dwarfing the actual article, as well as bloating an already-large infobox. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:29, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really think its our difference in monitors; 200px for the Gandara image looked nearly unable to be seen to me. I comprimised with 235px, as I thought it fair to keep the infobox in a reasonable size and one that allowed the image to be seen.</dd>

<dd>Of course this is irrelevant; since its merged. On the minor characters article, the lack of information is attributed to the game's distribution solely to Japan.

<p>Perhaps you should explain how exactly a fictional category should be emphasised, if not by describing the subject in question as fictional.

<dd>The article isn't large enough to explain from an outside source point-of-view, everything requiring explanation has already been addressed in the main Resident Evil article. If you're suggesting the entire article be scrapped and re-written, perhaps you should explain exactly what you want addressed regarding its fiction so that the next writer won't do exactly the same thing. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 08:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You wish to add information regarding the publisher, the creator, date of release, etc. Why? Its not worth the effort, the article itself is simply a small page intended to explain what the "Samurai Edge" is to people reading the main RE article who are unfamiliar with the name or weapon. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 08:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it's not worth turning into a properly encyclopedic article, then it probably needs to be merged or deleted. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:48, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly why the article exists to begin with. There is no specific article or category for it to fall under. I wrote much of the article in question and, as such, would not like to see it deleted or merged.

<dd>Well, right now it's just not encyclopedic. It tracks the movements of a single fictional object, without ever offering any context or even explaining in which games each claim can be attributed to. I'm tempted to prod it, honestly. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:02, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose the problem you have with the article is that you believe most of it has been entirely made up then? Much of the information can be found in files picked up in-game, more is explained in bios and official sites regarding RE. You said you're not a big fan of RE, I assure you, I am, and I know what I'm talking about. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 09:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's made up (Well, it was made up by Capcom, but you know what I mean), I think it's wholly unsourced, and subtrivial. Wikipedia can't rest on "I know what I'm talking about"; you need to cite sources, and "the RE series" doesn't really cut it.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, I don't really think this article is worth going to all the trouble of rewriting and sourcing, since it's subtrivial; one gun in one game series. I think the best thing to do with it is redirect it or delete it, from what you've told me in this conversation. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps you should open a poll regarding that decision. Regardless, I can't specify every single file I've come across from a game made in 1999. If you want sources, I'm sure they have something at the official website or you can pick up a copy of Nemesis from <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>. Instead of deleting the article, why don't you personally add the references you would like to see displayed?</p>

<p>As I've already stated, I don't want the article deleted so obviously that is not what I'm suggesting. I'm suggesting that if you don't like how the article is written, you should make the changes you feel it needs. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 09:53, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I'm stating that I'm not qualified to do so without some idea what games are involved, and the article doesn't currently give me context sufficient to determine same. Additionally, I don't think the article will be encyclopedic after being sourced. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Then I suppose we won't be reaching an agreement on this issue anytime soon. I believe that it details a major weapon used by many characters in several RE games, and that there isn't another description of such depth on the Internet today. People who read the article will most certainly already be familiar with the Resident Evil franchise and will hardly be interested in the sourcing of information and out-of-universe perspective or relevancy. You obviously don't agree. I suppose you'll do what you'll do. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 10:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi A Man In Black! Long time, few encounters. How are you? Still the bright, bubbly person we once knew and loved&#160;:P?</p>
<p>Anyway, having looked at your recent talkpage entries (yes, your userpage is still on my watchlist), I can see perilously few positive messages, compliments or other such niceties (I've never been able to spell that word) so here you go: a message with no griping, moaning, groaning, vicious or catty comments, or even useful, insightful discussion. Instead, you got me, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rabbit#Verb" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rabbit#Verb" rel="nofollow">rabbiting</a> on - is that an improvement? I doubt it, but you have me anyway. Oh, and this delicious-looking fruit 'n' veg stall (sorry, I'm a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/veggie" class="extiw" title="wikt:veggie">veggie</a> to the core). Enjoy!</p>

<p>I couldn't help asking, but is there some sort of joke tradition going on with putting the dead guy on your talk page onto other people's pages and labeling it as vandalism? If it weren't a joke, it's kind of a strange thing for an admin to do. And let me assure you: If you put one of those Nixon-faced goblins on my talk page, I'll replace it with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dick_Cheney.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dick_Cheney.jpg" rel="nofollow">dick</a> of my own...

<dd>It's definitely a joke; a very weird vandal once put one on my talk page, so I kept it because I was amused. It sort of became a thing after I decided to poll #wikipedia for people who wanted to have their user pages vandalized with a picture of a Dick, and it went from there. Minun put a request on his user page to have it redesigned, so I added a decoration. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 19:30, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think I can actually challenge your credibility with that explanation: Research into your talk page's history reveals that it was not the vandal that put the Nixon picture there, it was you that put it there to replace what the vandal had put in previously: an actual picture of an erect male tool. And the reason he did that was because you deleted a page called "Pope John Paul Kiddiefiddler", which he was apparently attached to. Ahh, details are entertaining...

<dd>Er. That's not what I understood you to say. Because you used the term reappropriation, I assumed you were saying it had been and still should be redirecting to the WikiProject. I was just confused by your language. It just seemed a silly point to me otherwise, because if the Project had wanted the shortcut it had lain there until April waiting. Still, there's probably little worth discussing it any further. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What you are doing on the New Super Mario Brothers Wiki page is vandalism, adding more reviews to the review section should not be reverted back. It is providing more opinions for the viewer on this particular game. It should be noted that the particular review I am adding is for NON profit and is from a down to earth gamer's perspective rather than a paid critic working for a corporation. Also Gamerankings is a site that has hundreds of scores submitted from various sites and is a great place to have many opinions offered to you at one single location.

<p>Gamerankigs is part of the CNet umbrella which owns Gamespot. Yes there are fansites submitted but they must pass strict guidelines before they can be submitted. The site must have over 300 reviews for a multiplatform site and over 150 for a site dedicated to one particular console. It is a great way for the user to see many opinions all in one place. If anything Famitsu scores should be removed considering we do not have access to the actual review and it is in a foreign language. --<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStiffler52_5ffb.html" title="User:Stiffler52">Stiffler52</a></p>

<p>You do realize the guidelines have changed for Gamerankings though right?

<p>Thanks for not respecting my wishes, I have come to expect no less from you. I am fully aware of the discussion regarding warnings. Frankly, it is irrelevant to what I have stated on my talk page. Surely I am within my rights to state that I do not wish to use the User talk page to communicate, but inted to comply with clearly enunciated policy and ARBCOM rulings. It is clearly stated that <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a> is <b>not</b> a policy.</p>
<p>I also feel that your "helpful" posting to my talk page is a back-handed way in which to harass me, as you surely know that you are one of the administrators that I obviously do not wish to communicate with at all. Can I say that I do not like you without that being uncivil or being characterized as a personal attack? Is it ok just to think it, but not write it? No incivility is intended in this remark, but I would rather not communicate with you at all unless absolutely necessary because I do not like you. Is telling someone that you don't like them "uncivil"? or a "personal attack"? If stating so is somehow "uncivil" or a "personal attack", I hereby apologize in advance (do I have to MEAN the apology for it to count?)and ask how I could explain that I do not wish to communicate with you in any way, shape or form without being uncivil or making a personal attack in communicating to you that I wish no further communication with you.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Did you even bother to read what I have written on my User talk page? I asked that editors please refrain from communicating with me there unless absolutely necessary. I suppose it depends on what your definition of "need to speak" is. I am trying to express that I am not interested in communications (even such as this one) unless they are absolutely relevant and pertinent. If someone wants to talk to me in a manner other than this, I am putting up the notice on my User Talk page to make it clear that I do not wish to communicate unless it is necessary. Editors should be able to communicate with me on talk pages of relevant articles or on appropriate project pages for any other requirements. The only reason I am entertaining even this conversation as long as I have on your user talk page is because I wish to "settle the hash" with you, as it were. I want to get any "necessary" communication with you over with now because I don't really relish the thought of communicating with you in the future. I feel it is best for my future participation on WP to avoid you and people like you at almost all costs. Whether it is your intention or not, I interpret your communications with me as goading, insincere, harassing, offensive, frustrating, snide and back-handed. This may be a failing on my part, that I interpret your comments in the worst light even while trying to assume good faith, so to deal with that, I am choosing not to communicate with you, and request that you refrain from communicating with me.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 00:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey, I was wondering, since you implimented the general CVG character boxes, could you make a Star Fox in-universe one, similar to the Metal Gear, Resident Evil, etc. ones? A while ago I tried, but got lost in the complex coding.

We need more editors committed to describing fictional entities as artifacts of this universe and realizing that, if they can't, then the article doesn't belong. With fiction on Wikipedia, I've noticed that the biggest problem is not vandalism (which is easy to detect and revert) or POV pushing (usually), but good-faith yet misguided efforts to expand the articles in the direction of in-universe trivia. I used to be an eventualist, but having seen the widespread issues with these edits, I think that I've started to head towards immediatism, at least for wholly in-universe articles. A complete rewrite is too often utterly necessary even in cases where there is encyclopedic potential if proper research is done, and deletion stops the bleeding. It's kind of sad that it comes to that, really. ‚Äî <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 21:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I get what you're saying, and that approach is probably best for subjects that inherently don't deserve articles. It's the stuff that should theoretically be sustainable as separate articles if properly researched ‚Äî some of the <i>Halo</i> auxiliary articles, for instance ‚Äî that's irksome. Yes, I saw your point about the main Bungie articles in need of cleanup, and I'd mostly agree. The flip side that, looking at <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>, we have a good number of quality exemplars of video games, films, and characters, but little in the way of fictional universes themselves and other smaller elements of fiction/gaming, except for <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">spoo</a>. I think at some point notable examples of these elements need to be well-researched and vetted through FA, to set a model for similar articles. The other thing is that I'm far more involved in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Machinima_8cbf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Machinima">WikiProject Machinima</a> than I am with video game articles themselves, and certain things that are trivial to the video games themselves are somewhat more important for their use in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinima.html" title="Machinima">machinima</a>. ‚Äî <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 10:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize for calling your edit vandalism. I was patrolling recent changes, saw your edit, which screwed up the image positioning, and reverted. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 07:03, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings. There's a small issue with <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_mods_6a66.html" title="Deus Ex mods">Deus Ex mods</a> article I'd like to discuss.</p>
<p>The article was very recently created to reduce amount of modding links in the <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_80b2.html" title="Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a>. I think it was on borderline of rules, but the article currently progresses. After you deleted it, it was shortly recreated, most probably not intentionally, but just missing the fact it was deleted in the process of editing. I don's suggest to delete it, of course, and would rather ask to keep it for a while. Currently I'm in doubt about what <i>in general</i> should be done. Do you suggest to put mods back to the main article, let the article expand or implement other solutions? I'm personally in favor of keeping the article to expand, but, if it can't be implemented, please suggest something else. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 11:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
