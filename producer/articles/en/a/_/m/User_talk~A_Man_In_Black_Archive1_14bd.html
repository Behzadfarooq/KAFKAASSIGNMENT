Consider putting something on your user page, even if it's just #REDIRECT [[User talk:A Man In Black]], which will send people to your talk page immediately. While you're not under any obligation to have a user page, many people are unnecessarily distrustful of people who don't have them, as very few established users and very many <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sock puppets</a> don't have one. Of course, if you are already aware of this and have consciously chosen not to have a page (for whatever reason) feel free to ignore this. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 11:28, 2005 Apr 29 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems I've been banned as a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> for a snarky remark about how one of his trolls could be taken as funny, out of context. While I understand why the admins might be touchy about such remarks, I rather wish someone had taken the time to look at my contribs, or e-mail me, or leave a note on my talk page before placing an indefinite ban.</p>
<p>There wasn't even a note placed on my talk page to alert me why I was banned; I went to continue a conversation on a talk page when I got the ban notice, and had to do into the ban list to find out why I was banned.</p>
<p>I think anyone who had taken the time to look at my contribs can tell that I'm not some random troll, and had the admin in question contacted me, I could have pointed him to at least one Wikipedian (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">User:Schissel</a>, an admin) who can vouch for my...uh...independent existence.</p>
<p>Hopefully, someone sees this on Recent changes, since the abrupt ban with no note on my talk page has cut me off from the usual channels to defend myself. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>) 09:30, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please expand on your rationale for posting the NPOV tag to the article Danish Blue Cheese. It doesn't look like any of the previous versions had any sort of bias issues. They did have serious quality problems, and I wonder if there is real need for the page. It is likely a candidate for redirection or other action, but I would first like to find out what you intended with your NPOV tag.

<dd>Redirecting a whole series of articles <i>en masse</i> is the sort of thing that requires consensus or at least discussion before just up and doing it, especially if information is going to be lost in the process.This is made even worse by the fact that some of your information has turned out to be faulty, such as your assertation that several characters did not appear in the manga, when in fact they very clearly did, in multiple chapters as well. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:18, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The misunderstanding that they made single appearances was why I listed them on VFD, and, if you'll note, I delisted them after being corrected. They never even made it to the main VFD pages before I marked them for delisting.</dd>
<dd>As for merging them, see my reasoning on <a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">user talk:Celestianpower</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/c/WP%7EPAC_a17e.html" title="WP:PAC">WP:PAC</a>. The game info really is cruft; I am in the process of adding their signature Pokémon to the list articles (and welcome anyone from PAC who wants to help me do that), but long lists of specific Pokemon and specific levels from the different levels of the Emerald endgame aren't encyclopedic content. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>) 13:24, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem here is that you seem to consider your own opinion of what "cruft" is to be universal when it's pretty obvious that it isn't, since at least two others disagree with you. While it's entirely possible that the game info might be removed at some point, we need to establish consensus first. We're not talking about one-sentence substubs here, nor are we talking about one or two articles. This is a whole series of articles, with numerous previous editors. Discuss, build consensus, then act... not the other way around. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:33, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I see in a recent edit you made to <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_5c0d.html" title="Giovanni (Pokémon)">Giovanni</a> that you made a hidden (is that the word? I mean those tags that have the "!" sign in them and are visible only in the edit box) question concerning the bit in the article about Giovanni's mother. (i.e "WTF is this?") It's true that this is not exactly mainstream knowledge, so let me explain:</p>
<p>In Japan, a "radio drama" (which as I understand it is basically a Pokémon episode without the animation) was produced, which was about the story of Mewtwo until the events of the first movie. Part of the radio drama was the short "Birth of Mewtwo" video that also exists in English.</p>
<p>The story is narrated by Giovanni, who tells us about when Team Rocket was led by a very beautiful woman that he then identifies as his mother. This woman is referred to as On'na Boss, meaning the Woman/Female Boss. Jessie's mother Miyamoto, a TR agent, brings to her attention the existence of Mew from a recording in the Andes, and On'na Boss sends her to investigate. Miyamoto eventually finds Mew, but is subsequently lost in an avalanche and never heard of again. The story then continues with Giovanni's own attempts to find Mew one generation later, whose results we all know. Hope this cleared things up without being too long-winded! <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinistro_1894.html" title="User:Sinistro">Sinistro</a> 22:01, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

The main reason you are pestering me is probably a bad conscience. I have explained in detail why it is not a fork proposal, and before setting it up. It needs to be established first that we do need standardization before we have standardization. There is nothing to argue.

<p>Sorry, Man, people keep asking me to contribute to that page. They're asking for it. What did they think they were going to get apart from sarcasm - a proposal for mandatory pink and green infoboxes? I have nothing to add to that page.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 09:25, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about "I strongly feel that any attempt to standardize the infoboxes is a bad idea"? Strongly and clearly stating your case helps. Sarcasm and disruption to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> just makes you look bad. Personally, I don't want to see any sort of top-down effort to standardize the infoboxes, but this just makes you look bad and annoys everyone involved, on top of confusing the issue.</dd>
<dd>If you don't feel you can contribute in a useful way, then state your case clearly and briefly, then walk away. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 09:33, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know you want to defend your POV and not listen to other peoples comments still: Maybe if you have a good day think about this: you are voting for a proposal which is going to hinder Wikipedia forever. Numerous users will be busy putting through rules that serve no purpose whatsoever. Numerous users will leave Wikipedia due to the edit wars that you are laying the basis for with the proposal you support. The proposal you are signing includes grave plans to disrupt the work of innocent human beings for an indefinite period of time. The time spent on this stupid debate could go into creating the article that the standardization attempts illustrate ridiculously well: Over-bureaucratization is still a red link to this day, even though this problem has been prevalent for a while.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 09:38, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this your POV is strikingly similar to mine than I completely fail to see what your editwarring here is about. If you think I am disrupting a dialogue, and had any example to confirm that I assume you would have already given an example. But Ok, I am waiting for you to come up with one. And I would ask you to get some grip on yourself and not resort to personal attacks (making yourself look bad). There is a policy against that on Wikipedia, read here: <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. If you think I am attacking people who agree with my goals, give examples. I have only responded to the ones that have not supported my proposal, because this is the thing usually done on VfD.</dd>
<dd>And again, I would like you to think about the consequences of your actions: by supporting the deletion of my policy proposal you will set an important precedent: the first consequence is that other proposals will be put on VfD and the second consequence is that you are going to have infobox standardization (which strangely enough is against your own goals). Also may I express my utter disgust at calling other peoples proposals POV, POINT and the like.

<p>I'm not editwarring. Voting in good faith and continuing conversation on talk pages isn't editwarring.<br />
You need to calm down. This is advice from someone who agrees with you. Let calmer heads take over the discussion, because you have clearly personalized this debate. You're clearly very angry about this, acting in anger, and are lashing out at anyone who disagrees with you on even procedural issues.<br />
Walk away from this for two days. Chill out. I can't tell from your user page what your hobby is, but absorb yourself in it a bit. You'll come back refreshed and destressed, and I promise you that this issue won't be closed by then. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 10:06, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Man in Black,your comments during the last hour were useless and pointless beyond discription. If that is not editwarring I don't know what is. You are doing this because you enjoy annoying other users. There is no real need for your attacks on my person that you could objectively argue. I recommend again you stop this.</dd>
<dd>Trying to convince other users who do not agree with your POV to go away is nowhere near good faith. And if you take a few days off, you will realize that.

<dd>Well utterly baffled is a good description, again, as several times before and in several places before, I suggest you stop your attacks now. There is no need to attack other users - we have all seen you can. Great. Are you done now? Again, your criticism of my person is completely out of place and goes over any top. What do you think you are doing? Also, so that there is no misunderstanding on my comments on the proposal you favor: the sarcasm about the stupity of having standardization is one thing. It was not meant to be sarcastic however that I do support to have standardization because there is so much support. I think we should respect that opinion. People who don't like it don't have to stay. The organization is going to run down that alley no matter what. I do know that standardization will be costly to Wikipedia, the people on VfD don't. There is nothing you can do about that but watch them wreck it. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 11:42, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Snarky reason: because the article is about half poorly-formatted lists, and one-third excruciating detail about fans arguing about how the series was localized. The article needs restructuring, better linking, and a little bit of brushcutting, all by someone knowledgable about the subject but also willing to say, "You know, it's not really necessary to go on for three paragraphs about mild romantic tension being removed from the English-language localization of a childrens' anime."</dd>
<dd>More reasonable reason: The tag is there because the article could do with a little attention from <a href="../../../p/a/c/WP%7EPAC_a17e.html" title="WP:PAC">WP:PAC</a>, and bringing things to the attention to the contributors to that project is what the tag is for. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>) 20:02, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, I read your note several days ago and forgot about it. Real life responsibilities lead to Wiki-procrastination.</p>
<p>I was a pretty avid SW:CCG player for a while. I eventually lost interest after moving to a different state, since I had to leave behind all my fellow players. I still have a few hundred rares stowed away in a box in the closet. So where do you remember seeing me? My memory isn't great, and I can't say I remember seeing your nickname. Perhaps on one of the mailing lists or forums?</p>
<p>As for those Pokémon articles, I just cleaned them up on a whim. I haven't played any of the games since the original Red/Blue/Yellow years ago, so I'm not too knowledgeable on the series. I just re-arranged the existing information into a more readable format. My focus on Wikipedia has been wandering lately, so I can't really commit to one of those WikiProjects. I will keep an eye out, though, if I come across any Poké-related articles that I can improve. --<a href="../../../p/o/i/User%7EPoiuytman_f6fc.html" title="User:Poiuytman">Poiuyt Man</a> <a href="../../../p/o/i/User_talk%7EPoiuytman_ccf5.html" title="User talk:Poiuytman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 07:50, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, A Man in Black, I have to say I was quite surprised at your comment on my talkpage. I do not know CoolKatt that well, and he seems to have mistook me for an admin when he said that I should report you for vandalism. Although I do edit a lot of videogame related articles and I do revert vandalism, I am not a sysop. About the whole dispute, though, it's true that CoolKatt should not be adding vprotected tags as only an admin has the right to do that (since he can't protect the page). The admin TonySidaway recently protected the article you're having a dispute over, so that conflict seems to have quieted down for now. As for CoolKatt merging cultural references into the Pokemon article, I think he should wait for the VfD to finish before he starts merging the references. Regarding the VfD, he's not really doing anything wrong by calling the votes sockpuppets and the closing admin will determine if there has been sockpuppetry in the Vfd. So all in all, I can't really do much to help since I'm not an admin or a mediator. I hope you two will just let the dispute quiet down and work on resolving it calmly without any personal attacks. <a href="../../../a/m/r/User%7EAmren_dbd6.html" title="User:Amren">Amren</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/r/User_talk%7EAmren_474a.html" title="User talk:Amren"><font color="#63B8FF">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:00, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh! I thought you were an admin. You can always volunteer to mediate (anyone can), but there's no onus on you to do so.

<p>Hi there, I noticed you moved a page by cutting the text from one page and pasting it into another. There is a better (preferred) way of doing this which preserves the pages edit history). As the page being moved TO already exists, it requires an admin to delete the page. I'll make the changes now - this way, users who have the old page on their watchlist will automatically have the newly named page on their watchlist). -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 12:22, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also - I'm not sure if the preferred naming scheme for Pokemon characters is (Pokemon) or (Pokemon character). WP is being pretty slow for at the moment, so I will carry out the page move anyway - it can always be un-done later! -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 12:28, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there. I'm pleased to let you know that, consensus being reached, you are now an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator</a>! You've volunteered to do housekeeping duties that normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops can't do a lot of stuff: They can't delete pages just like that (except patent nonsense like "aojt9085yu8;3ou"), and they can't protect pages in an edit war they are involved in. But they can delete random junk, ban anonymous vandals, delete pages listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> (provided there's a consensus) for more than one week, protect pages when asked to, and keep the few <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected pages</a> that exist on Wikipedia up to date.</p>
Almost anything you can do can be undone, but please take a look at <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_how-to_guide_237e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide">The Administrators' how-to guide</a></b> and the <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">Administrators' reading list</a></b> before you get started (although you <i>should</i> have read that during your candidacy&#160;;). Take a look before experimenting with your <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">powers</a>. Also, please add <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Administrators' noticeboard</a> to your watchlist, as there are always discussions/requests for admins there.

This article has, at its core, the evidence that he publically claimed that he would make these movies, despite later protests to the contrary. I don't feel that all the scraps of evidence about what he originally planned to have happen in these movies should be assembled into some sort of jigsaw puzzle, just that his earlier public statements should be cited as a source of a great deal of fan community speculation. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 04:03, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that, but I'm uncomfortable with it, nonetheless.

<dd>Trust me, I'm not defending them. I've cooled down since. I rarely treat others with such a level of temper. Anyhow, I've seen current admins go a little gung ho on certain people, both with audio and action. Anyway, I understand that an admin should not act in such a manner, and I wouldn't act as such and tarnish the image of an admin. Of course, that's just my word, and it can't be proven as simple fact. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 08:11, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's still a confrontational action, you know? There are things you can do in good faith that can still provoke others, and appearing to defend even admitted mistakes is one of them.
