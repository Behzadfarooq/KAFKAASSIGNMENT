<p>Greetings. I noticed you wanted <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2_Skulls_05db.html" title="Halo 2 Skulls">Halo 2 Skulls</a> deleted. Being the page's creator and primary contributor, I felt obliged to defend it. Originally, I created it to contribute to the then strong WikiProject: Halo. However, that seems to be a lost cause, especially for list pages such as the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>What I'll probably eventually end up doing is just creating a section in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a> and linking to the High Impact Halo archive. Perhaps you wouldn't mind doing it? It is you, if I'm not mistaken, who would do desire to see the end of pages like this. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_C62_dbb4.html" title="User:Cryptic C62">Cryptic C62</a> 22:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello A Man In Black. I noticed that in your draft User:A Man In Black/CVG and A Man In Black/CVG/Tool you have the categories still activated, so it's showing up in <a href="../../../e/s/o/Category%7EEsoteric_templates_07a5.html" title="Category:Esoteric templates">Category:Esoteric templates</a> and in several others. Could I suggest that you deactivate the category links (by putting a colon before 'Category' in the link) until such time as the article is in the mainspace rather than the userspace? (As per <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>, "If you copy an article to your user namespace you should decategorize it".)

<dd>I absolutely agree. A redlink might prompt someone to actually m ake a proper article, these were not even real stubs - and half of them were for elementary schools at that, there is not even an obdurate minority vetoing all attempts at consensus for elementary schools. I am more than ever convinced that we should have a separate project for schools so that we can go back to including in Wikpedia only those schools which are verifiably significant. Nobody has yet succeeded in explaining the essential difference between schools and hangouts in terms of significance within a community, the vast majority of school articles are functionally unverifiable to anyone outside the local area, after all. My suggested bar for inclusion is at least one alumnus who is, say, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Lucasian Professor of Mathematics</a> at Cambridge University, or <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Adrian_IV_1644.html" title="Pope Adrian IV">Pope</a>, or director of <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Weddings_and_a_Funeral_942b.html" title="Four Weddings and a Funeral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>, or a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Rice_f13b.html" title="Tim Rice">composer of West End hits</a> or some such.

<p>MIB, I notice you're blanking all the comments to <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephencolbert_d735.html" title="User talk:Stephencolbert">User_talk:Stephencolbert</a> so I thought I'd make my suggestion to you directly, rather than adding it myself.

<p>Blocking someone to protect the real Colbert is one thing-- blocking someone for their speech on a TV Show is another. Given that we're not doing the latter, could we put up something in big letters explicitly saying point blank that "If this is really Stephen Colbert's account, it will be unblocked".</p>

<p>I recently noticed that regarding an article that the user <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> deprodded (the Metal Gear <a href="../../../s/n/e/Sneaking_suit.html" title="Sneaking suit">Sneaking suit</a> article), you asked him on his talk page if he was interested in improving the article, citing sources or otherwise contributing to the information there. I just wanted to let you know I have had some trouble with the behavior of this user before (primarily the same thing, in that he deprods articles constantly, probably 75% of which I object to). He does not appear to actually exhibit an interest in seeing the articles or the Wikipedia project itself improve, which I find objectionable. I once overstepped my bounds in criticising him in AFDs to articles he had deprodded, and soon learned my lesson. My question for you is, is there any way (other than toughing it out) to deal with the hours of work he takes racks up for other editors after he spends only a couple minutes removing prod tags from pages? If I recall correctly, the last time I brought this issue up an editor directed me to bring it up at PROD talk. If I had any confidence that would achieve anything, I would have done so. Any opinions you have on the matter would be appreciated.
