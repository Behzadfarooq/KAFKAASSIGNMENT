<p>I began drafting a syntax guide to go along with aforementioned infobox and I'm inquiring if there's any interest in one being made.

<p>Hi, I'm contacting you since you are the one who protected the <a href="../../../w/a/p/Wapanese.html" title="Wapanese">Wapanese</a> to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanophile.html" title="Japanophile">Japanophile</a> redirect. I'm not sure what the Japanophile article looked like at the time you did this, but it has in the meantime gone through an AfD and a consequent rewrite to reflect the dictionary meaning of the word instead of the internet meme. Because of this, the redirect from Wapanese is now meaningless, it redirects to an article that has very little to do with the common conception of what a Wapanese is. Could you remove the protection and bring back the Wapanese article? Much obliged, <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 20:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

No, I won't bring that back. If you want to make a sourced article, I'll delete the redirect, though. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I did see the article before I contacted you here, and I agree, it is terrible. And under the circumstances, with a Wapanese article being a vandal magnet for frustrated kiddies with no lives, I can see how a protected redirect can seem like an optimal solution - it's in a way even better than deletion. But the Japanophile article in itself has no real connection to the term anymore.</dd>
<dd>Ok, how about this: I write up a sentence or two into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a> article and you redirect it there? There's bound to be quite some people watching that article, so any vandalism is more likely to be swiftly dealt with than it would in a separate Wapanese article, and frankly, I don't even think Wapanese deserves a standalone article. Would that seem like a viable solution to you? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 19:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey MiB, I'm having a little problem on the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_Fusion_11b8.html" title="Cross Fusion">Cross Fusion</a> page, and was wondering if you could lend me a hand. You remember that list of each Cross Fusion Member that I wrote for the page? I realized how unencylopedic and crufty it was, so I removed it entirely while expanding the History section of the article in recent edits. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tempest115_c8bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tempest115">Tempest115</a>, however, is clinging to it despite the reasoning behind the removal of the list. Initially, he/she just put the list back on the page, but after being reverted, he/she created a <i>seperate</i> page (<a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_Fusion_Members_3ba9.html" title="Cross Fusion Members">Cross Fusion Members</a>) to house the list. Given that the list is unencylopedic/crufty/fan site-ish and unnecessary (as the Cross Fusion article details the history of the process and the history of the members involved, and not the members themselves), I believe the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_Fusion_Members_3ba9.html" title="Cross Fusion Members">Cross Fusion Members</a> page needs to be deleted (perhaps a lock on recreating the page after it's been deleted would be effective). --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 15:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, Pokemon is a PART of Nintendo, which is why everything Pokemon related belongs under the Nintendo project. That's also why I didn't add the Video game template. And, the Legend of Zelda WikiProject has the Nintendo template as part of its template, and not everything Zelda related has been in video games. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 19:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that you followed up the deletion of the article on 'Jossed' by removing it from <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction_terminology.html" title="Fan fiction terminology">Fan fiction terminology</a> as well. You state that this is because the term is not verifiable. The problem is that every single term on that page is verifiable to the same extent, or lack of it by, the rules as you have interpreted them. Those terms are created by fans, they are documented by fans, they are easily verifiable by half a minute's work with google and you will find agreement between all the fan glossaries as to what they mean. If fans aren't the experts about fandom then who is? To refuse to accept fan glossaries as a verification is bizarre. So I, personally, would consider that verifiable by any sensible standard, but if the rules of Wikipedia are such that they aren't then you need to be consistent. Either delete every single fandom term - which I personally think will annoy a lot of people and reduce the value of the site for no very great gain, or don't delete 'Jossed'. I am aware that by saying this I am risking you deleting the whole article on fanfic terminology but I think this is something that needs to be thought about a bit more carefully. The whole issue of verifiability for fandom terminology is muddy and it clearly needs to be thought out in greater detail. You cannot apply the same rules to something like fandom as were created for an academic discipline. So either the rules need to be made more flexible, or you are permanently prohibiting Wikipedia from including material that end-users would benefit from. But please don't just delete one word at random, thus reducing the comprehensiveness of the terminology article.</p>
<p>Having said all of which I have neither the time nor the emotional energy to care about this issue or spend any more time on it than I already have. There are plenty of alternative sites that provide fandom glossaries for these terms so its not as if the Wikipedia articles represent irreplaceable resources.

<dd>Is there a reason you can't let others edit the templates? I did see the talk for Tekken series. Just because the article for Tekken 6 isn't great, doesn't mean we should leave it out of the template. Others have the right to edit templates, without you reverting them all the time.

<p>Because the articles about the characters <i>are</i> about video games. They are not themselves video games, no; the template directs people to articles about video games.</p>

Unlike any of your older blocks, each of these three recent blocks were handed out for good reason, and they were the first blocks you got that weren't mistakes on the parts of the blockers. I'm seriously starting to feel a little concerned for you here, I sure don't like seeing you or any other good-faith user undergo stress over this project. Of course, I can stop feeling that way and stay out of your business if you'd like.

<p>The IRC revert block was reverting a troll, to be honest, I just didn't feel like explaining this to the blocker and getting it smoothed out since the block never affected me.

<p>Most of it is because I haven't spent any time concentrating on WP lately, just cleaning up in snatches of time. Usually this means forgetting who I've explained reverts to and who I haven't, where the ongoing disputes are, and how many times or if at all I've reverted.

It was my understanding that templates should help ease navigation through linked articles under a specific heading. What you've done to the template is make navigation much more cumbersome.

<p>I'm sorry, but if you think unofficial/fansites, like thesnakesoup.org, are unreliable sources, then you are no different from people who jump the gun or discriminators.

I, who is a big fan of Metal Gear and the series, have seen their (the snake soup) information and I KNOW that it is correct. Give me the scoop?

<p>Yeah, and it isn't right to edit an article and fill it with information based on one's experience alone and say it is correct. And that's what has been going on for all these years here and it was accepted and guys like you made sure it stayed. And there are no claims, there are facts. Guys like you ignore the fact that official websites have the right to be sourced even if they are wrong, as long as they are official. While unofficial ones are unreliable/untrustable just cause they are unofficial. I understand how things go here. But just rememebr this: at least 60% of wikipedia can be blindly passed with informaion that is false due people's free edits, and it's all through "official" sources. If you're gonna stand by a ideal, learn how to use it right. Now there is no uncorroborated (whatever the hell that means) claim; THEY ARE CALLED FACTS AND THEY ARE CREATED THROUGH POSITIVE AND ENSURING EXPERIENCE. See, based on how much wikipedia itself is not trusted by the world, it is clear that you're implying that any kind of information, be it true or false, can be (and is being) put on the articles, so long as it is not "an uncorroborated claim made on a fansite". I applaud your ability to singular-discriminate.</p>

<p>I don't believe you read my message, which is even more sad. I in fact read that shit, which is a long page of stuff mostly I don't care about. But its main idea is to put down the unofficial sources is what I so far understand. It is quite cool to have a website with such dumbass rules like these, one being a site that is probably very most informative than other sites. But it is clear that wikipedia has rules that care more about sourcing to "official" sites than unofficial, no matter the reason is if it has real info or not. God.</p>

<p><i>De-indenting</i> Would you perhaps be willing to leave the items there for the next week or so, to allow me to review the cards claimed as notable? I would then either provide a reference to a third party's assessment of a card as "notable," or delete the card.

<p>The "notability" of Damnation is exactly why I think citing the WOTC site is a bad idea. The only claim of notability is that WOTC, the company with a vested interest in promoting their cards, happened to promote it first from the new set they were promoting. "We thought this card was so important we wanted to get you hyped about it right away!" is not a claim to notability. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh, if you were in my position of view you'd be outright laughing; it was only a week and a half ago that I was posting here all worried about how many blocks you've been getting recently, and since then you got two more blocks of increasing seriousness. Based on your note on your Leeroy Jenkins edits, some of this blocky business might have been the work of a rouge admin, and your blocks and opposition towards you on article talk pages in general might be because people are interested in seeing your downfall or something (a fine way of putting it). But I'm starting to think the 3RR rule is a little too strict; five reversions would have made more sense to me if I designed Wikipedia.

<p><s>Here's my take: two edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114269187&amp;oldid=114268597" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114269187&amp;oldid=114268597" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114270713&amp;oldid=114270309" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114270713&amp;oldid=114270309" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> were removing The Real World stuff, while another two reverts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114271371&amp;oldid=114271186" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114271371&amp;oldid=114271186" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114271371&amp;oldid=114271186" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leeroy_Jenkins&amp;diff=114271371&amp;oldid=114271186" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> are of removing the "What was he saying" section.

<dd>Apologies, AMIB. Hbdragon88 05:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On second thought, another admin might consider previous 3RR blocks under gaming the system. Hbdragon88 05:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which is why I reconsidered reverting, and tried to self-revert and move onto other things. Problem is, I'm here, blocked, having violated neither the letter (no fourth revert) nor the intent (no ongoing edit war, as I've conceded the point and tried to self-rv) of the 3RR. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oakshade probably stopped because he had violated the 3RR. Hbdragon88 05:55, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Had he not made his fourth revert, my self-revert would show in the history. His version of the article (save for some non-disputed following edits) is the current one, and I did not at that point and do not now really feel like disputing it any more. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Unblocked</b>. Sorry about that, I should of reviewed that better. Though I do believe that some sort of block was justified because of your constant edit warring. I guess three hours is enough. Sorry again.
