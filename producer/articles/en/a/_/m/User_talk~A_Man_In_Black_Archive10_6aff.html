<p>As you have implied that you know perfectly well that there is massive dispute about school article speedy deleting a school article which had attracted several keep votes is a cynical abuse of your admin privileges, and shows that you cannot be trusted.

<dd>Whoo boy, I see you're really getting flak for doing what Jimbo Wales might consider the right thing. Since I'm a natural pacifist, here's my advice; when concerning an article that some users are more attached to than others, it might be best to leave the dirty work to other admins and focus on less sensitive issues. Unless you like flak, of course (and no, I'm not talking about Flak from Advance Wars). I'm just not too keen on seeing you undergoing the same stress episodes that <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">User:HighwayCello</a> had been going through recently, and which I tried to calm down also. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 23:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Secks</i> as in sex, or <i>secks</i> as in sucks? <i>Lots</i> of connotations there. But Lash rocks. In AW2, the only reason why I won at 4P Leaf Haven was thanks to Lash's terrain bonuses. The battle was too short to use her SCOP, but I did enjoy much better protection in the forests than usual. Then again, I was also matched up against Colin, Flak, and Nell, all of whom have average or below-average units. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 03:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note the conjunction, average <i>or</i> below-average. Plus, luck is a side factor. Colin/Nell/Flak is compartively weak to, say, if I picked the likes of Kanbei, Sami, and Max. Now Sami is HELL ON WHEELS - her 150% capture rate nearly captured my HQ! I couldn't get enough direct units to destroy it.

<dd>Geez, who knew that my trying to relieve your stress would evolve into a discussion about <i>Advance Wars!?</i> Well, since you seem to be open for this forummish discussion, what with you changing the header and everything, allow me to conclude my part in this with a quintuple pun; The various Hawkes around Wikipedia will continually Lash you with Flak and the pain will Adder up unless you quit showing your Blue Moon to those who disagree with you. If you don't, your adminship may succumb into a Black Hole. ^_^ By the way, as a <i>character</i> I like Hawke the best (though I never played the DS game, cuz I don't <i>have</i> DS, shame on me). <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik the Appreciator</a> 20:39, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made this guideline using the reverse process; I identified the problem (directory entries and advertisements), looked at other similar solutions to that problem, then modified it to make sure it defended non-problematic articles. I largely used <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a>'s content, since they had a handful of excellent cases of problematic, borderline, and clearly-non-problematic articles.</dd>
<dd>This compromise is strongly based on something you said in the last debate, that you were worried that a standard would result in the destruction of work spent improving school articles. With that in mind, I've been trying to hone it to affect only promotional and directory-style entries. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Communicating, would be easier, if you could have just said "No, I haven't made such an article" (if that's the answer). For example, I readily admit to never making Pokemon articles. That doesn't stop me from partaking in inclusion/deletion discussion of Pokemon. But, it limits the level/nature/effectiveness of my involvement. Much of your proposal seems based on a radical lack of understanding of the editing and research process. You seem to want instantly complete articles. You think all available information can always be found in the 5-day AFD window. You say you want expandable articles, but seem to want only fully expanded articles. If you wish to continue to spend lots of time involved on school articles, consider simply making some school articles that illustrate what you think a school article <i>should</i> be. When people see what you're for, they'll be less focussed on what you're against. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

Your work doesn't go unnoticed by the people who like to see wikipedia clean and in a good shape, nor does your continued efforts in fighting it.

<p>I edited the description of picture of Vader entering the Tantive IV (the ship's name also not being mentioned in any movie) in Darth Vader's page to say that it was the 501st accompanying him onto the ship. You said it wasn't mentioned in any movie and only in video games; it also is mentioned in the EU however. It is also said on the page of the 501st under the section Rise of the Empire that they did this, and it is mentioned that they make an appearance in Star Wars IV.

<dd>The articles need policing. Otherwise, we end up with 79 million plot summaries written from each minor character's perspective. When I've made changes, I've cited policy, argued them at length, explained my reasoning, and answered counter-arguments. I'm also the only one who has reached outside of Metal Gear fans for input on these articles. I think such an RFC is going to reflect more on the submitters than the subject, and, save for my exasperation over the nonsense over the images in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_Snake_9133.html" title="Solid Snake">Solid Snake</a> (where I lost my temper on a handful of occasions), I'm confident what I'm doing is supported by the community at large (if not a vocal minority of Metal Gear fans) and best for Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:47, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for joining the talk page at Template: da Batz. It works better if people talk, and in fact, we has the same idea about the burton schumaker. I figure it out last night after combining the Serials, but decided to wait a day to let Linin and the other editors see hwo they like the Serials. I did the same to the Christopher Nolan films, and moved teh continuity marker to condense it further. It shaves about 5 lines off the template with the B/S combo and the 9(re)movement of notations. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a request for advice regarding <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Batman_923f.html" title="Template:The Batman">this page</a>. While my first instinct is to take a step back from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Batman_923f.html" title="Template:The Batman">Template:The Batman</a> for a few days, I had also hoped that with the passage of even one day that <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> might have a calmer tone but this seems to not be the case. While I realize that his primary motivations seem to be protectiveness of a page he created and a perception of being ganged up on, his manner so far has been upsetting (to me at least). So I've been looking into the correct methods of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">resolving disputes</a>. From what I can see, we passed through attempts to resolve on his <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuranX_4d05.html" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk page</a> early on, and at least one objective third party (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">User:Josiah Rowe</a>) has attempted to intercede there (not counting any conversation on the template talk page).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So my question is (and I hope you know the correct answer): Is my next step going to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>? It seems to me that the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a> would not apply based on his refusal to accept outside suggestions by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">User:Josiah Rowe</a> and the more simple option of conducting a survey might simply increase ThuranX's belief that he is alone against a crowd of people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I realize you might not be the correct person to ask this, but I have no familiarity or experience with wikipedia disputes of this nature so I'm at a loss. If you choose not to respond (which I will completely respect), I'll of course go with my first thought to simply take a step back from the page for a few days.</dd>

<p>Given your fine work in reviewing gamecrufty articles, I just wanted to point out the new template above if you haven't come across it already.

<ol>
<li>They aren't deleted, just redirected.</li>
<li>There's nothing you can say about them that wouldn't be overly detailed plot summary (of games where the plot is of zero importance), game-guide, or original research (comparing characters, for example).</li>
<li>Killer Instinct is hardly MK or SF in terms of influence.</li>
<li>The MK and SF characters probably shouldn't have their own pages as it is, for reason #2 above.</li>

<p>Man in Black, I am very new at this wikipedia talk. however I have used this online enclopedia for many research topics I had. today for some reason I entered in to the search engin plasma pistol and to my amasment a page actually came up. I was astonished to see that someone had created it. Then I saw that you felt it should be deleated. I just want to say that I think that this article further emphizises the unchalenged fact that wikipedia is the most extensive online dictonary there is. nowhere else can you find such a wide range of topics so throughly covered. Here is the link to the page I am talking about. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_Pistol" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_Pistol" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>

<dd>True! &lt;scratches head&gt; , on the other hand, normal users can't actually delete anything. They can change a page, but the warning is still in the page history.

<dd>This case is above and beyond. Not only was this guy removing warnings, but when JzG restored a thread because it wasn't resolved, FYF was immediately deleting it as "a personal attack."

<p>Hello, AMIB.

The user in question is <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurnaceOfMonkl_e842.html" title="User:FurnaceOfMonkl">FurnaceOfMonkl</a>, and they (in addition to being an editor who consistently pushes POV in articlespace) have posted several images on their page calling people who believe in global warming, etc, drug-addled.

<p>I was wondering if you'd be interested in assisting moving a number of <i>Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior</i> articles to comply with <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>? Some of these titles have been released into western territories by the title <i>Dragon Warrior</i>, which according to policy takes precedence. I can't say whether any backlash is to be expected, which I am willing to deal with should it become necessary but I am however unable to move them myself as I lack admin privileges (they were moved previously), but this a matter of simple housekeeping and we're just enforcing a policy after all.</p>
<p>The articles are as follows:</p>

<dd>Thanks for not reverting my changes. I appreciate your POV -- you're right that trolling and vandalism can be reverted (although I'd be very hesitant to do so on a Talk page, since Talk pages are by definition a place for expressing opinions). But I think a simple off-topic comment doesn't qualify as either vandalism (because it isn't <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia</a>) or trolling (because it's not <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">inflammatory, rude or antagonistic</a> -- unless you think being compared to Ted Turner is an insult, which it might possibly be LOL!! It's simply an off-topic comment (and they usually get ignored) which should be accepted as a good-faith edit. Seems to me the best approach is the simplest: assume good faith, leave the comment, but post a note to the person who left it educating them as to the real purpose of Wikipedia.

<dd>I didn't delete it. I redirected it. What does an AFD have to do with anything that doesn't involve deletion? For that matter, how is a "no consensus" binding on any editorial decision?</dd>
<dd>That said, the "article" doesn't have a single external source, and seems to be rooted in nothing more than direct paraphrasing of the manual and direct observation of the game. Why is this lengthy, overdetailed, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>-ish description of the gameplay necessary, given the reasonable and brief gameplay description in <a href="../../../d/a/w/Empires%7E_Dawn_of_the_Modern_World_2703.html" title="Empires: Dawn of the Modern World">Empires: Dawn of the Modern World</a>? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it might be failed because of an insufficient gameplay section. I took out a lot out thinking someone could read up about it if they wanted to. I don't really know what to add back in. By the way, a redirect is pretty darn close to a delete. The article is gone and cannot be looked up by anyone who wants to read up about the subject (unless they are an expeirenced user). Plus, in the AFD, redirect was one of the suggestions, but was not the decision. I though that this meant that the a group consensus was that this article should be left as it was, since some people wanted it kept, deleted, redirected, or tanswikied. The other odd thing about a redirect is there is no equivalent to it for bringing an article back. I feel like you just skipped all policy and took deletion into your own hands in a quasi-vigilantyism (I'm pretty sure that isn't a word). Can you help me decrease the cruff? I am good at citing sources, and was improving it when it was redirected. I know you hate cruff, but can't this content be brought up to a good level. I mean the article on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gameplay_of_StarCraft_2b24.html" title="Gameplay of StarCraft">Gameplay of StarCraft</a> only has four references. Is that enough?

<dd>My orginal point was that <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starcraft.html" title="Starcraft">Starcraft</a> was featured as well. That was the only RTS game ever to make featured or good article status, so they must have done something right. That's why I modeled Empires after it. Those other games are well written, but what I am worrying about is how to set up the gameplay section, not how to write it. I guess I am not very good at this, becuase reading about a different genre of games didn't seem too relevant to me. They're two different breeds of games, and I thought it would be a good idea for me to choose Starcraft. --<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 20:40, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You seem to have a personal crusade where you want to either delete video game indexes or break them apart. Although I disagree with you in their usefulness, I don't think it is proper to delete whole sections without a general discussion. You can tag all of the articles that you find, but I don't think you ought to delete entire sections because of how you feel about something. For the record, I do have to agree with you that the two articles you deleted might be better suited for the main article, but you never gave anyone a chance to express this opinon. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 19:03, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really a crusade; I've helped to create a number of indices as well. The problem is that such lists tend to become repositories for various duplicate factoids that either don't really belong on Wikipedia or belong elsewhere. If Gamma and Mac are so important to you that they demand mention, mention them in the articles on the single games in which they appear.

<p>Hi there, AMIB. In the past I've known you to be an administrator with a clear understanding of policy, so I had a question for you. Recently, the user <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> has edited a number of controversial pages and made edits that a few editors have found questionable. My question to you would be, given my comments and tagging of a dubious source on the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Brownback_b47d.html" title="Sam Brownback">Sam Brownback</a> page, would anything I've said merit a warning for personal attacks or incivility? I'm always as careful as I can be to treat other users with respect, yet Getaway appears to have warned me for personal attacks out of the blue. If I could get a second opinion on this, I would very much appreciate it.

<p>You write: <i>The result was DELETE. Whudda mess. This subject could possibly be covered under Siberian/Ukranian nationalism (is there an article on that?), but essentially nothing can be said about this conlang as a language based on reliable sources, and it's pretty obvious that Yaroslav Zolotaryov has a row to hoe. Once single-purpose accounts are set aside, it's pretty clear that it's Zolotaryov and his flashmob versus everyone else.</i></p>
<p>With all due respect, but unless you are counting me and numerous other faithful wikipedians under "Zolotaryov's flashmob", this is way beside the truth. May I inquire what your conclusion is based on? Have you actually counted any votes? If so, I'd like to see the result! Even if you discount the bunch of one-editters who voted in favour of keeping the article, you should as well discount the votes of one-editters who voted in favour of deleting it - and believe me, there's a lot of them over here! In addition to that, have you looked at the arguments? Have you noticed the fact that in the meantime a compromise was achieved? To tell you the truth, I haven't seen many good arguments used in favour of deleting the article. In other words, I have a strong feeling that it's just your own personal opinion you are trying to impose. Please convince me.

<dl>
<dd>I discounted pretty much everyone who didn't bother to make an argument, and looked at the arguments in question; the fact that there was little coverage of this language at all, that all of it was in passing in dubious sources, and that <i>none of it was about the language but instead about the surrounding movement</i>. If someone wants to write an article about Siberian/Ukranian nationalism, fine, or an article about the dialects this conlang is based on, fine, but the conlang itself is only ever discussed as an artefact of those two actually-notable subjects. As for my opinion, I assure you I care little about politics in my own country, and that political spats and what-is-and-isn't-a-real-language don't cause me to lose any sleep.</dd>

<p>So, am I a single-purpose account or part of Zolotaryov's flashmob? What I see is actually several well-founded keep votes versus a bunch of STRONG DELETE per ___ by users with 5 or so edits, who came there from Russian Wikipedia through vote-stacking.

<p>I am not a single-purpose account. Nor am I part of a flash-mob. I read the article, read the arguments that existed for delete and keep, found an argument from <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E. Aharoni</a> that seemed to invoke precedent and other examples, so it made sense to me. I then examined the userpage of this editor and saw that he seemed knowledgeable about languages and didn't seem to have a major axe to grind, so I agreed with him rather than making my own argument. I'm disappointed that my opinion was discounted because I didn't make an argument myself. Maybe Amir is part of a flashmob. I don't know. But I do think the discussion indicates no consensus and your evaluation of consensus was mistaken.

<p>Hello, Man In Black. First of all, let me say that I completely agree that it this AfD was a hell of a mess. Yet, your answer don't convince me at all. You say that you discounted "pretty much anyone who didn't bother to make an argument". Look, I want to keep this whole discussion as civilised as possible, but in this case I really think you made a wrong decision. Indeed, it was a hell of a mess and sorting out the votes and arguments wasn't an easy task. I don't even expect you, as a admin, to read every single sentence that was written. So I took the liberty of doing it for you. It took me quite a few hours, but I think it was worth the effort. Here is the result. Let's first count the votes.</p>
<p>If we merely look at the votes for <b>keep</b> (including strong keep, mild keep etc.) and the votes for <b>delete</b>, we get: <b>31 keep</b>, <b>32 delete</b>, <b>2 abstain</b>. That is, completely disregarding any arguments used or any number of edits made.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't want to include the votes of those who merely joined in order to vote here. If we discount anonymous voters and people who made no edits before this AfD was started, we discard:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 for keep: <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttorahn_a24a.html" title="User:Ottorahn">Ottorahn</a>, 62.33.22.253 (Rutopist), Roman Baiduk, <a href="../../../../be/b/o/o/User%7EBooxter_74c9.html" class="extiw" title="be:User:Booxter">be:User:Booxter</a>, Kojpiš Anton, 212.40.42.166, 1 Anonymous, User:195.5.46.19, 85.202.213.101, Bluz, <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPBato_da2d.html" title="User:PBato">pbato</a>, and</li>
<li>2 for delete: 213.171.61.131, Andrey Fedichkin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which still gives us the result of <b>20 keep, 30 delete</b>. This would still classify as <b>no consensus</b>, methinks.</p>
<p>If we discount the votes not only of those who had no edits, but also of those who had few edits (less than 50), we additionally discard:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 for keep: Steel archer, <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.209.xx.xx.html" title="User:82.209.xx.xx">82.209.xx.xx</a>, Yaroslav Zolotaryov, <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwarnik_8cbd.html" title="User:Gwarnik">Gwarnik</a>, 85.141.215.53 (<a href="../../../../ru/d/m/i/User%7EDmitry_Nikitin_9950.html" class="extiw" title="ru:User:Dmitry_Nikitin">Дмитрий Никитин</a>), Alexander Gouk (<a href="../../../../be/a/l/e/User%7EAlexander_Gouk_166d.html" class="extiw" title="be:User:Alexander_Gouk">be:User:Alexander Gouk</a>), and</li>
<li>5 for delete: <a href="../../../o/c/h/User%7EOchkarik_e712.html" title="User:Ochkarik">Ochkarik</a>, <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVladimir_Volokhonsky_e2cf.html" title="User:Vladimir Volokhonsky">Vladimir Volokhonsky</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerebr_8fb3.html" title="User:Serebr">Serebr</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBoleslav1_8adb.html" title="User:Boleslav1">Boleslav1</a>, <a href="../../../../ru/s/h/u/User%7EShurShur_d205.html" class="extiw" title="ru:User:ShurShur">ShurShur</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we end up with the following list of people who had a lot of edits before this AfD started:</p>

<p>In other words, among the people with 50+ edits the final result would be <b>14 keep, 25 delete</b>. Although a clear majority of the voters voted for deletion, this is by no means what one would call "rough consensus". Please note that none of these 14 keep voters can be counted as "part of Zolotaryev's flashmob".</p>
<p>But you are right, it's the arguments that should decide. So let's evaluate them a little.</p>
<ul>
<li>in favour of "keep":
<ul>
<li>Several people pointed out that the language got "serious media coverage" (<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a>) or that it "look like a sufficiently notable <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conlang.html" title="Conlang">conlang</a> in that it has generated substantial press attention (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a>).</li>
<li>"Article (...) seems to adequately describe the cultural phenomenon (initiative on codification of dialects). It isn't OR, it's an article <i>about</i> OR" (<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a>).</li>
<li>"request for a wikipedia in Siberian has been approved lately." (<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a>). The Siberian test wiki has over 1,500 articles.</li>
<li>"This is as valid as <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Icelandic_9a76.html" title="High Icelandic">High Icelandic</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglish.html" title="Anglish">Anglish</a>. Few people use them, but they are clever people and their work has scientific value. It's more than original research and it's more than a stupid game - its creator acutally shows knowledge of Northern Russian dialectology (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E. Aharoni</a>, who also added that the language is very complete).</li>
<li>Several of the "keep" voters agreed that the article should be reclassified, either as a dialect or as a conlang. Some of them also made suggestions for improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in favour of "delete":
<ul>
<li>"Original research, not outside the internet" (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a>).</li>
<li>"A false presentation of an original development of Zolotaryov as a "standard dialect". You simply cannot make a "strandard" in 1-2 years" (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a>).</li>
<li>"shameless self-promotion" (<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a>).</li>
<li>Several people argued that the language is not real, fake. For example: "There are no such language, it's artificial creation of a small group of people" (<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVladimir_Volokhonsky_e2cf.html" title="User:Vladimir Volokhonsky">Vladimir Volokhonsky</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me just point out that the argument that the language is artificial should not be a reason in itself to delete it. There are over 200 articles about constructed languages in Wikipedia.en, a lot of them are far lesser-known than Siberian. If the article contains factual inaccuracies, that should be solved by improving it, not by deleting it.</p>
<p>Let's also have a look at a few non-arguments used in the discussion. Disregarding comments of the type <i>"Russian Nazis against development of Siberian culture"</i> or <i>"The 'language' is a creation of some separatist aggressive lunatics"</i>, we still have:</p>
<ul>
<li>in favour of "keep":
<ul>
<li>"This phenomena EXISTS. So the article on it has all right to exist too" (<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a>). Sure. My shoes exist as well.</li>
<li>"This language really needs to be noticeable by article, if such discussions are called by it" (<a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPBato_da2d.html" title="User:PBato">pBato</a>). That's autoreferencing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in favour of "delete":
<ul>
<li>"it's a constructed language, and one which is of no verifiable signifciance to an English-speaking audience" (<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a>). It is explicitly stated that Wikipedia is a world-encompassing project, so wp.en is not exclusively targeting the Anglosaxon world.</li>
<li>"This article was already deleted once and rightly so. Nothing changed since" (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr">Grafikm</a>). This is not true. The original article was a stub with a merely a link to a LifeJournal. This was a decent article with plenty of references to the language itself and its press coverage.</li>
<li>"the article includes no references or sources, only including external links, which fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>" (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a>). Not true, most of those links are actually references. As somebody pointed out, that was merely a formatting problem.</li>
<li>"nonnotable conlang without <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639_02b4.html" title="ISO 639">ISO 639</a> code" (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>). This wikipedia features at least 200 conlangs without an ISO 630 code (very few actually have one). Several of them have passed AfD's with a broad consensus for "keep" nonetheless.</li>
<li>"with all the sources in Russian, this simply cannot be verified" (<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a>). There is no policy that says references must be in English, just that they are in English <i>whenever possible</i>.</li>
<li>"A set of words is not a language" (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeMonk_22dc.html" title="User:CodeMonk">CodeMonk</a>). Perhaps the most ridicilous argument used in the whole AfD. Apart from the fact that it is not true, it wouldn't apply to Siberian even if it were.</li>
<li>"Was deleted in russian wikipedia too" (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorpheios_Melas_ce66.html" title="User:Morpheios Melas">Morpheios Melas</a>). Yes. So?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did another count: how many people used reasonable arguments in their vote (not counting the "per" votes and the most obvious nonsense, but counting opinions I disagree with)? My conclusion: <b>16 keep</b>, <b>14 delete</b>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I would like to note that during the AfD several improvements have been made to the article. I can't check it anymore, but <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> renamed the article, and <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrbug_126b.html" title="User:Drbug">DrBug</a> modified it to make it acceptable also to many of the delete voters. Unfortunately, both efforts have gone virtually unnoticed, but in fact they invalidate several of the previously made delete votes. Also, someone made the suggestion to substitute the article with a translation of the Dutch version (written by me), which many considered adequate and NPOV. The thought hadn't occurred to me, and unfortunately I hadn't seen that part.</p>
<p>Let's not even discuss the vote-stacking here. As you know, Andy Volokhov approached everybody who previously voted "delete", and calls to come here and vote for deletion were placed both in the Russian wikipedia and on the Russian messageboard here. But in all honesty, I suspect other people might have been doing something similar to gather keep voters, although I haven't seen it.</p>
<p>Yet, Man in Black, I don't really know how you got the idea that hardly anybody bothered to make an argument. In fact, I believe the "keep" arguments in general are much stronger than the "delete" arguments (mostly the usual non-notable/vanity kind of stuff). I guess the whole point of all this is the following: no matter how you count the votes, and no matter which arguments you decide to discount, the conclusion would always be: <b>no consensus</b>. I'm not going to attack you, nor am I questioning your good faith. But I really believe you should revisit your decision, in either of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>you restore the article and reopen the discussion, to see what new opinions can be gathered;</li>
<li>you restore the article and close the discussion, with "no consensus" as its conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really don't want to turn this into a personal attack on you. I don't want to make this incident more important than it is. And frankly, I don't want to start a Deletion Review either, because that would mean starting over the whole discussion all over again, which I believe nobody is waiting for.</p>

<dd>Hm, sorry maybe I never ended up even posting it *shrug* User: Bandaid 18</dd>
<dd>you cant just say that because she currently only appeas in spin offs, just because you dont think shes important doesnt mean she cant be described. Beofre you started crapping up this page people actually knew alot about Daisy from it then they do now. You cant take things off because you dont like who the page is about thats different from a rule violation, and their not random facts their explaining what shes like with facts sinse you always pee your pants when I dont have a citation.

<dd>Actually, I can remove things that I don't feel are appropriate just as any user can. It's just a trivial factoid sourced to the primary source, and such things can and should be trimmed down to focus on important aspects of the character. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello again, AMIB. Sorry to keep bothering you, but you're the only admin I know who's currently active. As you might guess by the histories of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Talk%7ESam_Brownback_9f33.html" title="Talk:Sam Brownback">Talk:Sam Brownback</a> and <a href="../../../s/n/o/Talk%7ESnowflake_children_eb09.html" title="Talk:Snowflake children">Talk:Snowflake children</a>, a debate has been going on between myself and the user Getaway again recently. I was curious if you might be able to give your opinion of the use of the politically loaded term "Snowflake Children" in article space without characterizing it as such. Personally I feel that the term should be left out entirely, just as the loaded term "flip-flopper" or "up-or-down vote" should be excluded from articles because they indirectly advocate one POV over another using the article's narrative voice. So far I think I have portrayed Wikipedia's policies on this kind of thing correctly, but Getaway seems to take a very contrary view of however I try to improve the article. By any means, any comments you feel need to be heard would be immensely appreciated. Thanks again for your patience. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 14:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the current template, I only would prefer if all the info (second column) would be aligned. Now, it is all centred, so sections with short info (in the example, "Hergé") start further to the right than sections with longer info. I have tried to finda solution to this, but in theend I was only able to remove the colour scheme from the template but nothing else... Apart from that, it seems finished to me. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oy!! You would think that the game has been released by the way people are adding tags and such to the various character pages. And I especially like that they put "rumor" next to their claim.
