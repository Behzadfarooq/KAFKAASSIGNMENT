<p>I noticed that you removed my recently article about the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_Command_Unit_a3e9.html" title="Armored Command Unit">Armored Command Unit</a> citing that it failed the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. This is however not original research but rather information taken from the game manual. I realise that the fault is mine for not citing my sources and apologise.</p>
<p>However you also deleted the article on the UEF faction within the game witch in my opinion is completely without cause. Not only do the other two factions of the game have seperate articles of theyr own but almost every game faction or race have similar articles on wikipedia. It may only be relevant within the game world but as the first point on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> states wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia and thus there should not be a limit as to how many subjects it should be able to cover. Thus the fact that the article bears relevance to the game would be eanough to justify its existance.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it's taken from the game manual, it's attributed to a primary source, does not claim <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, and is inappropriate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">game guide</a>, so my reasoning stands. Likewise for the UEF. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:17, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Seing as it is lore related information to the game world it would not fall under gameguide.

<p>You've added a couple of tags to this page, and while I do agree the page is barely above a stub right now, I'm not sure that the tags you are using are appropriate. This article is in no way a game guide (as I said, there's no information on how to construct a deck for any of these variants, not even examples of decks on it, hence, not a guide to the game). And I don't think notability is the same as what you were going for, which might be unreferenced, but it has references for several of the variants (though it does need some more, I don't consider being from Wizards.com a problem, it's an odd case of being a reliable source from the primary make of the product, it's still not a primary source). Still, maybe you could bring this up on the talk page instead of the tags? That might help explainN what you're concerned about better? Templates are nice, I use them myself when I'm hitting random articles I see need a problem, but in this case, I think further discussion might be worthwhile. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:28, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't have to be a guide to playing the game <i>well</i>; if all it does is tells you how to play that variant, it's a game guide.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, it fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> completely. You don't just make a gut call saying "Well, I think this is important, so it's notable"; you add non-trivial references in reliable sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I'm not entirely sure there's a great deal of encyclopedic value in a list of variants of MTG. Most of them are house rules, a number of them seem to be some guy adding his personal variant, and even the "notable" ones are side games in organized play.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is there an article about tournaments or organized play to put the 2HG mention in? We could probably just ditch the rest, since I highly doubt there are going to be any sources. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that you are mistaken about what a game guide is. The article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> tells you how to play the game. So do the articles on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variants.html" title="Chess variants">chess variants</a>. (and I see over 50 of them with articles of their own! Yowza! ) Providing this information is essential for explaining the subject of the article. Game Guides are instructions on how to play the game better, strategic ideas, which this article simply does not contain. Really, I cannot see how anything in this article could be construed as a game guide at all. If you could perhaps go to the talk page and point out something, maybe I'd see where you are coming from, but right now I can't.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I do agree that various minor house rules or individual variants don't belong on the page. I've removed several, and I'm debating pruning some others if I can't source them. I've tried to keep this page limited to only those variants of substance, such as the multi-player ones, the vanguard (and don't tell me that product isn't also keepable content), or even peasant magic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, more real-world content would be nice, some magazine articles or mentions of tournaments (GenCon, for example, has unsanctioned peasant and 5-color tournaments, information about which could be included here). And yes, Scrye, Beckett, and Inquest have mentioned these variants in articles, I just don't have the issues, so I haven't added them as sources. I have added the Wizards ones, as they are a reliable source, as mention on their website is something I'm comfortable saying is a good sign that it's not just a minor individual thing. They aren't just a primary vanity source, they are providing content of interest to the players who read their site. Are they completely independent? Nope, but it's not a case where they're just publishing press releases either. Their authors produce actual content. Thus I can't see any objection to them as establishing notability through coverage.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I do think this article could be improved, but there's no question in my mind that it is appropriate for Wikipedia. Magic the Gathering is notable, unquestionable there. The two major variants have official standing, either in the rules, or with official products. The others do need some clean-up, but I've been holding off on that for a while. But at least some of them are played by lots of people. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS, if you've got any suggestions about the page, let's go to <a href="../../../v/a/r/Talk%7EVariant_Magic%7E_The_Gathering_formats_735d.html" title="Talk:Variant Magic: The Gathering formats">Talk:Variant Magic: The Gathering formats</a>. As I said, the page does need work. The subject, however, is fine. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> tells you how to play the game as necessary context for the history of chess and for chess's place in history. Additionally, there are a variety of non-trivial works about chess (many of which are cited in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>), so there's no notability issues. <a href="../../../t/h/e/Variant_Magic%7E_The_Gathering_formats_9fff.html" title="Variant Magic: The Gathering formats">Variant Magic: The Gathering formats</a>, on the other hand, only tells you how to play these variants. I think much of this can be scrapped (I don't think most of the variant ways of playing Magic multiplayer have had any real commentary in independent, reliable sources), but there <i>is</i> an article here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I totally spaced on Vanguard, but, again, I think it's been crammed, ill-fitting, into this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still curious about the article about tournament play. Is there an article on one? I think one article on Type-2-turned-"Limited" (a concept that is now pervasive among collectable games), the various type 1 variants, block play, Vanguard, multiplayer variants; I think there's an article in there, and there will be much more to say than just how you play these variants. (Type 2 alone could possibly merit its own article, between the circumstances that led to its creation, the controversy around same, and its impact on other games. This is pending sources, of course.) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And since its necessary for Chess to tell you how to play the game for context, or a variant is set up, it's neccessary for this article to tell you how a deck is constructed in order to play the variant. Thus you see why I don't see your objection that this page is a game guide has merit. It'd be one thing if the sections mentioned land mix ratios, or strategies in building emperor decks, or casting costs, but it doesn't. No deck lists, no descriptions at all. It provides no strategic value whatsoever. Thus I would say it's clearly not a game guide.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, Chess does have a bit more of a scholarly body of work than Magic, but there are magazines that cover Magic and other TCGs, so it's quite possible that these variants are covered in articles there. I recall reading about many of them, but not having the magazine, I can't quite cite them as references myself. I do, however, feel comfortable in asserting they exist. And as I said, coverage on Wizards.com is enough for me to be satisfied that there's content there.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now as to your questions about organization, well, I'd agree the sections Vanguard could be expanded, but even if a page on it was made, it would still belong here. So, if you want to expand it, go right ahead. Unlike when it was part of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_240a.html" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>, there is plenty of room to grow here. In fact, tournament play is still mostly there, with a few bits on <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duelists%27_Convocation_International_a2b4.html" title="Duelists' Convocation International">Duelists' Convocation International</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Pro_Tour_%28Magic%7E_The_Gathering%29_d659.html" title="Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)">Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would an article that told you how to play Magic be a game guide? After all, it's not giving you advice on how to do it well. Raw rules are how-to, and that's okay when it's context for more content, but this article doesn't do anything but tell you how to play these variants.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but there's just a fundamental disconnect here. This article does not in any substantial way tell anybody how to play these variants, not as is meant by a game guide, but merely describe the game in the same raw sense as you say is appropriate for the describing the context of the content. I'm removing your tags again, they're just not appropriate, unless you can give me some real examples of what you're talking about. I do think the page needs improvement, but the tags you've chosen do not apply as far as I can tell. Maybe you should expand more on the article's talk page as to what you do want. I will leave {{expand}} though, since I do agree with it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd also not object to a generic {{cleanup}} if you want to add it.

<dd>Well, let's say whoever published Uno publishes a handful of house rules for Uno. Should we make Variant Uno formats?

<dd>Um, yes, if the publisher of <a href="../../../u/n/o/Uno_%28game%29.html" title="Uno (game)">Uno</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a>, were to publish a list of Uno Variants, it would be appropriate to cover them in that article. I don't know that a sub-article covering the subject would be needed, Uno is relatively simpler to cover compared to Magic, but if anything, having a source from Mattel would vastly improve the article on Uno, which currently has a large section covering variants with not a single source to be seen. It's been tagged for at least 3 months too. No clean-up to be seen. Pity that.</dd>
<dd>And yes, I do agree that variants somebody just made up should not be added to the page. Being added to the page should wait till the variant has some real content to it. That is why I prefer being noticed by somebody of repute in the Magic field, such as Wizards, Scyre, Inquest, or Pojo. Possibly others, I don't feel my list is definitive. And it's why I've added {{Fact}} to several entries. But there is little reason to object to Wizards.com as an establisher of notability within the already existing notable subject of Magic. They are a professionally-produced site, with an incentive to present only material of substance, not every bit of rumor or nonsense. So, I accept their value as observers within this field, even though I do respect the concern that they might be biased. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can appreciate how you think that simply reverting the sentence in question serves the good of the article, but the editor I requested to weigh in was defined as neutral. You have sided with Viriditas on at least two prior occasions, which kinda negates the whole neutrality thing. There were four different, established editors weighing, feeling that the statement should belong, and 70% of the traffic (read: edit-warring) came from Viriditas, who <i>clearly</i> has WP:OWN issues in regards to the article. He does not listen to concensus, and is disruptive, uncivil and tendentious. All of that aside, the statemetn is about an observable part of the movie and part of the plot. It is not part of the soundtrack, nor a subjective, thematic component. Thematic implies to something which is not open to objective analysis but instead <i>subjective</i> interpretation. The laughter of children at the end isn't open to interpretation. It occurs.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 00:51, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've only ever heard of Viriditas from you, and a passing look at your talk page and contributions seems to show that you're fond of accusing anyone who disagrees with you of being a proxy of Viriditas. I don't know what your beef with that user is, but you need to find a more productive way of settling it than accusing anyone who disagrees with you of being part of a conspiracy. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To begin with, perhaps you might want to look at my talk page a bit more carefully. I haven't accused anyone of being a proxy of Viriditas. Maybe you are confusing me with Viriditas, who was awfully fond of accusing folk of being meatpuppets of me. I can see how 'pretending' to mix things like that up works, but please, credit all of us with a bit more intelligence.</dd>
<dd>Dude, I don't think you're a part of a conspiracy. Lots of people disagree with me. It's just that whenever you seem to weigh in, it always seems to be in favor of Viriditas. I notice how yo9u never seem to find any faulkt with him, and frankly, it's a hell of a lot more telling than you riding to the rescue every time he's about to get overruled.</dd>
<dd>You know, I could point out the instances (there were actually three, not two), but what's the point? You'll suggest it is all a big coincidence. The point is,i asked for a neutral admin to weigh in on the article. Neutral would mean that you care neither one way or the other. And - to be perfectly candid, I would prefer an admin who hadn't just got off a block for tendentious 3RR blocking. I am sure you can understand why you simply aren't a good candidate as far as neutral admins go. I think what I need to do is just stay away from the two of you - you and Viriditas are chock-full of those issues that will allow you to self-destruct on your own. have fun with that.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 06:32, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever. The thing you deliberately keep avoiding is that you aren't impartial to the dispute. Plus, you just came off a 3RR block because you couldn't control your own revert tendencies (sound like someone else?) We asked for someone not related to the article to weigh in on the subject. You've made edits and sided with one of the two parties in the dispute on three pior occasions.Please, do tell how someone cannot help but perceive you as biased in the matter? If someone who wwas actually impartial inthe matter had weighed in against me, I would have been done with it, shrugged off the article as yet another piece of trash that would have to be revisited once a solid review came in controverting everything there. However, it wasn't someone unconnected tot he article, was it.</dd>
<dd>No, I don't like what you have to say, because we don't have to cite parts of the <i>observable</i> plot. If we do, please point to that specific guideline that says that a retelling of the plot requires citation. Four different,independent editors thougth it should belong, as it was observable. Since no citation exists for the laughter, what are we to do, pretend it isn't in the article at all? Please, don't insult us all by suggesting you were impartial in this matter. You clearly aren't. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcayne_c465.html" title="User:Arcayne">Arcayne</a> 07:40, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You do need to cite disputed factual or evaluative claims. We allow citation of a fictional work for simple observation since there's really no better way to do it. When a factual or evaluative claim comes under dispute, you need reliable sources, because it's not clear that it's a simple fact observable by any observer. If there are no other sources, we err on the side of exclusion. If there's no citation for the laughter, we exclude it for the same reason we exclude Theo bashing Syd's brains out with a car battery; it wasn't important enough to be mentioned in any sources, so it's not important enough to be mentioned in the article.</dd>

<li>Ian, my past experience is that your input tends to <i>increase</i> the determination of those supporting the mainstream to remove your preferred content. And nothing you said was <i>deleted</i>, as far as I can tell, it was just moved to the Talk page, which is unusual but not unprecedented when argumentation gets out of hand. Actually if I'd been aware of that AfD and your behaviour on it I'd have banned you from it or blocked you to prevent further disruption, per <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience</a>. This deletion was sound, and for the same reason as we deleted Aetherometry: there are no reliable independent sources of critical analysis of the subject. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>thanks for your alterations to the template, i agree that images w/out rationales need to deleted as they potentially sit there as copyright infringements and lazy uploaders need to be reminded that their work will be in vain if they don't follow through with wikipedia's policies. you know there's some issue i have though, b/c otherwise i wouldn't have taken the time to write you, the reason i didn't put enforcement on the template was because it would also be wrong to set images for deletion w/out notifying the orginal uploaders, so i figured that tagging them to categorize them would be enough (for now) until i got through all the images and then could go through the category more quickly (i had started organizing the easiest/highest priority images first). Of course if you're going to notify the uploaders, then i warmly thank you as you're lifting a great burden off my back&#160;:) -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 04:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't particularly care about this article, certainly not enough to even consider some kind of edit war behaviour. But there are procedures for merging into other articles and I think that's something you should discuss on the talk page before basically ideleting a page. What's the harm with laying out your case why you think it shouldn't exist and letting people trying to argue whether it should or not?
