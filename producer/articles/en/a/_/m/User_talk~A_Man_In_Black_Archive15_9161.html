<p>Following a seemingly unsuccessful AfD nomination of Castlevania timeline I thought it would be a good idea to get a reality check before contesting related articles, such as <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castlevania_recurrences.html" title="Castlevania recurrences">Castlevania recurrences</a>. These two, to me, are redundant and don't really stand on their own as separate articles, and sources are virtually non-existent with parts grabbed and assembled from a number of fan sites which may well be based on direct observations by the authors. Perhaps I was simply not clear enough in my argument?</p>

<p>Thank you for writing your last summary on you edit, before i get blocked for the 3RV. Ok I think it would look nice. And I was sort of modeling it after my fdavorite anime Oh My Goddess, because tell me if I'm wrong, but isn't there a show of pokemon based on the diamond and Jade games?? Also the movie Pokemon Power of the One i was modeling after Oh My Goddess. I hope you will consider my contributions to a anime that I'm don't like.

<dd>The problem is that they're dissimilar, and that you stated that the pages avoid spoilers when they actually don't.

<p>Do you think it would be reasonable if I deleted nearly all of the articles I created? A few exceptions, like Nasir Gebelli, seem like they're somewhat notable. I'm appalled that I created a List of Final Fantasy characters article and a List of Final Fantasy locations article (even worse). I've propagated fancruft and trivial information at Wikipedia for over a year and pissed all over the fair use clause. I badly want to merge, well, nearly every article pertaining to the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> universe into something like The Legend of Zelda series universe.

<p>Nah, not nagging, since Raul already trimmed the FAC list and it'll be some time before he hits MNSG. But I did want to note that development on the article is "complete" now that I've had four or five editors review it. I've also added a sequel section.

<p>I wonder if you can help. I have just received a warning from the above that I shall be blocked if I continue vandalism. You can easily access the correspondance which appears on my User page and on the Talk page of Paul of Tarsus. I foolishly made a light comment on one of the huge number of descriptors which had been put up. (To be honest, there is a widespread view that I was articulating) For my part I try, as an editor, not to spend my time making comments about other people's sutbstantive contributions eg. stub, or over-long, or POV etc. I am much more interesting in the work of increasing the scope and quality of material than playing at the margins. I did not think I was offensive, merely playful. I have seen much more robust contrib utions in Talk pages. I am not aware of how the hierarchy of WP works or who is entitled to issues a Last Warning. I feel very offended by it, attempting as I do to reduce the sum of human ignorance. I Ifeel like asking if Feureau could be blocked, certainly from misinterpreting comments about citizens of the USA as personal attacks. If I had been adding offensive or spurious information to well-written articles, as I see constantly, I would take my punishment but these 'policemen' have me very concerned about WP as an open, and not overly serious-minided medium engaged in a very important task.

<p>Please unblock me!!</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I was a wonderful contributor to articles in Wikipedia "Yu-Gi-OH and Pokemon". The story began when a user named Mitsumasa began creating and upload Pokemon images and articles.</p>
<p>After about 5 months after the start of the articles the PCP began merging the articles (A Man in Black, Ryulong, Interrobamf) i tried talking to them, and the PCP but they did'nt listen. I even tried to leave a committ on their usertalk pages but A Man in Black is the only one that responds to my committ. I gave up until recently students at my school "The Learning Community School" began bullying me, they knew that I was a contributor at the site "Wikipedia", so they told my teacher that they logged in some accounts and began vandalizing the articles that I personattly was currently having problems with you. My teacher Mrs. Lisa Mercato talked to the students Jene', Jessica, Aaron and restricted them from using the school computer.</p>
<p>I'm very sorry. May you please unblock me and my IP address 72.177.68.38. May you please just make it that I can create a new account. It is a total misunderstanding. If you want to talk to my teacher, please email her at lmercato@yahoo.com. The block is casuing the school not to edit Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I used my house IP. Thank you, and God Bless</p>

<dd>It's not a matter of my <i>opinion</i>. It's a matter of nobody ever publishing the opinions being expressed in this article. We need a reference that describes the game as worst ever. Not bad, not very bad, but "worst ever". "One of the worst games ever" suffices, but it "This is a terrible game" isn't enough. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:10, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello... I was told by Danny Lilithborn you were the person who suggested Q and Twelve's articles be merged with the SFIII article. Is... that right?</p>
<p>I didn't think it was very fair to do that... but these are just my feelings and my opinions (so they're probably moot). Seeing that you're an administrator, what I say is possibly worthless. But not trying to sound like I'm whining or anything. I'm not mad, just a little disappointed, that's all. =(</p>
<p>Anyways, I do very well understand they are minor characters. But then, so is Makoto, and so is Remy. Neither of them have made ANY appearances in any other game but SFIII Third Strike (but I'm most likely wrong on all that. I don't do the most extensive research on all games...).</p>
<p>Q and Twelve, while yes, again, minor characters... they do have enough information on their backgrounds and origins to at least have their own pages. Q in particular is very enigmatic... the speculization of his origins are what make him "Q". Or maybe I'm wording this wrong... I suck at trying to provide a good argument. But I'll try anyways... I've honestly got nothing to lose. Don't get me wrong, I'm not challenging you or anything. If you want it to stay that way, that's fine... there's honestly nothing I can do, and I really don't want to cause any trouble or impose.</p>

<dd>The problem is that there's nothing but recapping fictional works to say about these characters. Q is the worst case, where his article was 60% speculation by weight, but these character articles all really need to be merged into their games. There's nothing to say but the story of SFIII (or whichever game, for other characters), and if you want the story of SFIII, you should play SFIII instead of Wikipedia retelling the story in less-compelling form. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:31, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you revert the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Template%7EMetroid_series_bf6b.html" title="Template:Metroid series">Metroid template</a> to the standard?

<p>Okay, I've had just about enough of this. I finally go along with your suggestions, the ones that the majority of people at WP:CVG have agreed to, and you start reverting my changes. What more do you want? My edits follow your suggestions to the letter. No metadata, that idiotic blue background colour, only links to games italicised. What more do you want?</p>
<p>What is the point of reverting my changes to your ones? Your versions go against the very proposal you laid out. No one agreed that only longform works should be italicised, only links to games. As Remastered Tracks Rockman Zero are not games, they should not be italicised. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Leave the template alone. It's fine as it is. With Remastered Tracks Rockman Zero un-italicised, it does not violate your navigation template proposals. Users still might not be able to tell that it isn't a game, but the more intelligent ones will realise that that link isn't. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_ODonnell_36b5.html" title="User:Wolf ODonnell">Wolf ODonnell</a> 22:08, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't know about that, as far as I'm concerned, your usage doesn't apply to anything other than literature. It violates the proposals you made and the ones that the majority of the users at the WP:CVG agreed to. No distinction is made between the album and the games, so any Wikipedia user that comes across the template, won't know the difference. It is confusing and I will keep reverting it back to my version unless you can come up with a better idea to ensure a proper distinction. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_ODonnell_36b5.html" title="User:Wolf ODonnell">Wolf ODonnell</a> 22:03, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The reason I wrote that rule was because I wanted people to italicize game names, as is part of basic English usage, and not italicize things like years of release and articles about fictional objects. In the case of movies and albums and books that are in the template anyway, they should be italicized too. I can't imagine why you're still arguing with me about the intent of a propose rule <i>that I myself wrote!</i> - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:25, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because your propose rule does not mention longform at all and no one agreed to this. It is, by the way, not basic English usage. It is basic print usage. The link in contention is not to a longform work, but to an article that overviews four separate longform works and therefore should not be italicised. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_ODonnell_36b5.html" title="User:Wolf ODonnell">Wolf ODonnell</a> 11:19, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mr. Man in Black, could you help me to use the template named General CVG character at the portuguese wikipedia? I just want you replace some words. For example:</p>
<p><b>Nome</b> instead <b>Name</b></p>
<p><b>Nascimento</b> instead <b>Birthday</b></p>
<p><b>Terra natal</b> instead <b>Birthplace</b></p>
<p><b>Estilo de luta</b> instead <b>Fighting Style</b></p>
<p><b>Peso</b> instead <b>Weight</b></p>
<p><b>Altura</b> instead <b>Height</b></p>
<p><b>Tipo sangu√≠neo</b> instead <b>Bloodtype</b></p>
<p><b>Comida preferida</b> (which means <b>Favorite food</b>)</p>
<p><b>Hobby</b></p>
<p><b>N√£o gosta de</b> instead <b>Dislikes</b></p>
<p><b>Jogo de origem</b> instead <b>First game</b></p>

<p>So ok, I don't get why you need to remove those upcoming stuffs on Resident Evil (RE5, RE Wii, Extinction). I don't see anything bad about keeping them in the template specially those are confirmed and already on production. Also it would be easier to visitors to look at what's new stuffs about Resident Evil they don't know by keeping them at the template. You look at Windows Template and you can see Windows Vista, on Survivor Template there's the 2 upcoming seasons, etc, on Disney Template there's 4upcoming cartoons which would be releases in 3years or more.--<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotwiki_4fcf.html" title="User:Hotwiki">hottie</a> 14:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because those articles aren't very good, and aren't terribly integrated into the series of articles.

<p>But I think whether it's good or bad it is still should be in the template since it's related to the subject and there's no mistake watsoever just because it's upcoming.</p>

Neither of these criteria are an unequivocal statement that "fair use galleries of historical logos representing the subject of an article are forbidden". And, as I expressed before in <a href="../../../t/v/s/WP%7ETVS_4679.html" title="WP:TVS">WP:TVS</a>, we need more than one image to identify the subject when the subject has had several different identities throughout its lifetime. And in fact we occasionally need more than one image to identify some stations current as they currently exist, such as when a station has several digital subchannels. We have hashed these arguments back and forth and it is obvious that I will never change your mind. I do not wish to engage in edit wars with you, however, I do not intend to drop this until I see either a clear consensus, or a clear statement from Jimbo or the board on this specific issue. <a href="../../../d/h/o/User%7EDHowell_acb6.html" title="User:DHowell">DHowell</a> 09:41, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Galleries of fair-use images cannot ever be kosher. Only one image of a subject is ever needed to identify it, and after that, there's no way a gallery can be illustrating specific accompanying points in the text because there's no accompanying text.</dd>
<dd>Now, if a station is several digital subchannels with distinct brands, go right ahead and use an image to identify each subbrand if that's necessary.

<p>We meet again, and over the same subject, no doubt!</p>
<p>I notice you added the Original Research tag to the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroidvania.html" title="Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> article. After reading it and realizing that while the information there was mostly correct and indeed a reflection of the genre, it was also information I added myself without basing the information in the article on the writings of another, verifiable source. Rather than fight a rear-guard action which might include an AfD and bitter edit warring, I took a bit of time to reflect and decided that if someone was going to have to do the pruning I'd rather it be myself.</p>
<p>If you've got the time, would you mind taking a glance at the article and removing the tag if you deem it sufficiently reduced? I'd do it myself but I recognize that my own opinion in the matter might be somewhat... skewed.</p>

<p>I'd like to dicuss the recreation of a page, so to speak. Due to recently information on the <b>Cyber Dragon</b> cards in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, a much more comprehensive and informative article could be written on the cards, focusing on their relation to yin and yang and other Chinese mythos, as well as the Cyber Dojo's history. However, as the original Cyber Dragon page was deleted some time ago, I'm asking for your permission first. If you'd like, I could create the page and let you judge its value from there.

<dd>Agreed on the first point, but Zane plays either Cyber End Dragon or Cyberdark Dragon every time he duels, they're his signature cards. As for the second, if a source is discredited due to alternative interpretations, then how can any source be reliable on such grounds? There are lots of Yugioh pages that use the anime for a source, and they don't have any trouble. Is there some sort of higher-up Mod I could discuss this with? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 13:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That seems like an excellent argument to mention the card in Zane's article, then. The fact that there are other articles that fail to meet a reasonable of sourcing is a pretty weak argument to overturn an AFD result.</dd>

<dd>Once again, is there someone else I can talk to about this? When it comes to TV shows in general, direct observation of the show by all means should be a viable source, and I don't care about direct observation policies or whatever. My experience tells me that the only sites that give full information about the show are fansites, and the official sites typically only give hints and previews as opposed to the whole story, because hey, if they gave you the whole story on the site, you wouldn't watch. Such it is with Yugioh, half the information in the character pages isn't on the website supplied as a reference, it's info taken from the episodes, so please, tell me where to draw the line. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 16:40, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
