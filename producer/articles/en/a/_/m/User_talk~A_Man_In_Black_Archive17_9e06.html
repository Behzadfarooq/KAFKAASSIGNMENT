<p>Hi! I'm new here so I'm trying to learn as much as I can. Why did you change <a href="../../../n/e/e/Template%7ENeed_for_Speed_series_8c96.html" title="Template:Need for Speed series">Template:Need for Speed series</a>? I think it looked good and the unreleased game + the cities are definitely Need for Speed-related. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 09:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because the unreleased game doesn't have any substance; no name, no release date, no playable form.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The cities aren't really necessary for understanding, and they're already linked in the articles where appropriate. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 19:45, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But maybe one would find some info about this upcoming title interesting anyway, the game is inofficially <b>confirmed</b> by EA representatives. Many other templates have links to games which aren't released yet, so why can't this one? The link can be changed as soon as there is a better official title.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With all respect, about the cities, I don't think people read here just because they want to understand, they want to now more about the subject they're reading about, and what better way is it then just put all articles together in one navigation box. That's the purpose of nav-boxes, right? And btw, many other series have different "unrelated" thing in the nav-boxes, ever checked out <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft.html" title="Warcraft">Warcraft</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_ea8b.html" title="Half-Life">Half-Life</a>? --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 22:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've suggested it to Benten and am waiting for his reply. If I site the aforementioned Beckett Yugioh Collector homepage as a site, could (or perhaps "should") I format the page to list the cards notable in the real game? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 16:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On this page -</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HRM96" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HRM96" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HRM96</a></p>
<p>I am being harassed. Due to this article - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Csuri" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Csuri" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Csuri</a></p>
<p>Which used to contain my website. I asked for my site and name to be removed from that page as I do not want my business associated with this man. I noticed an "editor" (who is actually this man's SIL)added my name to the history as the one who was causing all of the trouble. It really is long and very High School..but if there is any way at all you can remove my talk page and any reference to my website and name from his edited history I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you, HRM96</p>

<p>Hi. I'm a relatively new contributer to Wikipedia, and recently stumbled across an article that interested me about the Revolutionary War. I looked up more sources on the subject and posted them, along with the facts stated in those sources. The article is now tagged as a possible hoax, and I am searching for objective analysis of it from multiple users. If you could please take a look, and urge others to take a look as well, I'd be very grateful.</p>

<p>I, and probebly some others, have noticed that you recently have been busy removing links from, what many others consider, perfectly good CVG-templates. What are your reasons to do so? As far as I know, there is no Wikipedia guideline or policy that supports your actions. The guidelines described <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_Navboxes_2230.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games/Navboxes">here</a> are only <i>proposed</i> at this moment, and should not be enforced, yet. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 23:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's the support of <a href="../../../c/v/g/WP%7ECVG_903f.html" title="WP:CVG">WP:CVG</a>. I don't think the presence or absence of a technical tag invalidates a reasonable standard backed by the relevant project. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:31, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said, the guidelines for navboxes, that <i>you</i> have made up, is only <i>proposed</i> at this moment, and I quote:</dd>
<dd><i><b>"The proposal may still be in development, under discussion, or in the process of gathering consensus for adoption.

<p>That's very interesting.

<dd>I am going to make this as clear as possible. You are editing templates based on a set of rules that you made up, and are not yet approved by the Wikipedia community. I disagre with that because it's simply wrong to make up your own rules and enforce them without the support of the community. You think <a href="../../../n/e/e/Need_for_Speed_XI_b343.html" title="Need for Speed XI">Need for Speed XI</a> contains no relevant information. I disagre with that because the article describes the development and contains information about the next Need for Speed title, and is very much relevant to the Need for Speed series. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 09:48, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The flip side of this coin is that my reasoning, that policy (or proposal, or whatever) page rests on a basic goal of expunging cluttering links, such as those to speculative/promotional articles and in-universe material.

<p>Relevance is not at issue. I never brought up relevance. I instead have focused entirely on its speculative and promotional nature; you have not addressed this point, near as I can tell. Do you feel that these articles are not speculative/promotional, or that speculative/promotional material has a place in navboxes? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I see your point. But, as stated before, the standards or policies are guidelines rather then rules and don't have to be followed word by word. I would prefer a case-by-case basis.

<dd>If the purpose of this standardization is to clean up large templates and make them nice and compact, I also think that it depends a bit on how much info there already is in the template.

<dd>One extra links eventually becomes many on many different templates; the problem is as much aggregate as singular. For example, Halo Wars was kept on the Halo template, because it was already so slim. The presence of Halo Wars was an argument to keep NFS XI on its template. That becomes an argument to keep the next speculative MK game on the massive Mortal Kombat template. Etc.</dd>

My changes also relink to my new user page. In this way old ded links are changed to functional ones. So I think it is also useful.

<p>I really have to disagree with your stand on the appearance of the template. The reason for the itemization of the "things" (i.e. Games, TC, TC2, Spin-offs; CZ) was to make it presentable to the reader to know if it's a game, if it's a character-related article, or such. Also, there are three wikilinks you removed without seeing them and taking note of, so as much as I hate to do this, I am going to have to revert your edit unless you have a hard reason and/or Wikipedia says so. Otherwise, I have to restore three wikilinks at the template that you removed. ‚Äî <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 19:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Notwithstanding, I also believe that describing "Games", "Spinoffs", and "Game-related information" also helps alleviate any vagueness the potential first-time reader may have with the template. The reason in describing whether or not the link is either a game, character, or spin-off was to ensure that newcomers won't think that they are lost. You also should talk to <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> about this as I'm unsure about what his views are regarding about template presentability, as the links aren't all games. ‚Äî <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 20:16, 27 January 2007 (UTC) (Reason for edit: Looked at the House of the Dead template‚ÄîI really have to deduce the template as looking ugly with the standard appearance; King of Fighters template is OK, but in the case of Time Crisis and House of the Dead, it's IMO a different story)</dd>

<p>I removed them consciously. Wild Dog and VSSE are already linked in the list of characters, and the minor characters could probably be replaced; I'm not a fan but I can't think of any good reason other than a gut judgement call to exclude them.</p>
<p>I don't think there's a great deal of likelihood for confusion because neither series is particularly noted for its story, so issues of continuity aren't terribly important, and (ideally) the template is directing readers to the parent series article that explains the differences between the main series and the spinoffs. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hate to be harsh, but apparently I'm going to have to ask for the template to be deleted since your standard formatting suggestion leaves the minor character article left out. ‚Äî <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 20:23, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First, I am not seeing this discussion, if you could give me a direct link, I would appericate it. Second, most of those images have been up, especially on the WUSA page, for awhile now. In the case of WUSA, they are logos through their WTOP, WDMV, and WUSA days, which is a long time. So, that is information that "contributes significantly to the article" (rule 8). If you want to take out the current image on the WVBT page, that is OK, but the "WB43" logo is again under rule 8....as is 3 of the 4 images on the WVNS page. I have put this before WP:AN, as I feel you are just deleting image galleries all "willy-nilly".</dd>

<dd>Dude, I gotta ask....exactly who put you in change of logos? In DC, WUSA has went through some many logos it isn't even funny. I live near DC (get WUSA on cable) so, I know. Just because it isn't discussed doesn't mean they can't be there. Now you are just making up reasons. First it is "fair-use", then it is a "legal issue", now it isn't discussed. Come on, make up a reason and stick with it. Otherwise, leave the logos alone, dude. If Gannett, CBS, ABC, NBC, or any number of companies really cared about them, they would have sued Wikipedia years ago. Why don't you leave TV and Radio and their respective logos to people who know something about them and know what they are talking about. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 06:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair-use is a misleading term. It means you've got a good enough reason to ignore the fact that you're normally not allowed to republish copyrighted material (say, an image). On Wikipedia, this term is misused by many users (myself included) to mean material under copyright not released under a free license. The problem is that many of these images are <i>not</i> fair use, since a sufficient fair-use claim cannot be made.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's standards for fair use are written to accomodate possible for-profit publishing by other republishers, so we set a very high bar for use of non-free material, essentially setting ourselves the standard of a commercial, non-educational publisher. (If you don't think we should do this, take it up with the Wikimedia Foundation.) As such, we very narrowly define allowable fair use.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While it's a strict standard, it's also an easy one. Ask yourself, "What's the least number of fair-use images do I need to illustrate this concept?" Usually, the answer is one, if it's at all a visual concept. If it's more than one, you have to answer the question, "Why more than one?" "Because we want to have all the images" is not and never has been enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's pretty much one satisfactory answer to justify <i>multiple</i> images: "Because there are multiple subjects discussed in the text." Let's say a station for many years had multiple variations on a famous, influential logo, then recently replaced it with a standard logo for the network brand. It would be fine to have an example of the influential logo with the discussion of how and why the logo was famous and influential, as well as an example of the logo in the infobox. The historic logo is illustrating the discussion of the historic logo, and the current logo is illustrating the discussion of the article as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You need to be talking about the logo itself, though. Putting the 1960s logo next to the discussion about the station in the 1960s isn't enough, since the logo isn't the subject of commentary and it isn't needed to identify the subject of the article since we already have the image identifying the subject of the article.</dd>

<dd>That makes sense, but still, I seriously doubt that a company is going to care if a logo is used on Wikipedia or not, especially if it is old. Most of those old logos are from tapes that people recorded from over-the-air....so, I think they are free. The WRIC ones you just deleted, also obviously recorded from the air. But if you want to use "fair-use" then you will have to take down even the most up-to-date logo as well...all of them to make it ia fair statement. Cause if you take 10 down and leave one, what's the point of taking the 10? Look, make ya feel better, I will give WJLA, WRC, WUSA and a couple others a call tomorrow and get permission for the logos to be up...they say "yes", then I don't think we have a "fair-use" issue. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 06:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>$5 says I call them and say, "hey, I want to use some of the old logos on Wikipedia, will your legal dept have a problem with this" and after talking to them...I will get a big ol' "no". Cause TV stations don't care. As long as they aren't being used in a way that hurts the station or is in a negative way, and as long as no one is making any money off the use of them (this being "free"), they won't care. Probably ask why they were removed in the first place.

<p>Could you elaborate a little on your recent changes to this <a href="../../../t/o/m/Template%7ETomb_Raider_series_61ed.html" title="Template:Tomb Raider series">template</a> because I don't see why the new version is an improvement over the previous one, on the contrary. The template is about more than just videogames, hence the pagename "Tomb Raider series", and the inclusion of Tomb Raider movies. I have the impression you changed the lay-out to conform to video game template standards, while in fact it isn't a video game template but a "franchise template". The current version gives the impression that all titles are video games. I don't think it's necessary to include subcategories for the games but at least make the distinction between the games and the movies. It looks confusing. What's wrong with for example this version that makes yours better? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteerpike_44bb.html" title="User:Steerpike">Steerpike</a> 17:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Last I checked, there wasn't a problem with anyone about linking character articles in a series template as they too were part of the series (see:Devil May Cry template). As it stands there are only two character articles, but both could be rewritten with enough work to fit. The non-link was there for the direct point to show that one of the games lacked an article entirely, which omitting entirely is a good idea how?

Reason I'm pushing for this is it makes it easier to see a list of relevant characters that may not be linked to in other articles, such as a character that appeared in two games out of three, but has significance to the mentioned character. Another factor is since in the Strider articles it would give some idea who the major or significant characters were without someone having to dig through a wikipedia article and click on ever tom, dick or hairy link: it just makes the transfer of information easier to the user. Either way what do you think about the subsection idea for characters, because apparently if you just removed stuff from teh DMC articles and someone put it back, it at least shows my opinion isn't the only one leaning towards this notion.&#160;:\--<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKung_Fu_Man_00fe.html" title="User:Kung Fu Man">Kung Fu Man</a> 05:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You do have a knack for understating articles you know o_O As it stands though the character does have a lot of seemingly backstory, mainly because too he was a manga character beforehand. One could easily argue Ryu's just a guy going around beating people up because that's the main part of his story, so there isn't anything needed to know, but we both know that'd be just flat out silly. Not to mention we're also talking about characters that have appeared in crossover games too, but that's another fun matter.--<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKung_Fu_Man_00fe.html" title="User:Kung Fu Man">Kung Fu Man</a> 05:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unless other folks are using your account...as it stands btw the Ghosts 'n Goblins template was better off with the crappier french design: One of those games isn't part of the series canon but is still related, Maximo is based off the series heavily, and the Gargoyle's Quest games were their own offshoot. As it looks now everything's clumped tight into an atrocious body bag.

<dd>Knowing capcom there probably is somewhere: they tend to go into overdrive regarding storylines. The games themselves do seem to follow some timeline (i.e. Ghouls 'n Ghosts' ending refers to Ghosts 'n Goblins as having happened a few years before) which that one game doesn't seem to fit into anyway: it was more a "for fun" game featuring the GnG theme to sell it, like Alleyway features Mario.</dd>

<dd>You have cited more than that, but that is not what this is about. It is your poor interpretation of those rules, your "taking it upon yourself" to delete images that are do not fall under those rules, your lack of understanding that these images have been up for months, your lack of understanding that companies do NOT care about their logo from 1960 being on Wiki, and your lack of caring for the people who worked long and hard to find those images. You have over-stepped the bounds as an admin and as an editor, people are obviously afraid to stand up to you and they have let you do pretty much what you please. I am not one of those people. I worked long and damned hard on these articles and I am not about to let someone who can't cite me one rule that ACTUALLY has to do with these images and PROVE to me that they ARE fair-use and not free images. No where on the images does it say fair-use...I believe most say "logo". If you take down the old logos, take down the up-to-date ones too...you can't have it both ways. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 07:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't matter how long the images have been up, and it doesn't matter if the companies aren't complaining at the moment.

You don't have to take my word that this is necessary; go back and look at what Hbdragon or Chris Griswold or Carnildo or any of the other admins were telling you at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Continued_Problem" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Continued Problem</a>.

<dd>I ask again, WHO says they aren't allowed. HBDragon and Chris Griswold, while giving their input, gave varying reasons (like you) on why they should go...these images didn't fall under any. Read the comment made by DHowell at the bottom of that section. You will find it quite enlighting. But still, with the comments you make on the edit summary (on your contrib page), you could give a damn less about the people uploading these images in good faith. What you don't seem to understand, these images were NOT a problem before you started this "smelly job" and still are not.

You will continue to delete all the older images and only older images, but leave the current image....if the old ones are fair-use, isn't that fair-use too? I think so, so let's takes those down. What about any logo for any sports team? Under your logic, that is fair-use too...those go. What about any picture of any city in the world...again, under your logic, most of those are fair-use too...those go.

<dd>I've read DHowell's arguments many times, and they're arguments to change the rules, not arguments about whether such-and-such images are currently allowed under the existing rules. Most policies and guidelines are subject to discussion and change, and one of the best way to do so is to just ignore the ones you don't like, argue why you're doing so, and see if anyone backs you up. That doesn't work with legal issues, however, like <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> or <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, since they're handed down from Brad Patrick, Jimmy Wales, and the Board. If you willfully ignore them, you just get blocked for exposing the project to legal liability. If people made arguments from the existing policy (instead of what they think the policy should be), I'd give them due consideration. DHowell's arguments are compelling, but they only compel me to regret that this is necessary.</dd>

<p>Could you explain why you changed the edit in CoM's plot synopsis regarding: "Kee goes into labour as they arrive. Miriam distracts a guard from taking <b>note of</b> Kee's <b>condition</b>" constitutes original research? It seems to observational that Miriam did what she did to distract the guard - not from taking Kee - but from even noticing her. Had the guard paid closer attention to Kee, no amount of distraction by Kee would have kept him from taking her. However, that wasn't the observation. Before he paid closer attention, Miriam faked her mania, distracting the guard from Kee.

<p>Dude, I just want you to know, that the encounter I have had with you has made me rethink my being here on Wiki. I have encounted many people who want to help, want to meet in the middle on things, are willing to talk things through and even take the other person's side on an idea on conversation even if they don't like it. You have been nothing but rude, argumentive, and just an all around ass****. Sorry for the language, but that is how I feel. I am going back to updating pages, adding articles and pages, and tiding things up on pages. Because of you, I am just going to stop doing anything that requires any contact with wiki members because my encounters with you have completely turned my off on the whole wiki admin here. I have tried to maintain pages so that all can enjoy, help keep vandals from screwing things up, help newbies as needed, help others with articles...but just trying to save a couple logos has been nothing but a pissing match with you and you will do what you want, you will throw a rule out to defend what you are doing, so it is pointless. I will go back behind-the-scenes and you can continue to do whatever it is you do here. Just remember you and your actions have pushed away an editor who really wanted to help around here and I really did. I really wanted to help out more, but dealing with you, it just ain't worth the migraines. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 04:45, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, but we say they have dual-affiliation and we say they carry shows from two seperate networks, but the schedule gives the information of WHAT NBC shows they carry. They don't just carry the 10pm(9pm MST) shows, but different shows across their schedule and "My Name is Earl" and "The Office" on Saturdays, two days after they are originally broadcast. This information would make for a rambling entry, hence the schedule...which is produced with information from TitanTV and BackChannel Media. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 04:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let's say Wikipedia had a policy stating "Wikipedia is not for listing the colors of buildings," but KXGN had an unusual building, painted with blue and orange stripes. You want to note the building's color in the article, so it prevails upon you to find references making note of the color of the building as unusual or noteworthy, not references that simply list the color of every building ever.

<dd>I thought so, but thought I would throw it out there. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransent_8ef6.html" title="User:Transent">User:Transent</a> checked 100000watts.com and it says that only WAGM-TV Presque Isle, Maine and KXGN are the only dual-affiliation stations. WAGM is solely CBS, so he sent in a correction (so the site would be accurate), when that correction is made, since 100000watts.com is owned by M Street Journal and Inside Radio, would that be a proper source? Scott Fybush is the editor of 100KWatts, so the change shouldn't take long. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 07:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, I was asking if 100000watts.com would be an acceptable source for reference. I figured since it was owned by two known companies and is readily updated with accurate information from those companies, that it would be.

<p>Is there anyway to make the time that shows up on your talk page or any page come up as 12 hour time and not 24 hour or military time? My Dad was in the Navy for 14 years and I still don't understand military time.</p>
<p>Also, I have a question from another user asking if the HD logo used on a few pages (like <a href="../../../w/v/a/WVAQ_95e2.html" title="WVAQ">WVAQ</a> and<a href="../../../k/r/o/KROQ_28b1.html" title="KROQ">KROQ</a>) is acceptable under fair-use or if that should go? The stations are HD (I only added the HD logo to WVAQ) so it might go with the current logo, but I suck with fair-use. Speaking of fair-use, I spoke with my friend, she is a lawyer, and she went through the fair-use rules (she can read legalize and not get a headache) and read it in a couple lawbooks too....and you were right (trust me that is hard to say). The logos are fair-use, even though I don't agree with it, you were right on that and I was stubborn and....wrong.

<dd>As for the HD logo, I honestly have no idea, and something tells me it's a case-by-case thing that takes specific calls. Basically, you need to ask, "Which logo is going to be most recognizable to the largest number of people?" Seems like this'd be the analog logo most of the time, but stations may have significant split audiences. Ideally, though, there should only be one image. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3 of the 6 people I asked from WP:TVS responded back to my messages on their talk pages. Of those 3, all said that it was a "reputable source". Once problem....the site requires a membership. So, with the help of a user to the site (used his password with permission), I went to 100000watts.com and went to the Montana page and got a screenshot of the Glendive page. Now, I know what you are going to say....since you can't verify it yourself it ain't going to work. Hence why, until a better reference comes along, I am putting this search on hiatus. I have added some programming information on the KXGN page, but not in the massive form that I had previous.</p>
<p>If the screenshot will work, please let me know and I will upload it for you to see or email it. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Work</a>)</sup> 19:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, in hindsight, the summaries do sound harsh, but, well, when you've kind been misguided-edit-fighting for a long, long, long time, it begins to affect most people's tones. And you'll notice I said <i>99.99%</i>, I have found helpful anons, but they're way, way outnumbered. As for the redlinked usernames--- you'll see that the creation of my userpage was the <i>first</i> registered edit I'd made. And I never hindered Wikipedia, I waited, watched, and learned before making an account. I was the anon who first introduced the Pok√©Tables (as per the prevailing style) to the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Rocket_187c.html" title="Team Rocket">team Rocket</a> article. At the same time, it <i>is</i> true that I added a huge chunk of POV to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misty_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_e78f.html" title="Misty (Pok√©mon)">Misty (Pok√©mon)</a>..... that wasn't removed till I did it myself, as a registered user, ages and ages later. So, while I do think that helpful anons ought to be guided, labelling an image showing Tracey as one showing Brock is plain idiotic. However, yes, I'll concede that the second summary was unprovoked.

<p>Let me ask you a favor,please. I showed my opinion at the time I editted the template many times. This time I'd like to do so here. I saw the page you had shown me, but I was not satisfied. There are not only game series but also other links such as characters on that standard, and there is no reason that unreleased game should not be added, which you said many times. In short I suggest that <i>Corruption</i> should be added. Additionally, articles of Metroid on Wikipedia don't have template about links except series title like those of other games. If you follow that standard, you should make another template about other terms which there had been on the temprate such as character, area and item before you editted it. You are too irresponsible without doing so. I also don't think that we should follow the common rules every time. In order to make a template which is easy to use we should be equal to the occation.--Lachsha 07:41, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main reason Wikipedia has FUC to allow a <i>limited</i> amount of copyrighted images in its articles is to get a good deal closer to our secondary objective to making a quality encyclopedia.

<dd>The fair use criteria section of WP:FUC is the exhaustive list of ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY conditions that ALL <i>MUST</i> BE MET in order for official policy to allow the presence of a fair-use image in a Wikipedia article that is supposed to be free-use. If any fair-use image fails to meet even one of the ten mandatory criteria on the page, it has to be removed to quite literally save Wikipedia from legal trouble. The ten criteria, reworded by myself for this discussion but remain on <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> in its original for everyone to read, are as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1: There isn't a free-use image anywhere that can be uploaded and used in the fair-use image's place.</li>
<li>2: Don't put up images that are likely to affect the money income of whoever the article talk about; if an article about a photographer shows all his photos on the article, people won't bother buying his products anymore because they can look at them on Wikipedia for free, which is piracy.</li>
<li>3: The amount of copyrighted images used should be <i>as little as possible</i>. Low-resolution images should always be used in the place of high-resolution images (especially images that are so high-resolution that they could be used for piracy), and the rule states loudly and clearly, "Do not use multiple images or media clips if one will serve the purpose adequately." In the case of fair-use image galleries, having multiple logos on there when you need only the most recent logo at the top of the article really does flunk this immovable rule horribly, as AMIB seems to have been saying so many times.</li>
<li>4: The material <b>must</b> have previously been published. Not too sure what the implication of this is...</li>
<li>5: The material <b>must</b> be encyclopedic and otherwise meet general Wikipedia content requirements (things like no game guide, no cruftiness, etc).</li>
<li>6: The material <b>must</b> meet the media-specific policy requirements (which themselves state stuff like upload giant-sized versions of free images and small-sized fair-use images, use JPEG for photographic images, use copyright tags, etc.)</li>
<li>7: The material <b>must</b> be used in at least one article; obviously we don't want copyrighted work lying around, so that should be deleted if it is not usable in any page.</li>
<li>8: Perhaps the point AMIB drives home the most, and rightly so: The material <b>must</b> contribute <b>significantly</b> to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose. In the case of the fair-use gallery, the fair-use logo at the top succeeds this rule but none of the additional logos at the bottom gallery do, since they're depicting logos for the same company being talked about in the article.</li>
<li>9: Use fair-use images only in the relevant articles themselves and not on any talk pages or templates.</li>
<li>10: Put fair-use tags and fair-use rationales on the pages of the fair-use images themselves.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So really, if everyone who edits Wikipedia would read WP:FUC closely and actually care about following it, there would be so many less fair-use images, so many more free-use images in their place, and so much less conflict between editors over this. Minimum fair-use and free-use in fair-use's place is the way the Free Encyclopedia Wikipedia is supposed to work, and is pretty much the will of Jimbo Wales himself, not to mention the result of a lot of consensus among experienced editors. So when AMIB removes fair-use logo galleries, he is quite literally saving the site from legal trouble, and the reason other station articles still have galleries is because neither AMIB nor any other admins who follow fair-use image policy like <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">User:ReyBrujo</a> have removed them yet. (I'm not an admin, but I probably should remove some galleries myself to show I care for the site.) You said above that fair-use images are fit for Wikipedia, but in fact, as proven by WP:FUC and everything I've shown about it above, galleries are very bad for the site and that only the minimum requirement of fair-use images, like the logo on the top of the page, are fit for the site. Many of us have a lot to learn about copyright in relation to images, and I myself learned a lot about fair-use criteria in typing out this essay of a response here, so it's my hope that you can walk away from this having learned how to become a better visual contributor all-around. It's also my hope that AMIB learns how to soften up a bit in his replies to questions posted on his talk page. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup>(<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">Appreciate</a>|<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_Keepers_dd6d.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator/Keepers">Donate</a>)</sup></b> 19:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for explaining this. I wasn't trying to tear him a new one or anything. I was just confused about his actions, that's all.

<dd>To RingtailedFox: You're welcome! I see a lot of users coming to this talk page to complain about AMIB's rather heavy-handed crusadership with fair-use images, and most of them were certainly more interested in "tearing him a new one", and the way AMIB usually gives short answers to weighty issues usually does not answer users' opinions as much as my essay above apparently does.<br />
To AMIB: Since so many people come up to you to confront your actions and you have to explain so many times on your talk page why your actions totally follow the policy, I really would suggest using the body of your userpage to post detailed accounts of what you do as a Wikipedian, why you do it, and how Wikipedia's policy supports what you do, so that other users won't be as likely to confront you about it on your talk page because they'll have read the answers on your user page already. I think that's a great use for your page, personally, and it might save you some grief. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup>(<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">Appreciate</a>|<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_Keepers_dd6d.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator/Keepers">Donate</a>)</sup></b> 18:59, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone made a mediation cabal case based on how articles covering <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_%28series%29_9db9.html" title="Street Fighter (series)">Street Fighter</a></i> characters should be named. Basically people are arguing whether characters with surnames should be referred by their full names on their title or by their more common single name (i.e:<a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Hibiki_320d.html" title="Dan Hibiki">Dan Hibiki</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_%28Street_Fighter%29_2e2f.html" title="Dan (Street Fighter)">Dan (Street Fighter)</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakura_Kasugano_1d25.html" title="Sakura Kasugano">Sakura Kasugano</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakura_%28Street_Fighter%29_c6c2.html" title="Sakura (Street Fighter)">Sakura (Street Fighter)</a>).

<dd>As for merging by evo line, it has been suggested, but it leaves us with 200-something articles with sourcing/notability issues instead of 400-some articles.

<dd>Yeah, there were some rollercoaster discussions at WP:PCP about merging Pokemon pages, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Pok√©mon_Collaborative_Project/Archive_8#Organization_of_Pokemon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Pok√©mon_Collaborative_Project/Archive_8#Organization_of_Pokemon" rel="nofollow">this</a> mega-sized multi-sectioned discussion at the start of November, and check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Pok√©mon_Collaborative_Project/Archive_11#.22Importance.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Pok√©mon_Collaborative_Project/Archive_11#.22Importance.22" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Pok√©mon_Collaborative_Project/Archive_11#General_issue_with_many_of_the_Pokemon_articles..." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Pok√©mon_Collaborative_Project/Archive_11#General_issue_with_many_of_the_Pokemon_articles..." rel="nofollow">this</a> at the end of November. I suggested and still stand by the concept of mega-merging all of the Pokemon into a series of list articles that cover about 15 or 20 Pokemon each, and a very rough mock-up of what I had in mind is still posted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Erik_the_Appreciator/Erik%27s_Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Erik_the_Appreciator/Erik%27s_Sandbox" rel="nofollow">my sandbox</a>, but other users felt we couldn't do it because there would be too much backlash and controversy from many users and readers who like Pokemon and like having so many articles about the franchise, so in a sense I think we're trapped.
