<p>Hello, I realize you are busy, so answer, or do not answer, this at your convenience. Do you believe that a page similar to the Smurf Communism page should be created to explore the rumors of communist metaphors that are allegedly inside Super Mario Bros.? I left a question like this on the Mario talk page, but no one has commented on it, and that was a while ago...--<a href="../../../t/t/o/User%7ETtogreh_9046.html" title="User:Ttogreh">ttogreh</a> 06:14, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Emphatically not. I don't think a Mario Communism page would be appropriate. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:10, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for chiming in about the comma thing on <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Todd_d1c6.html" title="Jason Todd">Jason Todd</a>. It's been extremely difficult to change the article; one or two other editors seem to have ownership problems. It was just kind of upsetting to have someone point out that I've tried to work on the article, blame me for not correcting one specific kind of mistake, and then do making more of that mistake. I agree with you that the article needs real-world context. I've just been kind of cautious to edit the article after the kind of difficult to do so in the past. Anyway, I appreciate that you took the time to look over the article. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 04:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im not mad at you, because I know that the block oviously had something to do with HighwayCello, but Cute Minun, is the account I want to keep. The block happened when I was right in the middle of making major improvements to the Minun article, and I had wrote messages on others talk pages asking them if they need help. Not replying, would let them all down. Cute Minun seemed to be a lot better than the old Iloveminun, and I would rather have it the other way round, Iloveminun, being the one who gets blocked, and Cute Minun, being the one who gets unblocked. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.158.162.78.html" title="User:81.158.162.78">81.158.162.78</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.158.162.78_59a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.158.162.78">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I disagree with this re-design, completely it looks horrid and chunky, can the project actually discuss this before you go off on a tanjent and change it?

<dd>Part of the redesign was necessary; hiddenStructure is depreciated. The only reason it looks the way it does is because it was easier for me to make it look like {{<a href="../../../p/o/k/Template%7EPok%C3%A9mon_character_e304.html" title="Template:Pokémon character">Pokémon character</a>}} (which has been uncontroversial) than to re-implement the old appearance. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 19:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But it's horrid! It looks like someone has attacked it with a ruler, and it's insanely coloured in. Couldn't you fix the hidden structure?

<p>Hi A Man In Black. Thanks for reverting Tony's shameful early closure of the deletion review. I just wanted to inform you that Tony is flat out lying when he says he "deleted a recreation" of the conservative notice board. It was a not a recreation but actually a restoration by another admin, <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> who attempted to make the project more neutral by renaming the board into the political notice board. See the logs here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3AConservative+notice+board" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3AConservative+notice+board" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3APolitics+notice+board" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3APolitics+notice+board" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> . It is really surprising that Tony would continue to say that it was a recreation when we already told him in the deletion review discussion that it was an undeletion. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=59090973&amp;oldid=59089610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=59090973&amp;oldid=59089610" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=59054694&amp;oldid=59054392" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=59054694&amp;oldid=59054392" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Thanks. --<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFacto_85e0.html" title="User:Facto">Facto</a> 03:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I noticed that you changed the Medic article into a redirect to Brood War. With you being an admin and all, usually I would not object, given as you probably would know more about articles and when to delete them in general. However. I noticed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Various_StarCraft_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Various_StarCraft_articles" rel="nofollow">deletion vote</a> for the StarCraft unit series was a "No Consensus" as of February; the Medic was one of those articles included. Though I do agree that some of the articles (haven't gotten to them all yet) are probably overspecific, I do believe that the units themselves merit a page, even if a small one, simply because StarCraft is one of the defining elements in the RTS genre and has continuted influence in the world today.</p>
<p>Thus I ask. On what grounds did you base your wipe of the article? And why was only the Medic article redirected, as opposed to the whole lot mentioned in the VfD? Also, would it have been possible to rewrite the meat of the article into a less strategy guide-like piece? Please note that I do not intend to convey a confrontational tone that might be implied; I basically want to know what was wrong so that I could contribute more effectively in the future.</p>
<p>I'll be inactive for a few weeks, so I know this isn't exactly the best time. Still, any answer that shed light on the situation would be appreciated! Thanks, <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai">Ourai</a> 02:42, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just to start things off, I didn't delete it or protect the redirect or anything; it wasn't an admin action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for individual articles, I don't particularly feel that mere association with a notable work necessarily makes every fictional object, character, or place associated with that work an encyclopedic subject unto itself, and I redirected the Medic article (which was filled with instructive, GameFAQs-style tips) for the same reason that I would redirect "Superman's cape" to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I redirected it after someone added a wholly unencyclopedic stat breakdown more suited to a Starcraft fan site, and partially because I'm unhappy with all these crufty SC non-articles outlining the plot, blow-by-blow, for every single mission, as well as individual articles for every single object, character, and unit. I figured if nobody objected, I would press forward, someone would object and I would convince them and could press forward with some support, or someone would object and I would find no support and I'd work on something else instead of coming off as a lone nut on a crusade (never a healthy thing to do on Wikipedia). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why have you turned the Resident Evil page into a disambiguation page?</p>
<p>Disambiguation pages are meant for terms which have a number of meanings. Resident Evil is a franchise with many elements - there is only one meaning.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil (series) page as it is now called gives an overview and history of the Resident Evil franchise and everything that it has spawned with links to the various films and games where they are covered in more detail.</p>
<p>I propose that this disambig page is once again turned back into a redirect to Resident Evil (series) again where the topic is properly handled.</p>

<p>Consistency. There are three different things named "Resident Evil," and it's reasonable that an incoming link may be referring to the first game or first movie. That said, I've added a commented-out warning not to add the sequels, film or game, again.

<p>I'm currently cracking down on fair use in articles pertaining to video game characters as they often contain images depicting characters in different costumes which are 99% of the time not being discussed within the article text, and there's usually not a proper caption either that connects the image to the text. I've noticed you've removed some and I'm hoping you'll continue to do so as these removals are often reverted by a select few editors. For clarification, you may cite items #3 (one image is adequate for identification and illustration), #8 (decorative purpose) and #9 (no critical commentary).

<dd>About the general templates, I've recovered from the shock of the previous implementation and I'm no longer opposed to the template, although I still would favor a more simiplistic design than that of the lifted from the CVG design. I'll argue the template design of the main CVG talk at a later time, as there's so much to accomplish on my to-do list, one of which, unsurprisingly, is the removal of spoiler tags and their usage on wikipedia. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 11:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm not sure about the redirecting of Ukkiki. It's been around for over a year now, and survived an AfD in the past. Anyway, was it discussed anywhere?

<dd>It was a <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> action, and you can redirect a contentless page without an AFD.

<dd>I wouldn't call it contentless. I'm not going to be a jerk, however, and revert your redirect. I would just like it noted that I strongly disagree, based mainly on the article's AfD, where it was decided that the article be kept.

<p>Hi there, just wanted to suggest adding List_of_weapons_in_Halo:_Combat_Evolved to your current afd nomination for the other Halo weapons page for the second game in the series. The suggested page is the same thing, except for the first game in the series. It includes such gems as "The Pistol along with the Sniper Rifle is considered by some to be the best weapon in the game" and " It is known that some players can easily defeat a foe who is armed with a rocket launcher simply by doing multiple head shots" and "A player with this weapon can become an unstoppable juggernaut with good cover/backup." Since its basically the same as the other page, I don't see the need for a separate afd (although maybe thats simpler, I dont know). Anyway, keep up the good work on the anti-cruft crusade! <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:27, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the encouragement. As for the separate AFDs, like I said on the AFD itself, I'd really rather keep these AFDs separate whenever possible so that issues with each article can be discussed on a case-by-case basis. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:49, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
