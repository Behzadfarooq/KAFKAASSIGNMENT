	    <p><i><b>A Maggot</b></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>) is a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> by British author <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fowles_8448.html" title="John Fowles">John Fowles</a>. It is Fowles' sixth major novel, following <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Collector_3a0a.html" title="The Collector">The Collector</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magus_%28novel%29_4cff.html" title="The Magus (novel)">The Magus</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_French_Lieutenant%27s_Woman_10c3.html" title="The French Lieutenant's Woman">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Martin_%28novel%29_075a.html" title="Daniel Martin (novel)">Daniel Martin</a>,</i> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantissa.html" title="Mantissa">Mantissa</a>.</i> Its title, as the author explains in the prologue, is taken from the archaic sense of the word that means "whim", "quirk", "obsession", or even a snatch of music (see <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earworm.html" title="Earworm">earworm</a>). Another meaning of the word "maggot" becomes apparent later in the novel, used by a character to describe a white, oblong machine that appears to be a spacecraft. Though the author denies that <i>A Maggot</i> is a <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_novel.html" title="Historical novel">historical novel</a>, it does take place during a precise historical timeframe, May <a href="../../../1/7/3/1736.html" title="1736">1736</a> to February <a href="../../../1/7/3/1737.html" title="1737">1737</a>, in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. It might be variously classified as historical fiction, <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_fiction.html" title="Mystery fiction">mystery</a>, or <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>. Because of the narrative style and various <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metafiction.html" title="Metafiction">metafictional</a> devices, most critics classify it as a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodern_novel.html" title="Postmodern novel">postmodern novel</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>"Mr. Bartholomew"</b> (real name unknown; son of the Duke): Bartholomew is the instigator of the action (the journey from London to Dolling's Cave) and primary actor in the mysterious event at the core of the plot; his disappearance drives an investigation, the documentation of which makes up the majority of the novel.</li>
<li><b>Rebecca Lee</b> (née Hocknell; aliases Fanny, Louise): A former Quaker forced by circumstances into prostitution. Hired by Bartholomew to accompany him on his journey, she is the only living witness of the mysterious event in the cave, and the fictional mother of the real Shaker leader <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Lee_77ba.html" title="Ann Lee">Ann Lee</a>.</li>
<li><b>Dick Thurlow</b>: Bartholomew's childhood companion and servant, he is deaf and mute. His apparent suicide following the event in the cave complicates the mystery of Bartholomew's disappearance.</li>
<li><b>Francis Lacy</b> (alias Mr. Brown): An actor hired by Bartholomew to play his uncle during the journey. His testimony adds little to the mystery of the disappearance, though it includes several important conversations with Bartholomew about the nature of God, fate, free will, and social justice.</li>
<li><b>David Jones</b> (alias Sergeant Farthing): An actor/loafer and acquaintance of Lacy, hired by Bartholomew to play a soldier who protects the travelers. Provides important testimony from the outside of the cave as well as his retelling of the "demonic" version of Rebecca's story.</li>
<li><b>Henry Ayscough</b>: A lawyer hired by the Duke to investigate Bartholomew's disappearance. His letters to the Duke which report his progress, as well as the transcripts of his interrogations of various witnesses, make up the majority of the novel.</li>
<li><b>The Duke</b> (father of "Bartholomew"): Though he appears in the story only once (briefly), he initiates the investigation, and Ayscough's letters and transcripts are all sent to him. Some critics argue that readers are implicitly identified with the Duke, leading them to examine their assumptions and interpretations critically.</li>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The book opens with an objective narration about a group of five travellers traveling through <a href="../../../e/x/m/Exmoor.html" title="Exmoor">Exmoor</a> in rural England. They arrive at an inn in a small village, and soon it becomes clear that they are not who they seem to be. The "maid" Louise casually rebuffs the sexual advances of the servant, Dick Thurlow, but then goes to his master's room and undresses before them both. Bartholomew calls his supposed uncle "Lacy" and they discuss Bartholomew's refusal to disclose his journey's secret purpose, as well as <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destiny.html" title="Destiny">fate</a> versus <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_will.html" title="Free will">free will</a>. Eventually the narration stops and is followed by letters, interview transcripts, and snatches of more third-person narration, interspersed by facsimile pages from contemporary issues of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gentleman%27s_Magazine_f1f3.html" title="The Gentleman's Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>. We learn from a fictional news story that a man has been found hanged near the place where the travellers were staying.</p>
<p>The subsequent interviews are conducted by Henry Ayscough, a lawyer employed by Bartholomew's father, who is a Duke. The interviews reveal that Bartholomew had hired the party to travel with him but deceived them about the purpose of his journey. Variations of his story are (1) he was on his way to elope against the wishes of family; (2) he was visiting a wealthy, aged aunt to secure an inheritance from her; (3) he was seeking a cure for impotence; (4) he was pursuing some scientific or occult knowledge, possibly concerning knowledge of the future. He takes Rebecca and Dick to a cave in a remote area. Rebecca's initial tale, retold by Jones, is that he there performed a satanic ritual, and Rebecca herself was raped by <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> and forced to view a panorama of human suffering and cruelty. Rebecca's own testimony admits this was a deception to quiet Jones. She says that she actually saw Bartholomew meet a noble lady who took them all inside a strange floating craft (which she calls "the maggot"). In this craft she sees what she describes as a divine revelation of heaven ("June Eternal") and the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakers.html" title="Shakers">Shaker</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html#Religion" title="Father">Father</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son.html" title="Son">Son</a>, and female <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> or "Mother Wisdom"). She also sees a vision of human suffering and cruelty in this version of her story. Modern readers may interpret her visions as films and her overall experience as a contact with <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travellers</a> or <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">extraterrestrials</a>. Rebecca then loses consciousness; she wakes, finds Jones outside the cave, and they leave together. She then tells Jones the satanic version of her experience. Meanwhile, Jones has seen Dick leave the cave in terror, presumably to go hang himself.</p>
<p>Rebecca later finds herself pregnant. She returns to her <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Society_of_Friends_321e.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> parents but then converts to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakers.html" title="Shakers">Shakerism</a>, marries a blacksmith named John Lee, and gives birth to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Lee_77ba.html" title="Ann Lee">Ann Lee</a>, the future leader of the American Shakers. The mystery of Bartholomew's disappearance is never solved, and Ayscough surmises that he committed suicide out of guilt from his disobedience to his father in the matter of an arranged marriage.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Maggot_eb55.html" title="Edit section: Technique and themes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technique and themes</span></h2>
<p>The novel's <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_technique.html" title="Literary technique">narrative technique</a> of using letters, interviews, a fictional news story (see <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_document.html" title="False document">false document</a>), and real historical documents harks back to, and to some extent satirizes, the conventions in place early in the history of the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a>, when the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistolary_novel.html" title="Epistolary novel">epistolary novel</a> was the most common form. (Fowles' book is set in <a href="../../../1/7/3/1736.html" title="1736">1736</a>, just a few decades after the first novels in English, and just a few years before <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Richardson_3de1.html" title="Samuel Richardson">Samuel Richardson</a>'s landmark <i><a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela.html" title="Pamela">Pamela</a></i>.) Originally, these strategies were intended to strengthen the illusion of reality and mitigate the fictionality of fiction; Fowles uses them ironically to highlight the disconnect between <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a>. At several points in the novel, the characters or narrator foreground their existence as characters in a story, further highlighting the book's fictionality. Moreover, the novel resists many conventions of fiction, such as the <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omniscient_narrator.html" title="Omniscient narrator">omniscient narrator</a> (Fowles' narrator seems omniscient but divulges little of importance) and the drive for <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climax_%28narrative%29.html" title="Climax (narrative)">climax</a> and resolution. In particular, the novel resists the convention of <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_fiction.html" title="Detective fiction">detective fiction</a> which satisfies the desire for a final solution.</p>
<p>The novel also examines the nature of history, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">historiography</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_justice.html" title="Criminal justice">criminal justice</a>, as Ayscough represents the historian/judge trying to create a coherent narrative out of problematic testimonies. The "maggot" itself, as a possible <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time machine</a>, represents historians as intruders in the past who alter it according to their own desires and needs. The power struggle between Aysough and Rebecca to create the narrative of the past problematizes the objectivity of history, making it subordinate to interests of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">social class</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a>. In the end, Fowles uses Rebecca and Ayscough as representatives of two classes of people, one subjective, intuitive, mystical, artistic (i.e., "right-brained"); the other objective, analytical, and judgmental (i.e., "left-brained"). See <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_hemisphere.html" title="Cerebral hemisphere">cerebral hemisphere</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Folwes explicitly positions <i>A Maggot</i> in an era which, he claims, saw the beginning of modern selfhood (see <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_%28psychology%29.html" title="Self (psychology)">self (psychology)</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Self (philosophy)">self (philosophy)</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individual.html" title="Individual">individual</a>). Rebecca is a prototypical modern individual experiencing the difficulty of breaking free from the restraints of society and convention in order to be radically self-realized. In this we can see Fowles' residual <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existentialism.html" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a>, though the novel as a whole represents a move beyond existentialism. His postscript both praises the struggle for modern selfhood and criticizes it for having been co-opted by <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> to create excessive <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumerism.html" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a>.</p>
