<p>I wasn't using my POV for the game. Many critics found it too short. Unless these sources are very unreliable. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankyboy5_1146.html" title="User:Frankyboy5">Frankyboy5</a> 04:23, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your references are a grab-bag of minor game sites, cherrypicked from Gamerankings to find reviews that agree with your POV (except for the G4 review, where you cited the ONE SINGLE NEGATIVE COMMENT from an overwhelmingly positive review). You've decided how you feel and have gone looking for sources, however iffy, that support your POV. That's not how things should be done. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:29, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, these reviewers may be saying that the game was too short for hardcore gamers. According to Nintendo Power issue#202, Takashi Tezuka intentionally made the game easier than others to encourage non-gamerS to play the game. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankyboy5_1146.html" title="User:Frankyboy5">Frankyboy5</a> 03:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you're so insistent on removing the image atop FN P90; when another copyrighted image is right below; and other similar articles are rife with them. At least replace it with the free image on the article. It is of much worse quality but it's better than having nothing atop the page. I understand the frustrations with pop culture but that doesn't mean you need to hold that article to a higher standard than others in terms of fair-use of images.--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 22:33, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops! I didn't realize the second image was fair-use as well.</dd>
<dd>I was consciously leaving the top blank to encourage someone to get a new, free image, but if you think using the PS90 image at the top is best, we can do that.</dd>
<dd>As for a "higher standard," this is the standard; enforcement is just lax. We need not to use fair-use images in cases where free images can be made or found. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If your going to remove a picture that doesn't violate the rules (fairuse images most definately do NOT), then you are responsible for posting a replacement.

<p>Hey there. I was looking at your Poke-cruft pages at <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_Poketasks_f7c1.html" title="User:A Man In Black/Poketasks">User:A Man In Black/Poketasks</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_Poketasks_Merge_6315.html" title="User:A Man In Black/Poketasks/Merge">User:A Man In Black/Poketasks/Merge</a> and saw a lot of things that were taken care of, but they were pretty jumbled linkwise with the unfinished parts. So I crossed out all completed items and restructured these pages for you for better organization, complete with comments about how each completed item was completed, so now you should have an easier time prioritizing your Poketasks. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">(I appreciate talk!)</a></sup></b> 17:17, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey AMIB,</p>
<p>Question for you: You seem to be an admin who spends the majority of his time working on articles (rather than on purely administrative maintenance tasks), and I recall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A_Man_In_Black&amp;diff=65330548&amp;oldid=65330393" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A_Man_In_Black&amp;diff=65330548&amp;oldid=65330393" rel="nofollow">this comment</a> preferring the former rather than the latter. I've thought intermittently about adminship as a way to help out with maintenance chores from time to time (<a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>, and <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> can become backlogged), but I'm wondering how easy it is for you to keep a balance.

<dd>Interesting question. As for balancing editorial and janitorial tasks, I balance it without worrying about balance. I'm here for intellectual stimulation while making something useful, so when I'm burned out or not really up to doing any real writing, I do the inane clicking buttons taks, but when I feel like getting something done, I work on articles.</dd>

<dd>That said, I don't think admins who concentrate on administrative tasks over just being editors with extra buttons are somehow losing focus or balance; that stuff just wouldn't get done if all of the admins had the same attitude towards admin tasks that I do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's been a lot of worry, lately, about losing focus on the encyclopedia, but I don't think it's there. Hauling the garbage (RC patrol, closing AFDs, dealing with AIV, the backlog) is important work to help the encyclopedia run, and while it doesn't directly make the encyclopedia more useful, it makes the work of writing harder if it's not done. If you become an admin and spend every minute of your time on Wikipedia speedying crap, then more power to you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The real risk in losing focus is becoming the kind of user who does nothing but fight with other users. AFD, policy writing, sometimes even FAC or some of the less-article-releated Wikiprojects, that's the real risk, and it's not limited to admins. It's all too easy to get wrapped up in the latest retarded drama (schools, userboxes, the godawful road naming fight) to the point where not only have you lost focus on accomplishing anything but also lost any desire to have anything to do with Wikipedia. Fighting over the content can be useful (although less than ideal), but fighting over policy or other meta issues is the real risk.</dd>

<dd>Yes, it makes a lot of sense. I didn't mean to imply that admins who focus on backlogs are out of balance in any way, as long as that's what they <i>want</i> to do (when it's not, then there's the risk of burnout); what I think I was attempting to getting at was whether you ever found yourself not having time to work on articles that you wanted to. But, as you pointed that out, there's a risk of that regardless of admin backlogs. I think that your approach makes sense (and would make sense for me as well, since I'm not always in the mindset needed to churn out new content or copyedit).

<p>Your first two criticisms are reasonable however, in a heading titled "critical response" no criticisms were displayed. The point I made(eventhough I personally disagree with it) was what the majority of people think, I can show you various different references if neccesary. Also, my referance was completely relevant; it did not promote MGS2's story and praised MGS3's more simplistic story.<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetal_gear_ninty_d14a.html" title="User:Metal gear ninty">Metal gear ninty</a> 15:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's critical response in that it's response from critics and not response that is critical. The IGN review praised the game as near-perfect; in fact, despite whatever you or I might think, the initial critical response in large publications was nearly universally positive, and the "critical response" section needs to reflect that. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:06, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The keyword is "initial" eventhough initial response was very positive; how the game has been regarded has deteoreated over the years. My referance was from a MGS3 review, and that reflected my point: "...with it's incessant codec conversations" "it was far from fun to watch a game eat itself" Here is Another example from a gamespy metal gear solid 3 review: "while there are good plot twists, kojima wisely reigns in the high-minded metababble that tarnished MGS2" I'm more then willing to show you more quotes.<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetal_gear_ninty_d14a.html" title="User:Metal gear ninty">Metal gear ninty</a> 18:20, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't disagree, but you'll need to find something more than an offhand reference in a review of a different game.

<p>A retrospective from G4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty raised the bar even higher for the tactical espionage action genre. The visuals were massively upgraded, and Snake had all kinds of fun new abilities. Yeah, Raiden was kind of hard to get used to and the story got a little wonky at times (i.e. "The La-li-lu-le-lo!"), but you could skip the cutscenes, and we've learned to love that blonde girly man.</p>

<p>I did find this from wikipedia's metal gear solid 3 article:Fans, as well as some critics, who also found MGS2's lengthy dialogues and multitude of plot twists detrimental to the game experience[51] found MGS3's storyline a pleasing throwback to the original Metal Gear Solid, with less of the "philosophical babble"[8] present in Sons of Liberty.Besides I don't see why I can't use referances from other rewiews; what's the difference between that and a retrospective?

<p>Man look it IS helpful and like I have no other places to store them I serioulsy do beg you if you can just LEAVE them and move on. And how isn't that helpful now. If people wanted to know what the worlds most popular character is they can see it at Mario when they type it. Man it's the only way to make people see his most popular.</p>
<p>Man please leave them. If you want I won't even make more summaries anymore just leave those okay. PLEEEEEEEEASE. If you are atLEAST leave the Super Mario Bros one. Just god damn it leave it c'mon. I trying to make wikipedia better. If that was not gonna be good at the first place I never would of joined. Man please.</p>

<p>The issue is that there isn't a commonly-accepted definition, and we shouldn't leave a proposal to change current practice (using the nebulously defined term "notability" to deal with issues of importance and noteworthiness) in a place where it will be mistaken for a description of current practice.</p>
<p>Fresh's silly crusade is an effort to write new rules that will let him shoehorn his articles about personal mass transit into Wikipedia. Labelling hopelessly doomed policy efforts to that effect as such will, at the very least, contain him to talk pages nobody cares about, which are unlikely to affect the encyclopedia negatively. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 12:32, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, so it is perceived that his articles cannot be entered with current practice about "notability" as there are people who object to the content, however, for the NN page to exist in its current form, using only policies to argue its points, kind of suggests that you can't delete the articles without refering to notability because it actually fulfils the other policies. Am I wrong? I had no idea that the user was doing this for personal benefit. I saw the page as a legitimate advance for Wikipedia, which is why I am supporting it. If their pages really do violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> then you should be able to argue from that angle.

<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dark_Throne_0cd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dark Throne">This</a> is the link. Sorry to bother you MIB but I'm struggling to reconcile myself with the result of this particular AFD.</p>
<p>In particular: no solid secondary links were found by anyone during the AFD (including me, I was looking for them in the hope of adding another article to my list to tinker with) <i>and</i> almost all if not all <b>keep</b> votes were from contributors who have contributed to that page (sockpuppet/SPA or established Wikipedian alike). Also, the closing comment mentioned an approx. 50/50 split - but isn't that the point of discussing the issue?</p>
<p>I don't want to be munching sour grapes, to start bandying the AFD around the admin-discussion thingmy if I'm wrong in the first place or to relist an AFD in the 'pitch-till-you-win' style, but I'm really struggling to see where the effort went to argue the point when it came down to a 50/50 vote and zero evidence was produced.</p>
<p>I think I'm guilty of introducing a straw-man myself towards the tail-end of the discussion (about charities), but by that point I was extremely concerned about the nature of DT, the way it appeared to be a Lazarus-sanctioned advert (one of the posts on the talk page is signed by a DT forum uber-mod or somesuch nonsense) and the fact that nothing had any cites at all. My skin was crawling.</p>
<p>Sorry to ask this of you, but could you cast an eye over the AFD and give me your opinion of whether or not I'm right to think it isn't a satisfactory result? I have tried to just get on with it and look at it as another article to fix, but exactly the same concerns arise as when I first stumbled across the AFD. If you're busy then tell me to pee-off and I'll look at the admin-consultation AFD-naughty thing (yet another thing to get my head around).

<p>Now I admit you and I have had our disagreements in the past, and in recent hours too. My personal feelings aside, there's a thought in the back of my mind that I'd like to bring to your attention. You have said on several occasions you don't watch Yugioh. Do you feel, despite this, that you can make reliable edits to Yugioh related pages with little to no knowledge of the topics? In my own personal opinion, if you don't have at least an average knowledge of the page's topics, your edits will have questionable integrity. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake</a></p>

<dd>I'm not a Yu-Gi-Oh fan, but I'm familiar with the CCG in passing (and have been playing CCGs since before the term "CCG" was coined) and have consumed enough of the anime to recognize all major and many minor characters, although moreso the original (yeah, technically second, whatever) anime than GX. Plus, everything I've been doing with Yu-Gi-Oh articles is style stuff; too many images, lists of trivia, other junk.</dd>
<dd>To use the case of the Sartorius images, I don't have to have seen the episodes (although I have) to tell you that you have two images that are supposedly illustrating a difference <i>that don't illustrate any difference</i>. Forget everything you know about Yu-Gi-Oh, go back to the old versions of that article, and look at those two images. They didn't show any difference but a difference of expression. There may have been a difference in the episode, but the images chosen failed to convey it.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, if these articles require that someone be more steeped in Yu-Gi-Oh fandom than I am (and I am far outside the average, despite my lack of great love for the franchise) to understand them, <i>they are bad articles</i>. Wikipedia's target audience is a lay audience, and our goal is to provide encyclopedic overview and context, not make orantely detailed fanpages about every single object, card, person, place, event, and thing in fictional worlds. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:25, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I do not like 207.218.218.50's vandalism on the talk page, I do think the logo gallery for KRIV-TV should stay there. First, those images do have a purpose. They show the history of KRIV-TV. Second, every other major TV station has them. Just check some and you're bound to find some. As for the source info, they are obviously screenshots of a TV, probably taken with a computer hooked up to a VHS. Does the exact source really matter?

Areas that can be considered shaky ground would be found in points 1 and 3, though as long as we continue to properly credit sources and keep redundancy to a minimum (i.e. the same logo appearing more than a few times with just background changes, etc.), that should be acceptable.</dd>

<dd>Ok why did you block me? If you check my history I have never been blocked and I have never done anything that would give me reason to be blocked. From my point of view you were reverting the page non stop breaking the 3R rule twice over and I did not block you when you did that. I was actually trying to talk to you to understand why you were doing this and all you said was there was no rational to use them. Since I constantly gave real and legit rationals for their inclusions your reverting without talking should have gotten you blocked. If you would have said that <i>any</i> disputed image(s) can't be shown that would have ended the conversation. Only brenneman said it and only after you blocked me. I always edit and communicate with others <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> why did you not do the same with me? As for the Anon editor I did not tell him to revert the page so please dont blame me for others doings. Like I said I always assume good faith so I will assume that this was a misunderstanding and hopefully you will correct this error. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a>

<dd>As I also gave you many warnings only to be ignored completely without any just reason given. The Anon user was not me but a friend that I told about this convo. I did not tell him to edit the page but he did it anyway since he also could not understand why you were ignoring everythng I said and aparently thought that I could use some backup on this. I was actually only given one warning while you were given several including the topic of this conversation <i>Please stop breaking 3R.</i> You were blindly reverting ignoring everything said even when I told you many times that there was an incorrect image included with your reverts you kept on reverting back to the wrong version. That only showed me that I was trying to communicate with someone that would not listen. I did EVERYTHING to get your attention and I even tried to talk camly to you. All you have to do is look at the history of the page and you will see what I am referring to. If I would have followed protocol I would have blocked you much sooner. But like I said I always try to work things out without resorting to such things. If you want to go on protocol then also undelete the images you speedily deleted since they were not candidates for such an action and no matter what you believe or your stance on their worth they have to go throught the same protocols as any other image does uploaded before May 4th 2006. I want to show Bose the complete page without any missing images as to get permission for their use. p.s. As you can still see I still have access to wikipedia and I can still edit here. but I have not reverted the pages back. If I was trying something sneeky wouldn't I be reverting the page back non stop with ip accounts or sock puppets like you seam to think I did? Just look at my record and you'll see thats not the kind of user I am.

<dd>Please undelete those images you speedily undeleted since they are Still not valid candidates for such an action. I have got in contact with Bose and I have already sent them a link to the page before all the edits and those images are showen in that page. It seams that nothing I say will ever work since like I said some items are not in the public hands. If you look around you'll still see the Image:Shuffle101.jpg being used without <i>ANYONE</i> including yourself battering an eye on the subject and hundreds of other Fair use images that could be replaced that have been listed as such since earlier this year. Look at all the other products including cell phones Heck the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archos.html" title="Archos">Archos</a> products that have been listed as such since June of this year as they should. Is there a reason that the Bose products are considered so different that they must be removed immediatly? The Fair Use rational for most of the products is a valid one even without Bose's blessing.

I felt like you were breaking 3R but I still did not block you I wanted to get your attention to talk and figure out how to work this out.

<dd>The other users had agreed that some of the images were rare enough to be used and it was agreed to use those images. You came and without replying to anything said even when errors in your reverting including an image of the wrong product were pointed out. You blindly reverted 6 times. Each time I tried to get a response other than copyvio content. They are not copyvio simply because you say they are!

<dd>So your still not going to apologize for blocking me mistakenly implying that I either got someone else to do my dirty work or that I logged out to do it myself?

<p>Please do not convey misinformation in a proposal for deletion. It's fine that you made the deletion proposal, but it's a blatant lie that the only sources are "the author's site and a speed-run archive he submitted it to". First off, "the author's site" is the largest and most notable tool-assisted speedrun site. It was submitted for inclusion via the normal means and was accepted with 69 yes votes to 2 no/indifference votes. Secondly, the author himself did not submit it to that "speedrun site" (which is really the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a>); this was done by a member of the community, independently.

<dd>I misread the links. Apparently the only links are the speedrun archive he sent it to, which has hundreds of speedruns in various categories. You're quibbling about a trivial point, while missing the main one; this speedrun article has no claims of notability; in fact, it says very little at all about the speedrun in question. It was sent to AFD where it was kept based on the promise that it would be expanded, and it's three months later and it's not expanded. If we're going to quibble about untruths, what happened to your promise to actually add some claims of notability to that article? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 19:01, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's interesting to note that I stopped writing the article right after you proposed its first AfD. The article would have been much bigger, had that not happened. I didn't feel like continuing for along time due to the possibility of my work being deleted later on. In any case, it seems that the article is going to be deleted anyhow, because no matter how notable it is inside of the tool-assisted speedrunning scene, and no matter how great an example of the phenomenon it is, there don't seem to be any notability sources that will adhere to your criteria. Still, I'd much rather have a correct article that has something worthwhile to add, as context of the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool-assisted_speedrun.html" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">tool-assisted speedrun</a> article, than some of the garbage that is currently on Wikipedia such as Mega Man weapons (apparently "Zidanet_129" is a reliable source?)

<p>Hi AMIB,</p>
<p>First off, thanks for your recent efforts in trying to maintain Wikipedia's policies on the use of Fair Use images. No one ever wants to be the bearer of bad news, so thanks for assuming a difficult position. However, you recently also made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_CW_Television_Network&amp;diff=81452825&amp;oldid=81335523" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_CW_Television_Network&amp;diff=81452825&amp;oldid=81335523" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> on Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_CW_f9b0.html" title="The CW">The CW</a>. Removing large amounts of material from TV station articles when you're also removing tons of images will only warrant a poor reaction from the WikiProject TV Station editors. I have reverted this edit for now, because each of the major TV networks contains current national scheduling information, and in fact there are also entire articles devoted to historic TV schedules (1946 to present) which certainly have some historic precedent, which is why they have been retained on Wikipedia. Feel free to contact me for discussion of this issue, or you can of course leave a note on the talk page of the article or on <a href="../../../t/v/s/WT%7ETVS_21aa.html" title="WT:TVS">WT:TVS</a>. Best, <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 21:48, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I misunderstood what it was, and didn't realize it was current practice. I've made a practice of <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>, and in this case I learned from edit summaries that I was wrong. No big deal. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:50, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
