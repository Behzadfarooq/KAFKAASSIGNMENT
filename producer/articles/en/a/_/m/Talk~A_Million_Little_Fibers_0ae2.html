<p>---No, the episode was brilliant... that was the closest thing to avant-garde cartoon art I've ever seen. I loved it! ...also, this ep. was WAY more experimental than Woodland Critter Christmas... for starters, the video for half of the cartoon was an unmoving close-up shot of Oprah's crotch!! Man, I love this show.... --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 04:41, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This one was a mixed bag for me. The basic story was a pretty good parody of the James Frey controversy, plus it's nice to actually get a little bit of character development for Towelie. The minge/Gary stuff left me completely cold, however. That whole angle I just found tiresome.<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymondluxuryacht_dffe.html" title="User:Raymondluxuryacht">Raymondluxuryacht</a> 05:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The episode was just boring for me. It had next to nothing to do with South Park. And a vast majority of the air-time was just a still shot of Oprah's vagina with Minge and Gary talking. While I can understand the humour in it, it just wasn't funny for me. <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrichalcon_4180.html" title="User:Orichalcon">Orichalcon</a> 06:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was probably a deliberate action to make this episode as it was, as someone said in the SP Fourms "Don't want politics? Then have some vegina then!" --Conan-san 07:43, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Man, this episode is just as bad as <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pip_%28South_Park_episode%29_0a89.html" title="Pip (South Park episode)">Pip</a>. I found this episode just as boring.</i>--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybob1222_db1a.html" title="User:Jaybob1222">Jaybob1222</a></p>
<p>I was annoyed at first that there going to do an entire episode about towlie and the james frey thing but i ended liking it. <a href="../../../n/i/m/User%7ENimrod1234_0db5.html" title="User:Nimrod1234">Nimrod1234</a> 15:35, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Nah, I don't think they're running out of ideas. It was just them trying out a different-style. I liked it, it was something a little different from the normal. I agree that there was too much staring at the minge/gary. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinblox_a046.html" title="User:Sinblox">sinblox</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/n/User_talk%7ESinblox_3ef1.html" title="User talk:Sinblox">(talk)</a></sup> 18:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think they're out of ideas; the last three episodes have been <b>awesome</b>, but this one really didn't do it for me. I laughed when I realized it was actually her vagina talking (OMG, are they really doing that?!?), but that gag got old quick. Oprah probably <i>did</i> manipulate that Frey fellow into getting back on the show, and she did deserve to be criticized for it, but a gun-toting vagina???Chesty95 17:43, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not part of the camp saying "Oh, South Park isn't good anymore. derp!", I loved the previous 4 episodes. But this one was super weak. Ace ofspade 22:51, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm in agreement here. This one was not that great, but the season up until now has been excellent, so I'm not complaining; they were bound to hit a weak spot sooner or later.<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymondluxuryacht_dffe.html" title="User:Raymondluxuryacht">Raymondluxuryacht</a> 23:11, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

5 minutes of Oprah's minge messed up my television. And it's a brand new TV too. --70.134.219.9 06:33, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I liked this episode. It was different (which is good - any show will be stale after 10 seasons), it was ridiculous (which practically defines south park), and it had towelie! I also liked how they spoofed books (a million little pieces, of mice and men) in addition to the usual action/drama movies <a href="../../../r/m/9/User%7ERm999_bd0e.html" title="User:Rm999">Rm999</a> 08:59, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that this episode had a good concept, but fell short. James Frey definately deserved to be payed out, but they didn't do it well enough. Unlike most of the synopsises tell you, Towelie did NOT give up his drug addiction. The first few minutes were awesome, I laughed so hard at "How hot would you like your Chang sauce...Oh man, I have no idea what I'm doing..." and the Australian Steve Irwin-style accent was good *keep in mind I'm Australian*.--<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikkyc_b35a.html" title="User:Rikkyc">Rikkyc</a> 00:49, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not their usual current-events view either, which I thought kinda sucked. The Frey thing was really old (as was the Muhammad controversy in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Wars_9432.html" title="Cartoon Wars">Cartoon Wars</a>), and in all CW part II and A Million Little Fibers were old and kinda sucked. -<a href="../../../m/y/2F/User%7EMy_sig_31a1.html" title="User:My/sig"><font color="black">Mysekurity</font></a><sup><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania_2006" class="extiw" title="m:Wikimania_2006"><font style="background:black" color="white">[<b>m!</b>]</font></a></sup> 08:03, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe Towlee's observation at the end aplies to Stone and Parker. "I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high - to reward myself." Maybe they were high when they came up with this episode (that was the only thing going through my mind when I saw that gun sticking out of Oprah's crotch) and realized that their episodes are better if they come up with their ideas first and then get high?

<p>OMG... That episode was TERRIBLE. The story was LAME and is not at all the great South Park I've loved all these years. Besides, Towelie's voice was awesome in past episodes, but in this one it seems like they were trying to recreate it, but it sounds like a poor attempt. Also, it seems like they were short in animation time (which is hard to believe, since they've been able to pull great shows in little time, like <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodland_Critter_Christmas_3ec1.html" title="Woodland Critter Christmas">Woodland Critter Christmas</a>), since most of the episode shows stills of Oprah's crotch while Minge and Gary go on with their boring dialogues. I can't believe Matt and Trey came up with this. It almost seems like they took the week off and let someone else (who lacks Matt and Trey's talent) take over this episode. I hope this is just a one-time thing and they go back to making the great episodes we all love. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndresornelas_46e5.html" title="User:Andresornelas">Andresornelas</a> 06:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Oprah's minge has an Australian accent, while Gary, her asshole, has a Scottish accent." - I didn't realise it was meant to be an Australian accent until i read this... I'm Australian, and damn that was a pretty bad attempt if that's what it was meant to be. - steve dangerous</p>
<p>I'm Australian too, I recognised it pretty quickly. It actually sounds identical to the way they voiced Russell Crowe in an earlier episode. Pretty funny, although I don't get the reason behind the accents. <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrichalcon_4180.html" title="User:Orichalcon">Orichalcon</a> 07:30, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm also an Aussie and that is defenantly not an Australian accent, it sounds like a thick British accent to me, either that or its the worst attempt of an Australian accent i've ever heard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking it was brit/scot when I heard it. american cartoons seem pretty bad at aussie accents... reminds me of the simpsons' poor attempt. - steve dangerous</p>
<p>Mingy sounded more <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Kemp_9a92.html" title="Ross Kemp">Ross Kemp</a> cockney than anything else</p>
<p>Agreed. It's cockney "gangster" (think <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock%2C_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_d9ba.html" title="Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a> or <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snatch.html" title="Snatch">Snatch</a>). "Gary" is not Mancunian, more <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_%28style%29.html" title="Camp (style)">camp</a> Scottish.</p>
<p>Gary's accent is definately not Scottish, sounds more Welsh to me (possibly lapsing into a Manchester Accent).</p>

<p>Nononono. bloody hell. Minge alternates between cockney and Aussie and Arsehole is a pretty consistent camp scouser (person from Liverpool) sounded Welsh once or twice though, I'll give that.</p>
<p>Mingy was cockney and Gary was scouse, end of. 80.229.161.131 00:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. As someone who is actually Scottish - Gary ain't. He is scouse.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both accents were terrible. Minge is a bad attempt at a sort of cocney, while Gary is a bad a attempt at a Liverpudlian accent. I have to say that the British accents in South Park are pretty bad (Pip is an exception), but usually dont detract too much from the programme because they're not overused. Here though, the accents just got annoying. This said, I don't consider myself an authority on accents and could be wrong, but I'm Irish and have heard enough of both accents to be fairly sure.</p>
<p>Small point, but Welsh and Scottish are not 'British English' accents- they are British, but, obviously, are from Wales and Scotland respectively, which are definitely not part of England. This might seem like nitpicking to some, but many Welsh and Scots can get pretty offended if they are confused or lumped in with the English. 82.38.163.106 02:04, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
