<p>Kang Jae-Kyrung (played by Hyun Bin) is a 18 year old <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">student</a> where, from his grandfather's money he had anything and everything in his way. But is there something that he can't stop?...</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie.html" title="Movie">movie</a> starts off with the count of this '<a href="../../../m/i/l/Millionare.html" title="Millionare">millionare</a>'s' money going over one million where in the movie smokes and picks a fight with a random man. Where it soon was interupted by one of his friends riding on a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a>, they both ended up fighting and Jae-Kyung stating that he was a millionare and could pay his way through this. The fight ends up in the police station having his lawyer signing a paper for him to leave. Out of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> office, where there Jae-Kyung rides a motorcycle down a school hallway and to his classroom. Where expectly he interrupted the class with him at his locker collecting his <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_phone.html" title="Cell phone">cell phone</a>. He then picked up a call and left.</p>
<p>Jae-Kyung then drives a <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrari.html" title="Ferrari">Ferrari</a> and arrives to meet his friends at a night club where it was stated that it was his 18th birthday. With them drinking and smoking Jae-Kyung then kisses his <a href="../../../i/d/_/ID_b718.html" title="ID">ID</a> card and continues drinking. It was then told that he was the heir of a famous hotel and was given to him by his grandpa.</p>
<p>The story then turns to Eun-whan (played by Lee Yeon Hee) (19 years old) in the movie, where she meets a women called Shin Jun-Lim (later known as her mother) where she works (in a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a>). Shin Jun-lim then asks Eun-whan if she was looking for her son which she then blew up and asked her to leave.</p>
<p>Eun-whan then arrives at the hotel which Jae-Kyung owned which she then faced him and tried to convince him she was <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnant.html" title="Pregnant">pregnant</a>. Without a doubt Jae-Kyung stated that it's a 5 star hotel and did not welcome her and asked her to leave, but with him so rich he shoves some notes in her hand and leaves.</p>
<p>Jae-Kyung was then later dragged to meet his lawyer who stated that there was a matter to be discussed and made a gathering in a room. His lawyer than pulled out a file and read it, there it stated that if Jae-Kyung wants to continue being the heir of the 5 star hotel he would have to follow the requirements he reads these requirements was that he had to transfer to 'Boram high school' in <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangwondo.html" title="Gangwondo">Gangwondo</a> and graduate or else if he doesn't follow then everything he had would go to charity. Then he also stated that if he gave up he'll only inherit 0.1% of everything he once owned. Without a doubt Jae-Kyung blew up and fired the lawyer which for the fact that he couldn't for he's grandfather hired that lawyer. Jae-Kyung, for the inheritence he took up the challege but was told that he could not use anything he's grandfather owned which had forced him to take a bus to Gangwondo instead of a ferrari.</p>
<p>After the stressful experience he had on the bus he finally arrive at Gangwondo and entered a <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a>, without noticing a old man gardening. He was then shocked by the old man and called him a 'gardener' where he did not noticed that the 'gardener' had known his grandfather and was expecting him to arrive. Jae-Kyung then started inspecting the house without noticing picture of him and he's grandfather there.</p>
<p>Jae-Kyung enters a petrol station to buy some food where he met Eun-whan again, he then found out that she worked there. After that, while paying for the food he then realised that his credit card was cut and only had a few notes in his pockets to pay for the food. As he left he stated to... that her hands were dirty so keep the change.</p>
<p>With Jae-Kyung's cruel words, Eun-whan then asked the gardener (later known as her foster father) to help her dye her fingernails in flower juice. While dyeing her finger nails she said that she couldn't wait for the first snow because that was believed to be when she would meet her true love.</p>
<p>While that was happening Jae-Kyung was struggling to sleep with the annoying noises (which was believed to be frog noises). The next morning Jae-Kyung arrived at Boram High School and was humilating the school motto 'Hometown of your heart'. As Jae-Kyung reached the principal's office, he again found out that the so called 'gardener' was the principal of the place and was pretty shocker by that. The no mannered Jae-Kyung gave a great first impression to his fellow classmates (including Eun-Whan) by smashing into the classroom where he was then introduced. The sly Jae-Kyung thought of being expelled for there was nothing about that matter on the will so he ordered to bash Myung-Sik (he's strong classmate) up and be expelled. After bashing Myung-Sik up Jae-Kyung was to have dinnner at Myung-sik's place where Jae-Kyung hoping for his father to be mad but instead treated him to dinner and thanked him. The disappointed Jae-Kyung's plan failed and instead was given leftovers by Myung-sik's family.</p>
<p>As Jae-Kyung left the estate he bumped into Eun-whan and accompanied her for he was frightened by wild animals. As she shone the torch on Jae-Kyung he said he was scared by an ugly girl like her leaving Eun-whan upset once again. On the way Eun-whan stated him as her boyfriend and left Jae-Kyung disgraced. Eun-whan then picked up a flower in a nearby bush, as she placed it on her head and asked if she looked pretty in it Jae-Kyung asked if she was crazy. The angered Eun-whan threw Jae-Kyung's torch into the bushes and left skipping. Without a doubt the scared Jae-kyung went searching for the torch and with the temper of his jae-kyung left in anger.</p>
<p>The next morning as Eun-whan was sorting out the characters for the graduation play, she found one character left. Jae-Kyung which was always late to class was fortunately given the role of being the maid for he had charged into the classroom. Due to the frustration Jae-Kyung was facing, he called his friends to pick him up and to borrow some money. To his concern it was embarassing.</p>
<p>After receiving the money Jae-kyung, hoping to persuade his pricipal gave the money to him hoping to let him graduate but to his surprise the principal didn't expect which then angered Jae-Kyung again.</p>
<p>Jae-Kyung met his friends in the town's bar which then the car ran out of patrol. They called the patrol station to fill the car up for them which turned out to be Eun-whan. Jae-Kyung's guy friends were pretty fond of Eun-Whan and insited in helping her, where one of Jae-Kyung's girl friends grew jealous after knowing she knew Jae-Kyung and insisted on her emptying the ash tray which made Jae-Kyung angry and taught her a lesson.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain.html" title="Rain">rainy</a> day came where Jae-Kyung has been absent from <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a> for a fews days which made Eun-whan worried, but his reasons wasn't for being sick but actually because he was wagging and walking around. As he was eating in front of a store he was attracted by two little children walking with umbrellas which made Jae-Kyung follow. As he followed, they lead him to some place called the Eunhye Orphanage which he found very familiar. As he walked deeper into the estate, he saw a women rather like his mother which unexpectly he followed them. Inside the building he had flashbacks of his childhood (which he had forgotten due to the painful experience of his parents painful death) and thought of his father. He then remembered the day his parents died which had frightened him so hard he ran out the building (in the rain) catching a cold.</p>
<p>Due to how worried Eun-Whan became, she arrived at Jae-Kyung's house which shocked her when see saw Jae-Kyung faint after calling 'mom'. When Jae-Kyung woke up to his shock his fellow classmates suddenly grabbed his finger and poked it with a needle, Jae-Kyung wanting revenge but was too weak to. After his classmates left, the kind and sweet hearted Eun-Whan took care of him by staying at his house and cooking etc. While Eun-Whan was cooking, she was frightened as he was peeping. The millionare Jae-Kyung felt touched after having a girl to cook for him (which he had never tried).</p>
<p>The next few days Jae-Kyrung noticed that Eun-Whan wasn’t at schoo. It turns out that she was sick and in the hospital. As Jae-kyrung goes to the hospital, he finds out that from the doctor that Eun-Whan has a bad heart and that any surprises, excitement or shock would kill her. As Jae-Kyrung tries to explain to the doctor that he loves Eun-Whan, the doctor interrupts, telling him that his love would kill Eun-whan.</p>
<p>Shocked, Jae-Kyrung stays with Eun-Whan in her hospital room over night. As he watches her sleep, he begins to write something. (Very important.) Eun-Whan wakes up and Jae-Kyrung lies and says that the doctor said she was anemic and that she needs to eat better. Jae-Krung stays with her and wakes up to find her hospital bed empty.</p>
<p>As Jae-Kyrung goes searching for her, he finds her going to the prinicples house. It turns out that she was adopted by the principle and that her adoptive father runs the opranhange that Jae-Krung went into and then ran from. Shocked, he tells her "I've lost my parents too." as Eun-Whan starts to tear.</p>
<p>Jae-Kyrung and Eun-Whan continue to grow close, as Eun-Whan realizes that she's going to die and doesn't want to hurt Jae-Kyrung with her death. (Not knowing that Jae-Kyrung already knows.) As Jae-Krung starts to get more and more attached to Eun-Whan, he decides to hurt her so it won't hurt when she dies.</p>
<p>After Jea-Kyrung goes back to school, he sees a little boy and girl. The boy grabs the girl's hand as he says, "I'll come back in 10 nights. 10 nights after. I promise." Jae-Kyrung gasps as his memories of him as a little boy come back to him. He made that same promise, while he was being adopted to a little girl, who was. . . Eun-Whan! As he remembers his adoptive parents deaths, on that same day of leaving, he runs out of the school searching for Eun-Whan.</p>
<p>Running, he goes to her job and finally finds her looking out into the distance. Looking her in the face, Jae-Kyrung stops and tells her that he was lying. That he does love Eun-Whan with all his heart and that he knows that she's dying. They kiss and as the months go on, Eun-Whan explains that she wants to own a house that has a bunch of windows and that her father and her are being kicked off their land.</p>
<p>Jae-Kyrung goes to the landowner, and finds that its the lawyer whose kicking Eun-Whan and her father out. In a rage, Jae-Kyrung promises that he will graduate and that the lawyer will get nothing. Smirking, the lawyer replies that anything can happen in five months.</p>
<p>Angered, Jae-Kyrung promises that he will make it up to her.</p>
<p>He then shares a moment with Eun-Whan as she makes a wish to live long enough to see the first snow fall.</p>
<p>As the play continues, Jae-Kyrung calls the lawyer and gives up his inheritance in exchange for the lawyer to stay away from Eun-Whan's home. The lawyer agrees and Jae-Kryungs realizes that its better that he does this now then wonder about it for the rest of his lige.</p>
<p>Warning: Review/Commentary may include Spoiler!!!</p>
<p>The movie, while falls under the stereotypical Hallyu format (read boy-meets-girl-with-terminal-disease-self-discovery-coming-of-age) definitely also presented many plusses usually absent in sappy, love stories.</p>
<p>First of all, the actual passing of the lead character was implied, not shown so there was no high-decible wailing, tearing of hair scene at all. In fact, towards the end, everything about the movie was very calm, mimicking the readiness of the character's to let go.</p>
<p>Secondly, the male lead played his conflicted role wonderfully. Many viewers may have felt that he was "in and out" of character but in actuality, he merely projected the unexpected reactions in all of us when dealing with the issue of imminent death.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a twist in their relationship that is to be savored as all the pieces come together. This is one of the better products to have emerged from Korean Cinema.</p>
