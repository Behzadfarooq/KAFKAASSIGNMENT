<p>someone changed the full title to omit the final k - not sure about the English of that period, but maybe it was written "publick" back then? (<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClemmy_bebd.html" title="User:Clemmy">clem</a> 20:31, 16 May 2005 (UTC))</p>
<p>I changed it back to Publick, which is the original spelling, then someone reverted it, and someone else reverted it again.</p>
<p>With all due respect to everyone involved, spelling in 1729 wasn't the same as it is today, and was actually quite a bit less formal. So the question, really, is whether the title of the wiki should correspond to the original title on the pamphlet itself, or modern spelling. I've been unable to find a wiki policy that directly relates to this matter. Perhaps someone can enlighten everyone?</p>

<dd>In my opinion, the title of the essay should retain the original spelling. A supporting argument is that texts which include a paraphrased version of "A Modest Proposal" cite the original text as a source.

<p>In my view this entire article is Not Notable at best. It is certainly not NPOV, it is not relevant in any way to the phrase <i>"A Modest Proposal"</i>, and it seems more like an attempt to vandalise Wikipedia. In short it does not belong on Wikipedia, hence the {{delete}} notice. <b>DO NOT</b> remove this notice without a discussion on the topic.</p>

<li>If that is where the term <i>"Modest Proposal"</i> comes from then there may be a case for keeping the article. But it needs to be rewritten because in no place in the article does it actually state why this Catholic babies thing is mentioned. There is no statement that it is the origin of the phrase. The article reads more like an argument supporting the case of eating babies.</li>

<dd>I have no problem with the article and was surprised to see a cleanup tag on it (I've written a couple of other Swift-related articles) so yes, it's fine. And, to answer the top point, the original title does have a final "k" -- I have a reproduction of the title page in my Swift collection. The explanation of "modest proposal" is good - usually a "modest proposal" is both grandiose and deliberately arguing the opposite viewpoint for satiric effect. The Iron Mountain one is a great example. One of Phillip K Dick's short stories is also based on <i>A Modest Proposal</i> but for the life of me I can't remember which one. Back to my point, yes, take the cleanup tag off of it.<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcoddath_a404.html" title="User:Arcoddath">AxS</a> 22:17, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is pointless to claim it is satirical or ironic and not explain how or in what way or by what evidence you are making the claim. By not giving such evidence, you merely support the position of those who think he was speaking from 1st person and very serious. By not giving such evidence, one could claim he later claimed it was satire and not 1st person only to save his butt. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.214.99.108 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.214.99.108.html" title="User talk:24.214.99.108">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__24.214.99.108_75fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 24.214.99.108">contribs</a>)  05:46, 10 March 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Perhaps this is a radical idea, but, as the essay is linked in the article, and the essay is rather short, why not just read it? It is common knowledge that the essay is satire.

<p><br />
I'm a different person that the one who commented above, but:</p>
<p>The page claims that the problem of people misunderstanding the essay was oweing to the difference between satirical intent and serious tone.</p>
<p>Satire is, by deffinition, ironic. It's intent and tone are necessarily opposed. The wording of the page so far makes it seem as though, in this instance, the problem was that people mistook the serious tone for serious proposal, whereas this is a continual problem with ironic works, especially satire (see Chris Morris, Brasseye Paedophelia Special, Polonius' advice in Hamlet).</p>
<p>The problem was that the natural state of satire, that of ironically adopting the flaws one hopes to explode, and then seriously exploiting those flaws to a humourous effect, tends to cause people to mistake the topic for the subject.</p>
<p>The subject of A modest proposal is indifference to suffering of the Irish poor, but the TOPIC is cannibalism. (there's a good bit on that by Menken and later discussion of Menken's ideas by Will Self, i have no time to resaerch any links however.. sorry&#160;:( )</p>
<p>I'm in no position to provide sources right now, as i'm at work, but it just seems weird to read, on a work of satire, that in this instance the tone and content were at odds. That's what satire is. It's like saying "the reason that these atlantic swimmers got wet is because in the atlantic, the ocean is made of water, and the atlantic water is of the wet variety."</p>
<p>Please someone make a ruling on this. It's just a little thing, but it's the kind of thing that always drives me crazy.. it's not majorly significant as a factual reconstruction of the piece and it's critical reaction in the UK, but it's just sort of sloppy thinking. Maybe decreases credibility to the article and the site in general.</p>

<p>To say that this article is not clearly satirical is a bit ridiculous. Given the context of other works by Swift and his standing as the most renown of English Satirist, shouldn't some things be deemed evident for literary consumption and study? Are we to disect and reference every point and line in every body of work in order to accomodate those who may be completely ignorant of the subject? Granted this is where people come to gain information, however, by presenting this information in an overly-analytic, even Kabbalistic way, the information would no longer be pallatable to the general population. I see no problem with stating that Swift was a Satirist without attempting to prove that he was working with satire throughout this work. Otherwise we must also prove that Shakespeare had a sense of humor or that Milton had a strong sense of religious conviction --where would it end? 72.178.116.85 03:36, 15 February 2007 (UTC)72.178.116.85 03:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
