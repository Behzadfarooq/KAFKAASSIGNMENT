<p>Despite that fact that his overall goal of achieving a consensus of moving the FS content to FS/ALLTP was achieved, ALLTP keeps re-inserting a sickening personal attack about me wanting to "kill all the jews". It's irrelevant to the discussion and based on absolutely nothing. My suspicions regarding his motivation about the page move are, on the other hand, directly correlated to his past attempt at deleting the page and his subsequent statements detailing his motivations. I earlier stated that I entirely objected to the move, but <b>I have compromised</b> and agreed to the move, so long as sourced, un-fan-cruft data doesn't get deleted. I don't believe that I deserve to be compared to Hitler by any means, especially when he uses me being suspicious of his motivations as an excuse to do so. The two aren't comparable by any means whatsoever.

<p>Here is what I hoped to do... This is somewhat a little history lesson. When I started writing about the series I wasn't even aware of the OVA, mini and manga series. I later realised that the series is too vast for a single person to write about. I simply didn't have the time to expand all AMG serries related articles. I have a mental idea on how I want to use each and every image. On occasions I "update" this when better images become avalible.</p>
<p>Let me explain, for instance <a href="../../../k/e/i/Image%7EKeiichi_Morisato_%28Oh_My_Goddess%21_Manga%29.png_43a6.html" title="Image:Keiichi Morisato (Oh My Goddess! Manga).png">Image:Keiichi Morisato (Oh My Goddess! Manga).png</a> is very important to explain keiichi's extraordinary personality and extraordinary situation. Angels are the "other self" of the host. If you look at Urd, her angel has a black and a white wing representing her true nature. I can give more examples but dont want to spoil it&#160;:P</p>
<p>It is an excellent series, I highly reccomend it btw.</p>

<dd>The thing is you caught me at a bad time. I am overloaded in real life so this decreases my productivity. I am also overwhelmed with the wikipedia panel I am working on. Furthermore, this entier issue had been most displeasant for me even though I know that was not your intention. All I ask is for you to understand this.
<ul>
<li>What I planed on doing is explaining Keiichi's involvement on the Angle Eater arc and the later Demon-angel arc. These two after all are probably the most signigicant events through out the manga. The manga image would approporately go aroud there. I was hoping someone would write about all that as I do not want to do all thw work. Infact if you know the series you can do this.&#160;:)</li>
<li>I have seen your ANB/I post. I'd rather handle the issue on your/my talk page. Both of us are aiming the guns at each other (metaphoricaly speaking), I'll be the first to put my hand off the trigger.</li>
<li>Another issue is the existing orphaned fair use images which will be deleted very soon as a result of your modification to the template. I'd recomend restoring the multi-imaged version temporarily and going through the images one by one on my userspace since some of the images are used for material not yet covered such as keiichi and angel image above. It would be counter-productive to rush this issue or for the images to be deleted.</li>

<p>The problem is that fair-use images can't sit around until they're placed somewhere relevant. They need to be removed <i>until</i> they're made relevant and useful. While I can sympathize with real life intervening, the problem is that Wikipedia can't be an archive of fair-use images that might someday be used. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:05, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The images are all relevant, I didn't randomly uploaded them. As for Keiichi's case, the image is approporate for being the manga version alone. I merely expressed my long term "plans" as you inquired, do <b>not</b> misinterprete my comments.</dd>
<dd>There is absolutely no reason why images cant be investigated on a case by case basis. Please take the necesary mesures to prevent their deletion. I do not have the time to mass write articles and I do not see the reason for the rush. Is wikipedia under attack?</dd>
<dd>So far you have comprimised nothing and to be blunt you have enforced your stance with the admin privilages you were given. All that makes it really frustrating for a seasoned editor as myself. I sincerely hope to see a cooperative enviorment, please pull your finger off the trigger unless you intend to fire.</dd>

<p>You skipped the "placed somewhere" in the sentence above. Cramming four images into the infobox is not placing them somewhere relevant.</p>
<p>Yes, the images need to be investigated on a case-by-case basis. Get cracking! All you need to do is put the images somewhere relevant in the articles and we'll get started talking about individual cases.</p>
<p>There's no compromise here. All I'm asking of you is the bare minimum; these images can't be in the infobox, feel free to put them anywhere else. I haven't deleted any images save for one image that was unusuable and one image that I've offered to undelete for you if you tell me where you're going to put it. If you can't - or don't, or won't - do that, then the images will be and should be deleted, but I've done nothing to accelerate that deletion save remove some ridiculous galleries crammed into the infobox. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you offer a solution to the <a href="http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_link_problem" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_link_problem" rel="nofollow">edit link problem</a>?

<dd>One way to do it is to let the images be passed to the infobox yet place them outside of the actual infobox template. But I havent got the slightest idea how. Since you seem to be talented on dealing with templates, I am open to suggestions.</dd>

<dd>Excess trivia? Four points? Not exactly a "huge project". The reason they are trivia points is because they are relevant to the character, but don't fit anywhere into the main article.

<p>It is entirely irrational. Not to mention that this comes from your anti-triva page itself: "This guideline does not suggest deletion of trivia sections. Instead, consider it a list of "facts pending integration" or "facts lacking sufficient context for integration". Seek to minimize it, but meanwhile leave it in place as a raw store of facts for both readers and editors to work with." - <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Wikipedia: Avoid trivia sections in articles</a> Not only has it been minimized to almost nothing, what is left can only be described as "facts lacking sufficient context for integration". The trivia section passes every stipulation for remaining in the article. Not only this, but if you are unprepared to add the information yourself, it should be left as a raw store of information for other editors to work with, just as the guideline proposes. Now that you have a guideline expressly suggesting that it remain, that's eight less articles you need to worry about.

<dd>By the way, changing the name of the section from "Trivia" to "Miscellanea" doesn't really solve the problem.

<dd>*sigh* You realize that "I hate cruft" thing was added as joking revenge vandalism by someone else when I put a picture of a bear on someone's userpage, right? (Before that it was "It's all a bunch of hippy tree-hugging crap!") There's no hatred here, just some basic editorial standards. I'm not sure what you're reading into this, here; I clean up my talk page all the time so I can read it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I assume you want to make well-referenced, informative articles. 99% of the policy and guidelines are merely advice from experienced users on how to do that. (The other 1% is the foundation covering its ass or basic protections for users or republishers.) <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> is a recent creation, but it's a good idea from long-standing practice at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One problem with having a trivia header is that it attracts crap. We differ on what's useful to an article, but we both agree that speculation, rumor, personal analysis, coincidence - that sort of nonsense doesn't belong here. Unfortunately, trivia headers often attract that sort of garbage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another problem is that it's usually the worst place to have a given fact. Take, for example, "David has no known friends or relatives in Raccoon City. True to his reputation as a "lone wolf", besides his interaction with Linda and Carter, he has no relationship with any other character throughout the series." Why wouldn't that go under #Background? It's certainly part of his background. More-relevant places could likely be found for all of the bullet points in all of the articles, unless they're garbage (like all the "such-and-such character might be based on such-and-such celebrity!" speculation).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it would help, I'd be happy to do this work on an existing article to give examples, explaining in detail in edit summaries or on talk where I moved each thing and why. I just haven't really fiddled with those articles because I'm working on something else, I have a whole list of things to do when I'm done with this, and to really do those articles right I'd have to replay RE: Outbreak and I'd rather gargle thumbtacks. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:10, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>??? I have no idea what this "I hate cruft" stuff is that you mentioned. Regarding articles, I wish to make articles which serve an informative purpose, regardless of guidelines, stipulations, policies and other garbage obstructing the creation of a truly informative article. The fact of the matter is that you are telling people what's informative and what isn't. Yes, trivia can accumulate lots of rubbish, as can just about any article, but I have "David King" on my watchlist, and speculative rubbish that is added is always removed by myself or one of several others who watch said article. I didn't re-write the whole thing just to have it ruined by vandals and original researchers. The lone-wolf point I left out because it would be exactly as it was in trivia, no more, no less, and I couldn't think of any better way to put that point across than the one that already existed. Obviously, you think this is wrong, wheras, I don't see a problem with trivia at all, hence the reason it was still there. Like I said, you wish to add the points to the main article, go right ahead, I won't stop you at all. Simply removing the information serves no purpose. Trivia may attract rubbish, but that should be expected on a site that anybody can edit, it doesn't mean the truly factual points should be removed, especially because one person decides that this would be best for all, that is no way to conduct a free contribution site. As for explaining your decisions, there is no need. I understand what you are saying, I just can't understand why you are tagging these articles if you are already working another project. Perhaps you should have another administrator appointed who can focus on the project in question or simply trust those who are already working it to make the proper additions. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 07:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not remove either because I couldn't prove the information right or wrong in either direction. King does look like Til Lindemann or whatever his name is, and I didn't know if he was actually based on him or not. The RE4 point is entirely true, not referenced, but was apparently mentioned in a limited bonus DVD created during RE4's production. I do not know the name of this DVD, nor have I heard it mentioned regarding this specific point, although I have heard it mentioned (in regards to overall gameplay) by members of the team on blogs and other visual material, so I didn't touch, due to the fact that I figured somebody would come along who would own the DVD in question or have seen it. They did the same thing with another game, asked for a reference to a specific point which contained none. Just so happened that I could reference the point in question and did so. We shouldn't immediately assume that things that sound credible are not just because they have no reference YET. Especially when I know that they are true, but cannot reference the point. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 07:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your analogy does tend to work; FFX, X-2 and FFVIII were the first to really attempt to strike a balance, and they have reasonable plot sections for the level of detail in those games. Even FF6, FF7, and FF4 have decent lengths, considering what they are. Chrono Trigger, however, is only half as long as most final fantasies; thus, its plot summary shouldn't suffer much with a 400-500 word reduction (or at least to the length of FF8 and FF10). Nevertheless, my major problem is when people are ignorant either way; as editors, we should go by what is generally accepted in the community (and what's best for the readers); if it changes a lot (like with plot summaries), that is when balance kicks in, and that is why Ryu and myself had a great system going. What are your more detailed and general thoughts on the "length" situation (Ex's comments aside, as I found his arguement to be more on citations, and the fact that he missed the whole point of those citations). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 03:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, right now, they're poorly formed.

<dd>I disagree that <i>Final Fantasy 8</i> and <i>Final Fantasy 10</i> and X-2's plot summaries are too long; as an editor and a person who experiences the pulls of "too long" and "too short" in the trenches, I can safely say those are an ideal balance. But Chrono Trigger/Cross, FF6, probably FF7, and maybe FF4 are all a bit long for a compromise. 20 percent reduction on all that should calm most people at least enough. Punting as you said it is a good idea, but it seems to never stay (I used to "punt" a lot as well, and look where it got me on my quest to make numerous featured articles). In using your analogy, I'd say the ideal style to follow is a 10 minute summary of a football game; it's not documentary length, nor is it highlight reel length; it's just right. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 03:40, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've been looking at the FAC pages, and honestly, I think what we ultimately need to do is to let things run a natural course and forget superficial things like length; people have complemented all these articles, and I've had people in real life enjoy the articles, so perhaps we are overanalyzing this issue (as editors tend to do). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 03:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well met, shadowed one. I must ask for your aid in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Acid_Reflux_%28webcomic%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Acid_Reflux_%28webcomic%29" rel="nofollow">the second Acid Reflux deletion vote</a>, as you were one of the few who knew the comic's past prominence in the first vote (and I'm nearly not as eloquent as I should be). The deletors are claiming non-notability to a man and putting the burden of proof entirely on the other side. One even tried to get the article speedily deleted and another demands a reputable newspaper article. What can be done about this? Is the nominator even allowed to have another go because the last time didn't give the result he wants? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 09:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I only reverted some of the edits made by an IP address on The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy episode articles because an admin did most of it.
