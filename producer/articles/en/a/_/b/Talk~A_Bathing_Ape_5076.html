<p>I'm a little confused about the part about how the creator likes to set up stores in hard to find places. There's one in Soho! --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 12:42, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well for example, in Japan, the stores have no sign and are in an area where you wouldn't find it unless you were looking for it (eg: not in a mall plaza). In reference to the store in Soho, that's the ONLY store authorized to sell BAPE apparel in America. In Canada there are only 2 stores (1 chain called <a href="http://www.getonthegoodfoot.ca/" class="external text" title="http://www.getonthegoodfoot.ca/" rel="nofollow">GoodFoot</a>) that are allowed to sell BAPE shoes, one store is located in Toronto, the other one in Montreal .<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWiZZLa_ce27.html" title="User:WiZZLa">WiZZLa</a> 07:11, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Even the one in Soho is kind of "hidden". It's on a small side street, not on an avenue or Broadway and it has no real sign or banner on the storefront. <a href="../../../b/d/o/User%7EBdotdub_a7d2.html" title="User:Bdotdub">Bdotdub</a> 00:39 14 January 2007 (EST)
<dl>
<dd>Livestock in Vancouver also sells authentic BAPEsta shoes
<dl>
<dd>As an update to my January 19th comment, Goodfoot no longer carries BAPE shoes, possibly because the brand has lost popularity in Japan and other countries. <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWiZZLa_ce27.html" title="User:WiZZLa">WiZZLa</a> 03:01, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>re: Soho being the only store authorized to sell in the US, that's not true. the Union store in Los Angeles is also an official retailer.</p>
<p><b>there's one seller on ebay that has real bape items for sale, as the article says. just go to advanced search and go to seller and type in "pondon" and enter and it should give you all his authentic bape products.</b> pondon is a female, lol</p>

You should use this section to discuss possible resolution of the problem and achieve consensus for action. Only when there is a consensus that the article is now cleaned up should you then de-list it by deleting the cleanup tag from the article, this causes the article to drop off the monthly cleanup-needed list page.</p>

<p>I have re-organized and added some information that I feel makes the article a lot more concise and accurate. Many of the sections had repeated information and in the wrong sections. Some things that I thought might need some work still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fame in Japan - I only briefly touched upon Bapes fame in Japan from what I know. It is very broad and if anyone knows anything else on it, that'd be great</li>
<li>I removed the line about a possible Bape skate team. I know that there is a skate team for Ice Cream, but I hadn't heard of one for Bape. It wasn't cited so I just removed it. Can anyone confirm either way?</li>

<p>I just cleaned up some of the wording here and there, as well as adding some small historical facts. I also expanded the Member's club info using the latest Bape catalog. I added the Design category and added info about the Bapesta, and Bapes adidas collaborations. Thanks to whomever removed that myspace link by the way. I hardly think that Bape would have a myspace page. Papercutninja 03:24, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, the list of celebrities that have been seen wearing Bape is getting entirely out of hand. There is no reason for most of them to be on there because they have not aided in Bape's growth.

<p>There is absolutely no sources in this so i removed it and put it here. Once it is cited, then it can be republished. Until then, this is all coming from God-knows-who's mind and half of this could be someone's thoughts.Desouki 22:31, 4 March 2007 (UTC) (Forgot to log in and sign the comment when I made it.)</p>
<p><br />
There are size limits in Bape clothing. Bape sizes may reach up to XXL or a 54-56 inch chest in hooded sweatshirts. There are no sizes bigger, such as XXXXl (4XL). Also sizes over XL are supposed to be rare, so you should be careful when buying a size over XL. Also People might fool you with a real bag, but might have the fake hoody in it.</p>
<p>Also another thing you should look for with Bape hoodies are the 'diamonds'. Look carefully and you will see the difference. Take a close look at how these 'diamonds' are placed on the hooded sweatshirts. The real bapes have the 'diamonds' "on" the letter. The fake ones have it "around" the letters. Also the quality of the material of the real Bapes do make a difference. The camoflauge designs on the real hooded sweatshirts appear clean and clear while the color schemes appear muted on the fakes. The hooded sweatshirts are claimed by Bape to be made in Japan, although they are sometimes produced in China. (Cheap Labor...Those that counterfiet Bapes are often the same ones who mass produce them in Chinese factories. They would usually keep a sample of the genuine article and mass produce it for the black market) And now, onto the subject of what real bapes are packaged in: The Bape plastic bags. The fake bags contain a yellow and orange hue as opposed to the real bag. The fakes have the zipper showing in the middle. The zipper is not supposed to be visible. The design on the fakes tend to overlap the waistband while the real ones do not. The waistband on the genuine ones are woven without visible defects. The fake camo prints are smaller than those found on the genuine ones. You can tell by the stitching and knitting found in the real ones. Look closely and you will see that the knitting starts at the neck and runs diagonally to the armpits. This does not apply to some other hooded sweatshirts such as the one color hooded sweatshirts like the shark and chompper jackets. The BAPE "General" (bape monkey logo) is always sewn onto the wrist of the hooded sweatshirt. The 100% Cotton material used to make counterfeit bape hooded sweatshirts is the same used to make the real hooded sweatshirts. The dye used in the fakes will run and fade with only one wash while the dye found on the genuine articles will not. However, counterfeiters have fallen short of producing quality BAPE denim jeans. They cannot replicate the selvedge edges and the denim is a cheap quality based on the same material used to produce Enyce, Rocawear and G-Unit jeans.</p>
