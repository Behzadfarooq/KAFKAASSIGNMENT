<dd><i>This film is essentially a story of how a person can overcome a debilitating mental illness to attain a true sense of accomplishment, or even greatness.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I contest this summary: after overcoming his illness, Nash hasn't accomplished anything great. His great work was done when he was young and the illness still in its beginning stages. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>For goodness sake, the excerpt isn't saying he has accomplished something great after his recovery, it's saying that he has attained a "sense of accomplishment". Whether we're talking about the real or fictional John Nash, it's indisputable that he has achieved this sense, after not only having won a Nobel prize, but having a highly-praised book written about him with ensuing publicity and articles in mathematics-related periodicals. The point is that after having almost disappeared into obscurity, he came back from a "debilitating mental illness" to achieve this recognition. I repeat: no claim is being made of great accomplishments after his recovery. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho Suh</a> 20:09, Dec 5, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Disagree -- the mental conditioning to supress his illness alone warrents this statement. Not to mention the fact that he was able to come back so well that he was granted a proffesorship <i>and</i> be recognized by his fellow professors for his <i>lifetime</i> achievement -- that one Nobel winning paper he wrote was a single event. All this occured <i>after</i> overcoming his illness. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a>, Saturday, April 13, 2002</p>
<p>He never became professor again after he lost his MIT job in 1959 because of mental illness. What "lifetime achievement" award are you referring to? Looking at his publication list, there is nothing that remotely could be called "great" after 1953 or so.</p>
<p>I would agree that overcoming mental illness is indeed an accomplishment, shared by many, but I don't see greatness anywhere here. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a>, Saturday, April 13, 2002</p>
<p>We are talking here about the character in the movie. In the movie John Nash is honored by his fellow professors by them giving him their pens and congratulating him. This spontaneous ceremony was depicted earlier in the film as s show of recognition for lifetime achievment that is bestoyed by professors to other distinguished professors at Princeston U. Let's not confuse the real John Nash from the character in the film. Even so, I will qualify the statement you are referring to. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a>, Saturday, April 13, 2002</p>

<p>I saw and loved the film. Then I read and loved the biography, one of the best biographies of a scientist or mathematician or engineer that I have ever read, because for once the biographer actually manages to convey something meaningful about his mathematical accomplishments.</p>
<p>I was, however, shocked by the lack of concordance between the basic events in the film and in Nash's life. The film is really about a fictional character with a vague resemblance to John Nash who happens to be named John Nash. It's a roman a clef with a plaintext clef. The resemblance between the John Nash of the book and the movie is perhaps less strong than the resemblance between Howard Hughes and Jonas Cord in "The Carpetbaggers."</p>
<p>For example, in the movie, Nash and his girlfriend are underneath a starry sky. He challenges her to name anything, and he'll find it in the stars. She names an umbrella and he looks up at the sky, filled what seems to be a random starfield, and suddenly a very umbrella-shaped asterism intensifies as he recognizes it and points it out. It's a nice dramatization of the phenomenon of seeing patterns. But no such incident or talent is mentioned in the book.</p>
<p>The book does not mention the incident in which Nash almost lets his child drown in the bathtub because he believes his illusory companion is taking care of him. Nor the pen ceremony. Nor his hallucination that a government has embedded a password device in his arm. Nor the moment when his wife finds the nearby garage, with the walls completely covered with newspaper clipping in which he has found and marked out patterns. Nor the moment when someone finds the abandoned mailbox in which he has been dropping his reports, believing that the government was picking them up. Nor...</p>
<p>...Well, what I mean to say is that this goes way beyond the degree of fictionalization you expect, even in a movie biography. And reviewers don't seem to have noted this much. I get the impression that the movie reviewers for the most part didn't even read Nasar's book. The controversy about biographical accuracy centers on question such as whether his homosexuality and antisemitism were downplayed, whether his recovery was spontaneous or should be credited to new drugs, etc. But I haven't read boo about whether there is really a pen ceremony or not. Or whether the movie includes actual facts about Nash that were <i>not</i> in the book.</p>
<p>There is always a problem with dramatizations, but when I saw the movie, I tended to assume that the basic outline of the basic facts was roughly accurate, e.g. that he did have an hallucinatory roommate with an hallucinatory niece, that he there was a specific moment at which he had to farewell to them, etc.</p>
<p>Something about this should be said in the main article, but at this point I'm not quite sure what. Thoughts? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 14:22, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>P. S. I thought it the film was a beautiful and moving film, and that the book was one of the best biographies I've ever read. For the record, lest you think me a Gradgrind, I'm personally prepared to accept the film as being "truer than the facts." However, the film was <i>so</i> convincing that I assumed that the incidents in it were perhaps dramatized or embroidered, but not actually fictional. I believe that the makers of the film could and should have made that clearer than they did.</dd>

<p>I'm surprised that when I came to this page, expecting to see an article about the book, I saw a page that is mostly about the movie. There should be separate articles about the book and the movie. This is usually what is done, and frankly, in this case, it should be done because of the confusion over the fictionalized John Nash (from the movie) which bears little or no connection to the biographical John Nash (from the book). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho Suh</a> 20:00, Dec 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section that speaks about the fictionalization of the book omits a very important change regarding his schizophrenia: the movie portrays his hallucations as being visual. Like most schizophrenics, Nash's hallucinations were in fact aural. In other words, he heard voices; he didn't see things that weren't there. -- <a href="../../../z/a/w/User%7EZawersh_d0f7.html" title="User:Zawersh">Zawersh</a> 02:04, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to say that looking at the credits on imdb, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352248/fullcredits" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352248/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352248/fullcredits</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/fullcredits" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/fullcredits</a> , this is not at <i>all</i> obvious to me.

Instead I wanted to use my understanding of what I'd read with additional research to evoke the grander beats of John's life. I didn't want it to be literal. I wanted to take stab at the truth of John's life, but not by way of the facts.</i></p>

<p>I put this text in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quote by former U.S. First Lady Barbara Bush - "But why should we hear about body bags, and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?"</li>
</ul>
<p>It was editted out with the comment: 'remove quote from last edit, as its not a source of confusion in the term "a beautiful mind"'</p>
<p>The thing is that the term "beautiful mind" has gained some currency as a more generic term generally equivalent to "Let them eat cake"</p>
<p>see: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+%22beautiful+mind%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+%22beautiful+mind%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or this article for example <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_07_16_atrios_archive.html#115349528829201844" class="external autonumber" title="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_07_16_atrios_archive.html#115349528829201844" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Could not a person be confused by that use of the term "beautiful mind"? Isn't confusion with the movie or book likely? <a href="../../../k/z/n/User%7EKznf_b8a7.html" title="User:Kznf">Charles (Kznf)</a> 13:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I edited the quote out because it didn't seem approrpiate for a dab page. Dab pages are navigation aids to get a reader from a common or ambiguous term to the actual article that were seeking. The question is: If someone types "a beuatiful mind" in the search box, what article were they trying to get to? In my mind, they were not looking for an article about Barbara Bush; they would have just typed "barbara bush" instead. What do you think? - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 17:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I wouldn't discount the possibility out of hand. It's not that they would have seen that quote, or heard about it and would look it up, it's that they would have seen or heard an obscure reference to it <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_07_16_atrios_archive.html#115349528829201844" class="external autonumber" title="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_07_16_atrios_archive.html#115349528829201844" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and would search for it here hoping for an explanation. I think the pertinent question is to what degree the term "beautiful mind" is used either as a derisive nickname for Barbara Bush herself, or is used to describe someone as callous and eliteist. I only know that in the liberal blog community, it is not an uncommon nickname or shorthand. <a href="../../../k/z/n/User%7EKznf_b8a7.html" title="User:Kznf">Charles (Kznf)</a> 18:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems a bit obscure, but I suppose there is no harm in adding it. Maybe we could add it as a "See also", as in:</dd>
