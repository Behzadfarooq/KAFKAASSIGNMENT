<p>When Ulrich tries to tell Yumi how he really feels after some prodding by the rest of the group, he finds her talking to William, who is doing the same thing Ulrich had planned to. Yumi turns him down, but Ulrich leaves before hearing it. Meanwhile, XANA activates a Tower and materializes a Krabe. At school, a driving class has been set up to teach the kids road safety. William turns out to be a good driver and Ulrich a rather poor one, which William makes fun of him for. The two then get into a fight and get detention because of it. Jeremie learns of the activated Tower shortly after and the group heads to the factory without Ulrich. During this time, the Krabe makes its way to Yumi's house. When the group reaches the Factory, they find a second Krabe guarding it. Yumi learns of the first Krabe from Hiroki and goes to help while Odd distracts the first so they can get to the elevator. In the scanner room, it's learned that the first two Krabbes destroyed the scanners that produced them, leaving just one usable. Aelita goes to Lyoko first. Before Odd can go, however, a third Krabe is materialized, preventing any further use of the scanners. Now Odd has to deal with this Krabe, Ulrich and William have to deal with the second, and Yumi and her family have to deal with the first. Not only that, but Aelita has to make her way to the tower without any support.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The episode starts out with the group exiting the Sewers at <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html" title="Kadic Junior High School">the school</a>, having recently taken a virtual journey. <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a> starts to head home, but not before saying goodbye. Her goodbye to <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Stern_94b0.html" title="Ulrich Stern">Ulrich</a> is clearly sounds more nervous than it was to the others. Once she's gone, the others wonder why Ulrich just doesn't ask her out. After much pressure from the other three, Ulrich takes off after her.</p>
<p>At Yumi's suburban home, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_primary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_9961.html#William_Dunbar" title="List of primary characters in Code Lyoko">William</a> is waiting by the front gate. He tries to make a move on Yumi. Ulrich rounds the street corner around now and sees him. Distressed, he takes off back to the school. When Ulrich has disappeard into the surrounding streets, William attempts to kiss Yumi. She dodges him and enters the front garden path. William asks if Yumi is avoiding him because of Ulrich. She won't give an answer.</p>
<p>Back at the school, <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a> is talking to <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a> about the pink "A" T-Shirt she wears for pyjamas. Odd apparently got it for her off of the Internet and Aelita said she thought the shirt would come out of a printer. Ulrich arrives, noticeably upset about what happened in the suburbs. He won't talk about it. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie</a> and Aelita head for their respective rooms as Ulrich lays down.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Jean-Pierre_Delmas" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Headmaster Delmas</a> has arranged for a road safety course for the students. He's even brought in a Warrant Officer from the municipal Police Department. When the Headmaster introduces <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Moral%C3%A9s_017c.html" title="Jim Moralés">Jim</a> as an assistant, Jim refers to himself as Corporal Jim Moralés, Seventh Engineering Battalion, Serial Number 92121. Jim won't elaborate any further on his apparent military service. He also gets the Warrant Officer's rank wrong twice when talking to him. Meanwhile, Yumi tries to get Ulrich's attention. Thanks to the events of the previous night, she's less than successful. After asking the others what's wrong, she learns that Ulrich saw her and William.</p>
<p>The road safety course has been set for the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Track" title="Kadic Junior High School">Track</a> With a runner's starting line serving as point A, the objective is for the students to drive a car around the entire track once without a hitch. A compact yellow EuroCar that appears to be a cross between a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini_Cooper_595f.html" title="Mini Cooper">Mini Cooper</a> and a <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smart_Car_f252.html" title="Smart Car">Smart Car</a> has been provided by the DMV. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a> is the first to go. She adjusts the rearview mirror and looks backward, only to take off in the opposite direction, hitting several orange traffic cones along the way. Next comes Odd, who drives like a maniac. He's followed by Yumi, who can't work a manual transmission and is visibly annoyed about that. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Herv.C3.A9_Pichon" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Hervé</a> comes after and has the same problem. Aelita seems to do well, but looks bored. William and Ulrich are the last to go. William does rather well. Ulrich on the other hand, is almost as bad as Sissi when it comes to driving. William makes fun of him for it, prompting a fight between the two. Jim promptly separates them and drags them to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a>, a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">Tower</a> activates in the <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Mountain" title="Lyoko">Mountain Sector</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanner_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7363.html" title="Scanner (Code Lyoko)">Scanner</a> Room, the equipment can be heard powering up. One of the three opens, but nothing is seen inside thanks to the steam. From a different angle, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Krabe" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Krabe</a> leg sticks out from a Scanner.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Administrative_wing" title="Kadic Junior High School">Administrative Wing</a>, the Headmaster threatens to suspend Ulrich and William should they fight again. He has Jim take them to the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Library" title="Kadic Junior High School">Library</a>. Meanwhile, the others are discussing the fight. Odd points out that they're not the first guys to fight over a woman. Aelita asks Jeremie if he'd fight for her. He replies by saying that he fights <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xana_%28Code_Lyoko%29_66e8.html" title="Xana (Code Lyoko)">XANA</a> every day for her. Odd thinks the line is rather touching. Jeremie's laptop picks up the activated Tower and they head to the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">Factory</a> without Ulrich.</p>
<p>At Yumi's house, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Yumi.27s_parents" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Mr. Ishiyama</a> arrives home early, as his business meeting was pushed back. His wife mentions that she's working on a dictonary. A rather forceful-sounding knock interrupts them. Mrs. Ishiyama opens the door to find a materialized Krabe staring her down.</p>
<p>At the Factory, the group finds another Krabe waiting for them. It fires on them, blasting up the concrete floor. Amid this hullabaloo, Hiroki calls Yumi and tells her about the first Krabe going on a rampage in the suburbs. Jeremie tries to call Ulrich for backup.</p>
<p>At the Library, Jim has confiscated both Ulrich and William's cell phones. He turns Ulrich's cell phone off in response to the call. With Ulrich being unreachable, Yumi heads off to her neighborhood to try and stop the Krabe.</p>
<p>With Yumi gone, Jeremie outlines a plan with all sorts of variables to get by the Krabe. It all boils down to "We need to get past the Krabe and into the elevator." Odd doesn't understand the decepitvely simple statement and just jumps right over the monster. As he distracts it, Aelita and Jeremie run for the elevator. As they do, a short look at each Krabe blast shows just how much more dangerous they are compared to the Kankrelats. Instead of small burn marks, they leave gaping craters which look to be about two feet in diameter. The three eventually make it to the elevator. Upon reaching the Scanners, all but one have been destroyed by the Krabes. As such, Aelita is sent in first. Odd tries to go next, but a third Krabe is produced. He calls Jeremie and says that the last Scanner is gone.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Aelita is given the Overboard. She heads off to the Tower alone.</p>
<p>The Krabe that had been on the Factory Floor has made its way off of the industrial island and through the central city. It is now attacking the school. Jim takes off to try to stop it. With him gone, Ulrich is able to get his phone back. He calls Jeremie and finds out what's happened. He plans to take out the Krabe with William's help. Jim is less than successful when fighting the Krabe. It just shoots him when he runs up. Ulrich and William arrive to provide more targets.</p>
<p>Near Yumi's house, the police have blocked all access to the street. The call about the Krabe at the school, which is believed to be a previously undocumented animal, gets the police to leave. Yumi explores her house in an attempt to find her parents. She finds her dad first. He's wearing the samurai armor that XANA possessed in the first season.</p>
<p>Back at the school, William is being chased by the Krabe. He leads to the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Garden_Shed" title="Kadic Junior High School">Garden Shed</a>. Ulrich jumps out of a tree and jams a metal rod through the Eye of XANA on the Krabe's posterior shell. It's disabled by the attack. After saving William, Ulrich warns him to stay away from their group, and, by extension, Yumi. William just tells Ulrich that he's not first in the running when it comes to Yumi, anyway. Any further discussion is cut off by Odd's call. The Krabe is still chasing him through the elevator shaft. The elevator itself is now in pieces. Ulrich says that he's going to stop the other Krabes. William corrects him by saying that they'll do it together.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Aelita is getting her bearings with the Overboard. She gets the hang of it rather quickly. On the way to the Tower, she even makes ramp via Creativity to do some tricks from. The fun and games is cut short by a group of nine <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Hornets" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Hornets</a>. After a short chase, Aelita finds a circular rock to orbit. As she does, the Hornets break up to follow. As the first closes in on her, she bounces off of it with the Overboard. It fires randomly in all directions, taking out one of the other hornets in the process. the other Hornets continue to chase Aelita. She heads straight for the large rock and does a sudden G-Force climb. One of the Hornets is caught off guard and destroys itself by ramming into the boulder. The seven remaining fly to either side of the rock to corner her. Aelita dodges them and two more crash into each other, removing themselves from play. As the remaining five regroup, Aelita heads for the Tower. The Overboard isn't as fast as the Hornets, so they catch up quickly. Once again faced with enemies, Aelita takes off towards the sky. Jeremie asks what she's doing. He's not reassured when she says it's something Odd taught her. After reaching the top of the region she dives down toward a small hole in the path she'd been following. The Hornets follow, and two more crash into the ground. Left with three, Aelita heads for a cave. In the cave, which is more of a tunnel, the Hornets try the split approach; two on one side, one on the other. During the chase, one of the pair of Hornets crashes and dies. Aelita asks if Jeremie can devirtualize the Overboard when she asks. He says yes, and the chase continues. Eventually, Aelita reaches a chamber inside the cave system with several platforms. As the Hornets close in, she listens carefully for their flapping wings. Once they get close enough, she has Jeremie remove the Overboard. The two Hornets, who expected to hit Aelita, hit each other instead. With no more enemies around, Jeremie brings up the Overwing and Aelita starts off toward the Tower.</p>
<p>At Yumi's house, she and her dad look for the Krabe. As the run through the trashed residential districts, they stumble upon the monster. It takes out Mr. Ishiyama when he tries to fight it. it also shoots Yumi in the leg. Ulrich shows up just in time to deflect its next attack with the sword that goes with the samurai armor. Ulrich jumps around the Krabe, deflecting its attacks. Hiroki and Yumi are pressed up against her front fence. Hiroki is rather impressed, going so far as to say that Ulrich is the one Yumi should be dating.</p>
<p>At the Factory, Odd is still having trouble with the Krabe. William shows up in the EuroCar to rescue him. The Krabe shoots it and puts a hole through both the front and back windshields. William comes to a stop near a dangling cable, giving Odd an idea.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Aelita finds the Tower guarded by the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Scyphozoa" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Scyphozoa</a> and a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Tarantula" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Tarantula</a>. The Tarantula takes out Aelita's Vehicle in just a few shots and the two monsters give chase.</p>
<p>At Yumi's house, Ulrich is doing well against the Krabe. The monster hasn't managed to hit the boy once the entire time. Ulrich even manages to cut off one of the Krabe's legs with the katana. Hiroki's admiration gets Ulrich in trouble, however. The boy runs out to watch the fight, forcing Ulrich to take a hit from the Krabe to save Yumi's little brother.</p>
<p>Back at the Factory, Odd ties the cable around one of the Krabes legs. The cable is attached to the EuroCar. William floors it and leaps out the driver's side door. The EuroCar gets dropped into the elevator shaft, taking the Krabe along for the ride. Odd congratulates William on a job well done.</p>
<p>Back on Lyoko, the Scyphozoa and Tarantula corner Aelita. As the Scyphozoa grabs Aelita to steal her memory, she flickers away. Aelita had managed to fool the monsters with a clone. With the Tower unguarded, Aelita runs for it. The Tarantula fires at her, but it's firing pattern shows no chance of scoring a hit. Aelita makes it to the Tower with little effort.</p>
<p>At Yumi's house, the Krabe has Ulrich pinned and is about to put one of its legs through his skull. Yumi jumps in a vain attempt to save him. Lucky for them, Aelita deactivates the Tower in time. Both let out a sigh of relief at this. Meanwhile, Odd tells William that he won't remember a thing as Jeremie activates the return trip.</p>
<p>Back in time at the driving course, Ulrich does a lot better. William invites him to join a go-kart club that he's a part of. Ulrich says that it sounds like fun. They shake hands, much to the surprise of the others.</p>
