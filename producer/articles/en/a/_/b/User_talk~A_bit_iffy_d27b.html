<p>You were right to revert your edits, but as you stated you were unsure here's a quick explanation. More distant stars &amp; galaxies are younger due to the time it takes for their light to reach us. Therefore if an object is 12 billion light years away, we are seeing at as it existed 12 billion years ago. If these galaxies still exist, they most certainly will be the amongst the oldest in the universe. But unfortunately we will have to wait billions of years for their light to reach us, to find out whether they still exist today. I hope that makes a bit more sense. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 21:27, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having just read your gracious comments on my user page - thank you - i've now read your user page. delightful. now *that's* a user page! i was pleased to read your mention regarding use of alternative software for talk/discussion pages, along the lines of PHP bulletin board. i'd had the same thought in the last week or so, and it really makes sense - and is badly needed. discussions aren't articles - using the same software for them is madness, and as noted increases the likelyhood of tomfoolery with other people's comments (i've had discussion comments i've written deleted arbitrarily by a person who feels who 'owns' the page in question and its discussion - if something written is wrong, then it must stand and be pointed out as wrong, not be capriciously removed). but enough rambling. fabulous photos on your page as well. cheers! <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 18:45, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether adding these notices at the top and bottom of articles is a good idea. The footer notice is really too big for an article. As many of these articles also contain {{<a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">language</a>}}, it might be better to use that templates capability to add a samll footer notice to the bottom of the language infobox instead. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 15:26, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ref your edit comment on <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">Euro</a>: I don't suppose you'd accept "stands to reason, dunnit". Only example I can think of is that the Irish Governmment has been able to secure long term debt denominated in Euro on more favourable terms that previously it did in IEP. Of course a sceptic might observe that "Ireland plc" has improved its credit rating no end at the same time, so what is cause and what is effect? --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 00:35, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>History gives "23:50, 27 November 2005 A bit iffy (rv last edit - test?) ".

<p>Hi. I was just browsing your user page and read, <i>And with years, e.g. 1956, I see very little point in making links of those. I think it's unlikely that users, on reading that someone was born in 1956, would then want to go to the 1956 article.</i>. I certainly understand what you're saying about over-linking making an article unreadable, but I think year links are very valuable. It's a fascinating way to learn about a topic. What was going on in politics, science, music, art, theology, etc at the same such-and-such person was born? How did those events shape that person's life? For example, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> states that Newton's work built on that of his predecessor, Galileo, but fails to note that Galileo died the year Newton was born (plus or minus some calendar confusion). Having year links would make it easy to discover this fact. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 20:15, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi I've been reading your user page and in the "Things about Wikipedia that irritate me" section you mention excessive linking. It occured to me that it would simplify writing and reading articles too if actually all words or expressions that have WP articles were automatically turned into links. I too often find myself wikifying words. What do you think about that?</p>

<p>Howdy, A bit iffy, In my work, inferences are never a bit iffy but either true or false. It is entirely possible that you, like so many prominent geostatistical scholars, do not know enough about mathematical statistics to pass the litmus test of H G Wells who believed statistical thinking to be as necessary for good citizenship as the ability to read and write. So why not engage in a little statistical thinking rather than delete what you deem a bit iffy. JanWMerks--Iconoclast 22:52, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I'll keep my message that geostatistics is an invalid variant of mathematical statistics as short as possible, and you do what you want to do. Visit <a href="http://www.http://www.ai-geostats.org/documents/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.http://www.ai-geostats.org/documents/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>and look at some of the posted files.

<p>I had mistook your edit to <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> to be vandalism. I originally intended to remove the bit about Limerick being nicknamed "Stab City".

Thank you for pointing out my mistake and I'll spend more time on each edit to ensure that this doesn't happen again. <b>Cheers</b>! <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 08:16, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having now had another look at this, I am still utterly mystified. I'm quite sure I did NOT make the above edit. However, the edit summary <i>"Cut link to babe100.com - linkspam. Tidied."</i> is in my style. I do remember seeing a link to babe100.com somewhere (not sure whether it was on Bullock's article), but looking back at various previous versions of the article I cannot find a mention of babe100.com. I try to be very transparent and honest about my edit summaries (as quite possibly you've noticed, Wil), and I would not bury major changes under a single word such as "tidied". In fact, I have never made an edit as major as that one, and if I did, I would probably (a) discuss it first, and (b) use caps in the edit summary. So, what now? Is the article now in an acceptable state, or do things still have to be fixed? Also, I would like to get to the bottom of that weird edit in my name - any ideas? --<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 07:09, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Sorry I did not provide a reason in my edit summary for removing the site; since you could barely edit a comma without receiving an edit conflict message, I just did a couple of quick edits so I wouldn't get reverted or blocked. I removed the Bunnies parody site because, while it certainly is funny, I don't think it belongs in an encyclopedic article. If we added sites with related content like that to the article, the external links section would become bloated.

<p>Hi! First off, I think it was a good idea to create these subcats. To reply to your points</p>
<ol>
<li>(Sadly) I know very little of bots, this could work, but note that most political parties aren't even categorized in established in years-cats.</li>
<li>There is a clear issue of consistency vs. beauty: do we go for the established route or do we innovate? Me creating Category:Political parties founded in 1968 was a typo as was Category:Parties established in 1922 by the way. These ought to be renamed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wouldn't worry too much about the scale since most political party articles are stubs without the year of foundation included. My estimate is that there are around 750 parties currently categorized per year. Even manually that could be do-able, but I hope you can find an automated solution. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 12:59, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re Abraham Lincoln, I can and I will. It was very early on his life. I'll find some links later today, cheers Johnnybriggs 07:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although I can find lots and lots of dodgy American sources about his bankruptcy in 1833 I can only find good links which refer to his severe (early) debts and his possessions being seized by a Sheriff and business that he owned going bankrupt - rather than a formal declaration of his personal insolvency. Anyone know an insolvency practioner who can supply me with a definition? It is part of American folklore that he did go bankrupt as a grocery store owner and then went into law and politics but accurate definition may be difficult.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Johnnybriggs (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnybriggs_c5b0.html" title="User talk:Johnnybriggs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnnybriggs_9ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnnybriggs">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I have put Ennis on my watchlist. I had a look at the edit history and I can see your point. As vandalism goes, it seems a bit more <i>thought out</i> than most, and at a guess, it would be someone from the area. That said, as vandalism goes, it tends more towards the <i>teenager having a laugh</i> end than the malicious end of the vandalism spectrum, so chances are it will peter out. Most of it is getting reverted within a few minutes, but I'll keep an eye on it. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerpotman_e960.html" title="User:Flowerpotman">Flowerpotman</a> 23:57, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw your question at the Ref Desk and seeing as how you got an answer and then presumably went off happy, I thought I'd let you know that I added yet another possible answer. Basically it was just that you could try starting with <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHURCH_7ed9.html" title="WP:CHURCH">WP:CHURCH</a>. Maybe something on the talk page for it would help you out. <span style="font-family:monospace;"><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></span>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:39, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have had the idea of expanding and renaming <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiProject_Brighton_ce53.html" title="WikiProject Brighton">WikiProject Brighton</a> to become <b>WikiProject Sussex</b> - this would not exclude people with a particular interest in, say, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chichester.html" title="Chichester">Chichester</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/u/Arundel.html" title="Arundel">Arundel</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worthing.html" title="Worthing">Worthing</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midhurst.html" title="Midhurst">Midhurst</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulborough.html" title="Pulborough">Pulborough</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billingshurst.html" title="Billingshurst">Billingshurst</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsham.html" title="Horsham">Horsham</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crawley.html" title="Crawley">Crawley</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Grinstead_4bbd.html" title="East Grinstead">East Grinstead</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haywards_Heath_8718.html" title="Haywards Heath">Haywards Heath</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewes.html" title="Lewes">Lewes</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastbourne.html" title="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings.html" title="Hastings">Hastings</a>, <a href="../../../r/y/e/Rye.html" title="Rye">Rye</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchelsea.html" title="Winchelsea">Winchelsea</a>, etc. - all places worthy of a WikiProject - and I'm not sure that having WP:BAH as a sub-project of WP:Sussex would work.
