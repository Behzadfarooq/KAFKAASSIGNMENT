<p><i><b>A Year in the Merde</b></i> is a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_novel.html" title="Comic novel">comic novel</a> by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Clarke_%28writer%29_7c57.html" title="Stephen Clarke (writer)">Stephen Clarke</a> first published in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_literature.html" title="2004 in literature">2004</a> under the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen_name.html" title="Pen name">pen name</a> <b>Paul West</b>. In later editions, the author's real identity was revealed.</p>
<p>Paul West is in fact the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_person_narrative.html" title="First person narrative">first-person narrator</a>, a 27 year-old Englishman, single and unattached, who is recruited by a French entrepreneur and given a one-year contract to come to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> to plan and organize a chain of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_room.html" title="Tea room">tea rooms</a> which his employer wants to open in the French capital. The novel covers the events of that year, starting in <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2002.html" title="September 2002">September 2002</a> and ending in the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>Set at the time of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, <i>A Year in the Merde</i> is about the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_shock.html" title="Culture shock">cultural differences</a> between the British and the French, which are somewhat heightened by the war, especially by the opposing views on the invasion held by <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Blair</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Chirac_001d.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Chirac</a> respectively. The French reaction to the strong <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-French_sentiment_in_the_United_States_2cfe.html" title="Anti-French sentiment in the United States">anti-French sentiment in the United States</a> and elsewhere is also captured in the novel.</p>
<p>A sequel, <i>Merde Actually</i> (<i>In the Merde for Love</i> in the USA), was published in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

<p>The title of the book refers, in a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphorical</a> way, to all the difficult situations Paul West finds himself in during his stay in France, but also, literally, to the huge amount of <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a> <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">excrement</a> that can be found in the streets of Paris in this fiction.

<p>When Paul West starts his new job in September he is altogether unaware of the true character and the machinations of his boss, Jean-Marie Martin, who is in his early fifties, rich, handsome, impeccably dressed, friendly, and prepared to pay him a good salary. West does not know yet that Martin, officially decorated for supporting the French economy, is illegally importing cheap British <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a> (the ban imposed during the <a href="../../../b/o/v/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy.html" title="Bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE crisis</a> not having been lifted yet); that through his political connections he has secured for his daughter Élodie a cheap, <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_council.html" title="City council">council</a>-<a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidy.html" title="Subsidy">subsidized</a> <i><a href="../../../h/l/m/HLM_b961.html" title="HLM">HLM</a></i> apartment; that he associates with the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">far right</a>; that, although married, he is having an affair with someone from the office; and that he wants to sell him, Paul West, a cottage in the country quite close to the site of a future <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power_plant.html" title="Nuclear power plant">nuclear power plant</a>.</p>
<p>West is allotted a motley crew who are supposed to work together on his project. However, everyone, including Martin, turns out to be very reluctant to learn what West has to tell them, for example that "My Tea Is Rich" is <b>not</b> a good name for a chain of English tea rooms. Soon West realizes that no one is following his orders, that nothing is happening, that he is being paid for doing, or at least achieving, absolutely nothing. In the end, his contract is prematurely terminated, and he spends some weeks <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">teaching</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>. ("It was much tougher than working in an office. You can't e-mail your mates while standing in front of a class.")</p>
<p>His love life during that year is an emotional roller coaster ride. In all, West has sex with four different women during that year: Élodie, his boss's daughter; Alexa, who eventually cannot put up with his apolitical outlook on life; Marie, a black girl who willingly drops him when her boyfriend returns from abroad; and Florence, half <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a>, the girl with whom he plans to open his own tea room in Paris at the end of the novel.</p>
