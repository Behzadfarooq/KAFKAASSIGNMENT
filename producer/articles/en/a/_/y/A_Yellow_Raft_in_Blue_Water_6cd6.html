<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/y/A_Yellow_Raft_in_Blue_Water_6cd6.html" title="Edit section: Rayona">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rayona</span></h3>
<p>From the start, the reader is given evidence that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonist.html" title="Protagonist">protagonists</a> of this novel are not involved in what we would consider a typical, contented <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a>. Christine and Rayona foster a relationship which contains definitive signs of dependency and bonding between the two of them, though this is largely offset by Christine's neglectful and erratic tendencies toward Rayona. Christine is a chronic <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> and frequently <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreational_drug_use.html" title="Recreational drug use">abuses</a> an amalgam of other <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoactive_drug.html" title="Psychoactive drug">drugs</a>, including <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percocet.html" title="Percocet">Percocet</a> (a highly addictive <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painkiller.html" title="Painkiller">painkiller</a>).</p>
<p>The book opens in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Health_Service_916d.html" title="Indian Health Service">Indian Health Service</a> hospital in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>, during a card game between Rayona and Christine. Rayona knows that Christine is cheating, and Christine expectedly wins the game. Pressed for another round, Christine declines.</p>
<p>In an article from the <i>Alan Review</i>, Frances Nadeau notes, "In other novels, the mother is absent emotionally, often as a result of alcohol or drug dependency. In <i>Taking the Ferry Home</i>, wealthy and sophisticated Simone suffers from her mother's addiction to both alcohol and drugs. The mothers' emotional dependence often requires that the daughters assume the role of "mother" in that they make decisions and assume responsibility."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Elgin arrives at the hospital a short time after the opening exchange, and he gives Rayona the keys to Christine's <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Volar%C3%A9_6d77.html" title="Plymouth Volaré">Plymouth Volaré</a>, which he had borrowed. Christine is furious at Elgin. Elgin leaves, and Rayona heads to the car in the parking lot. She arrives to find the car damaged and parked improperly, but more surprising is that Christine is breaking into the car with a coat hanger. Christine rants to Rayona about Elgin's unfaithfulness as a husband, and they she lets loose the trouble with her life in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I'm talking about is this: we're broke. We owe two months back rent on that lousy apartment. My unemployment is expired and I'm tired of finding two-bit jobs. I'm past forty years old and my husband wants to ditch me and marry some Arletta. I figure I've wore out my welcome in this world and the only thing I've got that's worth anything is the insurance on this fucking car. So it's going to have a little accident and you're going to win the <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lottery.html" title="Lottery">lottery</a>. Kiss me good-bye."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rayona is quick to prevent her mother from performing this atrocity; this leads to a sudden change of heart on Christine's part. After a trip to a video rental store where Christine rents the movies <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine.html" title="Christine">Christine</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Big_Man_40e0.html" title="Little Big Man">Little Big Man</a>, they continue to Aunt Ida's house in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a>, where the <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Volar%C3%A9_6d77.html" title="Plymouth Volaré">Volaré</a> almost makes it to the house before it dies. Aunt Ida confronts Christine, who suddenly curses Aunt Ida and leaves Rayona to Christine. After Rayona is separated from her mother — abandoned in unfamiliar territory and unsuccessful at first in befriending allies — she steadily becomes more reliant on her own determination and persistence in order to maintain the healthiest possible existence under the conditions she has been subjected to. Aunt Ida ignores Rayona, sitting in front of her teleivsion all day and talking to it. Rayona also meets Father Tom, a young <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> priest who attempts to grow close to Rayona, despite her objections.</p>
<p>Despite the prolonged period of inconsideration from both of her parents, Rayona remains optimistic — though somewhat wistful — about her family's future. In the events leading up to and during her stay at Bearpaw Lake, Rayona always remembers to pack along with her belongings the videos which Christine "rented" from the store in Seattle. These videos serve as a tangible connection and symbolic substitution of her mother, which lends her support in a very subtle manner. This shows us that Rayona is still very much inspired by her hope for reconciliation with her mother.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/y/A_Yellow_Raft_in_Blue_Water_6cd6.html" title="Edit section: Christine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Christine</span></h3>
<p>The origins of the conflict between Rayona and Christine, which manifests itself with the introduction of Aunt Ida, can largely be traced back to Christine's <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childhood.html" title="Childhood">childhood</a>, and the manner in which she was raised. Aunt Ida habitually distanced herself from Christine, and even more so as Lee grew into an increasingly promising young Indian. Christine turned to religion to cope with the lack of support she received at home, though she renounced her faith when a significant aspect of her ecclesiastical beliefs turned out to be false prophecy. As if this weren't enough, she became ever more distanced from Lee, as he became a close comrade to Dayton.</p>
<p>Christine went through several identity crises, the most significant of which influenced her migration to Seattle, and her lubricious but futile devotion to Elgin. When Elgin learned of Rayona's impending arrival, he perfunctorily made the decision to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marry</a> Christine, though it was painfully obvious he did not harbor the personality required to devote his lifestyle to a family. Christine was aware of this when the first clues began to appear, such as his frequent "late nights" at work and his concealment of wages from her. Over time the situation only got worse, and Christine forced herself into obstinate denial of the true state of her present family. Thus, the combination of a volatile and negligent adolescence, and the outright disdain shown by her husband, gave her no proper experience on which to model the raising of her own daughter.</p>
<p>Often Christine spends her nights immersed in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">bar</a> scene of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>, searching for prospective husbands who could fulfill the rift created by her vagrant husband, Elgin. The reader is also given the idea that Christine periodically denies the fact that she has a daughter at home, wondering where her mother runs off to at all hours of the evening.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Christine does find solace in Rayona's presence, and not only realizes, but understands, that the identity which she has assumed through the experience of mothering Rayona is in fact the one which she has been searching for all along. In spite of this enlightenment, Christine remains engrossed in her drinking habits, and learns that this has resulted in severe damage to her <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liver.html" title="Liver">liver</a>. Thus, she has only six months to live, though she does not tell Rayona.</p>
<p><a name="Ida" id="Ida"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/y/A_Yellow_Raft_in_Blue_Water_6cd6.html" title="Edit section: Ida">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ida</span></h3>
<p>Aunt Ida is the one in the book who makes everything make sense. She took in her cousin christine when she was in High School and pretended to be a single mother. Years later she did become an actual mother to Lee, but always went by Aunt Ida because she said she couldn't be called mother because she never got married and never told them who their father really was, believing that it would ruin them forever. Ida raised them both and cared for both the children equally. Christine's personality pushed Ida away and caused a drift in their relationship. Ida regained her daughter when Christine finally was forced to come home after learning that her liver was failing. Ida was a loving mother and helper to many, and she always talks in her native tongue, except for when it comes to watch her shows. Aunt Ida really makes the story come together, but at the same time she is the most misunderstood character of them all.</p>
