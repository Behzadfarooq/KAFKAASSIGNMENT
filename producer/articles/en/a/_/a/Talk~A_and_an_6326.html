<dd>Sure there are differences (why else have separate words?), but I think they are similar enough to call them synonyms.

<dd>I won't argue with a fellow Cantabrigian&#160;:) but it would be interesting to define the difference between "a" and "one".

<dd>Well <b>I'm</b> not a Cantabrigian. &#160;:-) So what if German only has the one word? English only has one word for "kennen" and "wissen", yet I've seen no one claim that <i>these</i> are synonyms. And whether a distinction is essential to human communication seems irrelevant here. A lot of things are non-essential, yet they still have differences.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I could concede "a hundred", but as Auximines pointed out "make a wish" and "make one wish" have clearly different connotations — "a wish" doesn't necessarily mean <i>just</i> one. Calling them synonyms could imply that "a(n)" and "one" can be used interchangeably in this context, which they cannot.</dd>

<dd>The OED cites two other uses of "an": 1) to remove the definiteness of a numeral adjective or express an estimate (e.g. "a sixty years", "a two hundred spears", "a many men") and 2) to mean "one, a certain, a particular; the same" (e.g. "two at a time", "an age"). However, it adds that both are now rare and limited to just a few phrases (such as "a few"). -- <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamezi_280d.html" title="User:Damezi">Damezi</a> 06:50, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Can you give some examples of how your edit applies? While this is entirely likely to be ignorance on my part, I cannot think of any dialects of English in which H normally goes unpronounced at the beginning of a word - Yet examples dialects in which the use of an in this context spring to mind easily, despite their sounding of H (Many north american dialects, a couple of dialects in great britain...)"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm ... I may have been a bit hasty; a quick look on Google for "h dropping" and "an historic" reveals that the situation is somewhat more complicated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems dropping of 'h' in pronunciation is mostly confined to England, and there to RP and Cockney accents, though this seems to be dying out, at last among the educated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While saying 'an historic' must have been prompted by h-dropping, it now seems to be a matter of preference for a lot of people, though it's still less common than "a historic". It seems a lot of people think it "just feels nicer" or seems more sophisticated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While there are plenty of cases of <i>writing</i> "an historic", my own experience has been that it's rather unusual — I'd definitely notice if someone used that form. (Yes, I'm American, but I've heard Canadians, Australians and English(wo)men speak both on TV and in real life.) Curiously, there's also some suggestion that it's primarily a feature of <b>writing</b>; so, is it possible that a lot of people <i>write</i> "an historic", but actually <i>say</i> "a historic"?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And there are of course various opinions to be found on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22an+historic%22+pronunciation&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22an+historic%22+pronunciation&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a></dd>

<dd>I think the <a href="../../../h/-/d/H-dropping.html" title="H-dropping">H-dropping</a> article is a not-awful resource.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The dropping of H is quite common in various dialects of English, though rarely is it applied in a general way to all examples, and often its implementation changes from dialect to dialect. In fact, I would suggest that the North American dialects are unique in their near-universal retention of the <i>H</i> sound where appropriate, yet media exported from America show no greater retention of the <i>an h-</i> usage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Common consensus appears to be that the absence of H is more natural than the presence, from an historical perspective. At times words starting with vowel sounds were generally pronounced with aspiration (the H sound) though the letter itself was not present in the word, and that the spellings gradually changed to reflect this. Of course,spelling was pretty hit-and-miss before the dictionary anyhow...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many of the relevant words also come to us via French, and thus were spelt with a silent H.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whichever of these two most popular options applies to any given word, in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> <i>an</i> is always used before a word beginning with an open sound; the use of <i>A</i> is exceptional and would still be considered technically incorrect in most places, as long as somebody noticed.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These are my reasons for favouring the less specific description of the phenomenon, and for my disagreeing with the exception for aspiration-retaining dialects, though I certainly can't say that your edit is actually inaccurate. The whole language is a bit of a mess and I think it's wise to avoid applying broad generalisations to any one part of it.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Well see, I <i>did</i> look for such an article, but I searched for "h dropping" rather than "h-dropping". &#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My main point, really, is that while even in America some words (such as "honor" and "herb") have a silent H and normally take "an", I would consider it extremely odd if someone used "an" <i>and</i> pronounced the H, as in "an historical perspective". I would expect to <b>hear</b> either "a historical perspective" or "an 'istorical perspective".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>How about this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is also used before words beginning with an H sound in an unstressed syllable as in <i>an historic event</i>. This second usage is fading in written English and some dialects of spoken English, such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>, where it is more common to use "a" rather than "an" before a pronounced H.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I just think the article should reflect any widespread deviations from the 'norm' (and I do think this is one widespread enough). While I certainly can't speak for everyone, I do think the general tendency in <b>pronunciation</b> is for "an" <i>or</i> "h", but not both.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, while using "an" in these cases may be considered more prestigious or just better sounding, neither version is really considered <b>correct</b>. On the other hand, a few years ago I heard that young children were learning it was okay to use "a" before a <b>vowel</b>, as in "a octopus", so it may just be that this country is going to the dogs. &#160;:-)</dd>

"An historic" is anachronistic in written English, and plain wrong in spoken English *unless* there is h-dropping. The whole point of using "an" rather than "a" is to smooth over ugly letter combinations (compare "an egg" with "a egg", for example); to say "an historic" whilst sounding the h runs against the grain. -- JS.Farrar 09:00, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Plain wrong" – except to those who prefer it. I recall a lovely film in which Michael York says something like "We shall have to go to an hotel" and a grande dame replies "How lovely; I haven't heard a young man say 'an hotel' in years." (It might have been in <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> (1974), in which case it might have been Wendy Hiller, Ingrid Bergman, or Lauren Bacall. I can picture the scene, but not the face.) As observed elsewhere here, there exists a definite intellectual-snob usage where the 'h' is pronounced in "an hotel," "an historic," "an historian." I tend to think of it as an Oxbridge usage. You may not like the sound of it, but many do (including myself). I don't think it can be declared wrong just because it is a bit unusual. It is still in the realm of normal usage. (I've also heard "an unicorn" and "an unique", but these are more likely deliberate extensions of this snobby usage, with less literary legitimacy. Although I must confess to liking them as well, and finding them easier to say than "a unicorn" and "a unique".) <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinality_2ccb.html" title="User:Spinality">Trevor Hanson</a> 02:00, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you'd like a concise, easy-to-remember rule, how about this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Use the article <i>a</i> before consonant sounds: <i>a historic event</i>, <i>a one-year term</i> (sounds as if it begins with a <i>w</i>), <i>a united stand</i> (sounds like <i>you</i>).</dd>
<dd>Use the article <i>an</i> before vowel sounds: <i>an energy crisis</i>, <i>an honorable man</i> (the <i>h</i> is silent), <i>an NBA record</i> (sounds like it begins with the letter <i>e</i>), <i>an 1890s celebration</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, it's concise; and many people subscribe to this position; and following this rule would never get you in trouble; but still, many don't agree. Try Googling "an hypothesis" or "an historic" to see plenty of deliberate literary and scholarly uses of this form. (Moreover, the "rule" that one doesn't use 'an' before a consonant is a shaky one. We are all familiar with the grade-school list of vowels: "A, E, I, O, U, <b>and sometimes Y</b>." The 'y' sound is frequently a dipthong beginning with a short i or long e sound: 'yellow' sounds rather like 'ee-ellow' or 'i-ellow'. Unless you say 'yellow' quickly enough, "an yellow flower" would seem to be OK, even by the lowest-common-denominator AP rule.) At any rate, for words with French origins that begin with 'h' like "hotel" and "historian", there is a strong case for using "an" even when the 'h' is aspirated. At least I don't see how one could say such use is wrong, when it has been ubiquitous among scholars since <a href="http://www.newtonproject.imperial.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=NATP00002&amp;mode=normalized" class="external text" title="http://www.newtonproject.imperial.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=NATP00002&amp;mode=normalized" rel="nofollow">Newton</a>. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinality_2ccb.html" title="User:Spinality">Trevor Hanson</a> 08:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My apologies about the edit (I restored it, which is probably another violation of the policy). I obviously misinterpreted the tone of your reply, but your use of <i>lowest common denominator</i> and <i>I don't see how anyone could say such use is wrong</i> came across as condescending to me, even if you didn't intend it. (But I didn't do any better in my reply, so I'm just as guilty.) Anyhow, your link was from the works of Isaac Newton, which is why I inferred you meant works of past scholars. Also, I thought you were talking about the spelling because you wrote <i>...the "rule" that one doesn't use 'an' before a consonant is a shaky one</i>. I looked up the phonetics for y, and it's listed with the consonant sounds, so it doesn't violate the rule. <a href="http://cla.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/phon/learnipa.html" class="external text" title="http://cla.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/phon/learnipa.html" rel="nofollow">IPA for English</a> I think it has something to do with tongue position so you don't trip over the pronunciation. I think it's similar to French abbreviation of <i>la/le</i> before a word starting with a vowel sound. Beagle1971 02:36, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh heh. Thanks for clarifying your point. I definitely did not mean any condescension; I literally meant: 'I don't understand how <i>"an hypothesis"</i> or <i>"an historic"</i> can be thought wrong, since these forms are in wide current scholarly use.' By <i>"lowest common denominator"</i> I didn't mean anything pejorative, though I can see how it might sound that way. I meant that the goal of standards from organizations like AP is to write clear, understandable prose that will look normal to a newspaper reader – a form of writing that, if I recall correctly, is deliberately geared to the level of a high-school-level reader. In other words, such standards are intended to <i>define</i> a lowest-common-denominator; thus usage that might be normal in an academic journal might be judged inappropriate for AP copy. (Similarly, we use different styles when writing a press release versus a journal paper – or a Wikipedia article.) My citing Newton was simply to show that "an hypothesis" had a long tradition; but a quick Google will find lots of recent uses, along with "an historian", "an hueristic", etc. The bottom line here for me is that, although there are lots of people who seem to <i>want</i> an official rule for such cases, I don't believe that there is any such rule-making body for the English language. We of course have established rules of usage, but these are reached by consensus, and on the use of 'a' versus 'an' I think there remain diverging opinions. I further assert that any usage found regularly in scholarly publications and mainstream literature cannot be declared "wrong". A very similar example exists with split infinitives. Grammarians of another generation attempted to legislate them out of existence, but split infinitives have been used by good writers since before Shakespeare; and so the fact that you or I may prefer to avoid them cannot make them wrong in some <i>a priori</i> sense. (I do realize that this whole argument is a tempest in a teapot, and few people give a hoot. But every time I see someone appearing to don the mantle of the Language Police, I feel I must state the other position: that the language is a living thing, and that, in the end, correct usage is defined by how good writers choose to write – and not the other way around.) <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinality_2ccb.html" title="User:Spinality">Trevor Hanson</a> 03:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the AP Stylebook is used to standardize spelling, punctuation and some grammar issues, but it's a myth that it defines how to write for one particular audience or level of reader. Reporters don't purposely write down to a certain level, and editors don't dumb down the copy. Most press releases are poorly written because they're often done by advertising and marketing departments who are unfamiliar with writing anything but ad copy and have an agenda of promoting whatever it is they're writing about. The main difference in an academic journal is that the audience already has context in the subject, while a newspaper or magazine not devoted to that subject has to provide it for the reader. Personally, most academics like to think they're good writers, but they just need a good editor to cut out their overuse of clauses and run-on sentences.</dd>

<p>I think this discussion of Y might need a new subheading, maybe combined with discussion of U below since they're both using the same phonetics. Beagle1971 02:44, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I actually wasn't making a strong case about using 'an' before Y and U, which (even I must concede) would be odd usage. (One might find "an unique" in the mouth of a pedantic fictional character, but not so often in normal writing.) I was instead trying to show that the simple-sounding rule of "use 'an' before vowel sounds" wasn't necessarily as simple as it sounded; and, again, that our goal here should be <i>descriptive</i> rather than <i>prescriptive</i> – "What range of usage has been normal among writers with good ears and good educations?" rather than "What set of rules should we insist that writers follow?" <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinality_2ccb.html" title="User:Spinality">Trevor Hanson</a> 03:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would it be safe to say that 'an' is used before most acronyms. More specifically when the acronyms are spelled when said. For example 'an SAT score' would use an, but 'a RAM chip' would use a because ram is spoken as one word.

<dd>The rules for acronyms are exactly the same for normal words: If the first <i>sound</i> is a vowel, then you get 'an', otherwise you get 'a'. Hence (in addition to your observations), "a TER score" because you say "tee-ee-aar"; "a US company" because you say "you-ess". Also, some acronyms are written-only, and they're meant to be expanded when read, such as "a SO" because you say "a significant other" (or so the present author intends&#160;:). There is some variation; for instance, I pronounce the name of the letter H as 'haitch', so I say "a HTML document". Others who are unfamiliar with my usage might think I intended it to be said "a hypertext markup-language document". —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <span class="usertalk">(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary"><span title="Ae hI: ja" class="IPA">ɑe hɪː jɐ</span></a>)</span> 00:24, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps this clarification can be added somewhere in the article. Currently it is not definitive. For instance, the article doesn't explicitly state whether you would write "an MBA" or "a MBA". Convention would suggests 'an' is appropriate because of the pronunciation "em-bee-ay". Begaddy 22:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another example is that "an orange" used to be written "a norange" (cf. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> <i>naranja</i>), until the 'n' shifted from the beginning of the noun to the end of the article.</dd>

<p><i>Many British usage books, therefore, discount a usage which some Americans (amongst others) employ as being a derivative of the Cockney.</i> Which usage? Using "an" before words that start with "h"? In that case I'd say it should be just "Many British usage books, therefore, discount this usage as being derivative of the Cockney." The way it is is ambiguous in both "a usage" and "employ as being a derivative of the Cockney". I know that isn't why Americans (and others) employ the usage, but...&#160;;)</p>
<p>I can't find anything about it in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a>, but the plural of the letter "h" is spelled "h's" and "h"s in two different places in the article. In fact, should letters be in double or single quotes?</p>
<p><i>Hence "an" may be seen in such phrases as "an historic", "an heroic", and "an hôtel of excellence" was the by-line in an advertisement in a New York City newspaper.</i> Presumably only the last was printed in a New York City newspaper (which one, anyway? I think we should either cite completely, or not at all, as these are just linguistic examples and it's fine for them to be invented), in which case the part after the last comma is a whole sentenced smashed onto the end of a list. Furthermore, was it printed as "an hôtel"? Then it should be in the section about French-derived words. And one more thing: I've never heard by-line used that way. As far as I know it only means the name and position of the writer (see <a href="../../../b/y/l/Byline.html" title="Byline">byline</a>).</p>

<p>...I've one burning question on this subject -- which is the proper form to use; "A European perspective" or "An European perspective"? Thank you! 84.192.116.254 16:05, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most people (and most of the rules cited here) prefer "a European", because the word begins with a 'y' sound. Using that form would <i>never</i> be incorrect. Most participants in the discussion on this page would further assert that "an European" is in fact wrong. I personally disagree, and believe that a case could be made for it – that one will encounter this form in both written and spoken English. However, it is certainly not the most common usage, and the situation is less clear-cut than "an historian", "an hypothesis", or "an hotel" (which I believe are so well-established in literature and speech that their validity is beyond argument). This is of course just my own opinion. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinality_2ccb.html" title="User:Spinality">Trevor Hanson</a> 19:15, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
