<p>In all actuality, John Knowles was gay. One theory is that this novel was written as a way to express repressed homosexual tendencies to a society where homosexuality was not prevalent at the time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I feel the section on the homoerotic tones is well written, it violates NPOV and doesn't sound encyclopedic. A rewrite is desirable. --Hench 04:16, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just finished reading the book for the first time and the theme of homosexuality can not be avoided. it is evident that there is some sort of thing going on from even a cursery reading. not to mention that all boy prep schools are known to have a certain level of homosecuality among them either in fact or in lore. there teall should be something about the gay themes in the book since they are almost rampent in the work.</p>

<p>- - "Nothing endures, not a tree, not love, not a death by violence." As one reads the first chapter, this statement feels like it is meant to be the novel's thesis. Let's break it down. "Not a tree." The narrator feels that the mighty tree which in a way took his best friend's life has perished. "Not a death by violence." He seems to feel that he's finally gotten over Finny's death. But what about that phrase between the two? "Not love." Obviously, Gene is telling us that his beloved, the one thing he cherished above all else, is gone. What could that be? Or, more appropriately, who could that be? It's quite plain that it could definitely be, and in fact probably is, Finny. Just how Gene loved him is not explicitly stated, but as with all works of literature or anything else, for that matter, we must infer from what is given and reach a logical conclusion. - - "Gene is a lonely, introverted intellectual. Phineas is a handsome, taunting, daredevil athlete. What happens between the two one summer, like the war itself, banishes the innocence of them and their world." That sounds like the back of a typical romance novel, doesn't it? But no, it is the summary found on the back of almost any copy of any edition of "A Separate Peace". On a similar note, the motion picture adaptation has been published in a list of the 50 greatest romance films of the 20th century. Clearly more people than one have seen in this story the possibility of a couple. - - The wrestling scene in an early chapter of the book has often been criticized as having homoerotic undertones, such slight hints that one could easily simply ignore or say "boys will be boys", the only things possible for Knowles to include without his entire novel being ignored. "I threw my hip against his, catching him by surprise, and he was instantly down, definitely pleased. This was why he liked me so much. When I jumped on top of him, my knees on his chest, he couldn't ask for anything better." Even with the words "my knees on his chest" which are generally omitted in arguments using this quote, one has to admit that the lines still sound suspicious. The narrator at this point in the story is a sixteen-year-old schoolboy, the likes of which as a group are notorious for thinking only of sex. Construe from this information what you will. - - The whole situation with the pink shirt could easily have been left out without taking anything from the story. Knowles could simply have made Finny's emblem the wearing of the school tie as a belt. But perhaps it was included to make the reader aware of homosexuality as he read, to subliminally introduce it as a possible undercurrent storyline. Finny doesn't care if Gene or others think he looks like "a fairy", and he even suggests of the other male students that "suitors may begin clamoring at the door" without the least discomfort. While these may have been used to indicate his general nonchalance, it could also easily be construed that Phineas has thought about this concept before, so much as to become comfortable with the idea. - - The night at the beach is one of the biggest indications that Finny might also have feelings for Gene. He convinces his friend to go on a three-hour- long bike ride just to get there, then they go swimming together in the ocean. Finally, they both have a glass of beer and settle down to rest, side by side as they watch the sunset. Phineas begins his "usual nighttime monologue", making sure Gene had a good time and finally explaining that the only proper person for a teenaged boy to bring to the beach with him was his best friend. A hesitant pause follows, before "Which is what you are." Here is the same young man, always rash and bold, unashamed to be thought of as gay; and yet totally unconfident when it comes to telling his best friend how he feels. We are not truly sure if he even succeeds. There is also the time when Dr. Stanpole informs Gene before he goes to see Finny after his fall, "He wanted especially to see you. You were the one person he asked for." Gene is the one person at school Phineas cares about most. - - One of the things Gene struggles with so much about himself are his feelings towards his best friend. He doesn't quite seem to know what they are, but he certainly doesn't feel comfortable with them, and he definitely doesn't like them. It is arguable throughout the novel that this is partly because his feelings are more than friendship. Though we never learn for certain what Finny feels, through quotes like "I was used to finding something deadly in things that attracted me; there was always something deadly lurking in anything I wanted, anything I loved. And if it wasn't there, as for example with Phineas, then I put it there myself." Knowles makes obvious to the reader the kind of feelings hidden within Gene, who carefully covers them except in such moments as these when he unwittingly lets his guard down. Completely unawares, he outright tells his listener that he is indeed attracted to Phineas; not only that, but Gene wants him, Gene loves him. - - In fact, Gene often inadvertently puts more than he realizes of his opinion into his comments about Finny. He seems to think that he's just being objective, that anyone who saw or was aquainted with Finny would think these things. Yet we are never, throughout the entire novel, given any indication that this is the case. Gene's thoughts are consistently colored by his feelings; take for example the following quotes. When he goes to take a call in the dean's building and realizes that the number he's given is an operator in Finny's hometown: "I saw on the pad an operator's number... which seemed to interrupt the beating of my heart." When Brinker first tells Finny about their plans to enlist: "Phineas was shocked at the idea of my leaving. In some way he needed me. He needed me. I was the least trustworthy person he had ever met... but there was no mistaking...he wanted me around." Notice the desperate repetition of "He needs me," as if Gene is trying to convince himself. After this Gene deflects Brinker's comments and Brinker responds. Phineas doesn't notice Brinker, and Gene describes the scene: "But Finny hadn't heard that. His face had broken into a wide and dazzling smile at what I had said, lighting up his whole face. This drove me on." Gene continues to denounce Brinker's idea, and has some realization of what he means to Phineas: "I didn't know why he had chosen me. I didn't care." There are even more quotes in which Gene's feelings for Finny show through, as does the obvious mental state of being somehow in love. The ways in which he describes his friend always imply deep affection and adoration for the boy (except when he is deluded that Finny hates him). There are also many quotes that are more subtle hints at Gene's feelings, such as when he describes the odor of the gym: "I thought it anything but a bad smell. It was preeminently the smell of the human body after it had been used to the limit, such a smell as has meaning and poignance for any athlete, as it has for any lover." Such a strange connection is almost a conceit, unless one takes into account that the athlete and the lover are one in the same. - - It's worth noting that no one is a more practiced connoisseur of Phineas's beauty than is Gene. He often reflects on his friend's body, sometimes taking several paragraphs to compliment its supple beauty and grace. He's very impressed with his friend, pondering the "reddish copper glow of his tan" and the way it "made his eyes shine with a cool blue-green fire" as they walk together along the beach. He seems, throughout the book, to be especially taken with Phineas's eyes. And while he notices the bodies of other boys, such as Brinker's only incongruity, his overly large buttocks (Who but a gay guy would even think about that anyway?), he never compliments them as he profusely does for his friend. In short, he feels Finny is "too good to be true," and even tells the boy so himself. - - One of the major complaints about this novel is that the character Phineas is described as almost perfect. For some, it almost ruins the novel. Why does Phineas seem so perfect? It's almost impossible. It probably is impossible, which seems to devalue the worth of this piece of literature, of this American classic. But when we look at the point of view from which the book is told, and thus at the character and motivations of the narrator, this "complaint" is really a great literary achievement and only proves Knowles's incredible talent. The answer to the question, "Why is Finny so wonderful?" is actually very simple. The reason we see such a perfect picture of Phineas is that the novel is told from the perspective of the boy Gene, and Gene thinks of his friend as perfect. It's because to Gene, as to any one of us, his beloved IS perfect. - - No matter how you look at it, this novel is a beautiful and compelling statement about war, peace, and, yes, love. Call it what you will, there is love between the main characters of the story, Phineas and Gene. Knowles himself admitted this in an interview about the book. What kind of love is to be decided by the reader, as is the question of whether or not Gene intentionally jounced the limb that night. For those of us who are perhaps a bit more liberal, there is nothing wrong with conceding that the relationship between Gene and Finny may be a romantic one, or possibly had that potential. It was never realized that way in the book because it was never given a chance to, and because Knowles wanted the novel to be taken seriously; and yet, it's still obvious that Gene and Phineas were each the most important thing in the world to the other and cared for each other deeply. The beauty of such friendship, however it is interpreted, is probably the most deeply moving theme in the novel and one of the reasons that, even 45 years after it was written, it is still cherished</p>

<p>Unless there's some other reason, a section describing why this book was banned and where would cover a homosexual themes section. It's on wikipedias list of banned books, but there is no explanation there. This article mentions that Knowles said that Finny and Gene were in love on page 2. <a href="http://www.looksmartjrhigh.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200401/ai_n9385166/pg_2?pi=gdw" class="external free" title="http://www.looksmartjrhigh.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200401/ai_n9385166/pg_2?pi=gdw" rel="nofollow">http://www.looksmartjrhigh.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200401/ai_n9385166/pg_2?pi=gdw</a> Then again, that guy used the word love like nobody's business. The article cites a source I am currently to lazy to look up. I think it's probable that the writer of the article didn't intentionally take Knowles out of context, though. 66.41.66.213 14:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
