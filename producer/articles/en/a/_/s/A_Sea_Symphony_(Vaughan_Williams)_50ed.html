<p><i><b>A Sea Symphony</b></i> is a choral <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony.html" title="Symphony">symphony</a> by <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Vaughan_Williams_30b7.html" title="Ralph Vaughan Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, written between 1903 and 1909. Vaughan Williams's first and longest symphony, it was first performed at the <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> Festival in 1910, with the composer conducting. The symphony's maturity belies the composer's relative youth when it was written (he was 30 when he first began sketching it). Perhaps the first true “choral symphony” (the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a> is used throughout the work and is arguably the most integral part of the musical texture), <i>A Sea Symphony</i> helped set the stage for a new era of symphonic and choral music in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> during the first half of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.</p>
<p>Vaughan Williams did not number his symphonies as he composed them (he referred to them only by title or key) until the appearance of the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._9_%28Vaughan_Williams%29_fa85.html" title="Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)">Ninth</a>, which is in the same key as the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._6_%28Vaughan_Williams%29_43df.html" title="Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)">Sixth</a>. At that point, he assigned numbers to them, beginning with the F minor, in order to avoid confusion. The first three are as well known by their titles as by their numbers.</p>

<p>From 1903-1909, Ralph Vaughan Williams worked intermittently on a series of songs for chorus and orchestra that were to become his most lengthy project to date and his first true symphony. Originally titled <i>The Ocean,</i> <i>A Sea Symphony</i> was first performed in 1910 at the Leeds Festival on the composer’s 38th birthday. This is generally cited as his first large-scale work; although <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grove_Dictionary_of_Music_and_Musicians_9117.html" title="Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians">Grove</a> lists some 16 other orchestral works composed by Vaughan Williams before he completed <i>A Sea Symphony</i>, including two with chorus; the vast majority of those are juvenalia or apprentice works that have never been published and are long since withdrawn from circulation. Nevertheless, Vaughan Williams had never before attempted a work of quite this duration, or for such large forces, and it was his first of what would eventually be nine symphonies. Like <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Brahms_a544.html" title="Johannes Brahms">Brahms</a>, Vaughan Williams delayed a long time before composing his first symphony (38 years of age is a late start by any standard), but remained prolific throughout the end of his life: his final symphony was composed from 1956-58, and completed when he was 85 years of age.</p>

<p>At approximately 70 minutes, A Sea Symphony is the longest of all Vaughan Williams’ symphonies. Although it represents a departure from the traditional Germanic symphonic tradition of the time, it follows a fairly standard symphonic outline: fast introductory <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_%28music%29.html" title="Movement (music)">movement</a>, slow movement, scherzo, and finale. The four movements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Song for All Seas, All Ships (baritone, soprano, and chorus)</li>
<li>On the Beach at Night, Alone (baritone and chorus)</li>
<li>Scherzo: The Waves (chorus)</li>
<li>The Explorers (baritone, soprano, semi-chorus, and chorus)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first movement lasts roughly twenty minutes; the inner movements approximately eleven and eight minutes, and the finale lasts roughly thirty minutes.</p>

<p>The text of <i>A Sea Symphony</i> comes from <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Whitman_fc20.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>’s <i><a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaves_of_Grass_b1ad.html" title="Leaves of Grass">Leaves of Grass</a></i>. Though Whitman's poems were little known in England at the time, Vaughan Williams was attracted to them for their ability to transcend both <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanist</a> perspectives. Whitman’s use of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_verse.html" title="Free verse">free verse</a> was also beginning to make waves in the compositional world, where fluidity of structure was beginning to be more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. Vaughan Williams sets the following <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poem.html" title="Poem">poems</a> in <i>A Sea Symphony</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_%28music%29.html" title="Movement (music)">Movement</a> 1: “Song of the Exposition” and “Song for all Seas, all Ships"</li>
<li>Movement 2: "On the Beach at Night Alone"</li>

<p>Comparisons to Stanford, Parry, and Elgar, as in the Grove article, are expected. Not only were the four writing during the same era and in the same country, Vaughan Williams studied with both Stanford and Parry at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Music_2f9b.html" title="Royal College of Music">Royal College of Music</a>, and his preparations for composing <i>A Sea Symphony</i> included study of both Elgar’s <i><a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_Variations_1538.html" title="Enigma Variations">Enigma Variations</a></i> (1898-99) and his <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oratorio.html" title="Oratorio">oratorio</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dream_of_Gerontius_0340.html" title="The Dream of Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a></i> (1900).</p>
<p><i>A Sea Symphony</i> is among the best-known of a host of sea-related pieces being written around the same time in England, some of the most famous of which are Stanford’s <i>Songs of the Sea</i> (1904) and <i>Songs of the Fleet</i> (1910), Elgar’s <i>Sea Pictures</i> (1899), and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Bridge_6c88.html" title="Frank Bridge">Frank Bridge</a>’s <i>The Sea</i> (1910). <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Debussy_89de.html" title="Claude Debussy">Debussy</a>’s <i><a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Mer_6a35.html" title="La Mer">La Mer</a></i> (1905) may also have been influential in this apparent nautical obsession.</p>
<p>Vaughan Williams studied with <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Ravel_bc28.html" title="Maurice Ravel">Ravel</a> for three weeks in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1908. Though he worked chiefly on <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestration.html" title="Orchestration">orchestration</a>, this was to provide quite a contrast to the Germanic tradition handed down through Stanford and Parry at the RCM, and perhaps began to give Vaughan Williams a greater sense for colour and a freedom to move <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chord.html" title="Chord">chords</a> as block units. His partiality towards <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediant.html" title="Mediant">mediant</a> relationships, a unifying harmonic motive of <i>A Sea Symphony</i>, may have been somewhat liberated by these studies, and this harmonic relationship is now considered symptomatic of his style in general. <i>A Sea Symphony</i> also makes use of both <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentatonic.html" title="Pentatonic">pentatonic</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whole_tone_scale.html" title="Whole tone scale">whole tone scales</a>, now often considered idiomatic features of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_France_d334.html" title="Music of France">French music</a> of the period. Almost certainly, this music was in Vaughan Williams’ mind as he finished work on <i>A Sea Symphony</i> in 1908-1909, though it should be noted that Ravel paid him the great compliment of calling him “the only one of my students who does not write my music.”</p>

<p>Musically, <i>A Sea Symphony</i> contains two strong unifying <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motif_%28music%29.html" title="Motif (music)">motives</a>. The first is the harmonic motive of two chords (usually one major and one minor) whose roots are a third apart (usually a major third, though the Scherzo varies this by moving <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diatonic.html" title="Diatonic">diatonically</a> from G minor to B-flat, the relative major). The second is a melodic figure juxtaposing <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tuplet.html" title="Tuplet">duplets and triplets</a>.</p>

<p>The impact of <i>A Sea Symphony</i> manifests itself not only in the life of the composer (his first symphony and first work of such an immense scale), but also in the newfound support and appreciation of the English symphony and 20th century English music in general. Hugh Ottaway’s book, <i>Vaughan Williams Symphonies</i> presents the following observation in its introduction:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“The English symphony is almost entirely a twentieth-century creation. When in 1903 Vaughan Williams began to sketch the songs for chorus and orchestra that became A Sea Symphony, Elgar had not yet emerged as a symphonist. And, extraordinary though it may seem, Elgar’s First (1908) is the earliest symphony by an English composer in the permanent repertory. . . By the time Vaughan Williams had completed his Ninth [Symphony] – in 1958, a few months before his death at the age of 85 – the English symphony . . . had become a central figure of our musical revival. To say that Vaughan Williams played a major part in bringing this about is to state the obvious: throughout much of the period he was actively involved in English musical life, not only as a composer but as a teacher, conductor, organiser and, increasingly, advisor of young men.” (5)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the Grove article on Vaughan Williams, Ottaway and Frogley call the work:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“…a triumph of instinct over environment. The tone is optimistic, Whitman’s emphasis on the unity of being and the brotherhood of man comes through strongly, and the vitality of the best things in it has proved enduring. Whatever the indebtedness to <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_Parry_4efd.html" title="Hubert Parry">Parry</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Villiers_Stanford_da14.html" title="Charles Villiers Stanford">Stanford</a>, and in the finale to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Elgar_2c78.html" title="Edward Elgar">Elgar</a>, there is no mistaking the physical exhilaration or the visionary rapture.”</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../u/r/s/Ursula_Vaughan_Williams_0b4a.html" title="Ursula Vaughan Williams">Ursula Vaughan Williams</a>, in what has become the definitive biography of her husband Ralph Vaughan Williams, writes of his philosophy in a more general sense:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“…he was aware of the common aspirations of generations of ordinary men and women with whom he felt a deep, contemplative sympathy. And so there is in his work a fundamental tension between traditional concepts of belief and morality and a modern spiritual anguish which is also visionary.”</dd>
