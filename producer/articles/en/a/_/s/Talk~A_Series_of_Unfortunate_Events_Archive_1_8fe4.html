<h2><span class="mw-headline">General plot overview</span></h2>
<p>I cut the following out of the article in the interest of cleaning it up. I haven't read the plot summary below for fear of spoilers, so if someone else could clean it up that'd be great. I'm actually in favour of omitting plot summaries from most articles, including this one, so if no-one wants to work on it that's fine too. <a href="../../../r/p/a/User%7ERparle_26de.html" title="User:Rparle"></a>—<a href="../../../r/p/a/User%7ERparle_26de.html" title="User:Rparle">Rory</a></p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<dl>
<dd>The series revolves around the Baudelaire siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. In <i>The Bad Beginning</i>, they are told by Mr. Poe, a friend of the family, that their parents have been killed in a fire. They are sent to stay with a distant cousin, Count Olaf, who mistreats them and attempts to force Violet to marry him so he can steal their fortune. A kind neighbour by the name of Justice Strauss gives the children some help, but they are forced to defeat Olaf's plans primarily by their own efforts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The series then becomes somewhat formulaic: Mr Poe, who is in charge of their care, sends them to live with a succession of ever more distant relatives, where they are inevitably tracked down and once more troubled by the wearisome Count Olaf (usually in disguise) and his retinue of henchmen. In <i>The Reptile Room</i>, they go to live with their Uncle Monty, who is head of a herpetological society and keeps a large collection of snakes. Sadly, he is murdered by Olaf. <i>The Wide Window</i> sees them sent to live by Lake Lachrymose with Aunt Josephine, who is afraid of... everything! But Count Olaf returns and murders Josephine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Poe then sends them to <i>The Miserable Mill</i> - 'Lucky Smells' lumbermill - where they are sure Olaf won't reach them. But Count Olaf and two of his associates stir trouble again, and the Baudelaires get the blame. The owner of the lumbermill sends them off, and their next home is <i>The Austere Academy</i> - a boarding school run by a deranged principal called Nero. The Baudelaires make friends with the 'Quagmire Triplets', Isadora and Duncan (the third triplet, Quigley, is missing). However, Olaf is also eager to steal the Quagmire fortune, and the triplets are kidnapped - leaving a cryptic message, '<a href="../../../v/2E/f/V.F.D._267a.html" title="V.F.D.">V.F.D.</a>'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In <i>The Ersatz Elevator</i>, the Baudelaires move to Esme and Jerome Squalor's penthouse apartment. Jerome is kind but ineffectual; Esme is interested only in the latest fashions. When Olaf arrives, the Baudelaires try to rescue the Quagmires, but lose them again. Esme turns out to be evil and escapes with Count Olaf.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From this point, the series breaks away from the formula followed by the first six books as the Baudelaires set out in an attempt to find the Quagmires and find out the meaning of "V.F.D.", leading them into a gradually unfolding conspiracy, while fleeing authorities accusing them of murder.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Guardians</span></h2>
<p>I had earlier written that Uncle Monty was th'only exception the Baudelaires' long history of ineffectual guardians. Recently Hector found himself as an exception as well, but his skiddishness in the face of the village elders is basically a carbon copy of Jerome Squallor (who was afraid of confrontations, mostly with Esmé) and Charles (who didn't want to upset SIR). They all follow in the mold of Aunt Josephine who was, of course, afraid of everything. SIR and the elders themselves just weren't very nice, while Count O and Esmé themselves actively sought the Baudelaires' harm. Uncle Monty, on th'other hand, was kind and caring, and was even suspicious of Olaf's disguise, tho ultimately not for the right reasons. Still, he's th'only exception to the rule.--<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESignor_Giuseppe_0c0f.html" title="User:Signor Giuseppe">Signor Giuseppe</a> 20:42, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

But it could very much belong in the Wikicity, which is more KB type articles.

<p>If no one minds, I've deleted a couple of questions answered in PP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who was the man with no hair and the woman with no beard? Corrupt Judges</li>
<li>Who is the father of Kit Snickett's baby? Dewey Denuoument</li>

<p>The Baudelaire orphans father is in fact, Bertrand Baudelaire.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this article accurate?</span></h2>
<p>Maybe I'm grabing at smoke, but themes are very obvious, especially in the later books (The Hook-Handed Man actually says one outright in Book 11 and the Baudelaires' pleading with Count Olaf in Book 12 stresses it). This article, however, says there are no moral lessons in the book even though the underlying struggle is entirely about morals.</p>
<p>Also, most of the questions in the question section weren't even hinted at in the story. Sure, we could ask a million questions about connections that might be, but there's no hint of Mr. Poe being in VFD, for example. Also, in the section obove mine the editor says "Who is the father of Kit Snickett's baby? Dewey Denuoument." I don't recall that being said ever. -Anonymous reader, 10/22/05</p>
<p>It is never said outright, but Dewey Denouement's last word is "Kit", and Lemony says that he left "the woman he loved pregnant and distraught." They also share quite a few of the same lines. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_teh_H-Nut_12cc.html" title="User:Doug teh H-Nut">Doug teh H-Nut</a> 03:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is every chance in the world that this is wrong, but it's in the discussion page so what's it matter. I've actually said it above, and I'll say it again. Fiona and Fernald's parents are Beatrice and Lemony. Think about it -</p>
<ul>
<li>Beatrice and Lemony were together. Let's assume it was long enough to have kids. We'll say two, but it was more than likely three.</li>
<li>Beatrice and Lemony split up.</li>
<li>Beatrice marries Widdershins. Why? I have no idea.</li>
<li>Beatrice is killed. Widdershins says it was a manatee accident, though Snicket says it wasn't. Well, if it wasn't manatees, one of the other zillion things it could be is arson.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's not a lot of evidence, but there's nothing to prove it wrong...to my current knowledge. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_teh_H-Nut_12cc.html" title="User:Doug teh H-Nut">Doug teh H-Nut</a> 03:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And this isn't a place for specualation, it's a place for supported information (something that isn't very easy to find in this series, though). Personally, I think that (unless when he's speaking of his sister in Book 9 he actually says Kit, I need to check) Lemony is probably Kit Snicket's daughter. The Baudelaires could save her life or something while she's pregnant with him and that's why he loves them. Just thinkin'</dd>

<dd>I would say the <i>article</i> isn't for speculation, but the <i>discussion page</i> is well, for discussion. And it does have the least bit of speculation to back it up. (SPOILER) Did we have any evidence that Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire killed Olaf's parents with poison darts? No. Did we see it coming? No. And then it came in out of nowhere in that really awesome group of pages I think we refer to as "The Penultimate Peril, Chapter 12". Well, it had been built up to, but still. And while your theory could have a small bit of weight, but I believe Jacques and Lemony corresponded with letters calling each other "brother" in the LSUA. Besides, I have every reason to believe Lemony Snicket himself is the man that offered the Baudelaires a ride in TPP. And, then, there's the Snicket file. "In photographs and each public place, Snicket rarely shows his face." Baud parents, Jacques, Lemony. And then there's the song, which refers to his two siblings, and naturally they were just a tad older (Kit and Jacques are older than Lemony, and twins to boot.) Besides, V.F.D. likes sets of threes and everyone here knows it. So your theory's possible, but...not likely. Then again, neither is mine, really, but hey. This is Snicket we're dealing with. (Also, the idea of an unborn baby in danger is just a little dark for a so-called "children's" book, wouldn't you say? Darker than falling into saws, arson, and getting shot with a harpoon gun.) --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_teh_H-Nut_12cc.html" title="User:Doug teh H-Nut">Doug teh H-Nut</a> 12:43, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lemony Snicket seems to be against smoking in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Slippery_Slope_43bd.html" title="The Slippery Slope">The Slippery Slope</a>, so I doubt the man with the cigarette is Lemony. On an almost unrelated point, at the start of chapter 5(Who is Beatrice?) of the autobiography, there is a photo of a woman with the caption: Why was this actress replaced after only 3 performances. It then says that Lemony's fiance, who we know is Beatrice, was replaced by Esmé. Does this mean that the photo of her and similar on pages 29 &amp; 105 are Beatrice? <font style="color:#00BB55"><u><b>s</b>murray</u><font style="color:#00AA77"><u>in</u><font style="style"><u>chester</u><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup> <font style="color:#000000">17:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>

<dd>I'd say Lemony must be Kit and Jacques' brother, because in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vile_Village_a958.html" title="The Vile Village">The Vile Village</a> someone says "Jacques Snicket" and Klaus (?) replies "Isn't he the brother of the man who..." So they have a brother, who presumably is Lemony. This would also fit the sequential letters used by the Denouement triplets (D-E-F) with J-K-L for the Snicket triplets. <a href="../../../e/a/m/User%7EEamonnPKeane_209d.html" title="User:EamonnPKeane">EamonnPKeane</a> 20:45, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"The Recurring Themes"</span></h2>
<p>I thought I should run this past the Wikipedia ASUE community before I go editing 12 articles - would anybody mind if I changed "The Recurring Themes" headings on all the book articles to something else? I'm not sure what yet.... maybe just "Cover" or "Appearance" (better suggestions are welcome). I understand what's intended here, but "Recurring Themes" is misleading, as the "themes" covered aren't what would normally be understood by the term in the context of a series of novels; "themes" in this context would normally refer to the content of the text, and since each cover is different, the details don't really recur. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 16:36, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The sugar bowl (A Series of Unfortunate Events)</span></h2>
<p>Much as I hate to add to an already long list of ASUE articles, I think there might be an argument for a piece about the sugar bowl. It's appears to be a central theme, and some references make no sense without context. (Eg: "The main entryway has one bare light hanging from the ceiling, a stuffed lion's head nailed to the wall, and a bowl of apple cores on a small wooden table. This is noted to be the sugar bowl." from <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Olaf%27s_Castle_7379.html" title="Count Olaf's Castle">Count Olaf's Castle</a></p>

<dd>I was thinking of writing an article about it previously. The problem is that every single bowl that appears in the series will be listed as 'possible sugar bowls'. Still, the 'Vessel For <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaccharide.html" title="Disaccharide">Disaccharides</a>' probably does deserve an article. How about The sugar bowl (A Series of Unfortunate Events? <font style="color:#CC0000"><u><b>s</b>murray</u></font><font style="color:#DD0000"><u>in</u></font><font style="color:#EE0000"><u>chester</u></font><font style="color:#55BB22"><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Ho Ho Ho!</a>)</sup></font> 12:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that was why I headed this "The sugar bowl (A Series of Unfortunate Events)", but up until now, I had no idea what "Vessel For Disaccharides" referred to.... now I think Vessel For Disaccharides would be a better title.... we could link it to the entry on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_VFDs_fb09.html" title="List of VFDs">List of VFDs</a>, and point all other references to the sugar bowl to it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 12:55, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree there should be a sugar bowl article, but not that it should be called Vessel For Disaccharides - the title should be what the subject of the article is normally referred to as (probably The sugar bowl (A Series of Unfortunate Events)), since in the books it is <i>normally</i> referred to as the sugar bowl. Of course, that could change with the final instalment, but the article can be renamed when <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_the_Thirteenth_8e3d.html" title="Book the Thirteenth">Book the Thirteenth</a> comes out. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 13:18, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think Vessel For Disaccharides would be a good redirect, but it is only mentioned briefly, and as a title, would make the article seem more difficult and scientific than Sugar Bowl (ASOUE). And like CLW says, if Sugar Bowl is inadequate, we can move it. The other (nitpicky, I know) question is should it be Sugar Bowl or The Sugar Bowl? <font style="color:#CC0000"><u><b>s</b>murray</u></font><font style="color:#DD0000"><u>in</u></font><font style="color:#EE0000"><u>chester</u></font><font style="color:#55BB22"><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Ho Ho Ho!</a>)</sup></font> 17:16, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't Beatrice the Baudelaires' mother?

<p>I posted this on UnfortunateEvents.com a while ago. It's sums up all we know about whether Beautrice was the Baudelair's mother or not;</p>
<p><b>Beatrice IS Mrs. Baudelair</b></p>
<ul>
<li>They both died in a fire.</li>
<li>Both of them were married but not to Lemony Snicket.</li>
<li>That would be the connection between Snicket and Baudelair, seeing that Beatrice was the reason the series was started in the first place.</li>
<li>Mrs. Baudelaire could whistle Mozart's Symphony No. 14. Beatrice could do the same.</li>
<li>"The Hostile Hospital," when Klaus and Sunny have to descramble the anagrammatical patient names to find Violet, one of the names, "Carrie E. Abelabudite," could be rearranged to spell out "Beatrice Baudelaire."</li>
<li>Both Beatrice's last name and Mrs. Baudelair's first have not been confirmed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Beatrice IS NOT Mrs. Baudelair</b></p>
<ul>
<li>They firers that killed them were at different times of the day.</li>
<li>Whistling was a family characteristic, and possibly a Red Herring.</li>
<li>Another anagram from the hospital list translates to Red Herring.</li>
<li>Esme' mentioned that Beatrice stole the sugar bowl in front of the siblings twice, and yet none of them said anything along the lines of "...our mother...?" or "I can't see why our Mom would sit at a table with you in the first place, you <i>out</i>law!"</li>
<li>A passage in "The Grim Grotto," mentions "the Baudelaire parents" and "the woman [who Lemony Snicket] loved" as separate entities. --71.109.37.168 23:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Those of you who might receive HarperCollin's AuthorTracker would've gotten an April's Fools email today.

<p>I had a question on it, though. When 'Lemony Snicket' (Tim Curry) quotes, "...In fact the phrase, 'Physical Education,' like the phrases 'Frozen Fish,' 'Fashion Statement,' or 'Salad Bar,' takes one perfectly pleasant word and spoils everything by placing it alongside a distinctly unpleasent one," what do the initials being erased (TCB) under Lemony Snicket stand for, if anything?

<p>..between books one and 12 overall? Has anyone tracked it so I don't have to? Will post if I take the time to find out, but it seems to me that each individual book is never more than a couple of weeks in 'realtime' and the books are absolutely sequential, so the whole series must occur in substantially less than a year. Does that sound right to others? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 23:25, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you may have over estimated, as books 8-12 all take places in just days. I'm pretty sure a few other books took place only a few days time too. I've read how much time elapses article on a fansite that has closed now, but you can probably find another one somewhere if you really wanted it added to the article.-<a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacaman_ff05.html" title="User:Pacaman">Pacaman</a> 17:56, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
