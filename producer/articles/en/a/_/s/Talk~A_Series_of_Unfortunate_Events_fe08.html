<dl>
<dd>The series spans over at least two years, actually. Anyway, there have been many years of the dog in the last hundred years, so it doesn't exactly narrow it down. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmoocow_8224.html" title="User:Mrmoocow">Mrmoocow</a> 21:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is almost impossible to tell exactly when the series takes place. The clothes the characters wear and some of the technology (especially in the unauthorized autobiography) are 1920s yet Prufrock Prep has an advanced computer. In the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penultimate_Peril_20fd.html" title="Penultimate Peril">Penultimate Peril</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit_Snicket_95b7.html" title="Kit Snicket">Kit Snicket</a> quotes <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._20a6.html" title="Martin Luther King Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> from a speech he made in 1964. The play <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Forza_del_Destino_a841.html" title="La Forza del Destino">La Forza del Destino</a> was first performed in 1862. It may have gone on longer or have been re-performed.</p>
<p>One interesting fact is that the year of the dog was 2006 (one of them). That was when the entire series was finished and when Snicket made that interview with <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Adventures_d637.html" title="Disney Adventures">Disney Adventures</a>. I'm guessing that the series takes place in modern times.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My view is that the series doesn't take place in any specific time (or in any specific real place), so that Handler could bring in whatever technology he thought was appropriate to the specific plotline or joke.</dd>
<dd>I agree. I reckon it takes place in an alternate reality to our own. Think about it: it is home to a whole range of places that certainly do not exist in our world and has technology from all over the century. It can't be set in modern times (the styles of architecture, dress and technology are wrong) and it can't be set sooner (technology is too advanced).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's impossible, because Sunny is still only one in the final book, and only Klaus actually has his birthday during the duration of the series.</dd>

<p>Violet has her birthday in The Grim Grotto.</p>
<p>Also, I would estimate Sunny to be about two, as Beatrice is almost one. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunkyKong12345_c3bd.html" title="User:ChunkyKong12345">ChunkyKong12345</a> 02:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding Sunny's age: She was born less than two years before <i>The Reptile Room</i> (the Baudelaires think back in that book to what they were doing two years ago, and Sunny notes that she hadn't been born at the time, although the text could be read as indicating that Mrs. Baudelaire was pregnant with her). Since Sunny never had an obvious birthday in the series (likely so Handler didn't have to state her age, as that'd lead to all sorts of inconsistencies with her level of development), then by the end of <i>Chapter Fourteen</i> she definitely can't be four years old.</dd>

<p>What happened to the list of thirteens page? I thought I saw it recently. Could the "Other" Section on the template be further divided? The movie and video game seem too much of important and different things to be clumped up with a few things that probably would be better organized in a "V.F.D." section.

<dd>The List of thirteens recently came up on articles for deletion for the second time, and very few people came to its defense. It vanished shortly afterwards, so I've been removing any links I come across. Personally, I'm neutral as to whether the page should exist or not - I was convinced by the argument on the talk page to the effect that the use of 13 is a deliberate device in the series (I haven't read it), but I found the article itself to be lacking direction. I think it might be a good idea to incorporate examples of the theme somewhere in the main ASUE article, if it can be done well, and if it doesn't come to dominate an already overly inflated piece.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I copied the list, in anticipation its demise, and reproduce it here for editors' information. I should probably advise our less experienced editors that it would be a really bad idea to attempt to recreate the deleted article as was.</dd>

<p>The themes section seems kind of limited.</p>
<p>One theme that I've noticed is the gradual loss of clarity between good and evil. I think this could even be the most outstanding theme in the books... as the series progresses, right up to the very end, the Baudelaires increasingly doubt their beliefs about who and what is noble and who and what is wicked. They reflect more and more about the tradgedy they themselves have caused, and upon how there is always a bigger picture of what seemed terrible at first. It seems like there's a lot of almost explicit symbolism that nothing is either black or white, as the Baudelaires lose their innocence all the way up to the conclusion. Did anyone else notice this as a theme? 65.96.209.236 01:59, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did. I tried to add something about it, but it was deleted. Also, Lemony Snicket seems to have very little patience for charcters who see things in black and white and are unwilling to listen to other's points of veiw. (anon)</p>
<p>The theme of moral relativism is well represented now. I added a reference to Snicket's allusion to the biblical Fall. I found that scene at the end of chapter 12 in "The End" to be chilling. Snicket seems to use the snake and apple to punctuate his theme that survival may be the highest ethic. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonstew_f96e.html" title="User:Ronstew">Ronstew</a> 16:18, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a suggestion for all the entries in the Series of Unfortunate Events. All the books in the series contain tons of great literary allusions, such as the names of all the patients in the Hostile Hospital or castaways in The End, as well as catches of poetry, etc. However, I believe The End is the only entry that contains a comprehensive section of literaty allusions. Perhaps we should start to construct similar sections in the entries on the 12 other books. I will pitch in, maybe even start a couple sections in entries on the books I remember best, but I'm sure there are a lot that other allusions other people can provide that I forgot or didn't catch in the first place.</p>

<p>Of course many of Handler's themes are expressed in his choice of character and place names. But I think Literary Allusions deserve their own section in this article.

<p>It is important to remember that Lemony Snicket is not merely a pseudonym for Daniel Handler.

<dd>Writing down the plot of the books is original research, too, as you have to have read the books to verify it. It's no arcane secret that there are words and phrases that get repeated multiple times throughout each book. An interpretation of the significance of those motifs might be original research, but I don't believe that it would be original research merely to list them. <i>The End</i> manages it.</dd>

<p>I've never been able to figure out which these books should be considered as. To the best of my knowledge, they're unique in all literature. Do any other books have an essentially omniscient narrator with a clearly defined personality, background, and indirect role in the story, but who nevertheless never directly affects the plot? Penultimate Peril aside, that is, and I don't think that counts. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShay_Guy_deb3.html" title="User:Shay Guy">Shay Guy</a> 15:42, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>~Actually, in the study of literature, you consider the author as <i>always</i> being separate from the narrator. Even though the narrator is more fully fleshed out in these books (and no, it isn't unique in literature - Sheridan Le Fanu's In a Glass Darkly use a similar technique) it's still third person, since Snicket isn't one of the main characters. --Vampire Hermes 15th Jan.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure if the events of the books would have come about if Lemony had never existed, though; he knew many of the backstory characters in their youth, and he's the one who stole the sugar bowl (although that arguably only impacts on Esmé-related plots). I'd still call them third-person, though, as the books aren't about Lemony, he's just telling the story.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but he sometimes stop narrating to mention incidents from his life in first person. My point is, the series is nor first-person, neither third-person. It constantly switches, so it's both.--<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthologist_bfd6.html" title="User:Orthologist">Orthologist</a> 19:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that the movie section says this: "Also, Silberling is quite unhappy that the filming process took seven months instead of the seven weeks in which he claimed he could shoot the movie." This is taken from an external article that got its facts wrong. In the original interview, Silberling said it was a very taxing 7-month shoot for him, and that he's not sure he'll be on the second movie, because he'd rather make a more intimate movie that wouldn't take more than 7 weeks to shoot. He never said he would make ASOUE2 in 7 weeks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.70.12.179_7406.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.70.12.179">86.70.12.179</a> (talk) 10:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I think we should go through this in detail before we consider re-nominating this for featured article. Let's start with facts - steampunk? I don't understand the link. I've never heard the series associated with steampunk, nor did steampunk ever cross my mind while reading them. This is an excellent time to get a source about <i>the books</i> being steampunk, rather than making an assertion that the books are steampunk. Anyone have any ideas, or should we remove the reference? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not confident they are all that steampunk - or if they are, it's only in a very broad sense. It's more that they take place in an amalgamation of time periods without picking one over the other. Looking at the steampunk article, I guess that the books are <i>inspired by an era when steam power was widely used but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy</i>, but like I said, that seems an awfully broad definition that could fit probably just about every book set in a kind of penny-dreadful setting. 217.42.64.32 09:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There IS a source there, if you go to the genre section. I can get more for you if you like. Anyway; while reading the series, no, it didn't make me think 'this is a steam punk series' but thinking back on it, the series DOES fit the definition of steampunk. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmoocow_8224.html" title="User:Mrmoocow">Mrmoocow</a> 07:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The source looks rather subjective to me, and not at all comprehensive; I'm not sure an offhand mention of the series as an example of steampunk, on an <i>anime</i> site I've never heard of, really fits attribution guidelines. Not that I know much about them, but it's probably about the most obscure and unrelated source anyone could find. 217.42.64.32 09:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. I'm not sure an anime site is all that reliable regarding the genre of a textual book. Combine that with the point that, from my admittedly minimal research, only Wikipedia and these people are claiming as such, it seems more than a little fishy. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I admit that the source wasn't the best one to use. However, if you put '"Lemony Snicket" steampunk', or '"A Series of Unfortunate Events" steampunk' into Google, it is obvious that the series has been oft referred to as steampunk. Anyway, I wasn't the one who originally put the 'steampunk' in the article. Perhaps we should vote on the matter? <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmoocow_8224.html" title="User:Mrmoocow">Mrmoocow</a> 21:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not really worth voting on - either we have reliable sources that refer to it as steampunk - and my google search doesn't turn up much in that department - or we don't. Even if some <i>do</i> refer to it as steampunk, it's not the only type of book it is, nor is it the most obvious one, nor is it the most oft-cited one. At best, steampunk is worth a mention if we have the sources. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
