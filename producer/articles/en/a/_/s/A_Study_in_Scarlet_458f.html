<p>"<b>A Study in Scarlet</b>" is a <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective.html" title="Detective">detective</a> <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_fiction.html" title="Mystery fiction">mystery</a> <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">story</a> written by <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle_017d.html" title="Sir Arthur Conan Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and published in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>. It is significant as the first story to feature the character of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherlock_Holmes_4282.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, who would later go on to become one of the most famous and iconic literary detective characters, with long-lasting interest and appeal.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_Doyle_2e3b.html" title="Conan Doyle">Conan Doyle</a> wrote the novel at the age of 27. A general practice doctor in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southsea.html" title="Southsea">Southsea</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodical <i>London Society</i>. The story was originally titled <i>A Tangled Skein</i>, and was eventually published by Ward, Lock &amp; Co. in Beeton's Christmas Annual <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>, after many rejections. The author received £25 in return for the full rights (although Conan Doyle had pressed for a royalty instead). The novel was produced in book form in July <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, published by Ward, Lock &amp; Co. This book was illustrated by Arthur Conan Doyle's father, Charles Doyle. A second edition appeared the following year and contained illustrations by George Hutchinson, and J. B. Lippincott Co. published the first American edition in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>. Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.</p>
<p>The story, and its main character, attracted little public interest when it first appeared. Only ten copies of Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887 are known to exist now and they have considerable value. Although Doyle wrote fifty-six <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short stories</a> featuring Holmes, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> is one of only four full-length novels in the original canon.</p>
<p>The novel was followed by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sign_of_Four_dc5b.html" title="The Sign of Four">The Sign of Four</a></i>, published in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>.</p>

<p>The novel is split into two quite separate halves. The first is titled <i>Being a Reprint from the Reminiscences of John Watson, M.D., Late of the Army Medical Department</i>. This part is told in first person by Holmes' friend <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Watson_b11f.html" title="Dr. Watson">Doctor John H. Watson</a> and describes his introduction in 1881 to Sherlock Holmes through a mutual friend and the first mystery in which he followed Holmes' investigations. The mystery revolves around a corpse found at a derelict house in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brixton.html" title="Brixton">Brixton</a>, England with the word "RACHE" scrawled in blood on the wall beside the body.</p>
<p>Holmes firmly resolves to solve the case despite the fact that he won't be given any credit of it. For this purpose, he makes up a plan using a wedding ring that had been lost at the crime scene. After placing an ad in the newspaper, asking for the ring owner, Holmes is visited by an old woman who claims the ring. Holmes follows "her" (it turns out to be a man in disguise) but the disguised man manages to escape.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Holmes is visited by one of the police detectives assigned to the case, who claims that the case has been solved and the murderer is now jailed. After the detective finishes explaining how he solved the case, a second police detective (<a href="../../../i/n/s/Inspector_Lestrade_64d3.html" title="Inspector Lestrade">Lestrade</a>) arrives to announce that there has been a second murder - it is clear that the man the police have arrested is innocent. The police are now completely at a loss - both detectives have arrived at dead ends.</p>
<p>By way of reply, Holmes announces that he himself has solved the murder and will shortly arrest the killer. Pretending to be packing his bags for a journey, he asks the waiting cab driver to come and assist him with his luggage. As soon as the cab driver appears in his room, however, Holmes takes out his handcuffs and arrests the driver. Proudly he says, "Gentlemen... Let me introduce you to Mr Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Strangerson.".</p>

<p>The second half of the story is called <i>The Country of the Saints</i> and jumps to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States of America</a> and the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> community, and incorporating a highly-fictionalized depiction of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danites.html" title="Danites">Danites</a>, including an appearance by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> in a somewhat villainous context. It is told in a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_person.html" title="Third person">third person</a> narrative style, with an omniscient narrator, before returning in the last two chapters to Watson's account of Holmes' investigation, and then Holmes' own explanation of his solution. In these two chapters the relationship between the two halves of the novel becomes apparent. The motive for the crime is essentially one of lost love and revenge.</p>
<p>Doyle later apologized after a fashion to the Mormons for his lurid account of their sect as being steeped in kidnapping, murder and enslavement<a href="http://www.adherents.com/lit/article_Doyle.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/lit/article_Doyle.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Study_in_Scarlet_458f.html" title="Edit section: Plot holes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot holes</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is strange that the police apparently never questioned the owner of the Brixton house, where the first murder happened. The door was intact, so whoever murdered Drebber had to have a key, for which the owner would have been the obvious candidate. This would have led the police (or Holmes, who chose to ignore the clue as well) quickly on to the right track.</li>
<li>It also does not follow that Jefferson Hope shows no suspicion upon having his cab summoned to 221B Baker Street, after his earlier ploy of having sent a friend disguised as an old woman to the same address. It seems unlikely that he would have forgotten the address so quickly after having seen the advertisement about the gold ring in the paper on the previous day.</li>
<li>The book violates what would later become one of the cardinal rules of detective fiction and which provides much of the fun of reading such books - namely, that the author must provide enough prior clues to let an intelligent and perceptive reader solve the mystery for him/herself. There is no way whatsoever for a reader to do that here. The very first time that the reader hears the name "Jefferson Hope" is when Holmes produces him as the murderer. (The most the reader could know before is that somebody with the initials J.H. is somehow involved). Nor is there in the smallest prior hint that <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormons.html" title="Mormons">Mormons</a> are in any way involved. Certainly, nothing found in possession of the two murdered men gives any hint of their Mormon background - in fact, Doyle positively misleads the reader, since "<a href="../../../d/e/c/Decameron.html" title="Decameron">Decameron</a>" is anything but recommended reading material for <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saints_f81e.html" title="Latter Day Saints">Latter Day Saints</a>. In extenuation, it should be noted that these rules of the detective genre did not yet exist, and Doyle's book was among the pioneering works laying the very foundations of that genre.</li>
<li>The Avenging Angels who terrorize the Ferriers do indeed seem to have divine powers. At least they manage to deliver their daily warnings in a way that borders on the supernatural. Once they manage to place it in John's bedroom after he locks all the doors and windows, and another time he waits up outside his house all night for them, sees and hears nothing, and yet finds the warning painted on his front door. How the Angels manage to accomplish these and other feats is the greatest mystery of <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, one which goes unsolved.</li>
<li>The "duel by identical pills" device is both unnecessary to the plot and psychologically unconvincing. A man who had devoted his life to tracking down and avenging himself on two others would hardly be likely, once he has one of them in his power, to risk killing himself and leaving both of them alive and unharmed.</li>

<p>There are several minor inconsistencies in the story which are incompatible with later Sherlock Holmes stories. Dr Watson provides a short autobiography of himself at the start. In this he is invalided out of the army after being wounded in the shoulder in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Anglo-Afghan_War_2bc4.html" title="Second Anglo-Afghan War">Second Afghan War</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Maiwand_43fc.html" title="Battle of Maiwand">Battle of Maiwand</a>. In later stories, his wound has moved to his leg.</p>
<p>In this book, Holmes is presented as a single-minded person who has no interests whatsoever except for what directly serves his work as a detective, and who indeed actively tries to forget any irrelevant piece of knowledge which came inadvertently to his attention. While this works in the first book, it would have made Holmes an unutterably boring character had Doyle persisted in it for the rest of the series (which would then hardly have had the same amount of popularity).</p>
<p>In later books and stories Holmes is depicted, to the complete contrary, as a multifaceted intellectual with an intensive interest in and deep knowledge of numerous subjects having nothing to do with his detective work, such as music, art, philosophy and bee-keeping, and he keeps writing articles and monographs in numerous fields.</p>

<p>As the first Sherlock Holmes story published, it was fittingly the first one to be adapted to the screen. In 1914 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle authorized a <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_film.html" title="Silent film">silent film</a> be produced by <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._B._Samuelson_dc00.html" title="G. B. Samuelson">G. B. Samuelson</a>. Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who had never before (and evidently never after) worked as an actor. He was hired for his reseblance to Holmes as presented in the sketches originally published with the story. <a href="http://www.holmesonscreen.com/miscellanymain2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.holmesonscreen.com/miscellanymain2.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Unfortunately, as early silent films were made with film which itself was made with poor materials and film archiving was rare, this is now a <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_film.html" title="Lost film">lost film</a>. The success of this film allowed for a second version to be produced that same year by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Ford_1a30.html" title="Francis Ford">Francis Ford</a>, which has also been lost.</p>
<p>It has been adapted many times, although frequently only the portions of the first section of the book in which Holmes and Watson's relationship is established are used. The <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Howard_60ce.html" title="Ronald Howard">Ronald Howard</a>/<a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Marion-Crawford_769e.html" title="Howard Marion-Crawford">H.

The <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gielgud_0e68.html" title="John Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>/<a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Richardson_f3d0.html" title="Ralph Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a> radio series combined it with details from "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventure_of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton_674e.html" title="The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton">The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton</a>" to create its "<a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_story.html" title="Origin story">origin story</a>". The book has rarely been adapted in full, notable instances being in the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cushing_1e4b.html" title="Peter Cushing">Peter Cushing</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Stock_c64e.html" title="Nigel Stock">Nigel Stock</a> television series, as an episode of <i><a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_Radio_Mystery_Theater_b61f.html" title="CBS Radio Mystery Theater">CBS Radio Mystery Theater</a></i> and by <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Coules_4134.html" title="Bert Coules">Bert Coules</a> for the first project starring <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Merrison_0303.html" title="Clive Merrison">Clive Merrison</a> as Holmes and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Williams_8cfd.html" title="Michael Williams">Michael Williams</a> as Watson.
