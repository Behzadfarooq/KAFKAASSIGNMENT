<ul>
<li>The album cover of the soundtrack to 2001: A Space Odyssey is clearly visible in the record-shop scene of <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_%28film%29_0d45.html" title="A Clockwork Orange (film)">A Clockwork Orange</a></i>, another film directed by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Kubrick_762f.html" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyes_Wide_Shut_98e3.html" title="Eyes Wide Shut">Eyes Wide Shut</a></i> (the final film by Stanley Kubrick), an advertisement on the side of a building seen in the exterior New York sequences reads "BOWMAN". Also, Dr. Harford cancels an appointment with a patient named Kaminsky -- the name of one of the hibernating astronauts aboard <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_One_fb9c.html" title="Discovery One">Discovery One</a> in <i>2001.</i></li>
<li>In the final scene in the movie <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_%28film%29.html" title="Speed (film)">Speed</a></i> when the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapid_transit.html" title="Rapid transit">subway</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train.html" title="Train">train</a> burst out onto the street, the signage of a theater in the background indicates it is showing <i>"2001: A Space Odyssey"</i>.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>'s <i><a href="../../../2/0/0/200_Motels_8bee.html" title="200 Motels">200 Motels</a></i>, the monolith from the film can clearly be seen several times in a few different scenes. The most notable is when Motorhead's vacuum cleaner is going out of control before the finale, and there are several small explosions near the monolith.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lucas_cbb4.html" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>, known for creating homages to earlier films in his own films, stated in his DVD commentary to his most recent film <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</a></i>, that he made a homage to the <i>2001</i> Clavius Base. It is when the establishing shot of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28O-Q%29_b06e.html#Polis_Massa" title="List of Star Wars planets (O-Q)">Polis Massa</a> is seen. Polis Massa was specifically designed to be an asteroid base that looked very similar to the Clavius Base seen in <i>2001</i>. In fact, two people in space suits are shown in <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> in similar positions on the asteroid as the scene in <i>2001</i>. The opening shot of <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/Star_Wars_Episode_IV%7E_A_New_Hope_1317.html" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i> may have been not so much an affectionate "homage" to <i>2001</i> as a copy of Kubrick's striking visual of a gigantic spaceship moving overhead; others that much the same thing occurred with the hangar bay of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, which is visually quite similar to the Space Station's docking bay. Lucas did the same in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Wars_Episode_I%7E_The_Phantom_Menace_412d.html" title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></i> where an object in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watto.html" title="Watto">Watto</a>'s salvage yard was the pod used on the Discovery in the film <i>2010</i>.</li>
<li>A good portion of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Motion_Picture_f47d.html" title="Star Trek: The Motion Picture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></i> is inspired by <i>2001</i>, including:
<ul>
<li>Opening overture over a black screen (replaced by an animated star field in the director's edition)</li>
<li>The slow entry of the new <i>Enterprise</i> without any dialogue is similar to the first shots of the space stations in <i>2001</i>.</li>
<li>The <i>Enterprise'</i>s journey through the V'Ger cloud is very similar to some of the stargate sequence.</li>
<li>Mr. Spock's "V'ger Spacewalk" contains similar shots, camera angles and lighting effects to that of Bowman's stargate voyage.</li>
<li>When Mr. Spock floats back to the <i>Enterprise</i> after the mind-meld, the camera angle used is similar to that used in <i>2001</i> when Bowman catches Poole with the pod claws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Star_Trek%7E_First_Contact_51ac.html" title="Star Trek: First Contact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></i> it is revealed that the magnetic-constrictor-locks that hold the ship's deflector dish in place are designated "AE-35" units after the device in 2001.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Airplane_II%7E_The_Sequel_b99b.html" title="Airplane II: The Sequel">Airplane II: The Sequel</a></i> spoofs many parts of <i>2001</i> including a computer named "ROK" that tries to kill the crew. Several lines of dialogue are also taken from <i>2001</i>.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_World%2C_Part_I_9197.html" title="History of the World, Part I">History of the World, Part I</a></i>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Brooks_f0d0.html" title="Mel Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>' satire of the history of humanity, begins with a scene similar to <i>2001</i>, except that the ape-men are more self-absorbed. The movie <i>Simon</i>, starring <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Arkin_c6f0.html" title="Alan Arkin">Alan Arkin</a> also mimicked the "ape using a bone as a weapon" sequence.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Bye_Lenin%21_9814.html" title="Good Bye Lenin!">Good Bye Lenin!</a></i>, Denis, the friend of Alex, made a wedding movie in which there is a scene where a flying flowers bouquet changes to a cake in an explicit homage to the famous match cut in The Dawn of Man.</li>
<li>In the 1996 blockbuster movie <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28film%29_cbd9.html" title="Independence Day (film)">Independence Day</a></i>, as <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Goldblum_7bc1.html" title="Jeff Goldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a>'s character David Levinson activates his laptop computer on board the alien craft, it welcomes him with a very HAL-like "Good morning, Dave" and has a HAL themed desktop wallpaper.</li>
<li>In the beginning of <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaolin_Soccer_f516.html" title="Shaolin Soccer">Shaolin Soccer</a></i>, an alignment of the Sun, Moon, Earth, and a Buddhist monk's head is seen.</li>
<li>In the beginning of the movie <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Travesty_9cff.html" title="2001: A Space Travesty">2001: A Space Travesty</a></i> (An obvious play on the true title), there is a scene with a howling ape-man and a monolith in which the narrator says "And then God came, and He spoke," as a hand of God appears on the top of the screen. God says "Shut up, you stupid monkey." and pushes the monolith over, crushing the ape-man.</li>
<li>In the movie <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch-22_%28film%29.html" title="Catch-22 (film)">Catch-22</a></i>, the music from the opening strains of <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> are played when Capt. John Yossarian sees an amazingly attractive Italian woman walk past. The film was made in 1970, two years after 2001.</li>
<li>In the penultimate scene of <i><a href="../../../i/r/r/Irr%C3%A9versible.html" title="Irréversible">Irréversible</a></i> (2002) a poster for the film with the Starchild and the tag line, "The Ultimate Trip" appears. A miniature of the space pod also appears in the background during this scene.</li>
<li>The 2005 film based on the book <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_%28film%29_1a6f.html" title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></i> contains a lengthy sequence that includes a clip of the scene of the <i>apes discovering the monolith sequence</i> from the beginning of <i>2001</i> and features music used in the movie (Also Sprach Zarathustra). In spoof, the monolith is replaced by a Wonka Bar teleported though the television. The eerie, distinctive wailing music from the film is audible, and later on a recreation of the beginning of the "Moon-Watcher discovers tools" sequence is seen.</li>
<li>The film <i><a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoolander.html" title="Zoolander">Zoolander</a></i> features a segment in which two of the main characters reenact the scene in which the monolith is discovered by the ape men, with the monolith replaced by a computer. During this sequence, Richard Strauss' <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> is played.</li>
<li>The movie <i><a href="../../../c/l/u/Clueless.html" title="Clueless">Clueless</a></i> features a scene in which a cell phone is shown in a similar way as the monolith is, also featuring "Also Sprach Zarathustra"</li>
<li>The opening of Ken Shapiro's cult favorite <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Groove_Tube_bb5f.html" title="The Groove Tube">The Groove Tube</a></i> begins with an almost spot-on recreation of the "Dawn of Man" sequence (<i>almost</i>...one of the apes is playing <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solitaire.html" title="Solitaire">solitaire</a> with animal-skin "playing cards"). The monolith is revealed to be a 1960s-vintage console TV set, "Move On Up" by <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_Mayfield_a0ca.html" title="Curtis Mayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a> replaces the Ligeti-style chorale on the soundtrack, one of the apes invents music by banging a bone on the ground, and another accidentally rubs two sticks together and discovers fire!</li>
<li>Woody Allen's <i><a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeper_%28film%29.html" title="Sleeper (film)">Sleeper</a></i> contains a scene which spoofs HAL in which the evil computer voice is that of Douglas Rain.</li>
<li>One of the first scenes of the film <i>Werner: Beinhart</i> contains a parody on the "Dawn of Man" sequence, instead of using the bone as a tool, the apes find a bottle of beer.</li>
<li>A short, light-hearted stop-motion animation spoof of the behavior of some of the film's characters (as well as some slapstick) has been created using <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">lego</a> blocks and figures, called <i>ONE: A Space Odyssey</i> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353835/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353835/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>In the cult 1976 <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Roeg_c452.html" title="Nicolas Roeg">Nicolas Roeg</a> film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Who_Fell_to_Earth_23e4.html" title="The Man Who Fell to Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>, Newton (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>) knocks a glass off the table, in last moments of the film, just prior to his apparent complete resignation to his fate. Compare with glass knocked off table by Bowman in 2001 just prior to rebirth as star child.</li>
<li>The 2006 film <i><a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Feet_ce15.html" title="Happy Feet">Happy Feet</a></i> features a penguin with a voice similar to that of HAL telling Mumble, "This is heaven, Dave...It's wherever you want it to be."</li>
<li>The opening sequence of the 1999 sequel <i><a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Story_2_3a0a.html" title="Toy Story 2">Toy Story 2</a></i> shows Buzz Lightyear stepping on magnetically suspended bottlecap-like structures as he approaches "The Source of Zurg's Power" (a double-A battery). With each step, one of the chords of Also Sprach Zarathusatra is played... before the magnetic field is disabled and he drops like a stone.</li>

<li><a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Space_Homer_d5d8.html" title="Deep Space Homer">Deep Space Homer</a> contains many references to 2001, not the least of which the famous potato chip-eating scene and the portrayal of Homer as the 2001 Star Child at the close of the episode. In this episode there is also an <a href="../../../i/t/c/Itchy_%26_Scratchy_52ec.html" title="Itchy &amp; Scratchy">Itchy &amp; Scratchy</a> episode entiltled <i>Scar Trek: The next Laceration</i> in which Itchy rides in a space pod that looks exactly like the ones in 2001.</li>

<li><a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_Homerdrive_6044.html" title="Maximum Homerdrive">Maximum Homerdrive</a> where Homer is driving a truck with a built-in device that would normally get him out of trouble. However when he was approaching the Convoy it said, "I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red!" Instead of trying to stop Homer, however, the box simply jettisoned itself out the truck's sunroof.</li>
<li>In the segment <i>House of Whacks</i> in the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treehouse_of_Horror_XII_94cd.html" title="Treehouse of Horror XII">Treehouse of Horror XII</a> episode the Simpson house is fitted with a HAL-like computer (red fish-eye lens included), voiced by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierce_Brosnan_541b.html" title="Pierce Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a>, that falls in love with Marge and tries to murder Homer, a la <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon_Seed_023a.html" title="Demon Seed">Demon Seed</a>.</li>

<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_Spin-Off_Showcase_387d.html" title="The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase">The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase</a> shows the Lovematic-Grandpa machine sings <i>Daisy Daisy</i> in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing, as HAL does.</li>

Bender Sings "Daisy Bell' to the Planet Express Ship. Later on, Fry, Leela and Bender meet in the shower in order to plot against the Planet Express ship. While they talk, we see the ship's POV as she looks at their lips. In a humorous twist however, she says, "If only I could read lips". Leela then deactivates the ship's brain in a manner similar to Dave Bowman's deactivation of HAL.</li>

"oo, "ow", "all", "alk", etc. One such cartoon, "ee", was a reference to the "Dawn of Man" sequence with a chimpanzee acting as Moon Walker and even touching the monolith like him. Another, "alk", used the stargate sequence with the deistic voice repeating "alk", "Ow" spoofed the monolith and astronaut Dave Bowman in space (he stubs his toe on the monolith right as the kettledrum solo begins and yells "OW" several times just before it crumbles down to reveal "ow"), and "all" was a vague reference to the last scene of the movie, only with elderly Dave Bowman at the table eating dinner, not in his bed. <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_One_Television_7e0a.html" title="Square One Television">Square One Television</a>, another <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Workshop_98f5.html" title="Sesame Workshop">Sesame Workshop</a> production, had a live action skit spoofing HAL9000, who sings ad nauseam, "Row Row Row Your Boat" until one of the astronauts gives him an unfinishable program; This skit was designed to teach the concept of infinity.

Basically, if you're driving down the street, as you get near the pump you really start to feel it - sense of foreboding. Then when you're in credit-card-swiping range, it hits you: my God, the humanity!"</li>

<li>In the Super Nintendo game <a href="../../../s/e/a/E.V.O.%7E_Search_for_Eden_855d.html" title="E.V.O.: Search for Eden">E.V.O.: Search for Eden</a>, the monolith appears after each chapter to signify the evolution of the species into a form closer to human. The final evolution in the game allows the player to become human.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../c/a/l/Raptor%7E_Call_of_the_Shadows_99fc.html" title="Raptor: Call of the Shadows">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a>, published in 1994 by <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apogee_Software_04e9.html" title="Apogee Software">Apogee Software</a>, there is a small reference to the scene with the black monolith, found on the Moon. The dig site with the monolith can be seen in Wave 5 of the “Outer regions” mission.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> developer <a href="../../../h/a/l/HAL_Laboratory%2C_Inc._db42.html" title="HAL Laboratory, Inc.">HAL Laboratory, Inc.</a> took its name from the HAL 9000 computer.</li>

<li>The 1980s Sierra computer game <i>SpaceQuest III</i> starts in an interstellar garbage scow containing many spacecraft from sci-fi movies, and TV shows. For example there is the Jupiter 2 from Lost in Space, the ACME rocket from The Road Runner Show and many others including a pod from <i>2001</i>.

Another character in the game is also named <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Fox_%28Metal_Gear%29_4bc0.html" title="Gray Fox (Metal Gear)">Frank</a> and is David's former war buddy from the previous games in the same series.</li>

The first game in the <i>Xenosaga</i> series, <i>Episode I</i> begins when humanity first discovers the Zohar.</li>

<li>In the 1997 PSX game <i>Monster Farm</i> (<i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Rancher_5aac.html" title="Monster Rancher">Monster Rancher</a></i> in NA and UK), the monster breed "Monol" is physical ly identical to the monolith in "2001: A Space Odyssey".</li>
