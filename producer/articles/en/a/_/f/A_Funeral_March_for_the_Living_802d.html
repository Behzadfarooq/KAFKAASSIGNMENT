<p>There is a funeral with a guy crying how such a good person could die with everyone all depressed when the man remembers how that his eyes shined with confidence that he had broken one of his favorite things, punched, got into fights with him, the man in the funeral box had always smiled. As they bury him the man thinks about how the dead guy had such a beautiful smile. Meanwhile a bunch of men are running saying that this is for their own sake. The three runaway men are climbing on a cliff but they get hit by a boulder and they get knocked out.</p>
<p>One of the men wake but and they are being held by Naruto in the middle of his training. He is apparently training with Rock Lee, who is wearing iron shoes and gloves. Tsunade is in her office telling Anko that she did a good job but Anko steals Tsunade's last stick dumpling while Shizune is scared while Tsunade just glares at Anko, who gives the 5th a sheepish smile. She comments on how Konoha's Guy and Lee are jogging by and they stop at the inn for somes dumplings are the best. Guy rushes in saying: Mission accomplished! I beat those pirates on the channel with my fists of love! If they fell like they've received justice, my flow of tears is worth it! Tsunade balefully looks at him while Guy is hysterically looking.</p>
<p>Shizune looks in the mission book and tells Tsuande that a client has an S-Rank mission and that he specifically requested Guy to do this job. Tsunade tells him to get Team Guy while Guy boasts that if his students are going, this mission should be no problem. Tsunade then tells him that Uzumaki Naruto is also going.</p>
<p>Guy explodes while he exhales a bunch of air with his blown up head: Why can't it just be my wonderful students!? Why?! Answer me, Tsunade-sama!</p>
<p>Tsunade: I just came up with it.</p>
<p>Guy just stands in front of his desk while Tsunade explains that the three people Naruto rescues came from the Katabami gold mine with a mission to ask for. A family had appeared and claimed that they were there to protect the village, but instead, they chose to take control of it. The villagers were also murdered for no reason and that their mission is to take care of the new Family. Naruto asks why she sent for him to go on such an easy mission. Tsunade gets her face red asking him does he know who he is talking to. Naruto says that he has to look for Sasuke and that he has to train as well. Tsunade grabs his neck collar demanding that he is a Genin and that he doesn't get to pick his own missions and asks whether or not he wants to go to the academy. She proclaims Neji team leader who says that he doesn't want to but he understands. Naruto breaks hold of Neji's grip and says that he is going back to training. Tenten apologizes for their lack of manners. Tsunade grabs her chair and throws it out the window calling them damned brats.</p>
<p>Naruto grumbles about the mission and sees Sakura and asks her how is she doing and she had apparently healed a bird's wing and is setting her free. Sakura heals the bird and lets it go. Naruto says that it is amazing but Sakura says that the poor thing is that the bird got driven away from its friends. Rock Lee rushes in asking Naruto if he didn't interrupt them but Naruto says that he had already did. Lee vows not to be pessimistic and tells Sakura good day and Lee grabs him saying that he has something to talk to him about. At the ramen bar Lee asks them if he went on that mission in the land of the waves. Naruto remembers Zabuza and asks if he is one of the Seven Sword members and Lee also mentions Kisame, who Naruto had also met. He asks who else was with Kisame and Naruto mentions Itachi and that Sasuke is after Itachi. Lee says that they may be able to find some clue about Sasuke at the gold mine but Naruto skeptically says that this information came from Guy. Lee tells him that he should not be disrespectful and that he can count on the info 100%. Naruto jumps over the gate and tells them that they are late.</p>
<p>They head out on their journey and Rock Lee and Naruto have a competition about smashing rocks and dodging them. They continue on their journey and Lee remembers how that he could run while sleeping and smells curry. Lee apparently predicts the path by saying where the Restaurant "Curry of Life" is. Lee remembers about how good the curry was and flashbacks. A boy watches them jog along in their sleep and sees Lee lagging behind and still sees them running all of this time. Lee has fallen by the door from exhaustion and still sleeping. The owner wonders if he is hungry and feeds him in his sleep. She says how troublesome this is because he won't wake up and keeps on feeding him. The owner's son, Karashi, helps mix some curry and feed Lee. This time the curry is extremely hot and burns his mouth. The flashback ends. Everyone watches Lee because the said curry is swampishly black and bubbling. He tastes it as everyone's heart beats. Lee swallows it but his face turns red hot and quickly rushes it down his throat. Since Lee claims the curry to be so good, everyone decides to give it a try. They all turn red, screaming from disgust and fall over from the pain. Lee asks the owner of Karashi's whereabouts. The owner responds by saying that Karashi had joined the Kurosuki Family, which the Konoha Team had been ordered to eliminate. Tenten finishes all of her water and Lee vows to bring Karashi back to the owner.</p>
<p>Neji tells the three miners that they should stay here but all of a sudden the youngest miner has disappeared and Tenten is afraid that if they get the miner, he will be killed. We see the miner running with Team Guy running behind. Someone at the top of a pile of rocks says that they will hold another funeral.</p>

<ul>
<li>When Naruto, Neji, Tenten, and Lee leave the room, Tsunade gets fustrated and throws a chair out the window. Later on, When Lee pulls Naruto away from Sakura, two ninja are shown carrying the same chair Tsunade threw earlier. Both the chair and one of the ninjas are badly bruised and bleeding.</li>
<li>Karashi throws into his curry pot a living <a href="../../../s/o/f/Softshell_turtle.html" title="Softshell turtle">softshell turtle</a>, which is said to be a high-energy food in the Chinese (and so Japanese) culture. Apparently a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamander.html" title="Salamander">salamander</a>, another kind of energy booster, was also added, since its lizard-like limbs were seen protruding from the curry in a later scene.</li>
