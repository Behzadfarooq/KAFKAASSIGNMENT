<p>After a malfunction with the regular materialization program, Odd and Yumi end up in each other's bodies. Even worse, their atoms start to split after a while. The gang has to go to Lyoko and fix the problem before Odd and Yumi disappear forever, but it's not easy when XANA tries to stop them.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The episode starts with <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Stern_94b0.html" title="Ulrich Stern">Ulrich</a> in the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanner_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7363.html" title="Scanner (Code Lyoko)">Scanner</a> Room. He's flipping a <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">Euro</a> coin to see who will come out of the Scanners first. It lands on heads and he picks <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a>. <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a> comes out instead. He tells her that he lost, only to have her respond with Odd's voice wondering how exactly he lost. Odd and <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a> emerge from the other Scanners. Yumi is in Odd's body and just as confused. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie</a> figures out that the materialization program has a bug and switched their minds. Jeremie says that he can fix the program if he works at it overnight. Aelita stays to help, as well. Yumi is rather annoyed that she has to spend the night in a guy's body. Odd's not as concerned, which isn't too surprising, and points out that he has a great body. He says that Yumi's body, on the other hand, has a bad itch near her bra strap. She angrily warns him not to take it off.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Park" title="Kadic Junior High School">Park</a>, the two exchange what activities they're supposed to do until tomorrow. The basic jist of it is is eat, bathe and sleep. Yumi asks if Odd knows how to eat with <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chopsticks.html" title="Chopsticks">chopsticks</a>. He says he can if they look like <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork.html" title="Fork">forks</a>; in others words, no. She warns him not to do anything stupid while in her body. He makes a comment about his body being under warranty. He then mentions that he was supposed to break up with both Claire Girard and Magali De Vasseur that day.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Courtyard" title="Kadic Junior High School">Quad</a>, Odd suggests that Ulrich practice speaking to Yumi as long as he has her body. Odd even offers to give him pointers. Yumi isn't around, of course. Ulrich would really rather not. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a> happens to come by and asks why Ulrich doesn't just dump Yumi, who she describes as a string bean. Odd makes fun of her saying that at least she, as in Yumi, doesn't have the brain of a vegetable. He thens says they were made for each other and snuggles up against Ulrich (by pitching his voice high, to sound female). Sissi acts disgusted with the whole scene and storms off. Unfortunately for the pair, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Tamiya_Diop" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Tamiya</a> is nearby with her video camcorder and captures the moment for the paper.</p>
<p>In Odd's room, Yumi is looking around for something of Odd's. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Kiwi" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Kiwi</a> is barking incessantly, clearly aware that she isn't actually Odd. She finds the object, which is a small green pouch with a child's fork inside of it, and leaves the room. Kiwi runs after her but slams into the door in a rather comedic fashion (a "boing" sound is heard). Magali shows up just as Yumi leaves the room. She tells him (her) that she knows about Claire, Odd's other girlfriend, and slaps Yumi across her left cheek. Claire comes by right after and says she knows about Magali. She slaps Yumi across her other cheek. Sissi comes by once the two have left and tells Yumi to have Ulrich call her once he's done with that string bean. She doesn't get the meaning, however.</p>
<p>Back in the Quad, Ulrich and Yumi are walking to where Odd is. She mentions Sissi's comment and Ulrich just plays dumb. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Milly_Solovieff" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Milly</a> and Tamiya come by asking to interview Ulrich for the gossip column. He refuses and continues walking, still playing dumb about the whole situation. They meet up with Odd and Yumi hands over the pouch she got for him. He says he's had it ever since he was small.</p>
<p>At Yumi's house, Odd is trying, unsuccessfully, to eat sushi. Unable to get the hang of chopsticks, he remembers the pouch and Yumi's warning not to use it unless it's an emergency. He takes out and opens it. Turns out it's a pocket fork. The confused stares of Yumi's family forces him to act as though he's not hungry. As he leaves, he says something in Chinese. When Yumi's father questions the odd behaviour, Hiroki assumes it's love that is causing it. Upstairs, Odd's hand begins to fade away as he's washing his hands. It returns to normal fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Back in Odd's room, Yumi has finally gotten Kiwi to be quiet by petting him gently. The same fading effect happens to her hand. Ulrich assures her that everything will get sorted out tomorrow. As she tries to take off her shoe, Ulrich tries to warn her. It comes too late, though, as the smell from his feet hits her full-force. Ulrich just laughs, saying the smell is more powerful than a Lazer Arrow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jeremie has found the bug in the program. Aelita is seen sleeping in a corner.</p>
<p>The next day, the same fading effect happens to both Odd and Yumi. It's worse this time, covering both arms up to the elbow. At the school, Jeremie tells the gang, minus Odd, that they'll sort everything out at lunchtime. Odd shows up and stuns the gang. Instead of Yumi's normal attire, he wearing a green sweater with orange sleeves, some kind of stocking-like gloves and a cap with kitty ears to top it all off. The pants are the same color but a different material. Odd greets them with Chinese. Yumi points out the fact that he's using Chinese in her presence and isn't happy about the change in clothes, either. Odd defends the attire, saying that they're Yumi's clothes. He seems to think it's a rather cool look. Yumi tries to get him to go home and change before someone sees him. Milly and Tamiya come by with a camera again and ruin any chance of that. They say that the image will go great with the headline "Yumi Ishiyama: Transformed by the Power of Love." Yumi wants to know what's up with the "love" business, but Odd says he can't explain and needs to head for math class.</p>
<p>In the math class, there's a pop quiz on linear equations. This is ninth grade math, and clearly beyond Odd's level of comprehension. Odd is worrined about this and says so to himself. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_primary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_9961.html#William_DUnbar" title="List of primary characters in Code Lyoko">William</a>, who is next to him, asks if he always talks to himself. He just says it's a split personality thing. He attributes the clothes to that as well. The fading effect happens again and he makes an excuse to get out of class.</p>
<p>In the Quad, Jeremie figures that the bugged materialization is causing their atoms to separate. They'll eventually disintigrate entirely.</p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">Factory</a>, he sends the whole gang to <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a> so Aelita can fix the program. Even on Lyoko, their bodies are switched. Odd has trouble walking with the high heels of Yumi's geisha costume at first. While running, it also appears Yumi has trouble controlling Odd's cat tail as well. When they reach the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">Tower</a>, Aelita enters and starts work on the program. Outside, three <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Kankrelats" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Kankrelats</a> come to attack the others as the fading effect gets even worse. Odd tries to use his Lazer Arrows, but is in the wrong body to do so. Yumi is also seen trying to dodge the lasers. She succeeds, but not too gracefully considering her predicament. All three are forced to take cover. Ulrich springs out and uses his Super Sprint to start eliminating the Kankrelats. Odd shows Yumi how to use Lazer Arrows and is almost shot as a result.</p>
<p>In the Tower, Aelita finds that inhibitors are blocking the program and need to be turned off. Since the codes are unavailable, they need to go to <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Carthage" title="Lyoko">Sector Five</a> to do it. Ulrich takes care of the last of the Kankrelats as Aelita leaves the Tower. They reach the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Transport_orb" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Transport Orb</a> with ease, but a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Megatanks" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Megatank</a> quietly rolls up just before the orb arrives. Ulrich and the Megatank destroy each other just before the others are wisked away.</p>
<p>On Earth, Ulrich curses his stupidity for letting the Megatank get him like that. Jeremie switches the Holosphere (officially named by Jeremie) to the Sector Five map. When the gang arrives in the Arena, Yumi gets to feel Odd's motion sickness when entering the region. Odd, on the other hand, feels nothing in Yumi's body. As they head for the timer switch, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Creeperes" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Creepers</a> can be seen crawling on the walls, ceilings and even on the bottom of the platform the two Lyokons are running on. When the reach the end, they find the switch across the room with no visible path to it. Creepers interrupt their examination. Odd gets to try out Yumi's Tessen Fans here when Creepers show up, but doesn't do too well with it. Yumi catches it and uses it herself, but misses as well. A shot from the Creeper knocks Odd off the edge, but instead of falling, he floats away slowly. He even does some fake swimming for fun. Yumi continues to take out Creepers. With time running out, Odd propels himself toward the switch using the platform as leverage. He almost makes it, but falls short by a few feet. Yumi uses a Lazer Arrow to push him the rest of the way. He hits the switch and deactivates the timer.</p>
<p>With the switch off, the door to the Elevator opens. Odd gets to the door first. Yumi is about to follow when yet another Creeper attacks. Yumi tries to jump to the door with Aelita, but a Creeper shot disrupts their flight path. Aelita is stuck in midair with Yumi several feet away and Odd at the door. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Scyphozoa" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Scyphozoa</a> shows up for another go at Aelita's memories. Odd is able to use the Tessen Fan correctly this time and separates the Scyphozoa from Aelita, but he has to duck the fan when it returns. Yumi uses a few Lazer Arrows to scare it away. With the threat gone, Odd and Yumi use various kick tradeoffs to get Aelita to the door. The two are left in midair as Aelita heads for the Carthage Interface on the Celestial Dome. She manages to unlock the program in time for Jeremie to fix it. Odd and Yumi are devirtualized just as it's fixed.</p>
<p>Back on Earth, both Odd and Yumi are back in their own bodies.</p>
<p>At the school, Odd figures that he didn't make too much of a mess while in Yumi's body. Ulrich asks if he ever told her what happened with the two of them. There's really no need to, as Yumi is seen walking up with the school paper. Ulrich says he can't give Odd any pointers on what to say to Yumi. She's understandably mad about the picture in the paper. The episode ends with her angrily screaming Odd's name and one can only speculate Odd's punishment.</p>
