<p>I just made this page after noticing it didn't exist from the band's Wikipedia site. I apologize for my horrendous job with the album table.&#160;:P I don't have album art for it yet because the cover from the band's webpage "could not be displayed because it contained errors."

<p>I just checked the lyrics, and I don't see any references to Fight Club. This seems like just someone's interpetation. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 16:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cant take the kid from the fight, cant take the fight from the kid. Obviously references to fight club, but yes i see your point that its not a straight forward reference, and I also think that it seems as though the whole song is a reference, but yes i suppose it depends on how you interperate it. I would sign this, but i dont know how...</p>
<p>This song isn't about Fight Club (despite the 'take the kid from the fight' line). It's about Ryan's father's battle(s) with alcoholism. - FLM</p>
<p>Any references or links to articles to back this up? Has Ryan actually stated this at any point? It does seem to make some sense, but I would like to see some proof or evidence. - Sion Black</p>
<p>Yes, he has, in many an interview. You can look up any interview about his writing process and find it. He even commented that his father liked the album, but Ryan wasn't sure if he knew some songs were about him. Also, he's stated that he feels uncomfortable when some of the fans sing the lyrics without knowing what the song is about because it's very personal to him. So, in short, yes to your second question, but I don't have any actual links to put on here. - FLM</p>
<p>Camisado is by no means an "obvious" reference to <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Club_eaff.html" title="Fight Club">Fight Club</a> since it only mentions an ambigious fight and a hospital too specifically described to be paralled with the narrator's, aside from the truth of the personal content of the song. <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Palahniuk_0b15.html" title="Chuck Palahniuk">Palahniuk</a> doesn't have quite enough books for every song by Panic! at the Disco to reference them. (Besides, if there was a song about Fight Club, it would definitely be There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet...) <a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESybil_Gray_b5af.html" title="User:Sybil Gray">Sybil Gray</a> 00:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jon didn't play bass on the record brendon did. in fact jon didnt become associated with panic until about a year after the album's release. i dont have an account so will some one else please edit that part of the article?</p>
<p>thats what i was wondering too. why did someone put that there if he wasn't associated with them when they recorded the album. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessOfHearts_0158.html" title="User:PrincessOfHearts">PrincessOfHearts</a> 21:30, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Who cares if it qualifies for PA label? It's a totally voluntary practice, and there have been thousands of albums in the label's history that may have qualified for it, but never got it. This is a useless addition to the article.</p>
