<p><i><b>A Feast for Crows</b></i> is the fourth of seven planned novels in <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_3dd5.html" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i>, an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_fantasy.html" title="Epic fantasy">epic fantasy</a> series by American author <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_R._R._Martin_adce.html" title="George R. R. Martin">George R. R. Martin</a>. The novel was first published on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, with a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> edition following on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">November 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>; however, it appeared ahead of the publication date in several UK bookshops. Its publication was preceded by a novella named <i>Arms of the Kraken</i>, which collected the first four Iron Islands chapters together. <i>Arms of the Kraken</i> was published in the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> edition of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Dragon (magazine)">Dragon Magazine</a>. Another <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapbook.html" title="Chapbook">chapbook</a> featuring three <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daenerys_Targaryen_6fe6.html" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</a> chapters was published for BookExpo 2005, although these chapters were subsequently moved into the fifth volume, <i><a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Dance_with_Dragons_d1d6.html" title="A Dance with Dragons">A Dance with Dragons</a></i>.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Storm_of_Swords_6809.html" title="A Storm of Swords">A Storm of Swords</a></i>, <i>A Feast for Crows</i> was nominated for the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Award_a4a2.html" title="Hugo Award">Hugo Award</a> for Best Novel, one of the two most prestigious awards in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> publishing, although it lost out the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> ballot to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Charles_Wilson_7df5.html" title="Robert Charles Wilson">Robert Charles Wilson</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_%28novel%29.html" title="Spin (novel)">Spin</a></i>. <i>A Feast for Crows</i> was also the first novel in the sequence to debut at the top of the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> bestseller list, a feat among fantasy writers only previously achieved by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Eddings_f67a.html" title="David Eddings">David Eddings</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jordan_3ca0.html" title="Robert Jordan">Robert Jordan</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Gaiman_bd49.html" title="Neil Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>.</p>
<p>Due to complexities that arose during the writing process, <i>A Feast for Crows</i> only includes some of the POV characters from the past novels, as well as some new characters who appear only briefly. The remaining characters will return in <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>, the fifth book.</p>

<p>In the city of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strongholds_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_8e3e.html#King.27s_Landing" title="Strongholds of A Song of Ice and Fire">King's Landing</a>, the funeral of Tywin Lannister is held. To Cersei's distaste, Lord <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Tyrell_c0a2.html#Mace" title="House Tyrell">Mace Tyrell</a> tries to use the occasion to put himself forward for the position of Hand of the King and get one of his retainers from Highgarden installed on the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organizations_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_e679.html#The_Small_Council" title="Organizations in A Song of Ice and Fire">Small Council</a>.

Kevan says he will accept only if Cersei steps down as Regent and returns to Casterly Rock as Tywin's heir. Cersei furiously refuses him and Kevan leaves to help his son Lancel rule his new castle of Darry in the Riverlands. Eventually, she names the biddable Harys Swyft her Hand and fills the rest of the Small Council with her minions, including Gyles Rosby as Master of Coin, the sellsail Aurane Waters as Commander of the Royal Fleet, and the disgraced ex-Maester <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_b543.html#Qyburn" title="Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire">Qyburn</a> as Master of Whisperers.</p>

Gilly cries throughout the journey, and Aemon reveals that she has Mance's son with her, while her own baby has stayed behind at the Wall. In Braavos, Aemon's health takes a turn for the worse and they miss the ship that will take them south. Dareon makes money singing about the Wall, but constantly spends it on wine and prostitutes, leaving the group stranded. Dareon also hears rumours in the city of a three-headed <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#Dragons" title="Westeros">dragon</a> in Meereen. After Sam violently confronts Dareon, he meets a <a href="../../../a/c/r/Across_the_narrow_sea.html#The_Summer_Islands" title="Across the narrow sea">Summer Islander</a> trader who saw <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daenerys_Targaryen_6fe6.html" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a>'s dragons in <a href="../../../a/c/r/Across_the_narrow_sea.html#Qarth" title="Across the narrow sea">Qarth</a>. Aemon comes to believe that Daenerys fulfills the prophecy of the Prince Who Was Promised, reasoning that dragons are <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermaphrodite.html" title="Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodites</a>. He resolves to travel to <a href="../../../g/h/i/Ghis.html#Meereen" title="Ghis">Meereen</a>, and the Summer Islanders agree to take them south to Oldtown as part of the journey. At sea, Aemon's health finally fails and he dies. His last instructions to Sam are to tell the maesters of the Citadel what has happened and make them understand they must send aid to Daenerys. Gilly and Sam become lovers along the way.</p>
<p>In the Free City of Braavos, Arya Stark finds her way to the House of Black and White, a temple to the Many-Faced God. There Arya is inducted into the ranks of novices of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Cities_%28A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire%29_48bc.html#The_Guild_of_the_Faceless_Men" title="Free Cities (A Song of Ice and Fire)">Faceless Men</a>. Arya learns that the Faceless Men are not simply a band of skilled <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_killing.html" title="Contract killing">assassins</a>, they are a religious sect dating back to long before the Doom of <a href="../../../a/c/r/Across_the_narrow_sea.html#Valyria" title="Across the narrow sea">Valyria</a>. They consider their assassinations to be holy sacraments to their <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_deity.html" title="Death deity">god of death</a>. As Faceless Men must have no true identity, Arya assumes the role of 'Cat of the Canals' and becomes a familiar sight on the streets of the city. However, her old identity occasionally slips through. She hides her sword Needle rather than discarding it and later kills Dareon for forsaking his vows. The priests of the House of Black and White strike her blind by some means, but it is unclear whether this is part of her training or punishment for her transgressions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_b543.html#Brienne_of_Tarth" title="Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire">Brienne of Tarth</a> continues her quest to find Sansa. She is found by Podrick Payne, Tyrion's former squire, and she agrees to let him accompany her. They pass north through the town of Duskendale, encountering the Tyrell army under Lord Randyll Tarly (Sam's father) along the way, where they are joined by an old acquaintance of Brienne, Ser Hyle Hunt. Brienne's explorations take her along Crackclaw Point, where she kills several of the now-scattered <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organizations_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_e679.html#The_Brave_Companions" title="Organizations in A Song of Ice and Fire">Bloody Mummers</a>, and to a septry in the estuary of the River Trident. The Elder Brother of the septry tells her that he found the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_b543.html#Sandor_Clegane" title="Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire">Hound</a> dying under a tree and learned that he had been with Arya Stark, who had fled towards the coast. Brienne's pursuit takes her to Maidenpool and Saltpans, but she can find no sign of Arya. Her group runs across the remnants of the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_Without_Banners_a186.html" title="Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood Without Banners</a>, who take her captive. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_b543.html#Thoros_of_Myr" title="Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire">Thoros of Myr</a> tells her that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_b543.html#Beric_Dondarrion" title="Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire">Beric Dondarrion</a> died, giving up his borrowed life to save another. They take her to the undead Catelyn Stark, whom they name 'Lady Stoneheart'. Catelyn believes that Brienne has betrayed her by allowing Jaime to go free without returning with her daughters. She orders her, Podrick, and Hunt hanged. As they dangle on the noose, "She screamed a word."</p>

Cersei has the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#The_Seven" title="Westeros">High Septon</a> murdered so that he can be replaced by someone loyal to her, but the newcomer turns out to be a zealous <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinet.html" title="Martinet">martinet</a> who has the support of the war-refugees that now throng in the city.

One of the lords, whom Littlefinger bribed ahead of time, breaks custom by baring steel during the meeting. Littlefinger uses the insult to turn the tables on the lords, who eventually allow him to remain Lord Protector of little Lord Robert Arryn for the next year. Afterwards, Littlefinger discusses the deception with Sansa (who is posing as his bastard daughter, Alayne Stone) and is impressed at how quickly she picks up on the subtleties of his scheme. He reveals to her that if something should happen to little Robert, the Eyrie and the name Arryn will pass to Harry Hardyng, a distant nephew of the house, and if Harry and Sansa were to wed, that would give her an army with which to reclaim Winterfell. Whilst Sansa thinks on this, the weather is worsening, a sure sign that winter is almost upon the Seven Kingdoms, and the household of the Eyrie move to the Gates of the Moon at the base of the mountain the Eyrie rests on. During the move Sansa befriends Mya Stone, one of the late King Robert Baratheon's bastard daughters. Sansa also becomes a new mother figure for sickly Robert Arryn.</p>
<p>Jaime departs King's Landing to help end the siege of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strongholds_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_8e3e.html#Riverrun" title="Strongholds of A Song of Ice and Fire">Riverrun</a>, where the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Frey_31b6.html" title="House Frey">Frey</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Lannister_cee8.html" title="House Lannister">Lannister</a> besiegers are still defied by Lord Edmure Tully's uncle and castellan, <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Tully_c211.html#Brynden" title="House Tully">Brynden</a> the 'Blackfish'. Jaime has the captive Edmure brought down from <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strongholds_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_8e3e.html#The_Twins" title="Strongholds of A Song of Ice and Fire">The Twins</a> and promises not to harm him and to allow the smallfolk of the castle to remain if Brynden surrenders. After a lengthy siege, in which Edmure is made to stand on a gibbet in a failed attempt by the Freys at a threat, Brynden refuses Jaime's terms of surrender. Jaime cuts Edmure down and negotiates a surrender with him, as he is the true lord of the castle. Edmure is returned to Riverrun, but delays his surrender for half a day, slipping his uncle out one of Riverrun's water gates, past the Lannister siege. Furious, Jaime has Edmure sent under heavy guard to Casterly Rock. <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Frey_31b6.html#Emmon" title="House Frey">Emmon Frey</a> takes his appointed place as Lord of Riverrun. Shortly after the siege has ended, snowflakes start falling across the Riverlands. Winter has come. Jaime realises that with the fire and slaughter of the war, there will be no time for a last harvest. The Seven Kingdoms will suffer harshly in what is to come.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#The_Iron_Islands" title="Westeros">ironborn</a> strike hard along the coast of the Reach, conquering the Shield Islands and virtually blockading the mouth of the Honeywine and the route into Oldtown. Furious, <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Tyrell_c0a2.html#Margaery" title="House Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</a> and her brother <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Tyrell_c0a2.html#Loras" title="House Tyrell">Loras</a> ask Cersei for aid, but Cersei is reluctant to give it. She gives permission for Lord Redwyne to take his fleet home and destroy the ironborn, but only once Dragonstone is taken. Loras leads an assault on the castle and takes it, but is reported grievously injured in the process. Margaery's protestations vex Cersei, causing her to doubt her future role as Tommen's wife. She conceives a plan to ruin Margaery by framing her to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#The_Seven" title="Westeros">Faith</a> for sleeping with one of Cersei's guardsmen. Unfortunately the plan backfires when the new High Septon has the guardsman scourged to ensure the truth of the matter, and he confesses about Cersei's many impropieties as well. The Faith arrests both Cersei and Margaery. Kevan Lannister is recalled to take over as Regent and Hand. Cersei's summons for Jaime to return and defend her go unanswered. Mace Tyrell lifts the siege of Storm's End barely weeks after it began to race back to the capital and learn the fate of his daughter, whilst Randyll Tarly marches on the city from the north. Meanwhile, Aurane Waters absconds with the newly-rebuilt royal fleet.</p>
<p>Sam's ship reaches Oldtown, barely evading the ironborn reavers. They learn that the ironborn have raided and seized territories on the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strongholds_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_8e3e.html#The_Arbor" title="Strongholds of A Song of Ice and Fire">Arbor</a> and failed an attempt to burn the city harbour of Oldtown. Sam goes to the Citadel, but is intercepted by Archmaester Marwyn. Marwyn reveals that the other archmaesters will not be impressed or moved by Sam's revelations about Daenerys. When Sam asks how Marwyn knows that he was coming, Marwyn reveals that the Citadel has some of the ancient Valyrian obsidian candles, through which they could see things from afar. Marwyn states that nearly two centuries ago the maesters helped kill the last of the dragons to rid the world of magic forever, but now it is returning. Marwyn departs immediately for Slaver's Bay, telling Sam to study hard and fast, for the Wall will need his services. Sam is left in the company of two students, Alleras the Sphinx and a boy named Pate.</p>

The moot is deadlocked between the three until Euron reveals his plan to seize control of Daenerys's dragons through the use of magic and so rule Westeros. The moot crowns Euron king, and Asha disappears with her ship northwards. Aeron, who considers Euron ungodly, also leaves to gain popular support against him.</p>
<p>Euron launches an ambitious campaign against the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html#The_Reach" title="Westeros">Reach</a>, sending ships under his brother Victarion to conquer the Shield Islands and raid the coast. Initial appetites for plunder are sated by the raids in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html" title="Westeros">Westeros</a>, however, and support for Euron's plan for a trip <a href="../../../a/c/r/Across_the_narrow_sea.html" title="Across the narrow sea">across the narrow sea</a> dwindles, as does his hold over the ironmen. He realises that he must remain and consolidate his control. Victarion agrees to go to <a href="../../../g/h/i/Ghis.html" title="Ghis">Slaver's Bay</a> and deliver Euron's marriage proposal to Daenerys. Victarion, who hates Euron for sleeping with his wife, whom he then felt obligated to secretly <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor_killing.html" title="Honor killing">honor kill</a>, decides to return the favor and court Daenerys for himself.</p>

<p>The novel was published five years and two months after the previous volume in the series, <i>A Storm of Swords</i>. This was due to a series of problems that arose during the writing of the novel. George R. R. Martin originally planned for the fourth book to be called <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> with the story picking up five years after the events of <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (primarily to advance the ages of the younger characters). However, during the writing process it was discovered that this was leading to an overreliance on flashbacks to fill in the gap. After twelve months or so of working on the book, Martin decided to abandon much of what had previously been written and start again, this time picking up immediately after the end of <i>A Storm of Swords</i>. He announced this decision, along with the new title <i>A Feast for Crows</i>, at the World Science Fiction Convention in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">1 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> <a href="http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2001/09/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2001/09/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. He also announced that <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> would now be the fifth book in the sequence.</p>
<p>The reason for the subsequent delays were that the novel grew too long and the format changed from the previous book, with the introduction of short-lived POV characters who only had one or two chapters apiece. Martin also wrote a 250-page prologue to the novel which he then scrapped and scattered throughout the novel. Finally, when the novel was nearing completion his publishers realised it was significantly longer than <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and requested it be split in half for publication. After initially considering publishing it as 'Part 1' and 'Part 2', Martin's friend and fellow author <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Abraham_%28author%29_579c.html" title="Daniel Abraham (author)">Daniel Abraham</a> suggested splitting it by POV and location instead, which Martin agreed with. Thus <i>A Feast for Crows</i> only contains the POV characters from the South of the Seven Kingdoms and the Iron Islands. The characters in the North, in the Free Cities and in Meereen (including fan-favourites Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen) will return in the fifth book. The split of the novel also meant that the series would be seven rather than six books long. <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> remains the title of the fifth book.</p>
<p>Martin supplied a note at the end of <i>A Feast for Crows</i> explaining the reason for the split and promising that <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> would follow with the missing POV characters 'next year'. However, subsequently Martin embarked on a four-month signing tour in the US, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> at the request of his publishers and lost that time in writing the novel, which is now expected some time in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>.</p>

<p>Bakkalon, the Pale Child, is one of the Gods worshipped mostly by soldiers at the House of Black and White. This god appeared already in Martin's 1975 story <i>And Seven Times Never Kill Man</i> (where he is worshipped by a religious sect called <i>Steel Angels</i>), as well as in some other stories of the same era.</p>
<p>In Oldtown, mention is made that Maester Rigney believes that time is a wheel. This could possibly allude to fantasy author <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jordan_3ca0.html" title="Robert Jordan">Robert Jordan</a> and his popular series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wheel_of_Time_a73a.html" title="The Wheel of Time">The Wheel of Time</a></i>, as Jordan's true name is James Rigney. Another character, the southern noble Lord Trebor Jordayne of the Tor, is also an allusion to Jordan, <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tor_Books_2afd.html" title="Tor Books">Tor Books</a> being Jordan's best-known publisher, and the name Trebor itself being an anagram of Robert.</p>
<p>In the Chapter "Cat of the Canals" a reference is made to a story about the "Lord of the Woeful Countance," which is believed to be a reference to Don Quixote.</p>
