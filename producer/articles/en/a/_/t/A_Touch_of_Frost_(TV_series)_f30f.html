<p>Frost has a cavalier approach to the rules, thinking nothing for example of breaking into a suspect's property without a warrant. Neither is he above planting evidence to arrest a criminal who would otherwise get away with the crime. Frost can also be rude and aggressive to almost anyone, including innocent subordinates. He has a tendency to become emotionally involved in his cases, which Mullet considers unprofessional. However, there is usually someone to guide him back into line before he goes too far, and he does produce the goods. He has a good reputation among his colleagues because, when he is not overwrought about a distressing case, he is approachable and sympathetic, and it is clear that many of the younger detectives seen in the series look up to him as a role model.</p>
<p>Many also regard him as a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero.html" title="Hero">hero</a> because he was once shot while on duty, for which he was awarded the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cross_4a7c.html" title="George Cross">George Cross</a>, however Frost himself is modest about this, regarding himself as unworthy of the honour. The reality is that he was depressed and drunk at the time and approached the armed man out of recklessness, not caring whether he lived or died. Nonetheless, the incident made him the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Constable_7f69.html" title="Chief Constable">Chief Constable</a>'s blue eyed boy, and this protects him from being fired or retired by Superintendent Mullet. Frost's wife dies in the first episode, leaving him to cope with life on his own, which he finds difficult, throwing himself into his work instead, and living mainly on police canteen sandwiches and takeaways.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Touch_of_Frost_%28TV_series%29_f30f.html" title="Edit section: Setting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Setting</span></h2>
<p>The series is set in the fictional town of Denton, which from geographical references in the series sometimes appears to be in or near <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxfordshire.html" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, more precisely in the upper Thames Valley, or (infrequently) at a non-descript northern location. There are at least ten places in the UK named Denton, including one in Oxfordshire, though the town in the series is not directly identified with any of them.</p>
<p>Early episodes include references to nearby places such as Oxford and Reading, briefing-room meetings held in front of maps showing the recognizable shape of Swindon displaying the M4 and A417 and (in one case) the actual name "Swindon" clearly visible. This, together with locations that are in the general area, collectively point to the original (unstated) location of "Denton" being <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon.html" title="Swindon">Swindon</a> in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiltshire.html" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>.</p>
<p>In later episodes the program makers may have changed tack or forgotten this; one recent episode clearly shows a map of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading</a> in the briefing room - another, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maidenhead.html" title="Maidenhead">Maidenhead</a>. The general impression remains one of the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Valley_Police_650c.html" title="Thames Valley Police">Thames Valley</a> force. In one episode, a postcode with a DN prefix (which in real life would apply to the area around <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>) was shown to exist within the Denton area, but this was subsequently acknowledged to be a production error. Various individual location scenes have been identified by sharp-eyed viewers as shot in North London, Leeds, Oxford, Reading, Swindon, Devizes, Bracknell, Bristol and Birmingham.</p>

<p>Unlike most TV detectives, Frost does not have a single regular sidekick, and indeed some of his sidekicks are seen in only one or two episodes. There are, however, a number of regular supporting characters who are frequently seen and often promoted to a "sidekick" role:</p>
<ul>
<li>DS George Toolan (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lyons_%28actor%29_7c40.html" title="John Lyons (actor)">John Lyons</a>), Jack's long-time friend and colleague, with whom he shares an office. George is about the same age as Jack, but a rank lower. He is more cautious. He appears (in some capacity) in most episodes.</li>
<li>WPC Hazel Wallace (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline_Harker_2400.html" title="Caroline Harker">Caroline Harker</a>) is a young, happy-go-lucky uniformed officer. At the end of the third series she moved to CID, and though she ceased to be a regular she continued to make guest appearances in later series, and was promoted to detective sergeant.</li>
<li>DC Clive Barnard (<a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Bardock_4af9.html" title="Matt Bardock">Matt Bardock</a>), nephew of the Chief Constable. Most people believe he has only got into CID through his family connections, but Frost sees beyond that and takes Barnard under his wing. Later promoted to DS, but killed off in a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> episode.</li>
<li>DS Terry Reid (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Glenister_08da.html" title="Robert Glenister">Robert Glenister</a>). A tough London detective, he has often been in trouble in the past for his extreme methods, though he has mellowed by the time we see him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other regular characters include nosey newspaper journalist Sandy Longford (<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Stewart_d338.html" title="Bill Stewart">Bill Stewart</a>), who is always pestering Frost for information on his latest case, and sometimes has some useful information of his own, and police archivist Ernie Trigg (David Jason's real-life brother <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_White_%28actor%29_bf85.html" title="Arthur White (actor)">Arthur White</a>).</p>

<p>Only one new episode was produced during <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. As announced in various television guides, but with little publicity as of yet, there are three new episodes currently being produced. One of these new episodes aired on ITV1 in the autumn of 2006, called Endangered Species. It was mentioned in a few TV listings magazines that the other two episodes will be shown over the festive period 2006/2007, but they did not. <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> currently has no plans to show any new Frost programming but only repeats.</p>
<p>Repeats can currently be seen on <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV3_ef4a.html" title="ITV3">ITV3</a>.</p>
<p>The series is based on the novels of <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._D._Wingfield_ef49.html" title="R. D. Wingfield">R. D. Wingfield</a>:</p>
