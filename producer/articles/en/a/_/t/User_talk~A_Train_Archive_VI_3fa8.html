<p>Gentlemen, I just got home from work and I'm making dinner. I'm going out for the evening shortly, so don't expect too many more replies from me tonight.</p>
<p>At Imdaking's request, I'm going to look into the RfC. I will put 100% effort at being detached and impartial as I look it over, but judging from previous experience with Lucky 6:9 and Bishonen, I do not expect to find anything amiss. I have had no interactions with Paul Klenk before, but I know Lucky 6:9 and Bishonen to be fair-minded and generally outstanding users.</p>
<p>As I said, I will put aside any pre-conceived notions that I have and will look into the matter. If I find that Paul Klenk, Bishonen or Lucky 6:9 have acted improperly, I will say so at the RfC. If I find that Imdaking has acted improperly, I won't do anything, as I am loathe to step on another admin's authority in any matter. I hope this is agreeable to both of you. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 23:55, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I just re-read Imdaking's request a little more carefully, and I realized that a fair portion of his complaint centers around the "gayness" of Paul Klenk. I guess I'm at fault here for assuming a slightly higher baseline of maturity. Sorry, Imdaking, you're on your own on this one. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 00:10, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your kind attention, and don't feel too bad about "stepping into a pile" of this person's immaturity. He has been dropping them all over the place. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> 00:21, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ditto that, Fernando. I believe that I've acted within policy, but if I've done anything improper, please know that it was unintentional and that I appreciate your bringing it up in the interest of fairness. Thanks for the kind words, BTW! Have a wonderful night. - Lucky 6.9 00:27, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fernando: I'm not sure why Imdaking has contacted you, but if you have had some dealing with him and you think that you can communicate with him, that would be very helpful. He's going to be back after his 48 "wikibreak" no matter what happens in the meantime, but the question is, will it be for the better or worse. I personally do not want to see things escalate through RFC/RFM/RFAr. I've been through one before with the AFAr for Netoholic and would rather not go through that again. Instead, I would much rather see Imdaking editing as a productive editor without any copyright violations. If you could talk to him and explain why some of the things that he has done has violated Wikipedia policy, that would be greatly appreciated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Imdaking's suggestion of some sort of cabal, I've never had any dealings with Paul Klenk before yesterday. I've corresponding with Lucky 6.9 (we are both in the <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSC_81d7.html" title="WP:WPSC">Southern California WikiProject</a>, and were dealing with the very problematic editor <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonald20_630c.html" title="User:Ronald20">User:Ronald20</a> together), but we had never talked about Imdaking before yesterday.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I ran into Imdaking independantly and discovered that almost all of the images that he has uploaded other than company logos were tagged with {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairuse_cee7.html" title="Template:Fairuse">Fairuse</a>}}, but didn't fit the criteria for <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, and so I've been reporting some of them to <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">Copyright violations</a> (only about a third, so that are many more to report). Because of that, I've been threatened, insulted, cursed, and had my signature modified by Imdaking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just take a look at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#User:Imdaking" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">WP:AN/I#User:Imdaking</a>, and look at some of his recent edits as User:69.229.17.94, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AImdaking&amp;diff=23065632&amp;oldid=22951447" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AImdaking&amp;diff=23065632&amp;oldid=22951447" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LILVOKA&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23065912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LILVOKA&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23065912" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, where it is obvious that he is unrepentant.

<dd>Hey there Marg. I probably have archived whatever comment I had since then, as my talk page tends to fill up rather quickly. Basically what I said was that if NeoPop Realism is so important, why don't we write a whole article on NeoPopRealism? Find me some references in books or magazines or websites and I'll help you write the article. The problem with the Nadia Russ page right now is that it's really vain and not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> at all. If we want to claim that NeoPopRealism is so important, we need references to back it up, OK? Let me know when you find something we can use. I'm posting this comment on my talk page as well, but I'm also watching your talk page here, so we can continue this conversation wherever you want. Cheers, <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 19:25, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Marg, the other problem that I'm noticing as I look at the article again is that the only references we have are Nadia Russ' website. We need other, third-party references for this thing if you want it to conform to Wikipedia guidlines and be taken seriously. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 19:31, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While one editor saw the section and did not vote, I removed the section, since you had given me permission -I "voted" for him, in proxy (that was my idea, not yours, etc.) -and notified him in his talk.</p>
<p>The other fellow did vote to remove -and voted on a few additional things.</p>
<p>Like I said, Uncle Ed was my role model in how to negotiate disputes instead of mere spinnig of the wheels, like willy on wheels, and Big Willy, whoever <i>they</i> are, lol ha ha, and I hope I am a good understudy of Uncle Ed -things are moving along right well. Pretty soon, we can count votes and close the vote and open the page to editing.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks. It's nice to know that I haven't gone completely off the rails. Yeah...relistings...I thought about just deleting them. Given how many people look at AfD, I've previously thought that if <i>none</i> of them opted to object to deletion then that was good enough. Now that it's me with the delete button, I see things a bit differently. I also haven't taken any heat for doing so, despite asking people to tell me if they thought I was wrong. I did notice Android79 deleting some with a single participator today though, and I trust his judgement certainly. For some reason, since becoming an admin, my userpage has taken quite a bit of vandalism from one anon, and I really can't work out why. I suppose I deleted their page or something!</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a question actually. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_%28record_producer%29_bb07.html" title="Jack Douglas (record producer)">Jack Douglas (record producer)</a> was (originally) created as a copypaste move from <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a>, obviously a no-no. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a> was then edited into a dab. This is <i>exactly</i> the situation that <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves</a> says can't be easily fixed. However, I was wondering why the following could not be done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete both</li>
<li>Restore <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a> to before the dab</li>
<li>Move it to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_%28record_producer%29_bb07.html" title="Jack Douglas (record producer)">Jack Douglas (record producer)</a></li>
<li>Delete <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a> again</li>
<li>Restore only the edits after the copypaste move</li>
</ol>
<p>That would seem to preserve authorship and separate histories, in exactly the form that a proper move would originally have them. Is there a gap in my understanding? In fact, Bearcat has found another way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_%28record_producer%29_bb07.html" title="Jack Douglas (record producer)">Jack Douglas (record producer)</a></li>
<li>Revert <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a> to before the dab</li>
<li>Move it</li>
<li>Remake the dab at <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Is one of these routes righter than the other? Are both wrong? If not, does the example in <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves</a> need changing? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 18:53, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. That's a good question. I'd say both methods are kosher with GDFL requirements, but I'm no expert. If I remember right, <a href="../../../k/m/c/User%7EKmccoy_af23.html" title="User:Kmccoy">User:Kmccoy</a> is the go-to guy on stuff of that nature.</dd>

<dd>As for the AfD stuff, I totally understand where you're coming from. Having the ability and responsibility makes everything feel different, doesn't it? It can be unsettling at first. Hell, I've been an admin for 3 weeks and its still unsettling to me sometimes. I just try to be as transparent as possible, and it looks like you do, too. Keep it up, man.

Hi Fernando, thanks for taking a stab at this. On the proposed decision talk page (and on the original RfAr page) I have said that I look forward to others minding User:Cool Cat. You've asked that Karl and I take a step back per the proposed decision and I feel this is a good idea — but that it is incomplete. The proposed decision also prohibits User:Cool Cat from <i>editing any articles related or referring to Turks, Kurds, or Armenians for a period of 3 months</i> and places him on probation for a year, and I would ask that you suggest to him that he, too, accept the proposed decision pending the close of the case (which I expect to be rather soon). User:Cool Cat has a very long history of controversial editing of such articles. The proposed decision also states that other editors and administrators should take the lead in monitoring User:Cool Cat; I would ask you to monitor us <i>all</i> as your time permits and take what you feel is appropriate action. Thanks. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_b624.html" title="User:Davenbelle">Davenbelle</a> 02:15, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Davenbelle, thanks for your note. I understand your concern, but keep in mind that I was not acting as Administrator Fernando Rizo in this case, as I was wearing my Mediation Cabalist hat. I will keep an eye on the situation, but my role as a mediator (however brief) will probably create a conflict of interest if I intervene as an admin in the future. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 02:24, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Understood. I am confident that any review of User:Cool Cat's editing by reasonable people will tend to find biased edits. Sadly, there are not many people willing to confront problem editors. I again request that you ask <i>all parties</i> to this case to cease all editing that is likely to arouse the ire of the other participants; User:Cool Cat needs to let the Kurds live.

<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BEGINS HERE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>'s first published novel was <i>Diary of a Drug Fiend</i>. The book was originally published in London in 1922. Although written over seventy-five years ago, the book is still relevant for today's readers. The book paints a vivid picture of the mind of drug users. The drug user's highs, lows, and sometimes strange thought patterns are described in great detail in this interesting book.</p>
<p>The infamous Aleister Crowley invokes a reaction with some people. Some say he was strange and went off the deep-end with his involvement in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magick.html" title="Magick">Magick</a>, the practice of using various techniques to exert control over the forces of nature. If one is too close-minded to read this book because of the author's reputation, he or she would be missing a great read.</p>
<p>This story is supposedly based on truth. False names were used to conceal the identities of the people in the book. For instance, Aleister Crowley is called Peter Pendragon in the book. Peter went to a pub and was socializing with some people he knew when he saw the woman that would change his life, Lou.</p>
<p><i>Across the moaning body of the blackmailer, I was looking at the face of a girl that I had never seen before. And I said to myself, "Well, that's all right, I've known you all my life." And when I said to myself "my life," I didn't in the least mean my life as Peter Pendragon, I didn't even mean a life extending through the centuries, I meant a different kind of life --something with which centuries have nothing whatever to do</i></p>
<p>(Crowley 11).</p>
<p>This truly eloquent description of Peter's first glimpse of Lou reveals that Crowley was truly a master of language. The book is written in such a clever way that the reader continues to want more.</p>
<p>Basically, the story is of Peter falling madly in love with a woman named Lou. They run off to Paris and travel throughout Europe. Lou introduces Peter to <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> and they quickly become dependent on the narcotics. When their supply of drugs runs out, the withdrawal troubles begin. Lou's father, <i>King Lamus</i>, helps the two overcome their addiction by the application of practical Magick. Both Peter and Lou find their true purpose in life and live happily ever after.</p>
<p>"Diary of a Drug Fiend" would be a beneficial source of information for professionals involved with the psychology of addiction. Doctors, lawyers, police, and the average person would gain insight into the thought patterns of a drug addict from the first high, to the constant effort to regain the effects of the first high. The craving for the drug, and how it is the only thing the user thinks about when he or she does not have the drug for a period of time is covered thoroughly. How selfish and careless one becomes when he or she needs a fix is also mentioned in the book. Peter lost his love for Lou because he could only think of the drugs. He quickly knew this was wrong and constantly tried to regain his love for Lou.</p>
<p>If people are open-minded and enjoy challenging their beliefs, then <i>Diary of a Drug Fiend</i> may be the book to read. At the time of reading this book, we may find many useful insights that could dramatically change one's life contained within its pages.</p>

<p>These are the arguments posted on the page of "Moldovan language".</p>
<p>For these <b>facts</b> many users have been blocked and more forced to accept an unilateral point of view of the Administrator Mikkalai and 16 years old Kid Node_ue. <b>He does not bring arguments as we do</b>, instead he uses his power <b>to block many times</b> (for one week or 24 h). Like for yourself, he warned you and mock on you saying that you don't have the right to say something.</p>
<p>I agree with you when you say to redirect to "Romanian language". Anyway "Romanian" was once recognized in the constitution as official language of the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldova.html" title="Moldova">Moldova</a> between 1991-1994 and many attempts to remake this were done.</p>
<p>"Moldovan language" is <b>in fact</b> <b>indentical</b> with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a>, renamed as a "language" for political reasons by the government. Although similar theories have been fielded for other languages, this proposal is now believed to have been made to serve political purposes only, and nobody has provided any evidence so-far towards the idea that Moldovan and Romanian are not from common linguistic stock.</p>
<p>The term "Moldovan" is also a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">soviet</a> <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention.html" title="Invention">invention</a> (see Dept. of State &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>). A separate language based on these was declared and promoted for political reasons, in order to further advance a Moldovan identity separate from that of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>.</p>
<p>The soviet Russians called people of Moldavia Republic: "Moldovan" because they wanted to create a new nation different from Moldavians/Romanians.</p>
<p>There is also in Romania a region called Moldova.</p>
<pre>
Russians manipulated people of Republic of Moldova and washed their brains to create a new person, the soviet "Moldovan". The real name in English is Moldavian, in Romanian is Moldovean and in Russian is Molidavanin. So "Moldovan" belongs to no language!

<p>"The name 'Moldovan language' (in Russian, МОЛДaВCKИЙ ЯЗБIK 'moldavskii iazyk'); in Romanian, limbă moldovenească, or, in Cyrillic characters, ЛИMбЗ MOЛДОBeНЯCKЗ was applied in the Soviet Union, as during earlier periods of Russian occupation of the area in question, to the * Romance language used in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (corresponding more or less to the formerly Romanian territory of Bessarabia, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940). In reality, 'Moldavian' is nothing else than the *Romanian language as spoken in Moldavia, i.e. both east of the river Prut in Bessarabia (now the Republic of Moldova) and west of the Prut in that part of the former province that remains as part of Romania. Claims made in the post-Second World War period by the Soviet linguists that 'Moldavian' should be recognized as a distinct Romance language were not taken into seriously by western scholars. Under Soviet domination, the *Cyrillic alphabet was in the use in the Moldavian SSR until the passing of a law on 31 August 1989 (i.e. before the break-up of the Soviet Union) proclaiming Moldavian as the official language of the Republic and the use of Latin script. Apart from a few lexical differences (mainly technical terms borrowed from Russian rather than, as in standard Romanian, from western languages), the written language was thenceforth indistinguishable from that in use in Romania and moves are afoot to harmonize the technical terminology of Moldova with that adopted in Romanian specialized dictionaries. After the Republic of Moldova declared its independence of the Soviet Union in 1991, its Constitution (1994) declared that the official language was limba moldoveneasca 'the Moldavian language'. At the time of writing, moves to have this amended to 'limba română' the Romanian language have not yet succeeded.</p>

Evolution from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">Romanian</a> to so called <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavian.html" title="Moldavian">Moldavian</a></span></h2>
<p>Lately were discovered some facts that prove that the theory of the both languages <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">romanian</a> and "moldovan" - was prefab since the 1812-1918. Some important aspects of the problematics: functioning of the romanian language in the sphere of the laic education system from Bessarabia of the year 1812-1918, the attempts to codyfing the romanian language in conditions of a linguistic situations, causes that determined to degradation of the language compared with spoken romanian on the right side of the river Prut, taking out the name "romanian" and introducing the term "limba moldoveneasca", the intention of the tsarist government "to create a dialect neared to the slavic language".</p>
<p>In the first years of russian occupation (after 1812), because 95% of the population being romanians which they knew only their mother tongue, romanian was admitted as an official language in the institutions of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessarabia.html" title="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>, used along with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>. Gradually the russian language win importance. According to the dates offered by the Dept. for ruling the Bessarabia from <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>, the papers from bureau were held only in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">russian</a>, and around 1835 it is established a term of 7 years time in which the state institutions will still accept acts in romanian language. As concerning the education, romanian was admitted as language of teaching only until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>, after that being taught as a separate object. Thus, at the theological Seminar of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="Chişinău">Chişinău</a>, romanian language is found on the list of compulsory subjects, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the department of romanian is closed for good. At the highschool no. 1 from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u.html" title="Chişinău">Chişinău</a> the pupils had the right to choose between romanian and german or between romanian and greek until 9th of Feb. <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, when the state counselor of the russian government interdicts teaching of the romanian language because the pupils "know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals". Around <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>, the tsar published an ucaz "On the suspension of teaching the romanian language in the schools from Besserabia", because "In russian Empire are not taught local speeches".</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates that a formal text in Romanian and Moldovan may be completely identical, the only difference being the spelling of the î vowel in the word vântul. The colloquial languages show more difference, which varies over the area.</p>

I find it further unacceptable that you choose to use a helpful user as a pawn in your wiki political battle and as a result alienated him from our project. I have never before been so ashamed to be a Wikipedia editor. After careful consideration I believe that all users who have caused this travesty are a greater harm to our project than an asset.

<p>Congrats on your upcoming transfer! I certainly can't argue against studying instead of Wiki'ing. :) It's been a weird semester for me. I was really looking forward to one of my classes, and it turned out to be not so great. That hasn't been filling me with inspiration for my degree. And, some big things have been going on in my family -- not bad things, but things that make long-term planning difficult. So, in short, life has been generally okay but kind of up-and-down. Next year looks to be more exciting, so I'm thinking positive.

<p>Hello, I am <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicfly_8a25.html" title="User:Cosmicfly">Robert</a>, I have a cooking wiki already established that is in need of a few good contributors. I would be interested in giving Admin rights to a few good contributors. The wiki has mucho content but no real active community and just a handful of contributors. The project is located at <a href="http://www.cookbookwiki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.cookbookwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cookbookwiki.com</a> and I can be contacted at wikimanager@yahoo.com, I recently removed google ads and such. I need help getting the community part of the wiki active. Feel free to stop by and add your comments to our home page discussion or get started. From my understanding, there is much content that can be added that is missing from wikipedia due to politics. So, if you would like a cooking wiki playground, please stop by or contact me. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicfly_8a25.html" title="User:Cosmicfly">Robert</a></p>

<p>hi, there is an organized campaign to save the above self-promotional vanity games-club page from deletion.... i'm wondering if you'd be willing to take a look and voice your opinion? normally i wouldnt care but (a) i hate organized campaigns from groups of users (especially when they have vested interests but dont declare them) and (b) when challenged about it, they suggested i try it myself! so here i am.... cheers! <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzzzz_e5d0.html" title="User:Zzzzz">Zzzzz</a> 20:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Shark illustration.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Train_Archive_VI_0fc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Train/Archive VI">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box.
