<p>hi thank you! &#160;:) Are you from España? Yes I know i sometimes check in with Lucky 9.6 but i haven't talkaed to him for a while I mean i do <b>a LOT</b> of work on Brazil (brasil) and pornography, sex, jewish hot women (i'm jewish and love hot women) cocaine, and <b>South Park</b> and I know a lot of my stuff gets votes to delete, a lot of it to merge or redirect but a lot of my articlse also are praised like our <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Kushell_a59e.html" title="Lisa Kushell">Lisa Kushell</a> article (she is my American princess swettheart!!) I did that article with Jucky 6.9 and Superdude151. I did the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_174.html" title="Bus 174">Bus 174</a> article all by myself and that was about Brasil too. I am trying my best but I think that peole dont respsect the cutlure of Brazil here at all do you get that impression that they feel the wame say about Spain?<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_brah_9e73.html" title="User:Wiki brah">Wiki brah</a> 18:38, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nice to see your reply. No, I'm not from Spain; I'm an American of Latin American descent, actually. Your <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_174.html" title="Bus 174">Bus 174</a> article <i>is</i> pretty good, especially for a new user like yourself.</dd>
<dd>The big problem isn't that people respect Brasilian culture; quite the opposite, I think that Brasilian culture is respected almost everywhere and the Wikipedia community is no exception. It's just that Wikipedia has certain standards that it has to maintain, and some of your other articles don't quite make it. But don't worry about that. Check out <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, and feel free to drop me a line the next time you're going to start a new article, and I'll work with you to help you write what you want but still meet Wikipedia policy.

<p>Hi Fernando</p>
<p>I appreciate your comments on my Geek Shopping entry. You are the only one so far who has mentioned anything concrete on what is wrong with my the article and that ranks high in my book. I hope to address the concerns you mentioned and maybe give the article some life. I have already added the Fry's entry (don't know how I missed that since I have a Fry's about 2 miles from my house). I hope to make the article more 'Encyclopediac' while still keeping it current and useful.</p>
<p>PS -- I like Slurpees too!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey there buddy. With regard to Geek shopping, I'm afraid that even the inclusion of Fry's isn't going to save it, as it can never really be an encyclopedic article with the name it currently has. The fundamental problem with the article is that it can only be about what someone's <i>opinion</i> of geek shopping is. An encyclopedia can't have any <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, it can only present information referenced from other sources. I hope this clears it up for you, but please feel free to leave me another message if you've still got questions. I hope that you can still contribute to Wikipedia despite this initial setback. Cheers, <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 17:58, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fernando: I don't get your point as far as the title of the article. If I accept your critism of the term Geek Shopping then the term <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Geek</a> has the same fundamental problem in that it can only be about what someone's <i>opinion</i> of <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">geek</a> is. However the Wikipedia <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Geek</a> article seems quite widely accepted, hence the many hits when I was initially searching for Geek Shopping info via google. If a defination of Geek shopping is in order then that can be easily accomplished by referencing back to the <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Geek</a> article. I don't disagree that there are other problems with the 'Geek Shopping' article but nothing I've seen so far that cannot be addressed with a reasonable amount of editting and updating (including references to original source material). Best Wishes -- Dave</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, Dave. The problem is this: I think that geek shopping consists of going to stores <i>a, b</i> and <i>c</i>, but you think geek shopping is going to stores <i>x, y</i> and <i>z</i>. The problem is that there's no reference we can check. A good, encyclopedic article would be able to say, "Geek shopping is defined as ______, and is also considered _____", with the statements referenced to an outside work.</dd>
<dd>The big difference between <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Geek</a> and Geek shopping is that "Geek" is a term in very, very wide usage, that has had a notable impact on the English language and has an almost universally agreed-upon meaning. "Geek shopping" doesn't have the same cachet. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 18:52, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure how to determine if a term has a wide usage of not since this is a Point of View concept, but I notice a google search of "Geek Shopping" has around 34,000 hits whereas the term "<a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek_canon.html" title="Geek canon">Geek canon</a>" has around 6,000 hits but is a valid Wikipedia article without a non-Wikipedia referenced defination (that I found anyway). I don't mean to drag this on since I have much more serious fish to fry as I sure you do to, but I hit this discussion again via Google while looking for something else.</dd>

<p>Earlier, Murphy displayed his works at art festivals in Laguna Beach and the Scottsdale Celebration of Fine Art. His work has been displayed in several museums in both the USA and Europe. Murphy has exhibited his works at art galleries in Spain, Ukraine, France, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts and California. His work has been registered in Los Angeles, NYC and Hartford, CT. His painting and sculptures were part of the 1999 City of Los Angeles Juried Art Show. Murphy is listed in the International Registry of Art and Artists, an artists' database sourced by Getty Foundation. He has appeared on Russian Television, ABC and NBC; his works were published in several national publications, including Maxim Magazine. He is an print art and design consultant and has participated in the implementation of important digital color assurance technology for the Internet.</p>
<p>In early 2004, Murphy participated as one of the artists in the 1st Annual Lugansk Body Painting Festival, something quite new and exhilarating. Murphy completed a large print series based on the event, which served as a springboard to his focus on the female figure that continues into 2005.</p>
<p>Murphy has created one of the most popular of the professional artist's websites. He has participated in multimedia events for the Internet. This website was established in 1997. It has received many awards including: Art of the Web Award, Britannica's Internet Guide Award, the Gold Award from AA Project Juno and StarSaber's Award of Excellence.</p>
<p>Murphy has been invited to to display his artwork at: the Artist's Workshop 2002 on Crete, Greece; Art International 2003 - Zurich, ArtWalk 2003 at San Diego; the Biennale di Firenze, Italy 2003; Montserrat Gallery in Soho NYC, May 2003; Art-Philadelphia 2003, a contemporary art show June 27-29, 2003; XXX Aniversario Batik, Barcelona, October, 2003; Salon International de Peinture et de Sculpture 4e edition, Monte Carlo, November 2003: Gallery Gora, Montreal; Art in the West, Galway, Ireland, Montreal's International Festival of Erotic Art, June, 2005 and Omma Center of Contemporary Art, Santa Barbara, California in September. Last year, Murphy was interviewed on Russian-language television. A complete segment of the series is devoted to Murphy's recollections and comments on art and the art world. Was it Pablo Picasso who when asked, "What is art?" responded, "If I knew, I wouldn't tell anyone." Look for Murphy's work to appear online at Instair Art's June Exhibition of New Computer Art.</p>
<p>In addition to his painting and design work, Murphy has written poetry. Murphy has done volunteer work for several charities. He is a gifted artist dedicated to his work and to making a contribution the community. This is central to his philosophy and fundamental to his appreciation of life.</p>
<p>Murphy began his art career as a painter. Today, he is a computer artist, printmaker and film producer. His work with watercolors and oils offers a rich, spontaneous style. Much of his recent effort has gone into creating digitally-mastered prints, many of these are available on this website. He demonstrates a diverse capability delivering <b>minimalist to NeoPopRealism</b>. His works are world-class. Murphy's goal as a contemporary artist is to engage the viewer and elicit an emotion. With simple forms and lines it is possible to create a subtle complexity. An overview of Murphy's work can refresh the senses and might encourage participation. We can experience joy for ourselves and in our world. Murphy believes that the creative experience enlarges our spiritual world and begs for an increased participation in life and can foster a greater sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Murphy contributed artwork to E-Cards.com and Care-Mail.com, two charitable e-card web sites. Please visit them. At E-Cards your participation generates a contribution to protect our wildlife. Also, you can send postcards of Murphy paintings and prints to your friends and relatives from this website, if you simply CLICK HERE.</p>

<li>Okay Marg, here's what I propose. Instead of getting sidetracked with Neopoprealism in the Nadia Russ article, let's you and I collaboratively right a Neopoprealism article. The first step is going to be research; we have to make sure that its notable enough for inclusion, and we have to make sure that we can supply references for the article. Tomorrow, I'll be at my school's library inbetween classes. I'll see what I can't dig up for references and you dig through whatever art reviews and magazines you have for references, and we'll compare notes tomorrow or Tuesday. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a></li>

<dd>Okay, first of all, you did the right thing by not making any accusatory messages to Paul Klenk or The Deletator. Secondly, it looks like both of the articles that have been VfD'd are on worthwhile subjects and should survive VfD easily, so don't worry too much about that.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for bringing the matter to my attention. The mission that The Deletator claims to be on it worth watching, and if he brings a lot of bad faith VfDs up, it will be dealt with. Remember that they could well be a fairly new user themselves, and may need some time to the hang of the way things work around here. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 20:56, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Fernando,</p>
<p>The Greek Cypriot guy User:82.35.34.24 who vandalised my User page, and a number of Albanian related pages is back doing more of the same. He is creating a lot of problems wherever he is going.</p>
<p>For example, he has created an article called <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_mafia.html" title="Albanian mafia">Albanian_mafia</a> and is creating links to it, for example, from the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo_Liberation_Army_6b46.html" title="Kosovo Liberation Army">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> page. He continues to vandalise the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo_Liberation_Army_6b46.html" title="Kosovo Liberation Army">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> article. This so-called <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_mafia.html" title="Albanian mafia">Albanian_mafia</a> article <b>must</b> be deleted because it is totally and utterly POV. I tried to report this page to be deleted, but could not figure out how to do it. So, I thought maybe you could help?</p>

Please don't make me regret my leniency in this case. Leave me a talk page message if you have any questions.</p>

<dd><font color="#000099">The reason I even made the first edit was to improve the quality of the paragraph -and set it up for the second edit, adopting an older version that FuelWagon had not liked; he wanted a source to address the "atypical" language I chose to use, and I gave him that source. So, it (the 2nd "revert") was not "technically" a revert, but I did use a "version" of a prior edit, but with modifications to make Wagon happy. <i><b>The 3rd and 4th edits were certainly reversions, as I indicated in my talk posts.</b></i> I was getting frustrated with POV-pusher, such as Wagon, and asked for help.

<p>Gordon, I've been in class for much of the day. I did visit the Terri Schiavo talk page while I was on RC patrol earlier, and saw that it was no closer to compromise than it was yesterday. I haven't had enough time to immerse myself in the current debate, and I hope that you'll understand my reluctance to weigh in on a matter where I have not read all of the associated material.

<p>I added language from the Schindler's motion against Michael challenging his guardianship. They submit as evidence that Terri's transfer to a hospice was an improper use of her assets. (see bullet 31 of the motion which is linked in the proposed version).</p>
<p>The courts tossed the Schindler's motion against michael. The guardian ad litems appointed to have Terri's best interests at heart never mentioned this transfer as being a problem. There is nothing but an accusation from the Schindlers that the courts dismissed. Introducing Gordon's "typically only legally" doesn't belong in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="#000099">The attorneys' jobs on both sides is to make "accusations." It is OUR job to report them -all of them, and if Wagon wants to include info about the court's response of whatever, that is alright with me.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWattsDotCom_7788.html" title="User:GordonWattsDotCom">GordonWattsDotCom</a> 21:51, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p>The rest of the paragraph is redundant and can be removed completely. It only exists so that Gordon can say a Hospice "typically only legally" accepts terminal patients.

<p>My reply: Nope. If you had taken the time to study the Louisiana Evacuation Plan signed by former New Orleans mayor Marc Morial you'd have realized evacuation is up to state and local officials. Here's the link: <a href="http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/plans/EOPSupplement1a.pdf</a> See page 11 section D7, Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities. I have no other desire than to keep Wikipedia as neutral as possible hence my addition of Nagin's defense to criticisms he has received as well as my adding the balance of criticisms against Nagin to criticisms Nagin has issued. I've added Nagin's criticism of the Governor as well. Criticism by Nagin, criticism against Nagin, and Nagin's defense of criticism - what could be more neutral or balanced?

<dd>I am a political moderate. What I object to most from both the right and left is their partisan supression of fact. Suppression of Mayor Nagin's criticism of the Governor and suppression of his responsibilities under the state evacuation plan can only be motivated by partisan interest. A new fact reaches the world tonite. That fact is the Governor opposes Mayor Nagin's mandatory evacuation plan of his Parish. Suppressing that fact can only be considered POV. When I find an adequate source, that fact will be added to the article. It's a fact I'm convinced the left will choose to try to suppress for political reasons. -- Long John Silver 209.247.222.87 01:23, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Political moderates do not spend their time accusing others of being left wing extreemists, National socialists and liars as this user has done repeatedly. Nor do they constantly revert an article wholesale to their own version ignoring every other editor. Although there are comments from other IP addresses all of them are clearly comming from a single site with dual firewalls, apparently at a Naval installation in San Francisco. There is also a user Corwin8 who has been accused of being a sock but is probably not and is getting rather anoyed that his edits are being reverted by people who mistake them for LJS. I have also added some anti-Nagin comments to the article that have been eliminated in the same way. More details are at wp:vip including the subtle tricks he is playing with redirects to turn entirely unconnected articles into a political platform for an extreeme POV. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 05:19, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Fernando,</p>
<p>I am writing about the conversation you had regarding relevant external links, vs. advertising spamming- and just trying to get a clearer picture on how some of the articles, for instance 'solar ovens' have links to many solar oven companies out there.</p>
<p>Please excuse our earlier misunderstandings, it's just that our public television cooking series is a non-profit organization that also highlights and features other worthy non-profit organizations in everything from sustainable agriculture, to organic/fair trade markets, and alternative energy to name a few.</p>
<p>So we assumed that it was ok to place an external link on relevant articles, as we provide a lot of resources on these subjects as well.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your thoughtful consideration,</p>
<p>James</p>
<dl>
<dd>James,</dd>
<dd>I'm as strong a supporter of public radio and television as there ever was, and I certainly sympathize. However, I'm sure you can agree that if every worthwhile cause added a link to their websites to Wikipedia articles, it would get pretty chaotic around here.</dd>

<dd>So what can be done for your show? I would suggest that a public television program that is broadcast in a major market and thus has a large number of viewers is notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. Why not write an article for it? Put up a good draft, and I'll help you out with it. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 20:35, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No sweat, Bubba. Everybody, even anonymous IPs have a talk page. The format is [[User talk:XX.XXX.XXX.XX]] or [[User talk:Username]].

<dd>I'm not happy fighting vandals. :-) I was going to add one of those because this was the first time I had seen a repeater. But there was no "talk" in the page history and when I clicked on the IP address, there was no discussion page, so I didn't see any way to do it. I don't see any point in having 4 or so warning levels. One warning should be all they get. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> 17:13, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a bit confused as to how you called the Janelle Pierzina page. I count 8 votes for redirect, 2 for delete and 12 for keep. How does this become a conclusion of redirect? That just doesn't make sense to me, nor does it jive with what I've seen on some other votes.

<li>Most of the keep voters had less than 300 edits and their votes were disallowed; this is pretty standard.

<li>If I'm not mistaken, it's spelled out in Guide to AfD or in the deletion policy; I don't exactly recall where but it is rather explicit.

<dd>Firedrake, I don't have cable, and can't remember the last time I watched any television above and beyond some SportsCenter and CNN at my friends' houses, so I haven't the foggiest notion what you're talking about. I really don't care about the television show that Janelle is on, all I was doing was executing what I considered to be the result of the AfD debate. If you really feel this strongly about it, why don't you file a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User_conduct_3a88.html#Use_of_administrator_privileges" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct">Request for comment</a> about my alleged misuse of admin privileges?

<dd>I'm not sure it makes me feel any better knowing you have no clue as to the whole root of the argument to delete/redirect the page. I'm fairly certain now you don't know why Janelle's page was picked for deletetion over other contestant with fewer accomplishments. I more than likely will try the request for comment thing, as I do not believe that the page should have been deleted. I do realize you have nothing against me, but do not find your ignorance of Big Brother and why Ms Pierzina is notable to be comforting. I do thank you for pointing out to me where to go to attempt to fix this mess. I don't hold any grudge against you, I just feel the decision to delete the page to be frivolous and your call in the AfD to be unfair and unwarranted.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 03:50, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not trying to be condescending here, Firedrake, but you've got some serious misconceptions about how things work here.
<ol>
<li>The fact that I don't know anything about <i>Big Brother</i> has nothing to do with my ability to close an AfD. Not the slightest thing. I can close AfDs about Chinese medicine or knitting or anything of the sort. My opinion and knowledge of the subject have nothing to with anything. All I do is look at the votes, decide which ones are valid, tabulate the results and execute the consensus. That's it. Big Brother my be my favorite show in the world, and I would still execute the AfD the same way. Someone who knows nothing about the subject and therefore brings no personal POV into the matter is the perfect impartial executor of the consensus.</li>
<li>The page was not deleted. If you click on the "history" button, it's all still there. The current text of the page is # REDIRECT [[Big Brother (US series)]], but if you go back to the prior edit you'll see the whole thing as it was prior to my redirecting it.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If you hang around Wikipedia longer, I suspect you'll see that what I did was not only par for the course but fair. I invite you to look through my contributions and talk page archives; I pride myself on being level-headed and fair-minded. I'm sorry that you think otherwise, but I'm glad that you can at least see that it isn't anything personal. By all means, puruse an RfC if you think it's necessary. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 04:03, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that ignorance of the topic is hardly necessary to tally votes (although, as you may guess I disagree with the criterea you used to toss out some votes). My main point had to do with why the page was up for deletion/redirection in the first place. But that was the whim of another admin and not really your fault. (one question though, how can you know much about Aqua Ten Hunger Force without watching tv? &lt;g&gt;) I do realize the page isn't deleted, just harder to get to, expecially if you aren't all that familar with the history tab. Someone took the wikify things off Janelle's name, but I'll replace those. As for this being par for the course, I'm sure you can understand how I might not find to be comforting or any incentive to stick around. I do think you are trying to do your job fairly, I just don't think the result is worthy of a good encyclopedia. I actually think you are less deserving of an RfC for this than the person who put the page up for deletion in the first place.

This particular case is even more delicate because it's known to be a multi-user address.

<p>You seem to have added the line "Not enough discussion for consensus, reposting" to a couple of AfD discussions with only a few votes. Is this an official Wikipedia policy? If there is not enough discussion for consensus, then shouldn't the AfD be closed with a result of "no consensus"? Am I allowed to delete articles whose every AfD vote was "delete" but which only received a few votes? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:24, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you don't hang out at VfD a lot, JIP, but it's pretty standard procedure. Tony Sidaway does this 10 or 12 times a week. Maybe mine just stand out more because of my eye-catching use of red fonts. :) <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 07:41, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's true that I don't hang around AfD a lot. I only started closing AfDs two days ago and do not have much experience yet. So an AfD discussion with only a few votes should be treated as "no consensus" even if every vote is the same. But should those discussion just be closed with a result of "no consensus", or should they immediately be relisted? I previously asked about "no consensus" on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion</a> and got a reply that a result of "no consensus" should be effectively treated as a result of "keep". <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:46, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely, "no consensus" effectively results in a "keep" vote. But let's look closer at the ones I reposted.
<dl>
<dd>Seng: Nomination, one vote and a comment. That's not a good consensus there.</dd>
<dd>Kenyatech: Nom and one vote.</dd>
<dd>The Racial Compact: Ditto.</dd>
<dd>York Plug:Nom and comments, but no votes.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../r/o/t/Rottentomatoes_Monday_Photoshop_Contest_8848.html" title="Rottentomatoes Monday Photoshop Contest">Rottentomatoes Monday Photoshop Contest</a>: Nom and three votes, but one of them is a user with less than 100 edits, and that vote may or may not be discarded by the eventual closing admin.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Basically, the thinking is that it takes more than one or two votes to make for any kind of consensus. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Demarcation_869a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Demarcation">Here's a good example of this same methodology being used by Tony Sidaway</a>, as I mentioned above. Basically, if you don't feel comfortable closing an AfD due to lack of discussion, post it again.</dd>
<dd>Don't hesitate to bring up questions like this; this is how we learn and how we all stay honest. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 07:57, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm in a bit of a situation here, (I dont want you in the mix of this) but it all started when me and <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">User:Paul Klenk</a>, "bumped" into each other while editing <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Jobs_8006.html" title="Dirty Jobs">Dirty Jobs</a>. We got in a little argument that lead me into being a sockpuppet, impostor and all that good stuff. He started teaming up with other users like <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">User:BlankVerse</a>, User:Lucky 6.9, It was gettig me mad because all they wanted to do is post articles that i contributed, for deletion. (you cant tell when you're mad, when you type) so when, <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">User:Paul Klenk</a> asked me for help, I actually provided some help,(I never got help from him), but then he started getting an attitude once he got his helpfrom me. (all I said was,"I think it's O.K", meaning it wont get deleted) he responded with ("It's not if you care, I only follow wikipedia's polocies."). Now I regret ever helping him. that's when this user named "wiki brah" told him that he was gay, me and this other user, TheDeletator agreed, because to me he seemed "gay" from the beggining, and The deletator said that, <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">User:Paul Klenk</a> wanted to chat with him on yahoo messenger, and Paul Klenk showed him his errected penis, I replied in his talk page, but I think I went overboard,(I was overreating).

<p>Fernando, just a note to you as an admin who may or may not have experience with Imdaking: Be very careful not to let him bait you with his whining into doing something that you will kick yourself for later. You may have a sharp nose for these types; I don't know. I have watched more than one admin flush their credibility into the toilet by falling for Imdaking and others like him.</p>
<p>Imdaking is not a serious editor, but knows enough about WP to game the system. He uses it as a plaything, and does not respond to coaching. He currently has several more articles tagged for copyright violations; lifting text whole-hog from Web sites with only the slightest alteration. When I have tried to actually improve an article in the past (instead of putting it up for deletion) he started his campaign of harrassment.</p>
<p>Users like Imdaking suck up a lot of editing time and resources from serious writers and editors, not merely due to his poor work, but his bullying, vandalism, whining and gaming.</p>
<p>I am strongly urging you to keep your eye on him, please, and if you have any questions, feel free to let me know. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> 23:39, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
