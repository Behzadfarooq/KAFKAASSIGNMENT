<p>The story is set in our universe approximately 9,600 years in the future (approximately 11,600 C.E.). As is made clearer in McDevitt's later Alex Benedict novel <i>Seeker</i>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> during the course of recorded history, human civilization has spread through a substantial part of the Orion Arm of our galaxy. The novel is concerned with two time periods – the present of the principal viewpoint character, Alex Benedict, and a period approximately 200 years before his time, which is viewed through <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back-story.html" title="Back-story">back-story</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennia</a> since <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Armstrong_5dd2.html" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a>, McDevitt tells us, humanity discovered the ruins of one alien technological civilization, and encountered one that at the time of the story is alive and thriving, the Ashiyyur. The sphere of Ashiyyur worlds is described as abutting the worlds of human civilization along the Perimeter – first contact was made at least several hundred years before the time in which the back-story is set. McDevitt conceives the Ashiyyur as being at approximately the same technological level as humans, and in fact humanoid – bi-laterally symmetrical, bipedal, larger than average for human, of two genders, descended from predators, and interested in the same kind of real estate as humans. Most significantly for the story, they are also incapable of audible speech without mechanical aids, and are nicknamed “Mutes” by humans as a result. The Ashiyyur are telepathic<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and have evolved a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">society</a> based on that form of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communication.html" title="Communication">communication</a>. They have the ability, with some difficulty, to “read” human minds and emotions. Ashiyyur civilization is described as being much older than human civilization (approximately 75,000 years versus perhaps 15,000) but as having developed much more slowly. It is important to the back-story that to the Ashiyyur, human dynamism and exuberance appear threatening and humans are aggressive, untrustworthy and unethical.</p>
<p>The author describes human civilization at the time of the back-story as spread across many worlds, most of which were independent of the others. All maintained sentimental ties with Earth, but difficulties of interstellar travel and local parochialism ensured that there was no <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_government.html" title="Central government">central government</a>. Many human worlds maintained their own <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_forces.html" title="Armed forces">armed forces</a> but again there was no central direction. Communication between worlds was limited to travel by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_travel.html" title="Interstellar travel">interstellar ships</a>, which used magnetic drives for short and medium distance travel within star systems and Armstrong interstellar drives by means of which ships could travel between star systems through “Armstrong space”. Both at the time of the back-story and in the protagonist's time, navigation using Armstrong drives is sufficiently imprecise that ships must for safety reasons emerge from Armstrong space well away from stars and planets and travel substantial distances (and times) using magnetic drives. In addition, and partly as a result, travel through Armstrong space is time-consuming – as described in the novel, a voyage of 3,000 light years takes about seven months, of which about five months time is spent in Armstrong space. It is important to the story that some individuals, like Alex Benedict and most Ashiyyur, react physically badly to the transitions into and out of Armstrong space</p>
<p>As described in the back-story, following first contact with the Ashiyyur, there was increasing friction between human and Ashiyyur civilizations, evolving from a “<a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_war.html" title="Cold war">cold war</a>” into an increasing number of small and then larger military clashes in which the Ashiyyur generally prevailed. The fiercely independent governments of the human worlds responded to the Ashiyyurian challenge largely by dithering and self-deception about the threat. A few human worlds, led by Dellaconda, reacted militarily by forming a small military force, based at first mainly on the Dellacondan navy, to wage a <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla war</a> known as "the Resistance" against the Ashiyyur. The back-story begins at this point in history, although it is not told in chronological sequence.</p>

<p>The story begins as Alex Benedict receives word from a cousin that his uncle Gabriel was among the passengers on an interstellar that failed to return from Armstrong space. A package arrives from his uncle’s lawyers informing Alex that he is his uncle’s heir and giving him a sealed “sponder” message (a holographic projection with A.I. qualities) from his uncle. Uncle Gabe’s avatar tells Alex that his uncle had been working on a special archeological project that Gabe wants Alex to pursue now that Gabe cannot. Alex must return to Rimway, where Uncle Gabe lived, and look in the “Leisha Tanner” file at Gabe’s home to recover his research and notes. Gabe’s avatar won’t discuss the nature of the project, other than to mention Hugh Scott, an old acquaintance in the Planetary Survey, and a historical figure, Ludik Talino. However, en route to Rimway, Alex learns that his uncle’s house has been burglarized and, when he reaches home, that the Tanner file is missing and that all of his uncle's computerized records have been sabotaged.</p>
<p>From this point onward, the story follows two increasingly intertwined threads, a mystery in the present and a history of the past. The mystery is the nature of Uncle Gabe’s project, which Alex works to discover. As Alex does so, he becomes increasingly immersed in the history of the Resistance and its principal leader and hero, Christopher Sim. The story becomes almost fragmented at times as it switches back and forth from the developing mystery to historical narrative.</p>
<p>Alex visits the local police inspector, Fenn Redfield, and learns that the burglars apparently wanted only the Tanner file. Redfield, a social friend of Gabe Benedict, can shed little light on Gabe’s project other than to note that Gabe seemed distracted for the three months before his death (“His chess game was off...”) and that Gabe had become a “nut” on the subject of Christopher Sim and the Resistance</p>
<p>Chase Kolpath visits Alex at his uncle's house. Before disappearing, Gabriel Benedict had hired Ms. Kolpath to investigate the last flight of the <i>Tenandrome</i>, Hugh Scott's Planetary Survey ship, and then meet Gabe and an unidentified companion at Seraglia Station, near the Veiled Lady nebula, and pilot them to an unspecified destination. Gabe disappeared before reaching Seraglia, and owed Ms. Kolpath a considerable sum in back salary and expenses. Alex agrees to pay what is owed her and asks her to assist him in his investigations. From the planned logistics of Gabe’s trip, Ms. Kolpath estimates that they were to travel from 800 to 1,500 light years into the Veiled Lady. Chase doesn’t know Gabe’s objective, only that it had something to do with the <i>Tenandrome</i>. That ship had been exploring the Veiled Lady about three years before Gabe’s death and had returned unexpectedly. “Apparently, they saw something. . . Gabe wanted to know what, but I could never find out.”</p>
<p>Alex researches the <i>Tenandrome</i> flight at Planetary Survey headquarters but finds no indication of anything unusual besides a mechanical breakdown. Alex then attempts to visit Hugh Scott, but finds that Scott has been away from home for months. One of his neighbors notes that Scott’s personality has changed since the <i>Tenandrome</i> flight. Like Gabriel Benedict, Scott has become obsessed by the Resistance and Christopher Sim, and has traveled to the places of Sim’s most important battles. Alex is able to identify Gabe’s traveling companion as John Khyber, a retired security consultant, but there is no obvious reason why Gabe should have wanted him along on his trip.</p>
<p>Alex locates and studies Leisha Tanner’s diaries, which begin two years before the start of the Resistance and end five years later with her resignation from her teaching position and enlistment with the Dellacondans. Tanner was conflicted and depressed when a friend and faculty colleague, Matt Olander, resigned his position and enlisted with the Dellacondan forces. Her notebooks include pictures and letters from Olander that form a capsule history of the war. Tanner received word that Olander was killed in action. News follows of several major victories by Sim’s forces. Then a startling puzzle – Tanner received a sponder from Olander sent just before his death. Matt sent greetings from the front, then discussed the two most recent Sim victories, which in theory occurred after he died.</p>
<p>Alex is puzzled by the fact that during the war Sim’s forces, and especially Sim himself, appear to have been present and in action at widely separate locations virtually simultaneously. He decides to contact the local Ashiyyur representative to request access to Ashiyyur records of the war, which might shed some light on the problem. Alex meets S’Kalian and experiences mind-to-mind contact for the first time. He learns that the Ashiyyur are aware of the “problem” of Sim’s nearly simultaneous appearances in distant places and account for it as human scholars have done, by assuming that Sim’s fleet included as many as three other Dellacondan vessels disguised as the <i>Corsarius</i>, as a form of psychological warfare. Unexpectedly, S’Kalian confirms that the tactic was in fact effective, that Sim’s ship was seen everywhere and succeeded in demoralizing badly the Ashiyyur forces. “You may be interested in knowing, Mr. Benedict, that there is a myth among our people that Sim was an alien. A true alien, that is, a member of a species unknown to us both.”</p>
<p>Alex's house is burglarized again. The burglars sabotage a crystal containing simulations of Christopher Sim’s major battles; Alex uses one to view the battle at Rigel and sees his simulated ship attacked by the <i>Corsarius</i>. Someone is trying to frighten him.</p>
<p>Dellaconda itself is the next destination, as Chase and Alex continue the hunt for Hugh Scott. Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He sees a memorial to Sim’s students who joined the Dellacondan fleet – 27 names, of whom two survived the war. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will not tell anything about the "Tenandrome" mission, except to confirm that the survey ship found something and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the "Tennadrome" had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more.</p>
<p>The mystery begins to unravel. Alex and Chase decide that whatever the <i>Tenandrome</i> had found, Lesha Tanner had found it first, 200 years before. Alex has an inspiration – the location of the missing something is obliquely described in a poem by Walford Candles, to whom Tanner must have confided the secret. The book <i>Rumors of Earth</i> had been in Uncle Gabe’s bedroom when Alex returned, and was open to that poem. Gabriel Benedict must have had the same insight. Alex is able to find the university researcher who helped his uncle work with the clues in Candles’ poem. He identifies a location about 1,300 light years into the Veiled Lady as the primary locus of search.</p>
<p>Alex and Chase rent a ship and begin a 57 day journey through Armstrong space. At one point, Chase notices a shadow in the Armstrong scanners, but it comes and goes too quickly for her to be sure what she saw. At journey’s end, deep in the Veiled Lady and outside known space, they find a red type M dwarf star with two planets in the habitable zone. One appears to be a terrestrial world and they move toward it. From a distance, they are able to see something artificial orbiting this world. Moving closer, they can see first that it is a ship, then that it is a warship, and then that it is a Dellacondan warship. Finally, they can make out clearly the ship’s <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insignia.html" title="Insignia">insignia</a> – the famous markings of <i>Corsarius</i>, Christoper Sim’s own. It was not destroyed at Rigel.</p>
<p>They board the ship, moved and a bit frightened by the significance of what they’ve found. The Armstrong drive units are gone; otherwise, the <i>Corsarius</i> has power and appears functional. Inside, the ship appears virtually normal, aside from a few mechanical malfunctions due to age, as if the crew had just stepped away for a few minutes. They play back the captain’s log, and unexpectedly find that it ends before the battle at Rigel. They listen to the whole record and hear a Sim’s-eye view of the history of the Resistance. It becomes clear that as time had passed, Sim became increasingly angry at the shortsightedness of the major human worlds and increasingly disturbed at the casualties among “our finest and bravest.” Toward the end, “his anger flared: there will be a Confederacy one day, . . . but they will not construct it on the bodies of my men.” Alex cannot get out of his mind the image of Christopher Sim in despair.</p>
<p>Gradually, Alex works out the answer. Christopher Sim became disillusioned about the war and wanted to sue for peace. His brother Tarien and other Resistance leaders seized him and marooned him on this planet to keep him from surrendering. Alex confirms this by searching the planet in a lander and finds Sim’s camp. There is no indication there what happened to Sim. Following the defeat at Rigel and Tarien Sim’s death shortly afterward, apparently no one remained alive who knew what exactly where Sim was. Clearly, Leisha Tanner had searched for him extensively, but had she found him? Or had he died on this lonely world? There appears to be no way to know.</p>
<p>Alex’s thoughts are interrupted by Chase, who reports that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase to abandon their rented ship for the <i>Corsarius</i>; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the <i>Corsarius</i> exists somewhere on board but won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic maneuver from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable <i>Corsarius'</i> magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. S'Kalian contacts them and demands their surrender. Alex and Chase stall for time while they rig their lander with dummies and send it fleeing into space. The Ashiyyur vessel sends a commando team to seize the <i>Corsarius</i>; when its shields open to let the team pass, Chase has the battle computers fire <i>Corsarius</i>’ major weapons at it, then raise the ship’s shields to ward off the counterattack. The Ashiyyur vessel is badly damaged and limps away before <i>Corsarius</i> can fire again. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, <i>Corsarius</i> is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.</p>
<p>The huge (if temporary) technological advantage conferred on humanity by the new drive ends the human-Ashiyyur rivalry; the Perimeter stabilizes and more peaceful relations develop between the two civilizations.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Talent_for_War_d6f6.html" title="Edit section: The Past">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Past</span></h3>
<p>The following are all <i>historical</i> characters who play significant roles in the back-story.</p>
<p><b>Christopher Sim</b> - Christopher Sim is the most important character in the "historical" back-story, the person around whom the central mystery of the novel revolves. As Alex Benedict's <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quest.html" title="Quest">quest</a> progresses, the author reveals more and more of Sim's story. Sim lived about 200 years before the novel's "present" time, beginning as a teacher of Ancient History and Government on the planet Dellaconda, a frontier world near the Perimeter (border) with Ashiyyur space. McDevitt portrays the reaction of Sim, his politician brother Tarien Sim and others on Dellaconda and neighboring frontier worlds to the Ashiyyur threat: they banded together, formed a small naval force and conducted a guerrilla war (the "Resistance") over a four or five year period against the Ashiyyur. The author tells (one of his major themes) how the Resistance faced apathy or outright hostility from most other humans - for every human world that supported the Resistance, McDevitt tells us, two remained neutral (including the most powerful) and a few accepted overlordship of the Ashiyyur.</p>
<p>McDevitt portrays Christopher Sim as an unlikely hero who rose to greatness through an unexpected "talent for war," a charismatic military genius able to anticipate his enemy’s plans and outwit them with his own. As McDevitt describes the history of the war, over several years, Sim's tiny forces won a series of improbable (and famous) military victories against far superior Ashiyyur forces through a combination of audacity, imaginative tactics, excellent strategic intelligence, and uncanny insights into Ashiyyur psychology. Sim’s forces, small though they were (“sixty-odd frigates and destroyers holding off the massive fleets of the Ashiyyur”), seemed to be everywhere at once. McDevitt tells us that Sim's strategic successes foreshadowed his ultimate tactical defeat. While the tide of public opinion (if not government policies) on human worlds slowly turned in favor of the Resistance, Sim’s forces’ unavoidable losses in battle and meager replenishment and the much larger military forces on the other side eventually brought Sim to bay. In a climactic battle near Rigel, Sim’s remaining forces were overwhelmed and his famous ship, the frigate <i>Corsarius</i>, was destroyed. Only a handful of Dellacondan ships survived the battle; the Resistance navy ceased to exist for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>Christopher Sim’s death in battle, like that of Leonidas at Thermopylae, changed everything, according to the author. Public opinion swung swiftly to demand war against the Ashiyyur. Previously hesitant governments on many worlds now committed to the war effort; one especially resistant government was overthrown by an enraged populace and its major military forces committed to the war. Within a few months, Tarien Sim and his colleagues were able to persuade the majority of human worlds to sign the Instrument of Confederation creating a human federal government. The military forces of "half a hundred human worlds" were contributed to a unified Confederate fleet, which battled the Ashyyur forces to a standstill and preserved the independence of human civilization. Tarien Sim did not live to see this outcome; he was killed in battle shortly before the Instrument was signed and before the weight of human forces could be effectively mobilized.</p>
<p><b>Ludik Talino</b> - A weapons tech in the Dellacondan navy before the war who became Christopher Sim’s trusted navigator on the <i>Corsarius</i> during the Resistance. McDevitt tells us that available records show that he fought with distinction. Talino survived the war but famously was branded “the Traitor” because he and the other six members of Sim’s crew abandoned their captain and their ship before the battle at Rigel in which Sim died.</p>
<p><b>Leisha Tanner</b> - Another key figure, through whose perceptions (reflected in her private papers and the journals of her friend Walford Candles) McDevitt tells the major part of the back-story. She was a university professor at and after the time of the Resistance, a specialist in Ashiyyur philosophy and literature. Her translations of and writings on the most important Ashiyyur philosopher, Tulisofala, are considered definitive in Alec Benedict’s time. She was a peace activist during the early years of the Resistance, later becoming a staff intelligence officer and diplomat for the Dellacondans.</p>
<p><b>Rashim Machesney</b> - The most eminent physicist at the time of the Resistance, an expert in gravitational wave theory. Portrayed by the author as a larger-than-life Falstaffian figure, Machesney declared support for the Resistance early in the war and joined them with much of his scientific team. The Ashiyyur denounced him as a war criminal for creating advanced weaponry for Sim’s military forces. His principal apparent value to the Resistance was diplomatic. Together with Tarien Sim, Machesney was the public face of the Resistance. His scientific prestige lent credibility to the cause, his political campaigns drew public attention, his brilliant writings persuaded.</p>
<p><b>Walford Candles</b> - A professor of classical literature, a war poet, a contemporary of Christopher Sim and a friend of Leisha Tanner. Of his six works, his book <i>Rumors of Earth</i> is described by McDevitt as his best-known. In the novel, his journals are the best source of information about and insight into Leisha Tanner. They also paint a vivid picture of life on the home front during the time of the Resistance, with non-combatants waiting in hope and despair as the fortunes of the Dellacondans rise and, eventually, fall.</p>

<p><b>The Quest</b> - The main character, Alex Benedict, is on a <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quest.html" title="Quest">quest</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, that is, a journey to find an object and return home, involving much travel, great exertion and overcoming many obstacles. At first, <b>A Talent for War</b> appears to be a mystery story and it is not evident that the protagonist is on a quest until rather late in the novel.</p>
<p><b>Clash of Civilizations</b> - While science fiction offers many <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_contact_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="First contact (science fiction)">first contact</a> stories,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> this book deals in large part with what happens <i>after</i> first contact between two competing <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> at approximately equal levels of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a>.</p>
<p><b>Inability of Humanity to Unite in a Common Cause</b> - Humanity as a whole, like the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a> of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Rogers_0819.html" title="Will Rogers">Will Rogers</a><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>, is virtually never united, even in the face of an <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_risk.html" title="Existential risk">existential risk</a>.</p>
<p><b>Military Science Fiction</b> - This is a well-written example of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_science_fiction.html" title="Military science fiction">military science fiction</a> subgenre. The novel's historical perspective on the military narrative, looking back 200 years into the past, enables the author to be more thoughtful than many others writing about the nature and causes of war.</p>
<p><b>Ancient Greece – the Spartans</b> - A somewhat old-fashioned emphasis on the roots of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_culture.html" title="Western culture">Western culture</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. Reminiscent of some of the writing of Victor Davis Hansen on ancient history and modern culture and politics.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The story of the Resistance can be viewed as a retelling of the story of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Thermopylae_fd42.html" title="Battle of Thermopylae">Battle of Thermopylae</a> and the events surrounding it, with Christopher Sim in the role of Leonidas.</p>
<p><b>History is Bunk<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></b> - What happened in the past can be very different from what is or can be known about it today. As in the movie <i><a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashomon_%28film%29.html" title="Rashomon (film)">Rashomon</a></i>, the same event seen from different viewpoints can look entirely different.</p>

<p><b>A Talent for War</b> is not one of the three novels annotated under Jack McDevitt's name in the current (fifth) edition of <i>Ascent of Wonder</i>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> According to the editors' criteria for inclusion, this reflects an editorial judgment that the novel is not among McDevitt's most important. However, this novel is the first of a series of three science fiction/mystery novels in the <i>Alex Benedict</i> series and is therefore significant for providing a foundation for the two better-known sequels.</p>
