<p>The housemates are distinctly unhappy upon learning that Wooldoor has been making excursions into the dangerous <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_action.html" title="Live action">Live Action</a> Forest, but they are even more upset when they discover what he brought back with him: a live action cow. They return Live Action Cow to the Forest, but Wooldoor feels he cannot live without her, and goes to get her back. When he reaches the forest, he is attacked by the most fearsome creature in the Live Action Forest, Live Action Squirrel With Big <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testicles.html" title="Testicles">Balls</a>. The housemates (who have followed Wooldoor there) are terrified, but just when all hope seems lost, Live Action Cow shows up and fends the squirrel off. The housemates, out of gratitude, decide to take the cow back home, but almost as soon as they get there, the cow begins foaming at the mouth. Foxxy informs Wooldoor that Live Action Cow has developed <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabies.html" title="Rabies">rabies</a>, and Wooldoor will have to take the cow out back and shoot her.</p>
<p>Wooldoor takes the cow outside, but he is unable to finish the deed, so he fakes her death and returns to the house. The housemates discover what Wooldoor did when they see a news report that the cow has gone on a <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spree_killer.html" title="Spree killer">rampage</a>, and is destroying town after town. After chasing her all over the countryside, the group finally finds Live Action Cow back at the <i>Drawn Together</i> house. Federal agents swarm the place, preparing to shoot the cow, but Wooldoor steps in front of the cow to keep her from being shot. The agents inform Wooldoor that they're prepared to kill him too if necessary, but just as they are about to shoot Wooldoor, Live Action Cow jumps in front of the bullet, saving Wooldoor's life. Wooldoor is saddened by Live Action Cow's death, but comes to terms with his grief through a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_editing.html#Classical_montage_sequence" title="Film editing">montage</a> of their times together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Toot is depressed and frustrated that she can't get anyone to escort her to her fat camp's ten year reunion. She retreats to the attic to comfort herself by gorging on <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_candy.html" title="Cotton candy">cotton candy</a> (which is actually the <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiberglass.html" title="Fiberglass">fiberglass</a> insulation in the walls), but while she is there, she discovers the answer to her problems: a video game <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheat_code.html" title="Cheat code">cheat manual</a> which can make Xandir do anything she wants, including accompanying her to her reunion.</p>
<p>Toot arrives at the reunion with Xandir in tow, and much to the campers' envy and Xandir's confusion, they actually share something resembling a romantic experience together. However, just as Toot takes the stage with Xandir to be honored, the other campers find Toot's cheat book and expose her scam, leaving Toot mortified and Xandir upset. Toot becomes depressed once more and Xandir, taking pity, tries to comfort Toot by making her feel that at least part of their magical time was real and not just the result of the cheat book. This makes Toot very briefly happy before she challenges him to prove it. She promptly jumps on him, and in effect, rapes him. Afterward, Xandir tells Toot that he does like her, but he is still gay after all, and can't be with her romantically. She asks if he would be attracted to her if he weren't gay. Xandir says no, but he likes her as a friend, and slept with her out of <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pity_sex.html" title="Pity sex">pity</a>. Toot says she'll take that, and promptly jumps on him again.</p>
<p><b>Musical number</b>: "<a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Moment_like_This_%28Kelly_Clarkson%29_9956.html" title="A Moment like This (Kelly Clarkson)">A Moment Like This</a>", sung by Toot during her romp with Xandir. The song was originally performed by <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Clarkson_b0db.html" title="Kelly Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>. Also, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooke_Ramel_45f0.html" title="Brooke Ramel">Brooke Ramel</a>'s "I Wanted You to Know" makes its third appearance in the series, this time playing during the montage where Wooldoor remembers Live Action Cow.</p>

<ul>
<li>When the cast is at the dinner table (complete with <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Sabbath</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_prayers_and_blessings_39fa.html#Candle_lighting_blessings_before_Shabbat" title="List of Jewish prayers and blessings">candles</a>), Captain Hero says grace by first speaking in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, waving his hands as women do in the Jewish blessing, then following with some words of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>; ("And may señor <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> watch over us all"). Traditionally males only light Sabbath candles when there are no women present, and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover.html" title="Passover">Passover</a> isn't mentioned, at least not in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>. Thus the inconsistent religious affiliations and sexual tendencies of Captain Hero, previously demonstrated in "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Orphan_Hero_5a22.html" title="Little Orphan Hero">Little Orphan Hero</a>" and "<a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nanny_%28Drawn_Together_episode%29_9d88.html" title="Super Nanny (Drawn Together episode)">Super Nanny</a>," are elegantly blended.
<ul>
<li>Toot performs the hand motions along with Captain Hero, but none of the others accompany them in this; this, coupled with her last name of Braunstein, would seem to indicate Toot is <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> states that the Shabbat (and Chanakah) candles can ONLY be lit by a woman and it is tradition that the patriarchs lived in darkness on Shabbat from the time they left home until the time that they were married. It is possible, however, that Captain Hero is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform</a> Jew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After Wooldoor talks to the fire fairy, the image of a house on fire appears in his eyes; the house is the <i>Drawn Together</i> house.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The live-action shot of Foxxy's feet is the same one that appeared in "<a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Tub_%28Drawn_Together_episode%29_ef8f.html" title="Hot Tub (Drawn Together episode)">Hot Tub</a>," only the positions of the right and left feet are reversed. In both cases, though Foxxy is wearing boots in the scene, the live action feet are bare. The live action shot of her teeth is the same one that appeared in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_One_Wherein_There_Is_a_Big_Twist_c243.html" title="The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist">The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist</a>" during the close-up shot of her victory celebration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Captain Hero's line "Save yourselves!" was originally used in "<a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Tub_%28Drawn_Together_episode%29_ef8f.html" title="Hot Tub (Drawn Together episode)">Hot Tub</a>." In an interview on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a>'s website, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jess_Harnell_1e07.html" title="Jess Harnell">Jess Harnell</a> states that he always uses the line when signing <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autograph.html" title="Autograph">autographs</a>, believing it is a perfect summation of Captain Hero's character.<a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/drawn_together/videos/behind_the_scenes/index.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/drawn_together/videos/behind_the_scenes/index.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Through the first half of the episode, everyone refers to Live Action Cow as male, but halfway through the episode, they suddenly start referring to the cow as female, with no explanation. (Live Action Cow must be considered female, however, since the photograph that the show uses is of a female cow with <a href="../../../u/d/d/Udder.html" title="Udder">udders</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foxxy appears to have regained possession of the Foxxy 5 van. Previously, her battered bandmates had absconded with it after Foxxy ran them over and left them for dead in the garage in "<a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Hero%27s_Marriage_Pact_ea81.html" title="Captain Hero's Marriage Pact">Captain Hero's Marriage Pact</a>."

<li>Wooldoor's memories of Live Action Cow montage includes a number of references to previous episodes. In one shot, Wooldoor reenacts the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eli%C3%A1n_Gonz%C3%A1lez_4161.html" title="Elián González">Elián González</a> photograph (which the show also used in "<a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxxy_vs._the_Board_of_Education_7d97.html" title="Foxxy vs. the Board of Education">Foxxy vs. the Board of Education</a>") while wearing his hat and goggles from "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_One_Wherein_There_Is_a_Big_Twist_c243.html" title="The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist">The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist</a>." The shot of Wooldoor walking in crutches comes from "<a href="../../../r/e/q/Requiem_for_a_Reality_Show_ea75.html" title="Requiem for a Reality Show">Requiem for a Reality Show</a>." Also appearing in the montage are the Sweetcake genocide of the Sockbats, Wooldoor's suicide, and Wooldoor's <i><a href="../../../d/i/g/Dig_Dug_3b4d.html" title="Dig Dug">Dig Dug</a></i> coffin escape (all from "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_One_Wherein_There_Is_a_Big_Twist%2C_Part_II_e6eb.html" title="The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II">The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II</a>"), as well as another appearance of the oft-used "<a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gags_on_Drawn_Together_df4c.html#Visuals" title="Running gags on Drawn Together">Monkey Man</a>" shot. In each case, Live Action Cow is digitally inserted into the shot in an obviously artificial manner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is the second episode in which Ling-Ling has no speaking role, the first being "<a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Pranking_No._2_ed20.html" title="Dirty Pranking No. 2">Dirty Pranking No. 2</a>." This would be the first of several Season Two episodes in which Ling-Ling does not speak, the others being "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lemon-AIDS_Walk_d319.html" title="The Lemon-AIDS Walk">The Lemon-AIDS Walk</a>," "<a href="../../../a/l/z/Alzheimer%27s_That_Ends_Well_12a4.html" title="Alzheimer's That Ends Well">Alzheimer's That Ends Well</a>," and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Drawn_Together_Clip_Show_0fd8.html" title="The Drawn Together Clip Show">The Drawn Together Clip Show</a>" (though he does speak in some of the clips, he does not speak in the "new" parts of the episode).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foxxy refers to her child Timmy again, whom she had previously mentioned in "<a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Pranking_No._2_ed20.html" title="Dirty Pranking No. 2">Dirty Pranking No. 2</a>," implying that she had to sell him on the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_market.html" title="Black market">black market</a>. Here she claims that she had to shoot Timmy when it looked like he had <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabies.html" title="Rabies">rabies</a> (though he was probably just brushing his teeth). Future Timmy references would be of an even more random nature, indicating that his presence is more of a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> than show <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_presenter.html" title="News presenter">news anchor</a> who delivers the report about Live Action Cow's rampage looks exactly like the man who administered Ling-Ling's driving test in "<a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nanny_%28Drawn_Together_episode%29_9d88.html" title="Super Nanny (Drawn Together episode)">Super Nanny</a>."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After this episode aired, a clip of an extended, more graphic version of the Toot/Xandir sex scene began circulating on the internet, but it has since been removed by all sites known to have hosted it. Whether the scene will appear intact on the second season DVD is unknown.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When this episode aired on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comedy_Network_4175.html" title="The Comedy Network">The Comedy Network</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_UK_and_Ireland_c7f9.html" title="MTV UK and Ireland">MTV</a> in the UK, it was completely uncensored.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>At one point when Toot is in the attic, the "camera" pans upwards through the ceiling/attic floor. In the space between the ceiling and attic floor are the skeletons of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Simpson_9f2e.html" title="Lisa Simpson">Lisa Simpson</a>; <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> itself often employs similar jokes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In another <i>Simpsons</i> spoof, a scene showing the rabid Live Action Cow's rampage through the cartoon universe states that the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_%28The_Simpsons%29_365b.html" title="Springfield (The Simpsons)">Springfield</a> within <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons'</a> continuity is in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, referencing the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> that the show never reveals the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield%27s_state_%28The_Simpsons%29_394f.html" title="Springfield's state (The Simpsons)">true state</a>.
<ul>
<li>Bart Simpson can also be seen hanging out a window when the news broadcast switches to the scene in Springfield, Connecticut. The house appears to be that of the Simpson family themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This episode also makes fun of <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedrock_%28The_Flintstones%29_23d3.html" title="Bedrock (The Flintstones)">Bedrock</a> from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flintstones_047c.html" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a></i>, the futuristic city from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jetsons_acdc.html" title="The Jetsons">The Jetsons</a></i>, and even <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a>'s own <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>.
<ul>
<li>When the cast in the Foxxy 5 van enters Bedrock, Clara comments that Bedrock was ruined because its citizens had too much of "a gay old time." This is the last line in the closing theme to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flintstones_047c.html" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a></i> (though in later episodes the line was changed to "a great old time"). In Clara's view, the city was punished for being <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_friendly.html" title="Gay friendly">gay friendly</a>. Also, when the group is driving through Bedrock, you can see everyone's feet under the van making it move, referring to how everyone "drove" in <i>The Flintstones</i>.</li>
<li>I n the futuristic city, Captain Hero says, "We need to stop this crazy thing," a reference to the last line by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Jetson_7f5f.html" title="George Jetson">George Jetson</a> when he takes <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astro_%28The_Jetsons%29_9dac.html" title="Astro (The Jetsons)">Astro</a> for a walk and gets stuck on the speeding treadmill after Astro chases a cat.</li>
<li>When <i>South Park</i> is shown, Spanky says, "I bet if we lived here, more people would watch," referring to <i>South Park</i>'s higher ratings. Also, everyone visible has been killed except for <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_McCormick_6316.html" title="Kenny McCormick">Kenny McCormick</a>. This is a reversal of a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> on <i>South Park</i>, as Kenny was well-known for dying in just about every episode of the show's first five seasons. <a href="../../../m/s/2E/Ms._Choksondik_e873.html" title="Ms. Choksondik">Ms. Choksondik</a> can also be seen with a censor bar covering her mouth.</li>

Toot finds Xandir's cheatbook.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The title of Xandir's cheat book, <i>The Legend of Xandir</i>, is a reference to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> series</a>. The controller attached to the cheat book is a Sony <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3f6f.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> <a href="../../../d/u/a/DualShock_b53b.html" title="DualShock">DualShock</a> controller; however, there have never been any <i>Zelda</i> games released for a Sony console, the franchise being owned by and exclusive to <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The cheatbook being directly attached to the controller is reminiscent of <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codemasters.html" title="Codemasters">Codemasters</a>' <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Genie_6ccd.html" title="Game Genie">Game Genie</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/t/Datel.html" title="Datel">Datel</a>'s <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Replay_5810.html" title="Action Replay">Action Replay</a>/<a href="../../../g/a/m/GameShark_26e8.html" title="GameShark">GameShark</a> and similar devices that interface with game cartridges to enter cheat codes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first cheat Toot uses from the Xandir cheat book is an adaptation of the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami_Code_6533.html" title="Konami Code">Konami Code</a>, arguably the most famous video game <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheat_code.html" title="Cheat code">cheat code</a>. While the original code is defined as "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start", Toot uses a variant that ends "B, A, B, A, start". As the controller was for a PlayStation, B and A had to be replaced (with X and Circle, respectively); despite this, Toot recited it with B and A.</li>
<li>Wooldoor hiding Live Action Cow in the closet is a reference to Elliot hiding E.T. in the closet in <i><a href="../../../e/2E/t/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_5ed1.html" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This episode makes several references to <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i>:
<ul>
<li>Captain Hero's candle igniting laser eyes make the same sound as <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_Star_Trek_0d70.html" title="Weapons of Star Trek">phaser weapons</a> used by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Federation_of_Planets_abb7.html" title="United Federation of Planets">Federation</a>.</li>
<li>When Toot asks the housemates which of them is going to escort her to the reunion, they all immediately fade out of the scene, using the same <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_effect.html" title="Special effect">special effects</a> used on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Star Trek</a></i> when characters beamed into and out of a particular location using the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transporter_%28Star_Trek%29_ca74.html" title="Transporter (Star Trek)">transporter</a>.</li>
<li>The music during the fight between Live Action Cow and Live Action Squirrel with Big Balls is similar to the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> fight theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the group is about to take Live Action Cow back to the forest, Wooldoor tries to stop them by claiming that the others won't take her back because she will have his stink on her, referring to the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> that mother birds will reject their babies if they detect human scent on them.<a href="http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/babybird.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/babybird.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> However, this works with mammal babies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Toot thinks she might be confusing her memories with a <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> movie, the movie being parodied is <i><a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_on_the_Fourth_of_July_a36e.html" title="Born on the Fourth of July">Born on the Fourth of July</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At one point, Foxxy says that live-action and animation don't mix. Though many films over the years have combined live action and animation, Foxxy is most likely referring to the recent spate of live action films with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer-generated_imagery.html" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI</a>-rendered main characters, such as <i><a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_%28film%29_7069.html" title="Scooby-Doo (film)">Scooby-Doo</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield_%28film%29.html" title="Garfield (film)">Garfield</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_d5f8.html" title="The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></i>. The CGI effects in these films are widely perceived as being awkwardly rendered and poorly integrated into the film's live action sequences, creating an unrealistic, jarring effect. This could also be a play on <i><a href="../../../l/o/o/Looney_Tunes_dcd6.html" title="Looney Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>'</i>s two live action films, <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Jam_2006.html" title="Space Jam">Space Jam</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Looney_Tunes%7E_Back_in_Action_4281.html" title="Looney Tunes: Back in Action">Looney Tunes: Back in Action</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Live Action Squirrel with Big Balls is a photograph of a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sciurinae.html" title="Sciurinae">Cape Ground Squirrel</a> that has been circulating for some time, often being marketed and printed on posters and greeting cards to promote sexual <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innuendo.html" title="Innuendo">innuendo</a> humor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The sound effects heard when Live Action Squirrel with Big Balls is chased off are similar to those heard in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna-Barbera_355d.html" title="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> cartoons when a character runs away.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After Xandir agrees to escort her to the reunion, Toot does the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truffle_shuffle.html" title="Truffle shuffle">truffle shuffle</a> in celebration. This is a reference to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Goonies_2a8a.html" title="The Goonies">The Goonies</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wooldoor's story in this episode is a parody of <i><a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Yeller_f6bc.html" title="Old Yeller">Old Yeller</a></i>; several scenes parallel the film directly. Just like the dog in <i>Old Yeller</i>, Live Action Cow contracts <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabies.html" title="Rabies">rabies</a> protecting the group from a wild animal; finally, Wooldoor, just like Travis in <i>Old Yeller</i>, is forced to take her out and shoot her.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The scene where a flock of birds swarm the housemates is a reference to <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Birds_%28film%29_8041.html" title="The Birds (film)">The Birds</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The camp's name, Camp Really Fat David, is a pun on the name of the presidential retreat <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_David_0f90.html" title="Camp David">Camp David</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The camp reunion theme is "Enchantment Under the Seafood," a reference to "Enchantment Under the Sea," the school dance in <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_d4da.html" title="Back to the Future">Back to the Future</a></i>.
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="../../../d/t/_/Image%7EDt_210_fatcamp_m4.jpg_a01c.html" class="internal" title="Toot at fat camp."><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f6/Dt_210_fatcamp_m4.jpg/180px-Dt_210_fatcamp_m4.jpg" alt="Toot at fat camp." width="180" height="144" longdesc="../../../d/t/_/Image%7EDt_210_fatcamp_m4.jpg_a01c.html" class="thumbimage" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a href="../../../d/t/_/Image%7EDt_210_fatcamp_m4.jpg_a01c.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="../../../skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>
Toot at fat camp.</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Jelly Donuts' ring leader at the fat camp who torments Toot is modeled after the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Comics_cc5c.html" title="Harvey Comics">Harvey Comics</a> character <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Lotta_94b9.html" title="Little Lotta">Little Lotta</a>, a strong, overweight girl who appeared in the <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Rich_2fbe.html" title="Richie Rich">Richie Rich</a></i> comics before being spun off into her own comic book series.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After gutting the truck driver, Wooldoor wears his skin and poses as the driver to tell his family, "I love you." This is a reference to serial killer <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Gein_9bdd.html" title="Ed Gein">Ed Gein</a>, who not only would take the skin of his victims and make furniture covering, but would wear it as if he were the victims themselves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the fat campers feast, the scene is a parody of the lowering of livestock into the <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velociraptor.html" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a> pit in <i><a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurassic_Park_%28film%29_8414.html" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>; the goat resembles those from the comic <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Far_Side_6f1e.html" title="The Far Side">The Far Side</a></i>. The piece of meat falling out of Toot's mouth also refers to <i>Jurassic Park</i>, namely the scene where the goat's leg falls onto the tour car's sunroof.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the fat women use the cheat book to manipulate Xandir, they briefly turn him into a <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Kart_7a2b.html" title="Mario Kart">Mario Kart</a></i> character. In two other transformations, Xandir has giant feet and a big head; this is a reference to cheat codes from the game <i><a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjo-Kazooie_11cb.html" title="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></i> used to make those changes in the main character, Banjo.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the reunion, Xandir is wearing black pants pulled low enough to show his underwear, a bow tie around his neck, and no shirt—the official "uniform" of sorts for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chippendales_dancers.html" title="Chippendales dancers">Chippendales dancers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The scene of Toot standing on stage getting doused with blood is a reference to <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrie_%28novel%29.html" title="Carrie (novel)">Carrie</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Live Action Cow saves Wooldoor by jumping in front of him in <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slow_motion.html" title="Slow motion">slow motion</a>, the sound effect that plays is the one that was heard in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man_a7fa.html" title="The Six Million Dollar Man">The Six Million Dollar Man</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bionic_Woman_e236.html" title="The Bionic Woman">The Bionic Woman</a></i> whenever the title characters would perform their superhuman feats, usually also in slow motion.</li>
