<dl>
<dd>I haven't found a definitive <i>ancient</i> source for the genealogy yet, but the <i>Oxford Classical Dictionary</i> supports <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegina_%28mythology%29.html" title="Aegina (mythology)">Aegina (mythology)</a> as the common ancestor of Achilles and Patroclus; she was Menoetius' mother and Peleus' paternal grandmother. I feel like there should be something supporting that in Apollodorus' <i>Library</i>, but I have only the second volume of the Loeb edition of that in hard copy, and the Perseus Project is giving me difficulty. Frustratingly, the index of Apollodorus vol. II (Loeb edition) says that there's a mention of Actor (Menoetius' father) on page 97 of the <i>first</i> volume; if you have access to a copy of that, you could check to see if it also mentions Menoetius' mother as being Aegina.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The familial relationship is pretty distant anyhow; Aegina had Menoetius by Actor, and Aeacus by Zeus, so they'd be "half-first cousins once removed" if the English language made such a distinction. (I think other languages do.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Interestingly, Apollodorus gives <i>four</i> different possibilities for the identity of Patroclus' mother. One of the four is Polymele, daughter of Peleus; if you go with that version of Patroclus' parentage, then in <i>addition</i> to being Achilles' first cousin once removed (on the side of Menoetius), Patroclus would <i>also</i> be his nephew!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ultimately, all these genealogies are a bit random, since different ancient mythographers had conflicting ideas about who was related to whom and how. It probably reflects differences in the stories over geography and time. But I don't think that the notion that Achilles and Patroclus were kinsmen (as well as great friends and whatever else) is controversial. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 17:05, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings.

I am curious RE the ongoing life of the article and unclear RE AFD protocols that might determine its staying or going. If you are the lone nay vote, I ask that you reconsider. If it goes onto a larger forum for review in lieu of dying with a single thumbs down, that would be down right democratic as well. I would like to see it stand, so any advice as to what can be done to further its continued life would be appreciated. Hiiaka 05:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ignoring all rules is good. However, when it comes to a formal process like RfA, we should try to follow them. Those questions exist for good reasons: they provide information vital RfA contributors to render a decision. I wouldn't oppose <i>soly</i> because of that. My main problem was the vandalism. I have a hard time trusting a person with the admin tools if they're going to abuse the ability to edit pages. -- <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelmo_247a.html" title="User:Selmo"><font color="red"><b>Selmo</b></font></a> <sup><i>(<a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelmo_77ab.html" title="User talk:Selmo">talk</a>)</i></sup> 22:52, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't agree with you about the questions, but I do see your point of view.

<p>They're at it again after I removed their chat. This is NOT <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>. I'm sensing a strange feeling that either <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Kitsch_abb6.html" title="Taylor Kitsch">Taylor Kitsch</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Strait_2aca.html" title="Steven Strait">Steven Strait</a> are chatting with these people--but I have a hunch that that's a stupid thing to think. In case you missed it, there was a chat vandal, Beccaboo 06 from a month ago that was blocked indefinitely just because of the irrelevant chat. I think it's time for some administrators to intervene with the inappropriate behavior which will NOT be tolerated here. What template should we use to inform them of this behavior besides the "seriously" (joking) template? --<a href="../../../w/t/g/User%7EWTGDMan1986_196a.html" title="User:WTGDMan1986">WTGDMan1986 (D.F. <font face="Times" color="#3333FF" size="2"><i>"Jun Kazama Master"</i></font> Williams)</a> 14:43, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I had to revert their little chat AGAIN, probably (excuse my foul language) pissing Taylor and Steven off, which makes <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jun_Kazama_74f9.html" title="Jun Kazama">Jun Kazama</a> happy to hit them with (WS)2,1,1,1,2,3,4,3,3,4 (10-hit combo) until they are K.O.'ed (sorry for the imaginative thinking--I am a writer, you know) and make them learn the error of their ways. They're acting like Beccaboo 06, which makes administrators angry.

<p>Thank you for participating in my RfA. I decided to end it; more time is needed, and I probably need a bit more experience. From here, I think I'll look at community discussion, AfD and the like.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you sure that it's Herzog's mother, not father, that is of Croat descent? I trust that you have the source, I just wanted to double-check.--<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 02:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Gunnar-</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the text from the December issue of Harper's Magazine: "<i>Born Werner Stipetic in Munich in 1942, Herzog grew up in a lonely mountain village in Bavaria with a doting Croatian mother and an absent father.</i>" That certainly doesn't rule out a Croat father, but it's pretty unequivocal as to the mother's ethnicity.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I get Harper's every month, so if there's a correction in the January issue, I'll be sure to amend the article. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 14:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coelacan, I did take that into account when I closed out the decision.

<dd>Forgive me, Coelacan; I've mislead you. I did not, as suggested above, elucidate my thinking on that AfD's talk page.

<dd>Righto. I don't see a need to drag it through DRV, as I believe that if you took that into consideration, then it <i>was</i> closed properly. I think there's some more work that can be done on the article, though. Could you restore it to my userspace where I can work on it for a week or so, with the provision that when I move it into article space, I will immediately relist it at AFD?

<p>Hi. I predicted this article would be deleted and you made the correct decision following consensus.

<p>Hi again. Per discussion in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Angie_Phillips" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>, it was suggested that a request of the AfD closing admin that the AfD be extended is a good course of action.

<p>Why are you continually redirecting the entry "smug" to "snob"? They have different meanings and are different parts of language- smug is an adjective and snob is a noun. 140.107.63.220 19:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I just went and had a look at Smug, and I see that it redirects to <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snob.html" title="Snob">Snob</a>, which is less than ideal, I suppose. I reverted you once, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smug&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smug&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">other editors have reverted you other times</a> because you continually replace the redirect with two words: "overly self-satisfied".

I realize that "smug" and "snob" are at best casually related to one another, and perhaps we should consider deleting the page for "smug" entirely. If there's a better article that we should redirect Smug to, I'd be happy to discuss it with you. If you'd like to help with dictionary definitions, have a look at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a>.

<dd>As the smug turns: Looking through things with a finer-toothed comb, I found that this article's existence was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Smug_2453.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Smug">debated once back in '05</a>, and a strong consensus was found to delete it for much the same reasons I elucidated above. So this is now a fairly moot argument, and I've deleted the article.

<dd>Thanks for the info! I didn't realize that definitions were not allowed. (although I don't see why they shouldn't be, but I'll read up on that.) More on the Smug definition: It looks like someone DID start a "smug" page which talked about a Simpson's episode, I believe. This was also deleted- although it seems to me like that sorrt of information is what the wiki collects.</dd>

<p>Welcome back - I'm also on a reasonably limited basis here, and I've pulled out of WP:AIR due to the increasing level of bike shed bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Regardless, as far as the categories go - I would say that <b>propeller aircraft</b> could conceivably include all prop aircraft, but it might be worth organizing it with subcategories. For example, <b>turboprop aircraft</b> and <b>radial-engine aircraft</b> would be children of the overarching propeller category. I don't think the category is empty because of distinctions; I think it's because of people never bothering to sort it. Anyway, might be worth bringing up with the category guys, or you might want to just start filing things as appropriate. I'd probably support whichever route you took!

<p>As you know, your assistance in <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atransferrinemia.html" title="Atransferrinemia">atransferrinemia</a> was greatly appreciated, and with your help, it got on the main page under Did you Know on 2/12! Thanks a bunch! I do have a question for you. Lately, I suppose since because it was on the mainpage, there have been a few unsubstantiated edits to this page, with people changing the number of total cases of the disorder. The issue with this is that they are from non-academic sources. There is one study done by Beutler et al. in 2000 (stated in the 2nd external link) that is the only credible material that I have found to show that there truly is only 8 cases in 6 families worldwide. The person who changed the numbers stated sources that didn't even contain this data. I know my article is temporarily protected, but only until today. Is there a procedure to permanently protect it from vandelism, or at least for a little longer than until tomorrow, or should I wait until more people mess it up? Thanks for your help! <a href="../../../w/i/i/User%7EWiiAlbanyGirl_e2ce.html" title="User:WiiAlbanyGirl">WiiAlbanyGirl</a> 05:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi WAG. There's a couple of things you can do to try to keep unsubstantiated edits from making their way into the article.
<ul>
<li>You can put <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Invisible_comments" title="WP:MOS">invisible comments</a> into the text near where the number of cases is stated, reminding editors that they need to cite sources before making changes. It's a good idea to make an entry on the article's talk page explaining why you think your source is the most reliable one. Remember, other editors have just as much of a right to edit the article as you do.</li>
<li>The above will only work on well-meaning editors, of course. Vandals are another problem. You should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> whenever possible, but if another editor is making edits that you think are detrimental, discuss it with them on their user talk page. If things get to a point where you think it's beyond control, post about it at the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">Administrator's incidents noticeboard</a>. If your problem edits are mostly coming from anonymous IP addresses, then request that the article be semi-protected for a little while at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>. Protection and semi-protection are intended to be temporary, so there's no way to keep the article protected for long periods without good cause. The whole point of the encyclopedia is that anyone can edit it, so the conventional wisdom on page protection is that it should be a last resort. You can read more about that at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Wikipedia:Protection policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Hi there, Nima. I can see that you're a bit upset by Ideogram's actions over there from the way you're canvassing admins for backup. I had a look at the AfD, and although Ideogram is being a little brusque in his manner, he's not doing anything wrong. I personally agree with his position; most of the article's references are in Chinese, which doesn't do much good for an English encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>Don't worry too much about it. I know that UFO studies are your pet subject, but even if that article ends up getting deleted, you can always take the time to find some more references in English and see if you can't make a good case for its <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a>. Deletion isn't the end of the world.
