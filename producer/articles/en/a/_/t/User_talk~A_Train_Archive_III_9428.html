<p>Yeah, I know the fecalcore article is going to be removed. But I'm just messing around with it and learning things more things on Wikipedia, etc. Plus anyways, I'm going to save it either way, make it into a little website or just for my own personal and friend's enjoyment. But yeah, I figure it will be gone soon, so I'll make the most of it. Thanks, I'll see you around.</p>

<p>Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Gabrielsimon/Evidence.</p>
<p>I have added a comment to this discusion, and in coresponding to a question from another editor regarding this, I left this memo:</p>
<p>I copied this from Gabrielsimon's user page. Quote "It has been said that I have a very open mind as well.... I have been called inhumanly patient... and inhuman. If you want to know more, ask. I'm on MSN, YIM and AIM. Leave a message at my email address to learn what the IDs are."</p>
<p>I have been watching this sad saga unfold like a slow motion car crash for several days now. Beyond the obvious squabble that has been going on, I have come to some conclusions (based strictly on my own personal observations) that much of this GS, Ketrovin, Khulhy, Gavin the Chosen (and who knows how many others) is a cry for help from a lonely person. I also feel that many of the typographical and grammatical errors are contrived so as to foster a sympathetic response. I am curious as to what lengths the editors and admins are willing to go to in "babysitting" this individual. I am a new user myself, but is it in the best interest of WP to coddle a person who seems to go out of their way to be obtrusive? I wait, with interest to see how the situation plays itself out. There are a few admins here who I have made positive connections with, and I am inclined to copy this memo to their talk pages just to get some outside opinions. Keep up the good work Nickptar, as a new user I can say I've been impressed with your contributions here. See you "round! Hamster Sandwich 23:30, 8 August 2005 (UTC</p>
<p><b>Fernando</b>, my question to you is; is a comment like this "over the line" of civility? I was hoping to make my opinion clear but not "biting" or invective. Hoping you could add your two cents worth, I trust your judgement.

<li>Well it all comes out in the wash, as they say <a href="../../../g/a/v/User_talk%7EGavin_the_Chosen_20c9.html" title="User talk:Gavin the Chosen">User talk:Gavin the Chosen</a>. My opinion is that hes a nut-job. He goes from user to user like a sad sack looking for help. "Whats a sockpuppet?" "Can you help me?" "I got an email from a friend who told me..." Its all very tawdry and pathetic. Sad. Well sorry to take up your time with this, I just saw a pattern and wanted to report it. Mr. Gavin should be very glad I'm not an admin, because quite frankly I wouldn't have the patience for these shenanigans. I hope he becomes a good editor, and makes the extra work you admins have done with him worthwhile.

<p>fine i will stop adding it to the special operations forces list but if i do add an article per example lets say some force to that list please ask me why i did it first because i usually do not waste my time or put false information on sites for the heck of it.if i do put something on it is because ive seen it in a book etc. also about marine team six.it is mentioned in george fortys book.if you look at the last paragragh about force recon in the marines section you will see in the last sentence or so it mentions marine team 6 an delta force in saying that if your are so called elite enough you could be accepted to those units.please refer back to this.thanks for your help though even if i'm a pain in the a**.see you on the editing floor.</p>

<p>Fernando, I added "fair use" to the bottom of my posting of the church's description of the OT levels to explain my posting it to your talk page, not so that you could simply copy it to the article. I should have explained that you can use your own wording and not post it verbatum. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 06:26, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AI, I posted it verbatum, but cited it with footnotes and all. It's not a copyright violation because I cited it as a reference. I really feel that the article benefits greatly from its presence, and surely no Church secrets are compromised by posting some content from a freely distributed pamphlet, right? <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 06:29, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's ok I know you didn't intentionally mean to violate any copyright, but the material is not from a pamphlet but directly from one of the Scientology books. I merely offered it as a reference from which Wikipedia contributors could NPOV the article. The part mentioning OTIII data to explain the OT levels is POV because OTIII is not the only OT level. If you don't mind, I have a question about attribution as I am still a new user and haven't studied all the Wikipedia policies: Is referencing unpublished material proper attribution? Since it is unpublished, it is unverifiable. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 08:37, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HI Fernando How do you do? Thanks for your note. As Hayedeh performed in Persian Shah's court after 1979 revolution accused her with a funny term "prootione of 'Royal Music'" . They asked her to introduce herself to the revolutionary court.</p>
<p>This article is my research. How can I cite it? I have to create another page in another website and them cite it as refence?</p>

<li>Pejman, the official Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a> prohibits the posting of original research. Don't worry though. Instead of citing your own research as the reference, cite the books and websites that you used to get your research. The "prootione of 'Royal Music'" bit is quite interesting, but doesn't make any sense to someone not familiar with the term. Put it back in, just explain it better so that a common person (like me&#160;;) ) can understand it.

<p>Dear Fernando, I have had source (book, website, etc). I continued Hayedeh activities and works and what I wrote are what saw and knew. It's strange for you but as current regime of Iran is very strick with Hayedeh no one can write about her. So there was no source!</p>

<p>Sure. I believe it belongs for the following reasons, but I am open to input.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many notable African-Americans have contracted it. I.e. <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Johnson_b171.html" title="Magic Johnson">Magic Johnson</a></li>
<li>HIV rates are highest among the African-American community today (2/3 of all new teenage cases). See <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_in_America_4a8a.html" title="AIDS in America">AIDS in America</a></li>
<li>The CDC indicates the reason for this lies behind genetics. See <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a></li>
<li>Many African-American leaders as of late have spoken out against HIV and the need for more testing among their community, including <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Sharpton_c19e.html" title="Al Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> who participated in New York City’s gay pride events in order to build bridges between the two communities because he believes the gay population’s experience in dealing with it would be an invaluable resource to African-Americans.</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think? <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.57.82.114.html" title="User:70.57.82.114">70.57.82.114</a> 21:05, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That's all perfectly reasonable thinking, and the more I consider it the more sense it makes. At first blush it seemed like a racist edit to me, and I'm glad I asked you about it before I reverted it. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 21:11, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know how much of a Star Trek fan you are, or how much about Star Trek you know, but all of my entreys are from actual Star Trek episodes, please don't accuse me of making up stuff, becuase I hate people that just make up thier own Star Trek facts, and I am insulted that you think I am making this up. I don't think you are a Star Trek fan, because most of the stuff I have put there would be well known to a Star Trek fan.

<dd>Efeesh, please don't take my comments as any kind of accusation. I was afraid that you were going to be put off by the fact that your articles had been nominated for deletion, and I just wanted to explain why. I don't think you're making anything up, although you're quite right, I'm not much of a Star Trek fan. Try not to hold that against me.&#160;;) What I was trying to say is that some of your articles (ex. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_U.S.S._Lalo_4d82.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/U.S.S.

<p>I've done some heavy tweaking to the style (yay prettytable) and merged the date &amp; differences columns. Everything was getting all squashed with four columns, so I did some width specifying for the left and right columns and did a BR for the date/info sections.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is good for now! I tried to keep the headings short too so they'd stay on a single line, although the "Production period &amp; distinguishing features" label is probably slightly less clear than it could be.

<dd>&#160;:D Going through too many pages of VfD in one session leads to a kinda madcap mood. I have a lot of patience for cruft of all sorts - rightly or wrongly it matters more to people than dusty history and other 'obviously noteworthy' subjects, and brings a lot of people into the project. The main problem is stuff seems to get blind keep/deletes based on whether a particular bit of cruft is 'encyclopedic' rather than the sensible option of just sticking the info somewhere more appropriate until there *is* enough information to require having a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goomba.html" title="Goomba">dedicated article</a>. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 15:14, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are over 1 jillion tags out there, don't know if I would have picked "tone" so much as "needs to be trimmed / consolidated" type tag. IF it exists, organization on wikipedia is usually spotty and/or counter-intuitive. If it were de-fluffed I think it would slice out most of the fanboy style clutter at the same time... being a moderate fan of the EU (books) and the main films, my eye is probably somewhat jaundiced. <a href="../../../z/o/t/User%7EZotel_be1b.html" title="User:Zotel">Zotel - the Stub Maker</a> 04:02, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just spent too much time working with personality disorders. I've seen perfectly friendly and nice people freak out unexpectedly and irrevocably many times, or just burn out and fade away after a year of furious productivity, and as such it makes me more circumspect. I'm glad you have the community's support, and I hope everything goes well. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 19:37, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>hello, i guess i should thank you for getting a hold of me. i have been using wikipedia for both business and amusement for some time now and just got sick and tired of some of the dead links and blank stubs on here. although i would not call myself an expert on anything other than my chosen profession, most of the articles that i have written and posted have been about something i know about personally. all of them have to the best of my ability been drafted to be both as briefly informative as possible and, more importantly, to attract the attention of more knowledgable people who are better writers than i am. Since i have apparently drawn your eye and perhaps ire for doing so, i apologize for not, as you might put it, wikifying my text. i confess that i have not done so out of both a bit of laziness and the desire to avoid the risk of doing it wrong, confusing people, and having my contribution rewritten anyway. The manual is rather informative and would be of great help if i were a professional writer rather than an engineer. i would not mind one bit if any or all of my work underwent the process of wikification in the interest of greater clarity or usability. however, should my sentences be deemed too tedious to quickly edit rather having nothing in their place as they were when i came across them, i will either attempt to structure them with the notation your website suggests or will more likely stop contributing. Again, sorry if i made a nusiance of myself and i thank you for your time. yours, bef</p>

<p>I'll take it to heart. His descision and comments pretty much frosted my apples though, and I have read somewhere or other that a two thirds majority can be construed as a concensus in terms of closing VfD articles. Sidaway obviously has an agenda to push, concering "inclusionism", and as I've been doing some investigation of his VfD closures this is readily appearant. Also he responded at his RfC that he will not deign to respond to the issues that users and admins have put forward there and he claims to be "innordinately proud" of his own contributions. This strikes me as more than passingly egomanaical. Oh well. It would be interesting to see what kind of support he could expect if he were nominated for admin at this stage of his WP service. As I said mentioned to him in one of my posts, there will be no possible reason for me to refer to a "Religion and schizotypy" article at any rate. That "facts" in that article are completely subjective and unverifyable. I'll bet you a dollar that nobody does anything like a useful edit to that page in the next year. Lets make that a slurpee...I'd bet a Huge gigantic brain feezing slurpee on it. Sidaway disregards <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">WP:Faith</a>, Don't bite the newbies and probably a couple other cornerstones of the WP with his arbitrary, out of hand and capricious dismissal of my votes. OK...that was my rant...patience and tolerance, patience and tolerance... Thanks for looking the thing over for me. Of course I appreciate your advice. Good luck with the mop and bucket bro! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 03:17, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Considering that my views here have been so marganalized, it very difficlut for people to see past what i belive some on here want them to see, which is anything aginst the "norm" in consideration of how this site is run and the policies are used (or i should say abused), i am not supprised by your responce. Yes i do have a minimum cretieria that i consider, but i also have other factors that i consider as well. Consider that amount of power and responsibility that an admin is suppose to have and use, as i do belive that it is a sigificant deapature from being a standard user much more so then going from an anon to registered, that i think the standardships for adminission need to be extremely stridgent as well. I'll spare you the rest as i could go on for a while. Basically in the flawed system that we have, I rather be proven wrong with an oppose vote then a apporve vote. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÚ</a> 09:03, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It good to see that their are some people that can think for them selves. I hope nooffence was taken with my vote, none was intended, and i hope that you end up being one of the better admins, which is a group few and far between. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÚ</a> 09:10, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Except for the Bob Dylan vandal, who knew he was violating 3RR because he mentioned it, I didn't see any point in repeatedly warning all of the VfD vandal IDs, which were obviously the same person. I warned them twice and they kept doing it by new IDs, so I just started blocking. I am going to be going to bed now, though, so somebody else will have to take over.  :) <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 09:31, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not a problem.  :) Congratulations on the adminship, by the way. I haven't been back long enough yet to know the people who are being nominated, so I haven't been voting. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 09:34, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have pasted the information about the department as I am a student of the department itself. If you think then I can type the things. But I cant change the history, the names of the labs and the research areas of the department. if you still think then I can type the things, but they are better as they are.</p>
