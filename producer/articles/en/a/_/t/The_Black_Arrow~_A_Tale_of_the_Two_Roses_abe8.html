<p><i>The Black Arrow</i> tells the story of Richard (Dick) Shelton during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>: how he becomes a knight, rescues his lady Joanna Sedley, and obtains justice for the murder of his father, Sir Harry Shelton. Outlaws in Tunstall Forest organized by Ellis Duckworth, whose weapon and calling card is a black arrow, cause Dick to suspect that his guardian Sir Daniel Brackley and his retainers are responsible for his father's murder. Dick's suspicions are enough to turn Sir Daniel against him, so he has no recourse but to escape from Sir Daniel and join the outlaws of the Black Arrow against him. This struggle sweeps him up into the greater conflict surrounding them all. The story of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> is told in miniature by <i>The Black Arrow.</i></p>

<p>In the reign of "old <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VI_of_England_8b59.html" title="Henry VI of England">King Henry VI</a>." (1422-1461, 1470-1471) and during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> (1455-1487) the story begins with the Tunstall Moat House alarm bell being rung to begin mustering troops for its absent lord Sir Daniel Brackley, who intends to join the Battle of Risingham. It is then that the "fellowship" known as "The Black Arrow" headquartered in Tunstall Forest begins to strike with its "four black arrows" for the "four black hearts" of Brackley and three of his retainers: Nicholas Appleyard; Bennet Hatch; and Sir Oliver Oates, the parson. The rhyme that is posted in connection with this attack gets the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonist.html" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> Richard (Dick) Shelton, ward of Sir Daniel, to become curious about the fate of his father Sir Harry Shelton. Having been dispatched to Kettley, where Sir Daniel was quartered, and sent to Tunstall Moat House by return dispatch, he also falls in with a fugitive from Sir Daniel, disguised as a boy, alias John Matcham, who in reality is Joanna Sedley, an heiress, kidnapped by Sir Daniel. Coincidentally Sir Daniel was intending to marry Joanna to Dick himself; and, in her male disguise, Joanna brings up the matter to Dick affording her the opportunity of feeling him out on the subject. Dick says he is not interested, but he does ask her if his intended bride is good-looking and of pleasant disposition.</p>

<p>While making their way through Tunstall Forest that covers the better part of Book 1 Joanna tries to persuade Dick to turn against Sir Daniel in sympathy with the Black Arrow outlaws, whose hideout they discover. The next day they are met in the forest by Sir Daniel himself disguised as a leper and making his way back to the Moat House after his side was defeated at the Battle of Risingham. Dick and Joan then follow Sir Daniel to the Moat House. Here Dick changes sides when he finds out that Sir Daniel is the real murderer of his father, and escapes injured from the Moat House. He is rescued by the outlaws of the Black Arrow with whom he throws in his lot for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>The second half of the novel, Books 3-5, tells how Dick rescues his true love Joanna from the clutches of Sir Daniel with the help of both the Black Arrow fellowship and the Yorkist army led by Richard Crookback, the future <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_of_England_e98b.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard III of England</a>.</p>
<p>The second half of the narrative centers around Shoreby, where the Lancastrian forces are well entrenched. Robert Louis Stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4-6 of Book 3 as Dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of Joanna, who is being kept in a house by the sea. They are unsuccessful, and after Joanna is moved to Sir Daniel's main quarters in Shoreby, Dick then visits her in the guise of a Franciscan friar, which was a common disguise during the Wars of the Roses. Stevenson, the popularizer of the tales of the Arabian nights, has Dick tell the tale of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Baba_c09a.html" title="Ali Baba">Ali Baba</a> and the Forty Thieves in Book 4, chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain Arblaster, whose ship Dick and the outlaws had stolen.</p>
<p>Richard Crookback, Duke of Gloucester, makes his appearance in Book 5, with whom Dick keeps his rendezvous. Dick's accurate knowledge of the Lancastrian forces in Shoreby aid Crookback in winning the battle. Dick is also fortunate as a successful commander in this battle. A delighted Crookback accordingly knights Dick, and after the battle gives him 50 horsemen to pursue Sir Daniel, who has escaped Shoreby with Joanna. Dick succeeds in rescuing Joanna, but loses his men in the process. He, Joanna, and Alicia Risingham travel to Holywood where he and Joanna are finally married. In this way he keeps his initial pledge to Joanna to see her safe to Holywood.</p>
<p>Just before the wedding on the outskirts of Holywood Dick encounters a fugitive Sir Daniel, whom he keeps from entering the city and spoiling his wedding. While Sir Daniel slinks away he is shot by the final black arrow from the bow of Ellis Duckworth, who tells Dick, "But be at rest; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore - the fellowship is broken."</p>
<p>Sir Richard and Lady Shelton live in Tunstall Moat House untroubled by the rest of the Wars of the Roses, and the outlaw Lawless lives out his days as he wanted: a Franciscan friar.</p>

<p>From the information given in the novel two time references for the two blocks of action that constitute the narrative can be pinpointed: May, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1460.html" title="1460">1460</a> and January, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1461.html" title="1461">1461</a>. The important time indicator is the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Wakefield_2239.html" title="Battle of Wakefield">Battle of Wakefield</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1460.html" title="1460">1460</a> mentioned at the beginning of Book 3, Chapter 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Months had passed away since Richard Shelton made his escape from the hands of his guardian. These months had been eventful for England. The party of Lancaster, which was then in the very article of death, had once more raised its head. The Yorkists defeated and dispersed, their leader butchered on the field, it seemed, - for a very brief season in the winter following upon the events already recorded, as if the House of Lancaster had finally triumphed over its foes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is because Richard Crookback, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_of_England_e98b.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard III of England</a>, is presented as an adult active in the Wars of the Roses in January, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1461.html" title="1461">1461</a> that Stevenson points out in a footnote in Book 3, Chapter 6: "At the date of this story, Richard Crookback could not have been created Duke of Gloucester; but for clearness, with the reader's leave, he shall so be called." Richard was born in 1452, so he would have been merely 8 years old at the time of this story. A footnote in Book 5, Chapter 1 reads: "Richard Crookback would have been really far younger at this date [i.e. January, 1461]." Stevenson follows <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> in retrojecting Richard of Gloucester into an earlier period of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> and portraying him as a dour <a href="../../../k/y/p/Kyphosis.html" title="Kyphosis">hunchback</a>—Stevenson: "the formidable hunchback" (Book 5, Chapter 2). (See <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VI%2C_part_2_756f.html" title="Henry VI, part 2">Henry VI, part 2</a>; <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VI%2C_part_3_0d0d.html" title="Henry VI, part 3">Henry VI, part 3</a>; and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_%28play%29_1944.html" title="Richard III (play)">Richard III (play)</a>.) This characterization closely follows the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_myth.html" title="Tudor myth">Tudor myth</a>, a tradition that overly vilified <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_of_England_e98b.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard of Gloucester</a> and cast the entire English <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_Century_605f.html" title="Fifteenth Century">Fifteenth Century</a> as a bloody, barbaric chaos in contrast to the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_period.html" title="Tudor period">Tudor</a> era of law and order.</p>
<p>Curiously, the 1948 film portrays Richard Gloucester in a more favorable light than in the novel, somewhat anticipating the work of Paul Murray Kendall to rehabilitate him (Kendall, <i>Richard III,</i> 1956). When Gloucester is told he is "more than kind," he replies jokingly that such rumors would ruin his [bad] "reputation": the revision of the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_myth.html" title="Tudor myth">Tudor myth</a>?</p>
<p>The Battle of Shoreby, a fictitious battle that is the main event of Book 5, is modeled after the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_St_Albans_2792.html" title="First Battle of St Albans">First Battle of St Albans</a> in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. This battle in history as in the novel is a victory for the House of York. The presence of an abbey church in Shoreby is reminiscient of the abbey church of <a href="../../../t/e/w/Tewkesbury.html" title="Tewkesbury">Tewkesbury</a> to which the Lancastrians fled for <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctuary.html" title="Sanctuary">sanctuary</a> after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tewkesbury_9f37.html" title="Battle of Tewkesbury">battle</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/7/1471.html" title="1471">1471</a>.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson indicates that Tunstall of <i>The Black Arrow</i> is a real place by writing in the <i>Prologue: John Amend-All</i>: "Tunstall hamlet at that period, in the reign of old King Henry VI., wore much the same appearance as it wears today." In south-east <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffolk.html" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, England, 18 miles NE of <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipswich.html" title="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>, less than 10 miles from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> a "Tunstall" is located with an accompanying forest. The similarity of place-names near this <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunstall%2C_Suffolk_6367.html" title="Tunstall, Suffolk">Tunstall, Suffolk</a> to place-names in the novel also suggest that this is Stevenson's Tunstall: Kettley is Kettleburgh in actuality, Risingham is <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framlingham.html" title="Framlingham">Framlingham</a>, and Foxham is <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farnham%2C_Suffolk_d91c.html" title="Farnham, Suffolk">Farnham, Suffolk</a>. The identities of Shoreby-on-the-Till and Holywood are probably <a href="../../../o/r/f/Orford%2C_Suffolk_250e.html" title="Orford, Suffolk">Orford</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leiston.html" title="Leiston">Leiston</a> respectively. Orford is on the North Sea and has a road going to the northwest to Framlingham (the "highroad from Risingham to Shoreby"), and Leiston is also on the North Sea with a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey.html" title="Abbey">abbey</a> like Holywood of the novel. The River Till, which figures largely in Book 1 of the novel, would then be the River Deben in actuality. The River Deben flows near Kettleburgh.</p>
<p>The name of the main character Richard Shelton and his inheritance, Tunstall, were the name and title of an actual historical personage, Sir Richard Tunstall. He, as a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancastrian.html" title="Lancastrian">Lancastrian</a> and ardent supporter of King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VI_of_England_8b59.html" title="Henry VI of England">Henry VI of England</a>, held <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlech_Castle_882b.html" title="Harlech Castle">Harlech Castle</a> against the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkist.html" title="Yorkist">Yorkists</a> through most of the 1460s when <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_IV_of_England_a1fe.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV of England</a> ruled. In contrast, Richard Shelton, who becomes the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a> of Tunstall at the end of <i>The Black Arrow,</i> is a staunch Yorkist.</p>
<p>Two other anachronisms of Stevenson are in having Sir Oliver and others speak of "Simnel" and "the Walsinghams" as the ones behind the Black Arrow fellowship in the narrative. <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambert_Simnel_4c6d.html" title="Lambert Simnel">Lambert Simnel</a> is the focus of rebellion in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_of_England_2c03.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII's</a> reign (1485-1509), and "the Walsinghams," Stevenson's renaming of the Woodvilles, would have played a part only after May, 1464, when <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_IV_of_England_a1fe.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV</a> married <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Woodville_044e.html" title="Elizabeth Woodville">Elizabeth Woodville</a>.</p>

<p>Stevenson did not like his <i>Black Arrow</i>, referring to it as "tushery" with reference to his use of archaic <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> dialogue. For the planned fourteen-volume <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> edition of his works, Stevenson indicated that he did not want to write an introduction to <i>The Black Arrow</i>—his wife Fanny, however, did so for the 1905 Biographical Edition of his works. <i>The Black Arrow</i> is in good company as Stevenson also did not like his <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strange_Case_of_Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_8ebc.html" title="The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></i> (see below: links to the two volumes of his correspondence). The <i>Black Arrow</i> consists of 79,658 words, so it can be classified a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> rather than a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novella.html" title="Novella">novella</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelette.html" title="Novelette">novelette</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short story</a>, or <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_fiction.html" title="Flash fiction">flash fiction</a>.</p>
