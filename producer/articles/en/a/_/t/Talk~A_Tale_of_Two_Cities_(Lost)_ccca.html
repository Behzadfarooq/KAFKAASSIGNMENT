<p>Previous episodes have seperated the 'current' and 'flashback' storylines into two halves, to make the description flow better. Any reason why this was changed for this episode? The Others' bit can be included in the 'current' events (since, although a flashback, it was a prelude to the rest of the 'current' storyline), but Jack's should be moved into its own section as per the previous 40-odd episodes.

<dd>From what I've seen (and I read all the episode pages in preparation for the Season 3 premier yesterday) only 1 page has the plot split out between current and flashback. I think it reads better this way, as it unfolds the same way the episode actually does <a href="../../../p/n/k/User%7EPnkrockr_70a2.html" title="User:Pnkrockr">Pnkrockr</a> 13:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I started entering plot points I remembered from the original airing so some of my entries were a bit out of order. This episode really had 5 different plot arcs (with the flashback) and a lot more quick cuts then other episodes. Many of the scenes are less then 1min in length. It just started to become confusing to read. Although if you prefer the other format it'll only take a bit of cut and paste work. -- N1ck0 05:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did anyone else note the jewel case and liner notes of the CD that Juliet played at the beginning of the episode? The song was clearly the original "Downtown" by Petula Clark (charted 1964-65). However, the liner notes' colors and pattern looked very familiar to me as the album, "Speaking In Tongues" by The Talking Heads, released in June, 1983. I downloaded the episode and single-stepped through the frames and can confirm that the spine of the CD case clearly reads "Talking Heads Speaking In Tongues".</p>
<p>The disc itself has no artwork on it, but on a paused frame, I can read the CD's ID# as "JN 94743 A" (A means side A). A Google search reveals the ID# to correspond the the CD "Okemah And The Melody Of Riot" by Son Volt, issued in July, 2005. Interestingly, this CD is a dual-sided disc, which accounts for the lack of artwork on the A-side shown (which is really the B-side, since the "down" side is what is played).</p>
<p>What is the significance of all of this? Who knows? Probably, this is just sloppiness of the part of the director due to convenience; presumably, nobody had an actual Petula Clark CD with "Downtown" on it. The use of a double-sided CD/DVD makes it difficult to identify the disc in real time, but with downloadable shows, everything is subject to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Although I sincerely doubt it, but I can't fully exclude the possibility that there is some deeper meaning to the CD case and its contents. Perhaps some hint to the dating of items available to "The Others"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't have to pause the show to see that that jewel case is from "Speaking in Tongues", and I was really confused when the song played on the CD player was not from that album. Point is sort of moot, though. We'll get into an "Original Research" revert war (as one editor has already termed this as OR). Or, we'll get into a "insignificant detail" revert war, as <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_mediation_Lost_episodes_7992.html#Proposal_3" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Lost episodes">set of guidelines</a> were debated that restrict trivia if it is deemed insignificant. There was an extensive debate along these same lines over if the computer in the hatch was an Apple II (coincidentally, the first episode of last season). Personally, I don't understand why one can identify a song (and an artist) in the body of the article, and that's significant, but one can't identify the CD case visually and identify it. But I won't go through this again and argue the significance. In fact, it is simply significant enough that <i>there is a CD player</i> to begin with. The Others have a CD player? We must realize long before Juliet demonstrates knowledge about Jack that the Others clearly have more recent contact with the world outside the island than we've seen previously in any way. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/d/User%7EBldxyz_01cd.html" title="User:Bldxyz">Bldxyz</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/d/User_talk%7EBldxyz_c7d3.html" title="User talk:Bldxyz">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bldxyz_4c94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bldxyz">contribs</a>) 13:28, October 6, 2006 (UTC)</small> (Ooops.

<dd>Perhaps after the scene was filmed the producers couldn't get approval for use of a Talking Heads song or couldn't pay the license fee. That seems most likely to me. 69.231.194.152 05:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that it's not worth adding to the Wikipedia article. As mentioned above, the CD case was probably a convenient prop. The important part was simply that they *have* CDs. Something worth considering though, was what year that Petula Clark's song came out on CD, what year that the <i>Carrie</i> book was published (was that congruent with CD technology?), and what year that the plot in the <i>Carrie</i> novel was representing, since that may tie in to the polar bear / comic book possibility (meaning, does someone read something, and then things that they read about happen). Or in other words, did one of the Others (Juliet was obviously in a highly emotional state) cause the plane crash with Carrie-esque powers?&#160;;) As for Juliet's knowledge of the outside world, I'm not so sure about that one. Though the implication was that some of the documents may have been modern, in reality, all of the information that she had about Jack, could have been obtained from documents that were already aboard the plane (especially the autopsy report, which probably would have been required documentation to transport a corpse). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:19, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair point about the docs: I am highly suspcious that the file Juliet had was just part of a larger bit of manipulation designed to break Jack, and that's a plausible explanation, but clearly speculation and hence appropriate only for this talk page... fun! <a href="../../../b/l/d/User%7EBldxyz_01cd.html" title="User:Bldxyz">Bldxyz</a> 22:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am 99.9% sure that the book they're reading is Carrie, mainly due to the fact that all of the dark tower books and the stand are far too thick! Carrie is aroudn 250 pages I believe, maybe less, while the Dark Towers are all over 400 or so, and the Stand is 1140 pages long if I remember correctly. With these long lengths, I should think it's obvious that the book she was holding was far too thin, unless I'm missing something huge. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger89_15de.html" title="User:Tigger89">Tigger89</a> 04:00, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
