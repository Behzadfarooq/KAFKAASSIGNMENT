<p>Please refrain from this kind of post. It could be interpreted as a personal attack or offensive behavior in general. Rather than be a jerk about it, it would be better to politely point out the error, and fix it. Especially since you were responding to an edit that is over four months old, and is thus no longer really a key point of discussion.

<p>You're doing a great job adding screenshots for everything, but it would be preferable if they were in PNG format. This allows for the image to be a perfect representation of the onscreen image, and eliminates corruption due to compression, like for example in Image:AgahnimLttP.JPG, you can see a mess of pixels around the characters that wouldn't be there in a PNG. The filesize is smaller too. But anyway, you're doing a great job! <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 04:51, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, you've replaced them... I wasn't *actually* meaning you should do that, merely that you should think about using PNG "in future", but um, yeah, that's great! <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 09:58, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there! I applaud your efforts at cleaning out small articles on minor things from video games. However, I'd like to suggest the following... rather than listing them on VFD, could you please merge them onto some parent article?

<dd>It's a decent enough idea, but you have to consider the fact that these games aren't all associated with eachother. It wouldn't make sense to combine Hooktail and Bubbles. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 18:08, May 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, Blargg may have been a bad example. If the information there is false, then of course it should be removed. What I meant to suggest was something like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_enemies_7531.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series enemies">The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_enemies</a> or <a href="../../../o/c/a/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Ocarina_of_Time_enemies_1808.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time enemies">The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time_enemies</a>, only for Mario games (or each game individually, if that's more appropriate). But since you know a lot more about these games than I do, that decision is up to you really. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 07:33, May 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is an unfinished list, called List of Mario Villains. But even stuff like Bahamutt; half of that article is discussing the link between it and Bahamut. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 07:43, May 25, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">we trust you</a>. If you see misinformation in an article, excise it. If you see information in the wrong place, move it. "half of the article" on <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahamutt.html" title="Bahamutt">Bahamutt</a> in this case means one sentence&#160;:) Very short articles are obvious merge candidates, and while you do have a point about redirects being useless, the general consensus is that spurious redirects don't harm anyone so it's easiest to leave them in place. I'll add that to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">Wikipedia:Merge</a> though. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 15:20, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I will concur with Radiant that if you find fancrufty articles just go ahead and merge them with the parent article, or if you don't want to do that add a {{merge|Article you want it merged with}}-tag to the top. Deletion is a drastic solution, and should probably be reserved for cases where absolutely nothing is salvagable. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 06:56, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well, now, some of the VfDs have ended. Most have been Keep/Merge/Redirect, but the one that really gets me is <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._E.Gadd_ed9f.html" title="Dr. E.Gadd">Dr. E.Gadd</a>. Dr. E.Gadd! How could this be Wikipedia quality?</li>

<p>I noticed you transformed the <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zora.html" title="Zora">Zora</a> article from a redirect into an actual article with actual information. Much appreciated! However, that article was merged into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_races_010d.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series races">The Legend of Zelda series races</a> a short while ago, so there is (possibly redundant) information there also. I think you should do one of two things, based on your preference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restore the redirect and add the new information to the LOZ races article, or</li>
<li>Split off the article by moving the information at LOZ races to the Zora article (you might leave a brief summary on the LOZ races page, with a link to the main article).</li>
</ol>
<p>I would suggest the second option, since LOZ Races is uncomfortably long right now, but I'll let you decide. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a><a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerion_8e19.html" title="User talk:Aerion">//talk</a> 05:23, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ignoring the current rancor (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_The_Mushroom_Kingdom_450a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Mushroom Kingdom">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Mushroom Kingdom</a>), TMK probably is a helfpul site for many Mario subjects. However, Wikipedia has never accepted mass homepage spamming from any url. The IMDB homepage is never linked rather the movie pages used. Similarly a character page from TMK should be directly linked rather than the homepage.</p>
<p>Sadly for TMK which announced its intention of mass spamming, editors will not tolerantly evaluate it and probably every single reference to the site will be removed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 06:09, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What Lotsofissues said. I'm warning you that engaging in a linkspam campaign will result in you being reverted and potentially blocked. I would advise you in the strongest terms to reconsider your participation in any such effort, as it is considered vandalous behaviour not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:11, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then I could link to the game's page on the site. Then, it would fall under relevance and the idea of linking to the appropriate page. That may not apply to Cackletta or Bob-omb, but certainly to Super Mario 64 and Dr. Mario.</p>
<p>Also, FCYTravis, I'm not participating in any such effort. I think TMK should be linked to in some way in External Links, and as one page said, it encourages people to be bold about it. I've made very few posts on their forum, and only visit it occasionally. I hold no bias towards it, since I'm not really a devote member to the site. I put those links up before any of this hostility from two parties came up - it has nothing to do with this issue. I put it up because I'm 'being bold' about what I think should be on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:39, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your contributions to the Nintendo Revolution article. I agree that people should not just remove content "without reason" but I also believe that courtesy goes a long way when it happens. It happened to me a couple times on the Nintendo DS article, where edits were reverted without checking if they should or not. I would just recommend that when you discuss issues or make comments in your edits that are done that you try and remain calm. With something as uncertain as games in development, you MUST provide a source to prevent unneccesary edits or reverts. Same with anything, and even in Rumors, although its more forgiving in that section. A source of a rumor is appreciated. Again thanks for your input and I look forward continuing to work with you as well with everyone else on the article. --<a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitz_5cd1.html" title="User:Ritz">Ritz</a> 17:13, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
