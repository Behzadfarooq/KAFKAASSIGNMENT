<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/l/A_Little_Snow_Fairy_Sugar_d442.html" title="Edit section: Story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Story</span></h2>
<p>The story is based around 11-year-old Saga Bergmann, a young girl in a small German town who lives with her grandmother Regina and works in a coffee shop when not in school. Saga is extremely structured and plans her life down to the minute. One day, she notices a tiny creature in a fluffy outfit that appears to be starving. She offers it a waffle, which helps revive the tiny creature. Saga learns that this tiny creature is Sugar, an apprentice season fairy. Sugar explains that season fairies alter the weather by playing a magical musical instrument, and her specialty is snow, which she creates by playing the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccolo.html" title="Piccolo">piccolo</a>. Sugar is joined by two more apprentice season fairies, Salt (the Sun fairy), an outgoing male fairy who plays the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a> to make the sun shine more brightly, and Pepper (the Wind fairy), a quiet and caring female fairy who plays the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harp.html" title="Harp">harp</a> to make the wind blow.</p>
<p>All three apprentices are shocked at the realization that Saga can see them, since humans are not supposed to be able to see season fairies. Pepper speculates that exceptional humans might be able to see them, which is the best possible explanation. Sugar tells Saga that the three have been sent to Earth to train as full-fledged season fairies, and to do that, they must find the 'Twinkle' (In the Japanese version, the season fairies search for <i>kirameki</i>, which refers to something that sparkles or shines).</p>
<p>Sugar moves into Saga's bedroom and sets up residence, much to the consternation of the super-structured Saga. Saga is a well-meaning, intelligent and highly-organised girl who feels compelled to look after the childish, loud and irresponsible Sugar, who is incapable of looking after herself, as viewers can see when Sugar nearly starved to death before Saga saved her. The story is complicated further with the arrival of three adult season fairies (Turmeric, a cloud fairy, and Ginger, a rain fairy, and the Elder, the leader of the season fairies) and two more apprentices (Basil, a thunder fairy, and Cinnamon, an ice fairy).</p>
<p>With the highly disruptive presence of Sugar, Saga's life goes haywire. Her friends Norma and Anne think that she is losing her mind, and her teacher, Miss Hanna, is worried that her best student is acting strangely. Not at all concerned with her strange behavior is Greta, an egotistical rich girl who considers Saga to be her rival, and Phil, a goofy inventor who keeps trying to persuade Saga to help him with his experiments, if he is not already busy building and trying out his latest device.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Saga Bergmann</b> is the first main character of the story. Her mother has died, but her father's fate is never clarified. She lives with her grandmother in a fictitious small German town called Mühlenburg in the anime; they live in Guttenburg in the manga. She works in a coffee shop and keeps to a strict schedule. In an attempt to get everything finished, she still tends to run late - her encyclopedic knowledge of shortcuts means that she still appears organised. She finds Sugar by accident and offers her a home, which Sugar accepts gratefully.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Saga plays her mother's <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> in the local music shop, because they had to sell it, and respects great pianists. She often has trouble trying to appear sane to her friends when talking to what seems like nothing (as fairies are invisible to other humans). When Sugar leaves Saga to return home, Saga loses the ability to see fairies- and it is implied that people go through the fairy phase when younger so that fairies can gain 'twinkles'. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masumi_Asano_18df.html" title="Masumi Asano">Masumi Asano</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Ruff_4d3b.html" title="Michelle Ruff">Michelle Ruff</a> (English)</span></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Sugar</b>, the second main character, is a female little snow fairy, who tries to use her <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccolo.html" title="Piccolo">piccolo</a> to summon <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow.html" title="Snow">snow</a> from the sky. She has wanted to be a snow fairy since a child in an attempt to follow in her mother's footsteps; a famous snow fairy who could summon snow that is both soft and warm.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Sugar acts like a small child; she is clumsy, stubborn and has a short attention span, and has the habit to kiss whoever she is fond of when she is happy. She tries her best to be friends with Saga, but often gets things wrong. Sugar, like every fairy in the series, has an unequaled love of <a href="../../../w/a/f/Waffles.html" title="Waffles">waffles</a>. In the anime, it is led to believe that she mispronounces waffles as 'waffos'. Whenever Sugar gets excited, she squeals 'waffo!' (in the manga, she said 'waffos' before ever eating a waffle.)<span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomoko_Kawakami_14b7.html" title="Tomoko Kawakami">Tomoko Kawakami</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Forstadt_6f2a.html" title="Rebecca Forstadt">Rebecca Forstadt</a> (English)</span></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Pepper</b> is a female little wind fairy, who uses her <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harp.html" title="Harp">harp</a> to summon <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind.html" title="Wind">wind</a>. She lives in the house of a veterinary who has a newborn baby, and she often cares for the baby and sings it lullabyes.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Pepper is the calmest, most gentle and most polite of the featured fairies. She is very humble in her ability, which is quite developed. In addition, she can talk with animals. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../k/a/o/Kaori_Mizuhashi_2570.html" title="Kaori Mizuhashi">Kaori Mizuhashi</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lara_Cody_19c9.html" title="Lara Cody">Lara Cody</a> (English)</span></dd>

<li><b>Salt</b> is a male little sun fairy, who uses his <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a> to make the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">sun</a> shine more warmly. It is never mentioned where he lives.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Salt wishes to become a sun fairy as his father was one, but ultimately decides that he wants to be a cloud fairy like Turmeric. This is a difficult decision for him. He gets his twinkle immediately before Pepper, leaving Sugar alone on the Earth (except for two other apprentices, Basil and Cinnamon, with whom they do not closely associate). <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomo_Saeki_c065.html" title="Tomo Saeki">Tomo Saeki</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brianne_Siddall_c9e1.html" title="Brianne Siddall">Brianne Siddall</a> (English)</span></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Greta</b> is Saga's self-proclaimed rival. The spoiled daughter of a rich family, she is not as popular as Saga and resents that, often setting up impromptu contests between them in an attempt to prove herself better than Saga, often making a fool of herself. Actually, Greta has a good core (which she won't admit even to herself) and redeems herself at the end of the series. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinami_Nishimura_57db.html" title="Chinami Nishimura">Chinami Nishimura</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Sheh_8a02.html" title="Stephanie Sheh">Stephanie Sheh</a> (English)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Anne</b> and <b>Norma</b> are Saga's best friends. Anne is taller, quiet and more intelligent, while Norma is shorter, bubble-headed and obsessed with (very odd) fashions. They are often concerned about Saga, but support her in whatever she wants to do. Norma - <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../s/a/w/Sawa_Ishige_3d69.html" title="Sawa Ishige">Sawa Ishige</a> (Japanese), Stevie Bloch (English)</span>; Anne - <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akiko_Nakagawa_40a5.html" title="Akiko Nakagawa">Akiko Nakagawa</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mari_Devon_d7b9.html" title="Mari Devon">Mari Devon</a> (English)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Phil</b> and his two friends (lanky <b>Jan</b> and stout <b>Alan</b>) are (often unsuccessful) inventors who often try to enlist Saga, Anne and Norma's help with their latest project. It is speculated that there is a love interest between Phil and Saga. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asami_Sanada_4cfb.html" title="Asami Sanada">Asami Sanada</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Staley_d598.html" title="Steve Staley">Steve Staley</a> (English)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Miss Hanna</b> is the fourth-grade teacher in charge of Saga, Anne, Norma, Greta and Phil's class. She cares for Saga's family situation and therefore is quite concerned at Saga's strange behavior and odd outbursts. She has a pet turtle named <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancelot.html" title="Lancelot">Lancelot</a>. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akiko_Hiramatsu_ff77.html" title="Akiko Hiramatsu">Akiko Hiramatsu</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Gee_1165.html" title="Jessica Gee">Jessica Gee</a> (English)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Vincent</b>, a young actor in the Hammond Theater Troupe, is a talented piano player who admires Ingrid Bergmann (Saga's late mother). He often says things without really thinking about them and forgets them after a while, and he is quick to improvise - two traits which greatly unsettle Saga at first, but later she comes to be close friends with him. (Fans have speculated that Vincent is actually Saga's father because of his interest in her, his familiarity with her mother, and his ability to see season fairies. That is entirely conjecture.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Vincent can see Season Fairies - in a way - but how clearly is revealed only in the series' Special.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Ginger</b> is a beautiful adult <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain.html" title="Rain">rain</a> fairy who plays the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a>. She is honest to the point of hurting, but she means well, and has a crush on a cloud fairy, Turmeric. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../k/o/t/Kotono_Mitsuishi_6c59.html" title="Kotono Mitsuishi">Kotono Mitsuishi</a> (Japanese), Hope Grandflower (English)</span></li>

<li><b>Turmeric</b> is an adult <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloud.html" title="Cloud">cloud</a> fairy who plays the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello.html" title="Cello">cello</a>. Turmeric is a kind, thoughtful and subdued fairy whom Ginger loves and who becomes Salt's role model. He seems oblivious to the affections of the female Season Fairies towards him - including Ginger -; he puts his art first and strives to perfect himself constantly. <span style="font-weight: normal"><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Nojima_ca1b.html" title="Kenji Nojima">Kenji Nojima</a> (Japanese), <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Weisz_c4ad.html" title="Ezra Weisz">Ezra Weisz</a> (English)</span></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Basil</b> (a thunder fairy) and <b>Cinnamon</b> (an ice fairy) are the juvenile delinquents of the series. The two in-training fairies are less successful than Salt, Pepper and Sugar at gaining the twinkle, but they state that they are getting close to getting it when Sugar gets hers - it is presumed that they do finally find it, whatever it may be in their case. They live in an abandoned warehouse and value mischief and fun above all. Cinnamon wildly plays the <a href="../../../c/y/m/Cymbals.html" title="Cymbals">cymbals</a> to summon <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice.html" title="Ice">ice</a> (setting up a very wild face as he does so), and Basil plays the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a> to summon <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder.html" title="Thunder">thunder</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning.html" title="Lightning">lightning</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Grandmother Regina</b> is Saga's grandmother, who she lives with. Regina is a gentle old woman who's good cooking satisfies both Saga and Sugar. Saga often uses the excuse that she is buying waffles for Regina in order to buy extra ones to give to the season fairies. Regina (arguably) seems to know that Saga sees fairies, or at least helps her with coming to terms with them, which implies that Regina herself may have seen Season Fairies as a child.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kanon</b> is the young daughter of one of grandmother Regina's friends, an often absent musician. At age three when she first appears, she is quite a handful, restless and always wanting to play. She, Saga and Sugar (who Kanon can't see) become quite fond of each other, and with Saga's help she develops her musical talent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mr. Luchino</b> owns the coffee shop at which Saga works. He is caring, understanding and often amused at Saga's fastidiousness. He often encourages Saga to enjoy life more and stop sticking to such a strict schedule, and he puts her occasional unusual behavior (the fault of the Season Fairies) down to stress. He is always seen munching a cookie.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Henry</b>, who works from the clock tower in the village, gets regular coffee deliveries from Luchino (in which he is 'ab-'used as a guinea pig to test out new blends). He controls the drawbridge at the bottom of the tower.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Paul</b> is a worker at the local music shop. He lets Saga play her mother's piano in the shop even though he knows that she will never be able to buy it, much to the apparent irritation of <b>the Manager</b>, a stern-looking man. Thus Saga plays only when the latter is absent (for a very particular reason).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Joe</b> is a raven who sporadically appears as an antagonist. He is both bad-tempered and eager to steal shiny objects he can find. He and the fairies (especially Sugar) often get to fight about one slight or another.</li>

Places of note within or near Mühlenburg include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saga's house.</li>
<li>Saga's school, which lies just outside the city walls.</li>
<li>the City Wall Tower which is supervised by Mr. Henry. A popular spot for tourists - and Saga - to look over the city.</li>
<li>the Market Square. One of the most popular booths is a waffle-maker, of whom Saga and the Fairies are regular customers. The fountain in its center is a popular meeting spot.</li>
<li>the top of the city church bell tower, where the Fairies sometimes congregate.</li>
<li>the Junkyard. Phil, Alan and Jan have a makeshift workshop in the place, where they try to convert Phil's ideas into reality.</li>
<li>the city's Theater.</li>
<li>the Music Store <i>Crescendo</i>, where the piano of Saga's mother is stored.</li>
<li>the Coffee Shop where Saga works and which is run by Mr. Luchino.</li>
<li>the Animal Hospital of Dr. Barbara, where Pepper resides. (Note: The anime uses the English term for this facility, whereas the German word would be 'Tierklinik'.)</li>
<li>the city's Park and Playground.</li>
<li>Greta's small but luxurious house.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third DVD in the series, released by <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneon.html" title="Geneon">Geneon</a>, features a lengthy tour of Rothenburg with voice over provided by director <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinichiro_Kimura_032e.html" title="Shinichiro Kimura">Shinichiro Kimura</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masumi_Asano_18df.html" title="Masumi Asano">Masumi Asano</a>, the voice of Saga. Kimura discusses at great length how he and other artists on the production toured the town to get ideas for the series and took hundreds of pictures. Judging by the comments, Asano did not visit Rothenburg with Kimura. This DVD extra shows numerous pictures of the city and morphs them into the anime versions, showing that the artists paid very strict attention to detail.</p>
