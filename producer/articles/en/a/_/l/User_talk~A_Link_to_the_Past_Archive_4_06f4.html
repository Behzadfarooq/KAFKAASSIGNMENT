<p>I was pointing out evidence that there was no time for Link to go on a trip and then go to Termina in Majora's Mask. And Princess Zelda of the Oracles could be a new Princess as well. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:27, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh. what's with the three months thing, though? Is there a statement somewhere that Link left Hyrule 3 months after defeating Ganon and timewarping back? But yes, I think it's safe to say that <i>Oracle</i> Zelda <i>must</i> be a new character, since she introduces herself and says "you must be Link" upon encountering him. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> 03:49, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Majora's Mask's manual says it takes place three months after OoT.</dd>

<dd>??? I'm not saying it's not a new Princess. I'm saying it definitely <i>is</i>. This is silly, arguing the same side of a point.

<dd>I misread. But it's most likely the case. Link's Awakening is clearly connected to ALttP, and it has connections to OoS/A. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 07:47, September 10, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I dunno if the ALttP connection <i>is</i> that clear. There's nothing canon that confirms it. While it's probably what the creators intended, it's not really fixed that way in the storyline. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 04:56, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Link, I noticed you just switched your support vote to oppose for <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VI_262d.html" title="Final Fantasy VI">Final Fantasy VI</a>'</i>s FAC in light of nixie and Tony's comments. However, before you switched, I (and a handful of others) put a good deal of effort into editing the article in light of their comments, and I would like to know if you could be persuaded to either a) reconsider your opposition, or b) comment on the recent changes and add any further specifics as to what you'd like to see changed.

<dd>Thanks! The more help we get, the better: I'm much more concerned with improving the article than I am with getting it successfully through the FAC process, so I find the input you and everyone else has offered to be invaluable.

<p>The definition of "computer specialist" is rather broad. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_specialists" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_specialists" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I see no reason why it can't include game designers. When I assign specialized stub tags I think it's more important to put the article in a category where it will get attention from interested parties whether it fits the strictest definition of the category or not.

<dd>Something else I wish to say. I've noticed that you've gotton involved with a few edit conflicts. In pretty much everyone of those conflicts you've been correct in your judgement. However, I feel that you let others provoke you into making emotional responses, and you can seem rather harsh. There's no need for this, since many people here realise what you've contributed and will support you.

<p>I would appreciate if you didn't mass-PR articles the way you've done with a number of video-game related articles. Nominating articles en masse like is quite a load on an already burdened PR and will probably result in most of the articles being ignored anyway. And what exactly is so different about these articles from all the ones you've already sent to either PR or FAC? You should know by now what's needed to make these article good and if you want comments from your peers in video-game specific issues, I'm sure there are project pages that are more suitable for this.</p>
<p>And, frankly, I still find it inappropriate to push articles about an encyclopedically insignificant subject when it's already hugely over-represented here.

<dd>I estimate that the post-Mother Brain sequence, including the Space Pirate Mother Ship and Chozodia, takes up at least 1/4th of the game on an average playthrough. It can be up to a third on a 100% run. But yes, the game does contain the full Metroid storyline. It's something like this (M = story told in original Metroid, Z = story new to Zero Mission):</dd>

<dd>So it's not completely accurate to say that Zero Mission comes after Metroid, or that the two games overlap completely.

<p>Link, please stop changing {{Final Fantasy-stub}} notices to {{Square Enix-stub}} notices.

<dd>The problem is, the FF stub is part of the FF project, whereas the Square Enix stub is substantially larger than it. It's much more difficult for FF project participants to deal with a category that contains a bunch of stuff not related to our work than it is to deal with the existing category. I would also argue that it provides a more informative framework than sorting by company alone. ‚Äì <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 02:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I thought I might check with you, to get your input. I think you remember the "Star Wars episodes" and "Expanded Universe" templates I created. Wouldn't it make the most sense on Star Wars articles to place them like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Main Star Wars page:
<dl>
<dd>Both</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Episodes:
<dl>
<dd>Episodes template</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Expanded Universe:
<dl>
<dd>EU template</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Using this method, you can access only the articles in that specific category. You can still acces the other pages by going to the main page on either one. This would divide the star wars article types into the two major sections of canon: the films and the EU, as I have done in the main article. Yet, you would be able to access it all from the main page. Just thought I might check your opinion, becuase I knew you would become involved anyway. This method of placing them would reflect the changes I made to the main article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 19:25, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In this case, it's really not a case of quality. A template is designed to make related pages easily acessable. The idea is to have a template devoted to the films, and one devoted to the EU. They are one story, of course, but two completely different divisions. Now, like I said before, the main SW page would contain both templates, but each of the two templates would contain information relevant to <i>only</i> the films <i>or</i> the EU. I know what you mean by your version is smaller, and provides more content, that's true. But to me, it is better toi have tempklates that are topic-specific, rather than combining two divisions of material like your version does. All the major franchise pages on wikipedia have things organized the way I have. Take a look at the templates for: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 23:29, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know the two are directly related. However, they are two huge divisions of Star Wars. One controlled by Lucas (G-Canon) and the other by various people (C-Canon). The Lord of the Rings people, if you noticed, divided the templates into one devoted to the adaptations of FotR, TTT, and RotK, while the other was devoted to all works outside of this. That is similar, stylistically, to what I am trying to do by having two templates. The EU is vast, and a completely different type of subject than the films, even though they are the same story. I will continue to keep my template on the pages for this reason. I'm open to discussion, but, have been making an effort to keep these things organized in the ways I have explained. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 00:36, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's what my intentions are, what's best for wikipedia. The main page is to act as a portal to the films and the EU. When someone wants to know something about star wars, that's typically what they would first type in. I formatted the template I have on the pages to be specific to what the subject is. It's the same with my EU template, it is specific to the EU. The content is all still there, but is divided into specific categories. I really don't know how to better explain this. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 00:52, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who are you? I didn't attack anyone. I reserve the right to think whatever I want about you for nominating perfectly good articles for deletion. Everyone else is thinking it too, I'm sure.

<p><i>You had no basis to claim that any single AfD I created on these FFVI characters is a bad faith AfD. On what basis do you believe that I am AfDing these articles out of hatred for them? I guess I must not have copyedited some of FFVI's article. Quality of an article is not a reason to keep. If the character is not notable enough to warrant an article, they should not get their own article. - A Link to the Past (talk) 00:41, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>No basis other than the fact that there was no reason for you to have done it. The characters, of course, are notable enough, considering that they're the main characters of what many consider to be the best video game of all time. It seems to be your personal opinion that the characters aren't notable enough, and also that the decision to do what you did was spur of the moment and rather arbitrary in nature. It would be one thing if a large group of people had been talking about this before hand, but it seems like it was just you. Sounds like bad faith to me.</p>
<p><i>May I also assume bad faith on the FF community after you attacked legitimate AfDs, Hibana tried to get the AfDs removed and Hibana tried to spam the AfDs on a talk page that will obviously attract people who would vote keep. I can also assume bad faith on this simple fact - I cannot trust that you are voting on the overall worthiness of it having its own article, but you vote on what kind of article it is; an FF article. - A Link to the Past (talk) 00:43, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I attacked them because, they are, in my opinion, completely inappropriate. As for trying to attract people to vote keep, why not? They know the articles are legitimate, not to mention that they worked very hard on them. Anyway, I didn't personally contribute to any of the FFVI character articles, so I'm not biased, but, having read all of them, I can see no reason whatsoever for their deletion. And they won't be deleted, either. Even without the help of the FF project helpers. You wasted your time, I'm afraid.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccoloNamek_1430.html" title="User:PiccoloNamek">PiccoloNamek</a> 00:49, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Ah, I see. So wonderful to know that the Final Fantasy editors focus more on protecting their articles than improving Wikipedia. Also, it's nice to know you're not below stating your opinion as fact. So, because you like these articles, I have to like them too? More notable characters than these have been VfD'd. And of course, you voted Keep on Umaro. I guess lack of backstory, personality, and almost the entire thing being GAMEPLAY doesn't matter to you, because it is a Final Fantasy article. Status &gt; quality in your eyes, but in Wikipedia, we don't just let every single article exist. If you don't like that there are legitimate AfDs on your articles (Yes, they ARE legitimate, because your word is not the word of God), tough cookies. And it IS bad to spam people to vote keep on the articles. That's a blockable offense. If I made an article called Donkey shit, and it went to the AfD, are you saying that it's okay for me to cheat the process? Grow up. Preserving the quality of Wikipedia holds precedence over your wants.</i></p>
<p>So, you want to attack my person? I suppose I can play that game as well. If anyone needs to grow up, it's you. You seem to me to be a pompous blowhard, full of self-importance and sporting an extreme superiority complex. Just the kind of person nobody likes. Just the kind of person Wikipedia does <b>not</b> need. I hate to talk like that, but if you want to play dirty, then so be it. Anyway, like I said before, it is your personal opinion that the articles are of poor quality, and are unsuitable. You seem to believe that you have some kind of general backing or consensus on this issue. You have to like the articles because I like them? That statement is fallicious. I never said anything to that effect. As for status over quality, I think that's just out of line. Look at <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira.html" title="Spira">Spira</a>, or <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_50c2.html" title="Final Fantasy Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, or <a href="../../../a/i/_/Ai_Yori_Aoshi_1210.html" title="Ai Yori Aoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a>, or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robo_Aleste_5d17.html" title="Robo Aleste">Robo Aleste</a>, or my <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccoloNamek_Gallery_f117.html" title="User:PiccoloNamek/Gallery">picture gallery</a> and tell me to my face I don't care about quality.</p>
<p>We don't let every single article exist? Certainly we don't! But we also don't delete everything that isn't Britannica quality either. My word isn't the word of God? No, but judging by your attitude, you seem to believe that yours is. A blockable offense? I'd like to see that rule. No, seriously, I genuinely would, I'm not trying to be arrogant about that particular issue. Donkey shit? Funny, but those articles aren't donkey shit, IMHO.</p>
<p>As for your final comment, some people, many people, actually, believe rabid deletionists such as yourself are the ones that are damaging the quality of Wikipedia. But that's just us.</p>

<p><i>Ah, finally. Took you a little longer than usual to make baseless accusations. Did I say the articles were bad? No. Quality of an article =/= important. Notability. Kefka is not playable, and you admitted Kefka does not deserve an article. Same with Leo. If I had a superiority complex, I would skip the AfD, as I would be arrogant and disregard your opinion (which you feel is the word of God). But I did not, I put it up on the AfD. Congratulations, I gave you a chance to spam your friends into voting on this. Also, do you even need proof that trying to cheat the AfD process is a blockable offense?</i></p>
<p>You say that I make baseless accusations, and then you do the very same thing directly afterwards. Good going! You win at life! And where the hell did I ever admit Kefka did not deserve his own article? IIRC, I said that only very notable NPCs deserve their own articles, like Kefka and Sephiroth. Here:</p>
<p><b>As for NPCs, only the most and popular and important NPCs, such as Sephiroth and Kefka should be allowed to have their own special articles.</b></p>
<p>As for spaming to vote for this, perhaps Hibana's post was a little out of line, and I'm sorry I reverted it. Perhaps something more like "all of the character articles are up for deletion, be sure to take a look" would have been more appropriate.</p>
<p><i>It isn't so crazy based on the fact that you called them good articles and said that is why the AfD was in bad faith. That is stating opinion as fact. Wario isn't in the Brittanica, but it is kept. Give me one good reason why Umaro deserves an article. What, is it his deep personality? His exciting backstory? The two paragraphs that do not have to do with how he plays?</i></p>
<p>I'll admit, I'm actually at fault here! I replied to all of the article's deletion pages in haste. I have since edited my Umaro entry.</p>
<p><i>Also, I would like to think that I am not a rabid deletionist (as I rarely ever nominate anything for AfD). Of course, that fact is irrelevant - AfDing your favorite articles makes me one.</i></p>
<p>Those aren't even my favorite articles. It isn't so much that I <b>like</b> them, so much as it is you nominated them all at once for reasons I find very ridiculous indeed. We're all entilted to our opinions, aren't we?

<p><i>Wait, am I to believe that I am a rabid deletionist because I nominated many relevant articles? The point is that you don't think my reason for nominating them is in bad faith because you don't agree. Whoo. - A Link to the Past (talk) 01:50, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>God... this can go in circles forever. You say I'm wrong because I only disagree because of my personal opinions about the articles, and you, but was it not <i>your</i> personal opinions that caused you to nominate them in the first place? <b>Nice</b>. I suppose I could understand in cases like Umaro, but certainly not extremely important characters like Tina or Celes.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccoloNamek_1430.html" title="User:PiccoloNamek">PiccoloNamek</a> 01:59, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Nice job making up stuff. I never said you were WRONG about anything. I said I disagreed.</i></p>
<p>Tch, You know what I <i>meant'. Anyway, not that it matters after so many insults have been traded, but I'd like to apologize for the "bad faith" comment. I actually feel rather bad about it. I'm editing it out of all of the nomination articles as we speak.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccoloNamek_1430.html" title="User:PiccoloNamek">PiccoloNamek</a> 02:07, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Well, it's tilting at windmills, and I think they should be merged, not deleted, but it's a hell of a gutsy (if likely fruitless) move listing all of the FFVI character articles on AFD.</p>

<dd>My thoughts exactly! I was just about to say this: Let's delete <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a>!

<dd>Did you notice that <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> doesn't have an article separate from the novel in which he appears?

<p>The argument between you and I was entirely my fault. In haste, I copied and pasted the same message asserting bad faith into all of the Final Fantasy VI articles. For this, I apologize. It was rude and uncalled for, not to mention stupid. When you sent me a completely polite message saying that this was not a good thing to do, I took it upon myself to start an argument. For this, I also apologize. I let a <i>percieved</i> air of "pompousness" set off my temper, when I should have apologized right from the start. Again, I'm sorry I caused this to escalate into such a silly argument, and I hope that we can start over and be on good terms.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccoloNamek_1430.html" title="User:PiccoloNamek">PiccoloNamek</a> 02:43, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The game uses similar mechanics, yes, but when one of the developers (Ryan Payton) flat out says "this game is not a part of the Boktai franchise -- it is a new series", the argument becomes moot.</p>
