He dies when his horse falls into a river and he drowns.</p>
<p>Glenda:Zech's wife. She seems more of a tomboy in her adulthood and gives birth to four children throughout her life, three of which died at birth. She tricked Zech into marriage. Sadly she dies near the end of Zech's life when shes impaled by a bull, which Zech shoots out of rage.</p>
<p>Soloman:The 3rd generation's main character. He lived a sad life of power. After his father's death he became powerhungry wanting to leave a mark with his money and business his family started. Eventually he finds Bonnie and changes. After her death and a reunion with Toby he eventually changes his ways. In a press conference, while in his 50s, he makes his hate for what hes done known. Later on his death day, around his 80s, he sees his brother one more time and tells about later events in the book that happened(the events of his death day before he dies happened after this). He has a weak heart and when he experiences a attack he rather die so he can be with his family then live another pointless day.</p>
<p><br />
Bonnie:Soloman's love interest. Shes the daughter of a abusive father and is hired by Soloman as a fake housewife. The two live the same lifestyle for almost seven years. When they finally admit they want to get married she dies from a hurricane's tornado. The first ghost to appear to Soloman at the end.</p>

And has almost ten children. He leaves later to start a farm. Skillit only appears two more times in the book. When he returns for Emma's funeral and when Sol's life runs through his eyes. His fate is unknown.</p>
<p>Frog:A hired worker, former town drunk. Him and Bonzo began working for Tobias for their first successful mission. Frog was seen as almost a brother to Tobias and he was always a help. He died from being impaled by the same bull that killed Glenda. His death took longer, however.</p>
<p>Bonzo:A hired worker, former town drunk. He had few speech lines compared to Frog and was known as the first "real" death. He died from malaria which Tobias was able to get a cure for. His death was really early in the book.</p>
<p>Twanda:Zech's mistress. She was a former love to him when he went to the indian village. He only sees her three times. The first time when they deliver the cows and while Tobias is being healed, the second when Zech comes to get two new horses(there he sleeps with her), the third when he visits the village and gets her pregnant again. Her death in the timeline is unknown. It happened before Tobiases' death because her parents inform Zech, at the funeral, that she died in labor, the baby also died.</p>
<p>Toby:A part of the 3rd generation but only appearing four times. He was born from a affair between Twanda and Zech. He was picked on because he had no father in the village but was respected by adults because of his MacIvey blood. He is first met when Zech visits the town and the two bond. When he is 15 he encounters Soloman and Zech again and him and Sol bond. He later becomes the village chief and has three children. He hates Sol for ruining the forest and the two avoid contact for almost half a century. He sees Sol again when Sol is about to die, now the indians are living in a preserve.</p>
<p>Lester:He only appeared when Tobias died as a replacement. He is only mentioned near the end as a weithered old man who can barely move.</p>
