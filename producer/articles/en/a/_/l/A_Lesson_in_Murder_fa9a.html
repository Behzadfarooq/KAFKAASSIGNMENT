<p>The pre-titles scene opens with a young man, David Beale (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Audsley_c38e.html" title="Nicholas Audsley">Nicholas Audsley</a>) appearing before a tribunal, presided over by Lawrence Gascoigne (<a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Ford_Davies_01f5.html" title="Oliver Ford Davies">Oliver Ford Davies</a>). Despite arguing passionately and eloquently that he should be spared soldier's training (which he claims is merely 'a lesson in murder') Beale's application to be registered as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscientious_objector.html" title="Conscientious objector">conscientious objector</a> is refused. He is detained at the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings.html" title="Hastings">Hastings</a> police station, where some of the officers taunt him, and shower him with water from the fire hose. His wife is refused permission to visit, a decision made tragic when police officers find Beale hanging in his cell.</p>
<p>After the opening titles, we are shown Foyle attending a committee formed to discuss the expected <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Sealion_782a.html" title="Operation Sealion">invasion</a> of Britain by Germany. Present are the judge Gascoigne and local businessman Raymond Brooks (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Shrapnel_a6d2.html" title="John Shrapnel">John Shrapnel</a>), who had given <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">distinguished service</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. After the meeting, Sam drives Foyle to 'Carlo's Restaurant', run by his old friend Carlo Lucciano (Alan Corduner), an Italian, and his son Tony (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Dyer_1047.html" title="Danny Dyer">Danny Dyer</a>). After her hints, Foyle invites Sam to join him. Tony is quite taken with her and invites her to a dance the following night. After they leave, Tony is interrupted by old acquaintance Jack Winters (Christopher Fox), who he is not pleased to see. Jack is newly released from prison ("to make room for Jerries and Jews"), and swears vengeance on the judge who sent him there: Gascoigne.</p>
<p>Beale's wife Florence (Madeleine Worrall) is seen to live in a farm community of refugees and conscientious objectors. She is visited by her husband's friend Theo Howard (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Tennant_6de1.html" title="David Tennant">David Tennant</a>), who expresses anger towards Gascoigne, whose refusal to approve Beale's application led to his death.</p>
<p>Gascoigne lives in a large house (his wife's ancestral home) with his wife Emily (<a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Campbell_f609.html" title="Cheryl Campbell">Cheryl Campbell</a>), daughter Susan (<a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Myles_5a23.html" title="Sophia Myles">Sophia Myles</a>). They are currently hosting an eleven-year-old <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuations_of_civilians_in_Britain_during_World_War_II_10ee.html" title="Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II">evacuee</a>, Joe (Greg Prentice), who the senior Gascoignes consider a nuisance. He carries a notebook around with them, which he uses to make notes. One night, when he and his wife are in bed, he claims that he has heard a noise downstairs; he investigates. Raised by a draught that leaves her cold, his wife then hears a crash from downstairs. Wife and daughter run downstairs, to see the window broken and Gascoigne holding a note. Words from newspapers read "You too will receive justice".</p>
<p>Called to the house the next day, Foyle questions Gascoigne about the note. Joe listens to this, and also records the number plate of Foyle's car. Sam talks to him briefly. Returning to the station, Foyle gives the letter to Milner to study. Foyle has also been investigating the circumstances of Beale's death, at the request of Superintendent Reid (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Simkins_257b.html" title="Michael Simkins">Michael Simkins</a>). Milner, who has been making initial inquiries, reports that the Duty Sergeant the night of the suicide was Bill Ferris (<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Maudsley_3cde.html" title="Tony Maudsley">Tony Maudsley</a>) whose brother was rescently killed at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Dynamo_2ab1.html" title="Operation Dynamo">Dunkirk</a>. Examining the cells, Foyle notices the wet hose, and forms an idea of what happened. He puts this to Ferris and, implying the interrogation was only a formality, gets his agreement. Foyle arrests Ferris for <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggravated_assault.html" title="Aggravated assault">aggravated assault</a> and dismisses him from the police force.</p>
<p>At Gascoigne's house, Susan slips out surreptitiously, meeting her boyfriend Peter Buckingham (Elliot Cowan) in the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summerhouse.html" title="Summerhouse">summerhouse</a>. She is concerned as her father as forbidden their meetings and threatened Peter.</p>
<p>Foyle visits Florence Beale at the farm, expressing his regret and assuring her the people involved would be punished. Theo is not reassured by the apology; he speaks angrily about Gascoigne, informing Foyle that Gascoigne has refused all conscientious objector's applications except for that of Stephen, Raymond Brooks's son, even though Stephen was unknown by the pacifist communities. When Foyle repeats the words of Gascoigne's letter, he admits no knowledge of it but agrees with its sentiment.</p>
<p>Having discovered the words on the threatening letter had been cut from <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">The Illustrated Daily Express</a></i> and the paper showed traces of engine oil, Milner returns home. His wife is not welcoming; she doesn't like his false leg. She has packed a suitcase and tells Milner she is leaving him to stay with her sister. Sam attends the dance with Tony. She meets Jack Winters, who she takes a dislike to. Also present at the dance are Peter and Susan Gascoigne. After the dance, while it is dark, a figure enters the summerhouse and attaches a grenade to the doorhandle with wire.</p>
<p>The following morning, Gascoigne tells his wife that he received an anonymous phonecall, telling him there is something in the summerhouse. He decides to eat his breakfast before investigating, and forbids Joe to look himself. Joe disobeys, and runs down. When he opens the door there is a loud explosion.</p>
<p>Foyle hears the details from Gascoigne. Gascoigne suggests that he was the intended target, and identifies one enemy: Peter Buckingham, who he claims was forcing his attentions on Susan. He tells Foyle that Buckingham is a machine operator at the nearby munitions factory. Looking through Joe's room, Foyle discovers the exercise book. Leaving policemen to guard Gascoigne, in case of another attempt, Foyle goes to the train station to meet Joe's father Eric (Ian Puleston-Davies), who was due to collect Joe that day. Eric expresses great grief at the death of his son, who he had sent to the country for safety. Foyle finds him a hotel room, but forbids him to approach Gascoigne. Sam then drives Foyle to the factory, located in a wood, but they are refused admission by the foreman (Ken Drury), who refers them to the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Office_e75c.html" title="War Office">War Office</a>. However, Peter Buckingham comes to the gate to speak to them, explaining his relationship with Susan Gascoigne, and remarking that Gascoigne threatened him, not the reverse. Leaving the factory, Foyle comments that Buckingham cannot be a machine operator: his hands are clean, the factory has no chimneys (as it would if it had furnaces) and the track leading to it would not be suitable for transporting munitions.</p>
<p>Foyle meets up with Carlo again and they reminisce, and discuss the likelihood of Italy joining the war. Foyle also asks about Frank Winter, who he knows was once arrested for burglary and assault. Carlo is concerned by his son's association with him. Sam is out walking with Tony, who tells her he has joined up. He asks her to be 'his girl' so he can write letters. She agrees, although she appears reluctant. Tony does not tell his father about his plans, and, that night, walks out after an argument.</p>
<p>Foyle also visits Raymond Brooks, whose business interests border on <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_profiteering.html" title="War profiteering">profiteering</a>. Challenged about his son's listing as a conscientious objector, Gascoigne expresses anger at his son, claiming they are not on speaking terms. He also admits Brooks seeing Gascoigne, but states it was to speak <i>against</i> his son's request as he was not a pacifist but "afraid to fight".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Florence Beale has heard about the explosion and challenges Theo, asking where he was the previous night. Later, Theo removes a gun from his luggage and leaves the farm, asking Florence to forgive him. Milner has joined the 'guard' at Gascoigne's house and chats with Susan, who seems the only one to be upset at Joe's death. Watching outside, Milner sees someone in the trees, and sends a policeman after him, but he is not found. Susan confides her affection for Peter Buckingham, and feeling of hopelessness. When Gascoigne discovers Milner comforting her, he uses it as an excuse to send him away. However, that night, shots are heard and the policemen aprehend Tony and Jack in the gardens. Gascoigne is dead. The windows and doors are locked.</p>
<p>When questioned by Foyle, Emily Gascoigne claimed she was upstairs when she heard the shot. Susan remarks that her father kept a gun in his desk; it is missing. Back at the station, Tony tells Foyle that Jack wanted to break in and make a mess, but they had not entered. Tony had only accompanied him reluctantly. Knowing he has committed no crime, Foyle releases him, and he is reconciled with his father, after telling him he has joined up. Interviewed by Milner, Jack accuses Foyle of corruption since he let Tony go.</p>
<p>When studying Joe's notebook, Foyle noticed, amongst the scribbles, the words "FAC RAY" and "SOOO". Assuming this to mean the factory, and discovering the factory is unknown by the War Office, he forces his way in. There he sees carpenters busily making coffins by order of the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Health_%28United_Kingdom%29_bf3f.html" title="Department of Health (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Health</a>, to cope with expected fatalities during an invasion.</p>
<p>Now knowing the factory was not what interested Joe, Foyle visits Raymond Brooks and accuses him of lying. Brooks did visit Gascoigne, (FAC RAY referred to his car registration number) and paid him £2000 (which Joe recorded as 'SOOO')as a bribe to keep his son out of the war. His bank account confirmed this withdrawal. He had also been making phonecalls to his son. Gascoigne had been living beyond his means, and must have been relieved to have the money. Brooks admits this; having experience WWI, he did not want his son to suffer the same things. Foyle suggested he had obtained the grenade for Gascoigne.</p>
<p>Foyle escorts Eric Pearson to the train station; leaving on the same train is Theo Howard who has decided to join up. He admitted to Florence that he had planned to shoot Gascoigne, but there were too many policemen at the house. He stilled retained his pacifist ideals but, having discovered he is capable of killing, he knew he had to 'do his bit'.</p>
<p>Returning to the big house, Foyle arrests Emily Gascoigne for the murder of her husband. Explaining this to Susan, he says that Joe had discovered the bribe and would probably tell his father when he came, so Gascoigne invented the threats and set it all up so an excited Joe would explore the summerhouse. He had tried to implicate Peter Buckingham with the use of machine oil. Working out that her husband had killed the boy, and angered by his blaming her family inheritance for burdening him with rising cosat, Emily took the gun from his desk and shot him. Susan is comforted by Peter.</p>
<p>That night, news breaks that <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> has declared war. Carlo's restaurant is torched by a mob, and Carlo himself dies in the blaze. Foyle is upset at his friend's death. Sam tries to comfort the grief-stricken Tony but is repulsed.</p>

<li>Paul Milner is seen limping, and uses one walking stick; it appears he is becoming accustomed to his false leg. However, his wife, Jane, continues to be upset by it. She leaves him, saying she is going to stay with her sister Kate in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>.</li>
<li>We hear of Foyle's long-standing friendship with Carlo Lucciano, the restaurant owner, which dates back to when Foyle was married.</li>
<li>Foyle mentions that his son Andrew is undergoing pilot training with the <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_4f12.html" title="RAF">RAF</a> in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</li>
<li>Tony Lucciano asks Sam to be 'his girl' and write to him while he is serving. She appears a little reluctant but agrees to do this. There is no reference to Tony after this episode, and Sam does not consider herself attached, so presumably Tony did not write to her (he certainly repulsed her at the end of this episode).</li>
