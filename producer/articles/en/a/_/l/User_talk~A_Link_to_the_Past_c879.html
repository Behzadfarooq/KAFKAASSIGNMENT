<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../b/0/0/Image%7EB00006C29A.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg_f2c6.html" title="Image:B00006C29A.01. SCLZZZZZZZ .jpg">Image:B00006C29A.01. SCLZZZZZZZ .jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

<dd>Yeah, box art fair use images need a rationale.

<dd>Oh, I see. Any suggestions as to how I should establish a rational for a box art to be fair use? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 21:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, can't a rational that using a fair use image is necessary because it helps tell about the article, or something? Kind of like how a screenshot can get by because one is needed to help give a visual depiction of game. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 21:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The rationale needs to be explicit (even more so than the template says). It's prtty generic, really, and I just added a quick one. I also resent Rock's statement that only a few CVG members know about fair use rationales; all of the CVG FA articles have rationales. That's gotta be at least 15 people. The PCP project also does a crapload of rationles, mostly through a generic template that was later deleted through TFD. Hbdragon88 00:00, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I had figured would be a small discussion regarding the proposed move (point, counterpoint, consensus amongst editors, fin) has expanded into a incredibly large and extensive discussion. Since I respect you and you seem to have the largest role in the aforementioned discussion, I believe that it is fair to let you know about the move I did- basically, I've kept the discussion content intact but just moved it to <a href="../../../s/e/i/Talk%7ESeiken_Densetsu_proposed_move_to_mana_series_3ae8.html" title="Talk:Seiken Densetsu/proposed move to mana series">Talk:Seiken_Densetsu/proposed_move_to_mana_series</a>. That way the pros and cons can continue to be discussed without overwhelming the <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiken_Densetsu_a12e.html" title="Seiken Densetsu">Seiken Densetsu</a> talk page. I've also placed a notice on the main talk page with a specific link to the discussion, along with a recommendation that individuals follow it and place their opinion on the topic.

<p>In response to your question, the criteria commonly used by The Simpsons WikiProject is that characters must fulfill one of three guidelines: 1. Must have been extremely central to 2 episodes 2. If a one-timer, must have a resonant appearance 3. Must have appeared in at least 50 episodes If you still wish to merge the page, I suggest you make a formal merge request. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 22:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's not as wide as it sounds. We could easily have 1000 Simpson character pages, but we don't (don't think that people haven't TRIED to get us to 1000, I'd be willing to bet that there are at least 200 redirecting pages for Simpsons characters). Bridging the gape between fame and notability is tricky, for example, I can guarantee you that a LOT more people have heard of Bumblebee Man or the Crazy Cat Lady than have heard of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Meyer_c256.html" title="George Meyer">George Meyer</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Silverman_1827.html" title="David Silverman">David Silverman</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Swartzwelder_cd4e.html" title="John Swartzwelder">John Swartzwelder</a>, and yet, they undisputably deserve pages while Bumblebee Man and Crazy Cat lady don't. In the past month alone, I've merged about 20 character pages (and was fought every step of the way). The way I see it is that Herb and Mona were very central to their two episodes and they are pretty well-known characters, as are Frank Grimes and Hank Scorpio. If you still wish to do some merging, then propose a merge. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 22:50, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regarding the Kirby edits, in case it wasn't clear.&#160;:D<br />
I don't know what your deal is, or if you think you're 'helping', but deleting swaths of information in preference of a bloated single list is not doing it. We've already had an issue where we got a big main list deleted, so we made smaller lists so it wasn't so needlessly huge. It's nice an organized and each character gets a bit of info, because let's face it, no one criteria says which are more important than the others. A character like DynaBlade only appears in one game, but she's a well known and easily recognized figure.<br />
There's also already a category listing the Kirby characters and sub-lists, so there's truly no need for a giant list. Other series divide things up too. LoZ has a page for enemies, and a page for other characters, and a page for manga characters and so on. They don't shove everything on one page. We want to keep things organized. Don't mix up game, manga, and anime characters. If you can think of a good way to organize it, maybe we can even combine enemies/bosses/minibosses, but everything on one page is too much. <a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvyna_J._Spyder_f9b2.html" title="User:Ivyna J.

<p>I'm not exactly sure what you gain from this. You're not making the Kirby info any cleaner or easier to sort through, you're actively deleting information because you don't deem it 'worthy' or something. You just up and removed the Halberd page! Yeah you redirected it but you didn't keep any of the information it listed. You're being sloppy and careless.<br />
The Kirby character list was deleted once for being pointless and bloated, it'll be deleted again as we can establish, AGAIN, that it's not needed. <a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvyna_J._Spyder_f9b2.html" title="User:Ivyna J. Spyder">Ivyna J. Spyder</a> 04:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What are you trying to accomplish?

<p>Keeping it on one talk page.</p>
<ol>
<li>It was AfDed for being too large. Not EVERY single boss and mini-boss needs to be represented, and I never stated once that I wanted to do so.</li>
<li>And this AfD? Have you ever seen a character list in your life? Final Fantasy VI's character list alone is significantly bigger than the list of Kirby characters.</li>
<li>And if I don't take charge, no one will ever bother to say "hey, let's make a criteria and go by it". Instead, you'll keep going with "let's list every single thing that could ever apply to these lists".</li>
<li>Bosses get articles because they deserve them. Bowser, for instance, deserves it. Individual bosses from Kirby do not.</li>
<li>Halberd's unimportant.</li>
<li>You're the only people who have a problem with its length. If you hadn't made this AfD personal, it would be a landslide keep result.</li>
<li>Oh? I don't remember a game called "Adventure of Lololo". Can you prove that these are the same characters?

<dd>I won't play argue points by numbers, while some enjoy playing pretend bureaucracy over a GPL I have better things to do, like making sure people don't come to forums I am a member of with incorrect information because the Wikipedia articles were entirely wrong. But I will say there are about 7 different character lists for the Zelda games. If you merge all those articles into a single separate one (which shouldn't be a problem by your logic), then the Kirby article contributors might have something comparable to work off of, and that would be most excellent. However, our precedences are articles like those, articles like <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_Rogues_2521.html" title="Babylon Rogues">Babylon Rogues</a> which is comparable to the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby%27s_Animal_Friends_ed52.html" title="Kirby's Animal Friends">Kirby's Animal Friends</a> page, and so forth.</dd>
<dd>And lol, who has made it personal.

<p>I'm a little peeved at your hasty merge of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_%27N%27_Swop_af15.html" title="Stop 'N' Swop">Stop 'N' Swop</a>. I'm not pissed about the article getting merged — I'm pissed at how poor a job you did at merging the article. You did not deal with the double redirects, you did not remove looping links in the target article, you failed to tag the redirect as a merge, you didn't add a references section to the target article... If this is how you normally merge articles, let me be the first to tell you that you aren't helping. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 22:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Concur with Rock here. Which version of the articles did you pull out ot merge? Most of the Kanto articles, for instance, had the {{<a href="../../../n/i/h/Template%7ENihongo_517c.html" title="Template:Nihongo">nihongo</a>}} template on them, which are now gone from most of list articles. Some of them also contain crufty descriptions, most of which I eliminated awhile ago. Anyway, I find it rather satisfying - I just slapped {{<a href="../../../o/r/f/Template%7EOrfud_2019.html" title="Template:Orfud">orfud</a>}} on 33 city images so far. Accroding to the lists, there are 36 cities, but some of them had 2-3 images (such as illustrating how <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnabar_Island_efdc.html" title="Cinnabar Island">Cinnabar Island</a> looked in R/B/Y and G/S/C). Still, sterling work, and 'bout time that these got the boot. Hbdragon88 08:41, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The way I see it, general de facto guidelines establish that the NA title should be used. Because the page move is controversial, <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> should be used when one wants to switch to the European title, such as conesnsus wrangled from the numerous move debates on <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Mega_Drive_0377.html" title="Sega Mega Drive">Sega Mega Drive</a> and the relatively low-key move from <i>Yoshi's Topsy-Turvy</i> to <i><a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshi%27s_Universal_Gravitation_df1d.html" title="Yoshi's Universal Gravitation">Yoshi's Universal Gravitation</a></i>.</p>
<p>Now...how much bias do we account for? Seems a bit subjective. I originally Googled "Clubhouse Games" without "DS" in the title and got a 1.4 mil hits. I re-searched "42 All-Time Classics" in quotes after discovering that the generic search was cropping up other all-time classics compilations. I later went back to do another CHG serach with DS, and the lead shrinks - now at 350,000 (CHG) vs. 140,000 (42ATC). I side with ReyBrujo's reasoning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day%21&amp;diff=107745896&amp;oldid=107745343" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day%21&amp;diff=107745896&amp;oldid=107745343" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> as said in the <i>Brain Age</i> debate.

<p>See, there's something that really wasn't acknowledged, that the only reason anyone can say "it's not a guide!" is because is can't be a guide. There's no one to guide, and no one can guide them yet, as it's unreleased. But when all of the other MP mini-game lists are about telling how to play them, what is to be expected? There's not been a precedence to put mini-game lists on Wikipedia, and I'm sure that it surviving has more to do with people liking the article more than feeling it adheres to policy and guidelines. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 00:29, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I nominated all of the MP minigame lists for deletion on February 28 for that very reason: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a game guide. However, I had failed to notice that the previous AfD discussion had closed only 27 hours earlier, so I withdrew my nomination. I intend to wait a month or two (until April, at least, or even May), and the renominate all the articles for deletion. I simply removed the prod because it is not a case of uncontroversial deletion (having already survived AfD once). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One last thing: while it is true the date is modified based in our preferences, note that users that are not registered will see the article "as is".

<p>Why did you do this? The Wii Channels article is now massively long, to the extent that it's almost at the point where any new additions will take it over the size limit, and it will be advised that the article should be split. Furthermore, there's an existing discussion on the Wii Channels talk page regarding the possible merger of the Everybody Votes Channel page, at <a href="../../../w/i/i/Talk%7EWii_Channels_2162.html#Everybody_Votes_Channel_--.3E_Wii_Channels_Merger" title="Talk:Wii Channels">Talk:Wii Channels#Everybody Votes Channel --&gt; Wii Channels Merger</a>, which currently stands at seven votes to five in favour of it having its own channel. I'd appreciate it if you could contribute in that discussion before you unilaterally decide what's right and wrong for the pages. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 10:28, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, to cover your points one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of an article doesn't legitimize splitting it up into smaller, less notable articles.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Articles over a certain size, when editing, automatically have a header added on the editing page advising you that the article is very long, and that you should consider splitting it into small articles.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The ones I merged had no notability on their own.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That's a very strong statement with no evidence to back it up. In fact, if you looked at the Talk page for the Everybody Votes Channel, there was a great deal of discussion over whether the channel was notable, resulting in an agreement to keep the page since it is considered notable by a number of people. It also passes Wikipedia's notability guidelines. Can you expand your 'non-notable' claim?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Have you consider following the teachings of "sofixit"? I merged it. If you want to trim it, trim it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I don't want to trim it; if anything I want to expand it so that it's sufficiently split into sections, as it was before, and categorised, as it was before.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Nothing in the Wii Channel needs its own article, so you're going to have to keep trimming it to a manageable but informative size.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The majority vote appears to contradict you there, in wanting a seperate article. The Internet Channel is even more notable. Again, I think you need to set out a better argument than you have done. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 14:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The AfD was <b>already</b> overturned. The article was deleted by an admin who didn't look to see that the article had actually expanded beyond the two or three sentences that existed when the AfD was first placed. The same admin undeleted the article after he realised - and apologised for - his mistake. This can be seen in the deletion review which was linked to in the various debates. I don't think I need to prove it needs to be overturned again.</p>
<p>The exact text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This page is XX kilobytes long. <b>It may be appropriate to split this article into smaller, more specific articles</b>. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article size</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following that link says that long pages should be split up into sensible sections if necessary. Sensible sections should be discussed on the pages. Of course, all articles need to be notable. And what is notable? <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Everybody Votes Channel has been the subject of a number of articles already, including pieces in the Guardian, the Times and the Sun newspapers in the UK (not just trivial mentions I should specify), plus articles in videogames magazines and on technology and videogames websites. So, I'll ask you again, please can you explain why you consider this to be non-notable? <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 15:12, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to back up Tim here. In addition to the points he made, you never used the merge tag (as is Wikipedia policy) to solicit discussion on the changes before making them. By doing this, you effectively silenced the opposition before it had a chance to speak.</p>
<p>This merger is incorrect and should be reverted. If you still feel strongly about the merger, I would ask that you follow the proper procedure and apply the merge tags so that dicussion can commence. That way a concensus can be reached. <a href="../../../j/b/a/User%7EJbanes_69a8.html" title="User:Jbanes">Jbanes</a> 16:34, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Going by your last response on my talk page, I'm assuming that you don't feel able to assert non-notability any more. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 19:07, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> sets out very clearly Wikipedia's definition of notable. Using this definition, can you explain why you think it non-notable? <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 19:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're ignoring the articles in newspapers, then, and also what Wikipedia itself states to be notable. Many other things may indeed deserve articles. Does that mean that, since they have no article, there should be nothing on Wikipedia at all? <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 19:19, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you claiming that every feature of Xbox Live is as significant as the Everybody Votes Channel? Let alone the Internet Channel? A great many features of Xbox Live are as significant, and do indeed have their own articles. <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_Live_Vision_ecd5.html" title="Xbox Live Vision">Xbox Live Vision</a>, <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_Live_Marketplace_dbbd.html" title="Xbox Live Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>, <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_Live_Arcade_1dcf.html" title="Xbox Live Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> ... and if (when) they announce a web browser for the Xbox 360, I'd fully expect that to have its own article too. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 19:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your arguments are now no longer following on from each other. If you're going to compare it to the Xbox Live situation, then compare it, and don't try and find reasons why it's different. An article doesn't have to be overly long to be split, it ought to be split where there is sufficient information on seperate areas to warrant a seperate article. According to the discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/i/Talk%7EWii_Channels_2162.html" title="Talk:Wii Channels">Talk:Wii Channels</a>, the majority of people seem to think this is the case. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 13:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never claimed that the sole reason, or even the main reason, for splitting was size. Unless you can find something in the Wikipedia policies or guidelines regarding whether an article should or not exist, or be merged into a larger article, which directly backs up your argument, you'll just need to participate in the discussion like everyone else. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> 13:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd like to point out once again that when merging articles, you must do it properly. Discuss, obtain consensus, merge, put the {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_merge_eed7.html" title="Template:R from merge">R from merge</a>}} tag on the article, mention where you merged the info from in the target article, fix double redirects, etc. These things are not optional.

<p>I have reverted your redirect. You need to post on the talk page if you want to redirect the page. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_Williams_e79a.html" title="User:Jonathan Williams">Jonathan Williams</a> 00:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

What makes you think it's up to you alone to decide whether the Internet channel. It's not just a rhetorical question- I'd really like to know, since it seems to me that I keep running into people with a similar attitude. Anyhow, when someone thinks something should be deleted, the proper course of action is to follow the procedure at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 03:05, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>So I guess in your world, "Nevermind" means that the sinner has repented of his sinful ways and has no intention of engaging in such conduct again? <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 04:28, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If one first accepts the idea that everyone including oneself is a sinner, I don't see how such a person would be arrogant in referring to another as a sinner. What are your thoughts? <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 02:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

What did you mean when you said: "It'd be keen if you could stop disrupting Wikipedia, thanks." Disrupting Wikipedia? I haven't seen anything that could even come close to what I would call "disrupting Wikipedia". You may think that either I or Jonathan Williams were disruptive of your personal experience when interacting with others on Wikipedia, but that's nowhere near the same as disrupting Wikipedia itself as a whole. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 20:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have a curious definition of "creating conflict". I am trying to communicate how I am different from you and elicit information of how and why you are different from me. When people learn those sorts of things about each other, conflict is eliminated. Without exchange of such information, conflict escalates. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 20:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You say: "I intended to include insults, sarcasm, and general rudeness". That's curious, because I avoid such things in my own speech, except maybe sarcasm when I don't consider it being rude but humorous. Why do you think such things are appropriate human conduct? You may perceive me as rude, but you have failed to communicate to me the criteria by which you determine rudeness, not even the portions of your criteria that apply to my communication with you. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 20:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>First you marked out your apology and added "If you will not even acknowledge the apology and try to create more conflict, I might as well just not apologize if it serves no purpose", and when you added, "I intended to include insults, sarcasm, and general rudeness", my initial thought was that you were continuing along the line of thought that we were engaged in an adversarial situation and those were the tactics that you find acceptable behavior when in such a situation. Your latest statement has caused me to take into account the fact that you did unstrike-out the apology, so I have adjusted my understanding of the situation accordingly. However the point in continuing is that apologizing for something doesn't make everything all better in the same way that saying "please" doesn't automatically get one what one wants. In the same way that "please" is not useless when you don't get what you want, the same goes for an apology. However, an insincere "please" or an insincere apology are useless.<a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 21:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You must really dislike Grimes because this is the third or fourth time you've gone after his page. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Notability isn't measured by the number of appearances. He made a notable appearance in one of the more famous Simpsons episodes and he's since been referred to several times. By measure of importance, I'd rank him above a lot of secondary characters who have basically just served as one-off jokes. ie. Sideshow Mel, Roger Meyers, Rabbi Krustofski, Hank Scorpio, Radioactive Man, Fallout Boy, Drederick Tatum, Bumblebee Man, Luann Van Houten, Jimbo Jones, Rod &amp; Todd Flanders, Maude Flanders - And they all have pages.

<p>The apology was really not necessary, I think, you were just acting as you felt was best, and for the most part probably is the correct method, and I was just sort of hesitant at the idea (I still sort of am, but I've not been active enough on Wikipedia lately to really do much in the matter), and in your abruptness there was a sort of confusion and frustration. I'd actually like to apologize for my stubbornness and assuming behavior in the AIM chat and article votes.</p>

<dd>I see. Well, back in the day I hated sourcing screenshots because I felt that it was stupidly obvious who owned the copyright on then and that it didn't really need to be mentioned. It's also dumb because the place you find a screenshot is rarely the person that actually took it anyways, since many are just given out in press packets to sites that proceed to watermark someone else's screenshot. I still rather feel that way, but oh well. Good luck on the <i><a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land_bddf.html" title="Kirby's Dream Land">Kirby's Dream Land</a></i> article though.

<p>I noticed that you made edits to all the game listings in the Mother series, and I feel that the edits were made quite hastily. You cut out much relevant material, and while I will assume good faith in your desire to edit, the edits have been reverted because of the negative effect they had on the quality of the articles; in the future, please do a little more research and have a little more consideration before making further edits to these articles and others like it. --PeanutCheeseBar 16:47, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it was only a single game (and not a series), I could understand not having a list; however, you made some mistakes in that:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>PSI actually has some storyline significance to each game in the series, which has sadly not been expounded on.</li>
<li>You had not bothered to reference even SOME of the content within the list, which defeats the purpose of even keeping the article around.</li>
<li>You did not open it up for discussion on what could be done to improve it, but rather you blew away the whole article and redirected it. You do not have the "final say" in what is fit and what is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>From some of the other comments on your talk page, I can see you have a history of doing this. I will ask you once again to please refrain from doing so again without taking the proper channels, as blanking pages can be construed as vandalism. --PeanutCheeseBar 17:39, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also stated that the significance of PSI has not been expanded upon; however, rather than completely remove it from the picture, you can improve the quality of the article by showing how important it is. In the future, please open a discussion on the talks page of each article that you take issue with. --PeanutCheeseBar 17:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you "care" about the article, you alone do not have the authority to decide what stays and what goes; to do so is unencyclopedic and uncivil. --PeanutCheeseBar 17:47, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have already stated twice before now (in this discussion, no less) that more relevant information exists concerning PSI that has not been added to the page; that aside, you can feel free to "point out" things all you like, so long as they are within discussions. There are guides for Final Fantasy classes and magic (not to mention other games), and it is not your "job" nor do you have the authority to single-handedly make these decisions. --PeanutCheeseBar 18:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>...and as I said, there should be more content concerning the importance of PSI in the Mother series on the page, but there is not. I will make the effort to improve the page, since you have nothing constructive to contribute. --PeanutCheeseBar 18:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why write the same content in three articles when we can write it in just the one and link to it? Removing it is not an "improvement". --PeanutCheeseBar 18:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where is it Wikipedia policy to "be bold" and massively wipe out content? I have no problem with your "boldness" so long as it is constructive (which you have not been), and so far you have not given me adequate reason why you are inherently superior to other users, and thus why you don't have to engage in the conventional measures that most other Wikipedians do when they take issue with an article. --PeanutCheeseBar 15:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The be bold policy lets the user be bold, period. If it doesn't violate policy or guidelines, what do you bring up? And PS: The fact that you don't like it when I merge "your" article doesn't make it unconstructive. Based on the participants of the AfD, I'd suspect that my blanking of the PSI List article was very constructive. And I like how you say that I am claiming superiority to Wikipedians because I, like many other good Wikipedians, don't say "hmm, I guess I should assume that my edit will be controversial, so instead of being bold, I'll ask for permission for anything I do on Wikipedia". You make it seem like "being bold and not asking for permission whenever they want to do a merge" is an uncommon concept on Wikipedia, when plenty of people do it. Few of my merges are considered controversial, so you're basically complaining that I don't ask permission before I do anything. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 15:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not 'my' article, and that's not the issue; I simply don't appreciate the fact that you do this to as many articles as you do, despite the objections that are raised. Truth be told, I wouldn't have had as much of a problem with it had you not been so overtly arrogant at the start of this discourse. That aside, for what it's worth, it does not lend any more credibility to you when you compare yourself to "good Wikipedians", because it only adds to your arrogance (which certainly does not help the discussion at hand). Your boldness stems not from your desire to improve Wikipedia, but rather from your arrogance. The end result is that you show me an increasing amount of arrogance and excuses as to why you can do this and that instead of answering my questions, and I in turn will refuse to answer yours. --PeanutCheeseBar 16:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, right. Because the judge of my character is not myself, but a jilted Wikipedian who is upset because I redirected an article he liked. Do you know how many merged/redirects I've done? Compare that to how many objections have been made, and read more policies while you're at it. You never read what I say, so what difference does it make that you refuse to answer what I ask? Few, if any of my moves were clearly controversial. To say that they are is not only speculation, but baseless speculation at that. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 16:23, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, but you're quite wrong; I DO read what you say, and much as you choose to ignore answering my questions (with great contempt, I might add), I simply decided to "play by your rules" and I decided to ignore yours as well. As for your opinion of yourself and whether or not your moves were controversial, they are just that, opinions. Opinions often stem from fact, but facts don't necessarily stem from opinions, and that seems to affect both your editing skills and your attitude towards others; I am afraid that your refusal to acknowledge that is a shortcoming, but it is one I hope you overcome at some point in the near future. --PeanutCheeseBar 17:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You've been refusing to answer my questions much longer than I have of you. You never showed me a policy where I should say "if it is possible that someone MIGHT not like my edit, I shouldn't make it", you never told me who committed meatpuppetry (which you HAVE to do - not doing so is out of the question, lessen you wanna get in trouble for making attacks). My merges are uncontroversial by the simple fact that there is rarely ever anything to indicate that a merge would be opposed. What about that do you not understand? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 17:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, there's nothing among what you're saying that I don't understand, it's just that you're mistaken in thinking that you've been asking the questions longer (you still haven't explained to me why two years of editing can justify the ever-changing (and sometimes invalid) reasons you present for making changes that have upset a lot of people), and I simply do not appreciate your hostile attitude that has been ever-present in this matter. Judging from your past, I can see where you've upset others with your attitude, and eventually come to apologize to them, so I know you're not all bad; however, until you can be a little more level-headed and less hostile, I'm just going to ignore you. --PeanutCheeseBar 20:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(In reply:) By that token, can <i>anything</i> really be affirmed about Spectacle Rock, besides the fact that it's named in the original <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> (and somewhat so in <i>The Wind Waker</i>)? I think it's pretty obvious that Nintendo keeps programming it into the games. A symbol in the fashion of two, equally-sized, horizontally-depicted, eyeglass-resembling rock outcroppings is pretty unique and noticeable, I'd say... Though the LA picture I provided may not actually <u>be</u> of Spectacle Rock, it's pretty obviously a reference to it.

<dd>I wasn't aware my life was at risk&#160;:). I guess my point is, when it comes to knowledge, a lot of times there's doubt as to its verity, even if it's a sliver of a doubt. So in those cases, should the knowledge in question always be excluded from Wikipedia? Since it's a fine line, I'd think that a place like Wikipedia, which is essentially a compendium of knowledge, would opt to include it rather than exclude it. --<a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETryforceful_b16a.html" title="User:Tryforceful">Tryforceful</a> 07:32, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the discussion had lost steam apparently and the move to game mechanics was never agreed upon. i took the <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">silence</a> as agreement to leave things the way they were. As i have previously argued, topics like this have no place in an article discussing mechanics, additionally it opens the gate for allowing <i>more</i> irrelelvant content to get dumped at the mechanics article just because someone doesn't want to put forth the effort of properly describing what they're talking about. The encyclopedia should not be miseducating people. i had a similar problem with an editor who wanted to create Category:Breeds of rats. The first problem was that they didn't know the difference between a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breed.html" title="Breed">breed</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a>, and the second problem was that <i>rat</i> and <i>mouse</i> are non-scientific names given to a rodent based on size, and is largely subjective (there exist a couple rodents whose common names contain <b>either</b> <i>rat</i> or <i>mouse</i>). The final solution was to keep things the way they were because we should be using the opporutinty to educate people rather than letting them go on to believe falsehoods. This is the same case, the pokerus is a feature or event that operates like an item, not a mechanic and we shouldn't use the list articles as dumping grounds. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 18:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading other users comments, I see that the aggressive editing and persistence is not isolated. Frankly it is discouraging to see this kind of cookie cutter treatment. I can only imagine this is to establish and maintain a history of successful and large alteration edits. Yes we are talking about a list of weapons and items, but not a guide. If you are concerned about it having some kind of guiding or tutorial value, why not take the time to edit the language, or let me do it, or discuss it? The adheration by many to "the policy and rules" of wikipedia is a farce when one of the pillars of its design is its own flexibility and lack off such guidelines. I have previously provided a list of similar articles with the same flaw that you have identified. They will need to be revised. I wish you all the best in your endeavors. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarBaCoN_156b.html" title="User:WarBaCoN">WarBaCoN</a> 05:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just want to see the article, as with any suitable article, improve, not get picked apart.

<dd>I would not include a guide, but I would include a list/overview of weapons.. these are what sets fps games apart from each other in general.. and this is what made this and a few other games unique for the time.. you might as well say that an article can exist on a game, but it can't actually talk about the in game experience.. it's kind of like an overview of abilities in sonic the hedgehog's article, or kirby's.. I could call those a guide too if I wanted.. or whatever.. I see no strength in the argument other than some precedence and a vague rule about video game guides. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarBaCoN_156b.html" title="User:WarBaCoN">WarBaCoN</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarBaCoN_6d30.html" title="User talk:WarBaCoN">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WarBaCoN_2028.html" title="Special:Contributions/WarBaCoN">contribs</a>) 17:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>The only reason I point to other articles (precedence) is because you originally had referenced criticisms in prominent articles. If you are going to say levels = weapons, and so on, I can point to the <b>featured article</b> on the game <a href="../../../f/-/z/F-Zero_GX_9b31.html" title="F-Zero GX">F-Zero GX</a> which lists both "Techniques" and a table of levels, and has a further article to detail the in game levels/worlds. Or good article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_64_8e71.html" title="Star Fox 64">Star Fox 64</a> overviewing vehicles.. Or featured article <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a> with (condensed) weapon list and so on.. or countless articles listing characters, classes, ranks or other classifications referencing the game alone. I contest that unless you are planning to try for a featured or good article rating on this (which I can safely assume you will not), it isn't grounds for this much rigidity on your part. Even still, I think at best your point is derived from a guide for the "ideal article", not a rule set for all articles to adhere to, and going around deleting all lists of items, weapons, levels, enemies or whatever from articles would be in error. Not to mention the definition of a guide is much more defined than that of a list, but you use the words interchangeably. At this point I only debate to try to see some shred of flexibility in your adherence to this undefined, outside of precedence, "rule". I found only one reference to this stating that video games guides are not allowed, with no definition or details beyond this. To the majority, a guide is something that directs a player on how to play a game successfully, and does little to detail the game in terms of content and experience, as that is what you would find if you were to search for video game guides elsewhere. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarBaCoN_156b.html" title="User:WarBaCoN">WarBaCoN</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarBaCoN_6d30.html" title="User talk:WarBaCoN">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WarBaCoN_2028.html" title="Special:Contributions/WarBaCoN">contribs</a>) 21:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>You are saying that it is against the rules to list in any way, the weapons, items, levels in a game, and I think I have shown that that is not the case. To compare it to vandalism is a slight, where vandalism has no regard for the article. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarBaCoN_156b.html" title="User:WarBaCoN">WarBaCoN</a> 16:15, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw you had removed a section on the available powerups in one of the old games, A-jax (assuming I'm getting the name right). I have seen many other games describe available items in this genre. What makes some information a game guide and other information just encyclopoedic? I would agree that describing in detail how to acquire said powerups would be vital, but not just saying what is there. Note that other games have had the quantity of such items mentioned as unique or not--one example is the old Commando game. IL-Kuma 06:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to your request for clarification..I have seen some guides with what appear to be encyclopedic lists ('These are available from this'), some that have NO information at all, and some that give too much information ('Go to square 43, shoot NW three times ... '). The most typical are the list of what is in the game, as a way to contrast available items with other similar games. I rarely see overdescriptive items, and the stripped-list ones are only after someone had removed all mention of the abilities. I'm planning to add a few more items to the gameplay descriptions, but was also planning on mentioning the available items. At what point is a list a guide and not just a list? IL-Kuma 06:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You indicated your opinion that powerup descriptions are in the theme of game guides, which WP:NOT#IINFO cites as outside of Wiki's scope. However, I do disagree with the total removal of descriptions, as it can differentiate one game from another. The project page does not address this issue, though. At least, not that I've seen yet. Personally, I think a brief description would be warranted; I do understand that a lengthy treatise on how to acquire a laser upgrade is outside of Wiki's bounds, but a list included in the description of its gameplay would be more description than how-to guide. There is a differing line somewhere--otherwise, one could argue that a list of scoring would count. And while an enemy-by-enemy description is iffy (I would let it in), some games are cited as 'one enemy equals one point'--and that description WOULD fall under scoring, and if all scoring is removed as a game guide, then what to me is an important disticntion (games that score conventionally vs games that only score kills--compare Final Fight to The Simpsons arcade game) would be removed entirely.

<dd>Speaking of List of Wii Games, I re-assessed it as A-class. You bumped it down to B-class because it hadn't passed GA, and usually I'd agree with you, but lists aren't allowed to even be submitted to GA, and there's no such thing as a GL. Lists are kind of awkward in the assessment scale, some projects don't even bother assessing them, creating a List-class for them. Anyway, looks like it will be in FLC soon, so it won't matter one way or another. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 22:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
