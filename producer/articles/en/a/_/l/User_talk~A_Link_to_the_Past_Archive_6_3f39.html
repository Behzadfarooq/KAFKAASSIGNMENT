<p>I have thought of creating a WikiProject for South Park since it is now near its' 10th anniversary and has more articles than ever. I feel we could all do the following things through this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanup any short/poorly written/unformatted articles</li>
<li>Merge/lengthen the many character articles</li>
<li>Improve the South Park main page</li>
</ul>
<p>I have seen your South Park fan template and wondered if you were interested in joining. If so reply to my talk page and I'll get back to you as quick as I can.

<p>OK ALTTP, listen up and listen carefully...you CAN'T just edit all my contributions to the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_Tag_Team_Racing_8115.html" title="Crash Tag Team Racing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a> section of wikipedia just because you can't accept the truth. EVERYTHING I keep saying is completly true (ESPECIALLY about the part where some people say that it is a rip-off, others (and that's only including me) saying it isn't) and should be stated, but you obviously can't accept this because you're a Mario fanboy. Well listen here, buster. I don't take kindly to Mario fanboys barging in, trying to wreck the Crash Bandicoot franchise (or any franchise that Mario fanboys so wrongly try to beat up, for that matter). If you can't accept it, just leave it. Don't try and run from the truth. Besides, Mario cloned many games in his time as well, and you don't see any complaints on the CTR/CNK sections, do you?</p>

<p>OK, now you're just being DAFT! How can Crash Tag Team Racing be a clone of Mario Kart: Double Dash and Crash Team Racing NOT be a clone of Mario Kart 64? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, buster. Are you even paying attention to the works of these things? Not from where I'm standing. You're just being stupid. REAL stupid. For one thing, instead of trying to accept that other people might (and this is only a might) have a point, you tell lies about them. You did that to me! I repeat one more time, I. Am. Not. The. Only. Person. Around. Who. Thinks. Crash. Tag. Team. Racing. Is. NOT. A. Mario. Kart. Double. Dash. Clone. I'm trying EVERYTHING here to keep BOTH sides of the fandom happy, and you just vandalise everything, simply because you want everything to go YOUR way and YOUR way says that CTTR is DEFINATLEY a MK:DD clone, obviously. Your way is not the wikipedia way here kid, and you obviously can't accept the wikipedia way, which says that CTTR MIGHT be a MK:DD clone, but on the other hand might NOT be. And as you obviously can't accept this, I think we all know who the vandal is. I mean, I don't like Mario, but I don't actively go about trashing all of the sections. Think about it kid, and perhaps go away, mature, then come back. After all, I'M not the one losing my temper, and I'M not the one trying to wreck the wikipedia boards.</p>
<p>Look, there's a way that I see these things. Saying a game is a rip-off of another game is an opinion. Saying it isn't is also an opinion. But saying some people say it is a rip-off whilst others say it isn't, that isn't an opinion and doesn't even involve you directly into the conversation, which is not the aforementioned "Wikipedia" way, if you ask me. That's the reason I edited the piece of text out, then tried to alter it, to make it cover both sides of the argument. It's not what I'd call an opinion, and I know several areas which can back this up.</p>
<p>Look, you're not helping. It's all very well saying "Post a link to show that people say CTTR isn't a MK:DD clone", but I can't post links here, can I? No one ever told me how to do it here.</p>
<p>Link, when you edited the article, you clearly stated that people complained that CTTR plain-out copied Mario Kart Double Dash's two-people in a kart feature. Now, if you said people complained that CTTR used that feature because they believe it copied that feature, even though games before MKDD (I know for sure there was a Cartoon Network one) used it, it would be okay. - Klaus Kratchet</p>

<p>I already responded on the appropriate talk page. I had gotten involved after Ian Moody had moved the page. It began on Four Swords but had shifted its way to ALTTP/FS after the move, which gave it the appearance that you were attempting to removed ALTTP/FS, not FS. While I do disagree with some points you've made (as I stated on the page, the Jewish thing for instance), I don't have the same motivational suspicion and I was wrong about my earlier accusation. I've apologized on the talk page for the misunderstanding. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 01:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've a few things to discuss with you, which seem kind of fishy to me. When you originally posted to my Talk page that the vandalism of the Youkaimura article was done by the website's author, I assumed, and thus replied in a like manner, that you were a sympathetic user who was kindly informing me of said fact. I didn't really even look at your username on my Talk page until recently. Now, though, I can see that your comment there was actually a retort to my usage of the term "vandalism" or "vandal" when I restored the article. I guess what you were basically saying was that I was inaccurate in saying that he was a vandal, since he was altering information about his own creation.</p>
<p>In this light, I've begun to think about the fact that, while Hushicho claimed to have filed for deletion, it was you who actually did. When one considers that you and Hushicho share video gaming as an interest, and the fact that a separate website run by the owner of Youkaimura, about video games, prominently mentions the character Link and the game "A Link to the Past", well... This is an awful lot of coincidence going on, especially for a person who seems to uphold policies like "notability" which concur with his stance toward the article in question, but disregards other policies like "no vandalism" because they don't concur with said stance.</p>
<p>At least I was open with my intentions toward the article.Shikino 15:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The main point I wanted to make had nothing to do with valuing your argument or anything like that. I don't really see how you could have come to that conclusion. What I thought most interesting, besides the possible connections addressed above, was that while you clinged to the notability policy, the anti-vandalism policy didn't seem to bother you too much when you defended Hushicho's vandalism of the article on my Talk page. Shikino 03:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So you just happened to see the article and nominate it for deletion, just around the same time Hushicho claimed that he himself had done it? And I'm sorry, but you're wrong. The only time I used the word "vandalized" in regards to this article is when Hushicho did vandalize the article. Too late to check the article's history now, but if you'd bothered to do that, you would have seen that twice he deleted the entire article's text and replaced it with something along the lines of "This page is being deleted because of slander and copyright violations" -- two claims which, I might add, were totally baseless.

Basically, while yes, I do feel that the Jewish thing was a personal attack, I think for the most part we both maintained <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> pretty well, and the reverts were contained only to that one aforementioned part, so <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> didn't really come into play either. I explained that the misunderstanding was entirely <b>my fault</b>; heck, the entire argument was pretty much based on the fact that I hadn't seen that the "I'm going to move this article" talk bit had originated on the FS article and then later been moved. Seeing as I think that the argument was settled in a rather civil manner, I would rather not have any residual hard feelings creep up from my error. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 06:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Link, I'm not saying that you don't have a good argument for removing the cancelled games and Soul Calibur. I'm saying that when major edits are done to template pages, it should be discussed and agreed upon in the talk page, in accordance with the templates section of<a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>. The Soul Calibur edit, in particular, does not increase the length of the template, and there are very few non-Zelda games where Link is a playable character (unlike your example of Pac-Man), so it is reasonable to leave it in the template. That's why it's the "Related games" section. This may just be my opinion, but that is why we come to <i>consensus</i> on templates before changing them. <a href="../../../s/r/a/User%7ESraan_30dc.html" title="User:Sraan">Sraan</a> 20:19, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. You recently participated in a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Danny_Phantom_%28character%29_d8d6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Danny Phantom (character)">discussion</a> on the possible deletion or merger of some <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Phantom_2f41.html" title="Danny Phantom">Danny Phantom</a> characters. While all the articles were kept, I noted that many of those commenting on the debate suggested merging some characters into a main list. Seeing this, I've compiled a list of some of the minor characters who may not need their own article, and would like the opinions of those who weighed in originally.

<p>No, you have not proved it. The diff you friviously readded to my archive proves nothing. I said you had a bias towards characters having thier own articles. You were supposed to provide a diff that said that I said you hated Danny Phantom. That diff you provided didn't even have the text "Danny Phantom" in it. I am not about to say you were right, and I find it very annoying that you continue to troll at my talk page demanding to say you were right over a AFD that is now over, which you clearly are not by the outcome of the AFD. I refuse to keep taking messages from you on my talk page refering this Danny Phantom AFD that is <b>over</b>. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 20:13, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You really need to be a fan of the show to understand his importance though. I would rank Grimes as being more important to the show in his one appearance than many characters who have made close to a hundred appearances. But, it's your choice.

<dd>Yeah, but AMIB only blocked me for what I was reverting back to (or at least was more inclined to block me because of it). Additionally, I was only reverting because I wasn't going to discuss it again - we've been discussing merging, redirecting, and deletion for months, with all discussions resulting in a consensus for keeping the article where it stands. But AMIB continues to insist that we have to rediscuss is every single month for no reason other than to kill this article.

<p>Hi. I'm familiar with you from various video game-related edits you do and you generally do a good job. I'm just curious why you are set on redirecting the Poochy page to the SMW2: Yoshi's Island page. I feel that Poochy is a significant enough character to warrant his own page, rather than just the truncated bit of info available on the SMW2: Yoshi's Island page, especially since his presence extends beyond that game and it would seem out of place to put the Yoshi's Story and Tetris Attack info on that page. Anyway, please tell me what you think. <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKidicarus222_8b5d.html" title="User:Kidicarus222">Kidicarus222</a> 18:41, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would have to agree here (and not just because he's my namesake). If you felt that the page should've redirected to a disambiguation, I'd say it would've been better to move the article to another name, such as <a href="../../../p/o/o/Poochy_%28Nintendo%29_4aa8.html" title="Poochy (Nintendo)">Poochy (Nintendo)</a>.

I refused to on the grounds that it would be saying I was trolling, which I was not, and was blocked for 48 hours. And when I claimed he was acting in bad faith, I was blocked for 96 hours.

<dd>That's not how RFCs work. You don't just try and find the most amenable group of editors (in this case a gaming WikiProject) and try to get together a lynch mob to take another editor down. Wikipedia isn't a battleground. How about try talking with AMIB? What I'm seeing from this end is that you're constantly in conflicts with a variety of different people.

<dd>How am I starting a "battle"? I wasn't saying "hey, go attack him". I asked for people to give evidence that could be used. Am I to create an RfC and then hope people notice it and add information, or rather, should I single-handedly search his entire history for anything that I could consider abusive? But this is a moot argument. Nothing I did violated policy, and many people agree. If you would like me to find them, I will gladly do so. Regardless, here is the thing - you bring up an old debate and claim that this one is similar, when it is completely insimilar. You are comparing a heated argument to a calm discussion that happens to have some conflict between users. Please, just stop trying to dig for reasons to dig into me when your original statement was shown to be invalid to this current discussion. Yes, I have conflicts, because other people have conflicts too. InShaneee had conflicts that I was announcing an RfC, but it is not a blockable offense. The fact that I have been blocked before is not relevant - did I violate policy? No. But regardless, InShaneee is so convinced that I need to be blocked that he has started a wheel war. Please, stick to the discussion at hand. I do not have a poor history - I have only one block that hasn't been overturned. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 04:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're still being too argumentative. And I think you may have misread my opening comment.

<dd>Wait, so by not violating any policy on Wikipedia, I have done something wrong? I ask you, where is it that says anything I've been blocked for is blockable for even a single instant in time, let alone 96 hours? If he can prove that I am lying when I say I'm not trolling, then I'll take it in stride. But all he does is say "well, looks like trolling, must be trolling because I said so". That's not good enough, I think I'll go with what I think over what he thinks about what I am doing. I am being argumentative because InShaneee has abused his right to be an admin by giving an excessive block for a nonexistant policy violation. I'm not going to stop arguing this JUST because I argued before. The only person that handled this poorly was him. I was doing nothing wrong in keeping this up. I did not violate 3RR, I was not trolling (despite the Almighty InShaneee telling me otherwise), and I was not harassing AMIB, and yet InShaneee decided that I should be blocked because of the mere possibility that he could be right. And I'm of the opinion that admins DON'T have the responsibility to treat non-admins like dirt and regularly threaten them whenever they want to force Wikipedia to go their way. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:23, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Before you do so, read <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>. It states that blocks are meant to be protective, not punitive. What exactly is being protected by blocking me? You cannot prove that I am trolling, and are assuming bad faith, as any Wikipedian would tell you. All you have to show that I am trolling is the opinion that I am trolling, which is not a strong enough basis to block me, and you are certainly not preventing damage to Wikipedia. A 96 hour block for putting an RfC notice on a talk page and being sarcastic has no preventive value, and is clearly intended to be punishment. There is no way that any good Wikipedian would knowingly block someone out of punishment even though they know it's wrong. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As someone who generally agrees with you on this issue, Link, I'd like to pass along some advice, which you can take or leave entirely at your discretion. (Advice, like opinions, has been compared to a certain part of the anatomy both for its fragrance and ubiquitious nature.) I'd advise you to drop it and walk away at this point. I think what needed to be said has been said - further comment tends to shift the focus back from InShaneee's behavior and onto yours. I don't think that's the right way to go - it makes it look like you're eager to escalate, like you're hard to get along with, and that makes his (I believe) unjustified block look more justified than it was. I think a lot of people are starting to feel that this has reached resolution (and in your favor, I think). It might be a good time to walk away from it and get back to editing. But that's just my opinion, for what that's worth. Thanks.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 02:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware there was no vote or survey, I have seen others who have dissagreed with you about the issue, I don't see a concensus. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 07:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I looked at the discussion at CVG and I don't see a consensus there either, and it definitely was not 8:2. Voting is generally frowned upon, but in some cases surveys can be <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?VotingIsGood" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?VotingIsGood" rel="nofollow">useful</a> in determining whether there's any concensus, I think this is one of the cases in which a survey may have to be used. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 09:44, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, A Link to the Past. The problem here is that, many of these numbers are real numbers, that can be found across the internet. Especially the highest selling games such as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Bros. So I think the best solution here is to leave the numbers in, and try to find sources for all of them. That way there is some reference for someone who might be looking for information on this subject of sales. Deleting all of them is just quite silly if you think about. There are many numbers on this page that do not have citations and they haven't been deleted. So I think we should keep them as references.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust6000_91d0.html" title="User:Stardust6000">Stardust6000</a> 00:25, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you sure that all of the numbers are wrong? I've seen many source confirming the sales of many of those games. I doubt that they would just make up everything. Just to let you know, I finished deleting all of those sources. Now that it has been done the source reconstruction can begin. If we seriously cannot find any other sources confirming some of the sales figures then I would agree to remove them if someone opted to, but I wouldn't be the one to do that. I hope that helps, take care for now.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust6000_91d0.html" title="User:Stardust6000">Stardust6000</a> 00:34, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't have the time to argue with the likes of you anymore. I don't know what your agenda is to delete even the new sources I put in the article. I will no longer be involved in this situation. Go ahead and destroy the article if that is what you wish to do, goodbye.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust6000_91d0.html" title="User:Stardust6000">Stardust6000</a> 22:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, it doesn't really matter because your allowed to remove any comment you like on your talk page. Ultimately, he is not a factor in deciding what comments stay and go because there is no policy or guideline on this issue and there doesn't need to be. Anyone is allowed to remove what they see fit from thier talk page. It's always going to be in the talk page history and thats enough evidence supporting that you tried to talk to the editor.</p>

<p>This is bording on harassment. Stop it. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 23:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Harassment? The user is making it difficult for me to edit Wikipedia by reverting edits I make, assuming bad faith in what I am saying, and refusing to respond to anything I say. He is being a complete hypocrite, and ignoring other users for such a poor reason is not going to help on an RfAr. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're considering taking this to arbitration, and if I were his advisor, I'd <b>tell</b> him not to talk with you. He doesn't owe you any response - all he owes you is to leave you alone. To the extent that he is not leaving you alone - i.e. that he is reverting all your edits or the like, I'd say to make a list rather than fighting with him over it. Just a little advice - as always, you can take or leave it.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 23:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Reply from my talk page) Your comments might hold some water if you didn't have a knack for getting constantly into disputes with people. There's always <i>someone</i> twisting your words, revering your edits, assusing you of trolling, acting in bad faith, etc. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 23:49, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Reply from my talk page) Link, I'm largely on your side, as I have been throughout this. But he's not placing himself above you by refusing to discuss this with you. Right now neither of you are going to be able to have a calm, courteous discussion. He'll get mad, or you'll get mad, or a third party will get mad - whatever. The best thing to do is to not talk to each other directly - that's why you go to an RfAr. If you could work it out between yourselves, you wouldn't <b>need</b> arbitration. You can't work it out between yourselves. So if contact with him (a) has no possibility of resolving the issue and (b) will probably lead to more conflict, then why do it? If you're going to arbitration, wait to discuss these things with him there. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 00:13, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My advice still stands - make a list of all the times he does it rather than talking to him about it. Nothing you say to him will change his behavior. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 00:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
