<dd>It was certainly not a content dispute; the user WhiteMinority was linkspamming vgcharts.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, I must apologize, I did not intend to commit 3RR. I was under the impression that 24 hours had passed since my last revert. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I accept that your intention was not to violate 3RR, but the spirit of the policy is to stop edit warring, waiting 24 hours and one minue for a 4th revert is simply gaming the system.

<p>I have know from the beginning that VGCharts may not be the greatest source in the world, and I certainly agree that its numbers are not accurate to precision. I also do not really care whether the sales data is used here or not, as all video game sales data is ultimately unreliable, making this arguement largely pointless. I think this page really should be deleted for a lack of reliable information or at the very least radically redesigned, but I know this would not go over well at all. We do have a rather nasty edit war here, however, largely perpetrated by <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteMinority_a18f.html" title="User:WhiteMinority">WhiteMinority</a>. I have only gotten involved in an attempt to understand what is going on and how this may be resolved. Can you think of a scenario where some of these numbers would be acceptable to show something as a compromise? If not, I think we should delete the numbers as unverifiable and bring an RFC against <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteMinority_a18f.html" title="User:WhiteMinority">WhiteMinority</a> if he tries to change it back. I would fully support you in this move and act as a verifying witness on your behalf, but I will not start the RfC myself. If you are not willing to take that step, I understand, but I just want you to realize that after discussing the matter with you fully I agree with your position and feel the numbers are not reliable for the purposes of this article. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 23:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am unsure why you have not responded to me, as I see you have been lurking around wikipedia on a couple of occasions since I wrote the above, but I am a little surpirsed due to your sometimes heated exchanges on the best-selling video games page. I would appreciate a response even if it is just "buzz off, I really do not care anymore" (though I would hope you would put it more politely than that&#160;;) I am fully serious about supporting you in an RFC and making sure these numbers do not remain on wikipedia, I just do not want to move to a more formal stage unless I know there is support to do so. Likewise, I would understand of this futile arguement has just made you sick of the whole thing and you want to leave things where they are. Either way, please give me the courtesy of a response of some kind. Thank you for your time, and I hope I am not annoying you too greatly, as this is not my intent. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 22:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What in the world?! I'm not gaming the system! At what point does making three edits make it gaming the system, no matter what? The only reason I alerted him to it is because if he did break 3RR afterwards, he would have no reason to not know better.</dd>
<dd>And what in the world AGAIN. You know, I wouldn't be so pissed at this if you didn't decide that because I was trying to keep a bad edit off of this article I was trying to game the system. Oh, and I probably wouldn't be so pissed if it weren't for the fact that you blocked ONLY ME. So let me guess - someone who actually did something wrong and made three edits and is fully aware of 3RR and should know better since he reports all sorts of 3RR violations. But God forbid that an admin be fair.</dd>
<dd>So tell me - if I had reverted an IP replacing the article's content with curse words three times, would I be gaming the system? This user blanked the contents of the page because they are unsourced - is there any policy that says unsourced content should be deleted and, thusly, made unsourcable? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:50, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Complex partial reverts" refer to reverts that remove or re-add only some of the disputed material while adding new material at the same time, which is often done in an effort to disguise the reverting. This type of edit counts toward 3RR, regardless of the editor's intention.</p>

<li>Yes, and my intention for the first edit was to remove the numbers. I was fixing links as I went along. I was not masking my edits - why would I have to? The website was proven to be unverifiable, no one was objecting to it, and it was three days old. I waited until the discussion about VGCharts was more or less complete.</li>
<li>And? I made a separate revert of something several days old. Under your logic, I would have to be blocked if I first reverted vandalism and then reverted three times afterwards?</li>
<li>I highly doubt that it's accepted to completely destroy the article. There is no way for people to contribute to the sourcing of this article if the article pretty much doesn't exist. The user was obviously seeking to get rid of the article now that VGCharts was proven to be a poor source. AfD threats, blanking of the article, and an eventual AfD (in which he stated that the AfD was to "improve" it, to pretty much force people to source it before five days is up). When the majority of the article was unsourced but still used VGCharts' numbers, he didn't care. But when the numbers were no longer there, then he decided that the article must be deleted. I don't care that you are assuming I am acting in bad faith, I am protecting an article from being blanked. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:54, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> is right, if a material is or can be challenged it must provide a source, if it has no source it must be deleted. The information can be placed back in when it is sourced.

<dd>So Khoikhoi is right? Well, that's strange - he didn't say it "must be deleted". Show me a policy that says without exception, all unsourced material must be deleted. If it were policy to delete unsourced content at sight like you have done lately, then logically, anything that's added without a source right away must be deleted at sight as if it were no better than vandalism, preventing anyone but those who knew it was once in the article to source it. And if you really cared about an article being unsourced and felt that all unsourced content must be deleted, then why didn't you do so earlier? Only when VGCharts' complete wipe out from the article became highly probable did you bring it up as a concern. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:05, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me dig them up. He blocked me for "insulting" him. He warned me for calling one user a troll. He said that even if the user is a troll it's wrong to call someone a troll..

<p>Hey A Link to the Past,</p>
<p>I don't know if you're anti-lotl or pro-IGN, or we are just having a misunderstanding, but I thought this is better discussed on our talk pages.<br />
I am not certain what you think the sources on Wikipedia are for, if it is not to make sure that the information is correct. I mean, if it is to make sure the information is correct, then sources should be about <i>correct information</i> / the truth, not about the image.</p>

<dd>It can be verified that IGN is more often correct than they are incorrect. As I said, all you need to know is that Wikipedia - not me - says verifiability is more important than truth. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:12, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And IGN is reliable. Reliable enough that what they say should be assumed to be truth. Voila. Whether or not it is true is a moot point. They are a reliable source. They are used as a source in many other major sources. Can you name a game source that hasn't been wrong about something? IGN said that Link was in Soul Calibur II. IGN was the first to say the secret characters in SSBM. They have been correct more often than not. They have verifiability. They have reliability. The odds of them being correct are on their side, not those seeking for it to be removed from Wikipedia. It is your burden to prove that they are not reliable and verifiable now. People know them. 95 of the top 100 most-clicked websites on Google when searching for "IGN" were IGN or related to it. It is in the top 200 websites on Alexa. It stands as one of, if not THE most well-known source for game information ever. Just because you dislike them does not mean you can declare them to be a bad source.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, the point is not the say IGN is completely unreliable, which I believe I never said, but that it shouldn't be acted upon like they are holy, BECAUSE they have shown to be unreliable. Information from IGN should just be handled with cause.</dd>

<dd>LotL - unverifiable. Basically, if you can't show verifiability, how reliable the information is is moot. If they are not verifiable, they likely aren't the ones Nintendo gave the info to, but rather got the information from a site such as - oh, say, IGN. You have to show it because IGN has NEVER been shown to be unsuitable for Wikipedia. In a long debate, literally no one showed LotL to be appropriate for Wikipedia. Am I the only one who has to prove anything? I have shown that IGN is verifiable and reliable, but no one has shown that LotL is verifiable. You do not seem to understand Wikipedia policy. Land of the Legend is not verifiable and thusly is never to be used. IGN is verifiable and is to be used when appropriate. Until you can show LotL to be verifiable, it will not be included on Wikipedia.

<dd>So if the source is bad, it does not matter, as long as... well, you have yet to explain why LotL is reliable. The fact that they can read what everyone else says and recycle it on their page does not make them reliable. And how can information be verifiable? The only way to tell if information is correct or not is the assumption that because a verifiable source said it, it's true. Explain to me why LotL is a good source. They are a fan site. If LotL were reliable, were verifiable, you'd have proved it by now. The Verifiability policy in a nutshell is "use only sites in which it can be assumed that it is true based on the site's verifiability". In what universe can LotL be shown to be verifiable or reliable enough? They have no standing in the industry, and as such, cannot be assumed that what they say is most likely true. And even if what they say is most likely true, it's not because they are a big site. They could be described as nothing more than a Geocities web site which merely reads everything every other site says and repeats it. So basically, LotL is the parrot of the industry. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 02:16, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You keep mixing up verifiable information and reliable sources. There is no such thing as a verifiable source, as it is the source that varifies. As the very first mark of the policy talks of <b>reliable sources</b> and not verifiable sources (verifiable is mentioned below when talking of the information), this whole discussion is based on something non-existant.</dd>
<dd>Why is lotl reliable? Simply, because they have not been wrong (yet), and have rather, often debunked rumours.</dd>
<dd>I remember IGN saying from E3 2005 untill fall this year, that there would be flying transportation, alike Epona, in Twilight Princess. I remember from day 1, that lotl said it was not the case. The game is out and, they've been proven correct.</dd>
<dd>Many more rumours have been debunked by them like that; either rumours from IGN, some magazine, or from inside the Zelda community.</dd>
<dd>Your statement about being the parrot of the industry is false as well. I've done a little research, and they were the first with news on several occasions. This years' E3 about the differences between the two versions of TP, they were the first to post that news, LATER also posted by bigger outlets. Early 2006, when Miyamoto gave some interview to Nintendo of Europe, they were the first to get aditional information from that interview, which was later proved correctly again.</dd>
<dd>Such an outlet (which they state to be a professional outlet themselves -and I have checked and they are indeed registered as a press outlet here in the Netherlands- rather then a fansite) can be called reliable because of those very reasons. They have given reliable information, and they have a record of not giving unreliable information.</dd>
<dd>I don't care if I, you or Bill Gates likes an outlet like that; Wikipedia is about facts and these are the facts about land of the legend. If that makes me a devil's advocate, so be it, but facts are facts. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 06:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AHAHAHAHA. Oh, so I guess LotL is good at everyone else being correct. LotL is a PARROT. If it couldn't get the information from all of the other big sites, it would have no information that the readers didn't already know. I guess you have a good track record as long as you piggyback on every single other web site.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! I can't believe that IGN could have been wrong and LotL is right. It's not possible, as IGN is omnipotent and LotL is not physically capable of being correct about stuff. You know who else has been wrong? Hint: Billions and billions of people, and more or less - Hell, exactly every single media outlet that has ever existed. And what do you mean, "they aren't a parrot because they reported on the E3 thing"? So do you mean to say that they went to E3, played it, and then went back to put it on their site? I'm really sure that a web site with an Alexa rank of &lt;2 million got an exclusive on Zelda TP's controls. Hell, my web site is leaps and bounds more authorative, verifiable, and notable than Land of the Legend is. Hell, why is it even used over Hyrule.net? Alexa ranking for that site is around 250,000. More than 2 million places higher than LotL.</p>
<p>Not only that, but why in the world is this even being debated? I assume you remember that it was basically you and the site owner V. world.</p>
<p>And here in the Netherlands? Mind if I ask, do you work for LotL? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 07:12, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny how you like to try and twist things, when facts are presented.</dd>
<dd>Trying to deny lotl's presence at E3, while they have shown to be there, have footage of it and all - where E3 2005 is what made them 'famous', is really nothing more then rediculing.</dd>
<dd>It's nice and all you try and use Alexa as a back-up, but anyone with the least bit of understanding of webdesign, knows that suchs things are not definite. Some ranking most certainly does not overrule the verified facts that they have (had) exclusives.</dd>
<dd>No, I do not work for land of the legend; it's called a little research. A little research like which could have shown you their proven reliability. In this case, simply looking up who they are -GameLegend is from the Netherlands, and here in the Netherlands -where I happen to be from- they are registered as press. Takes 10 minutes and saves a lot of vandalizing of articles.</dd>
<dd>I don't know what more can be said, other then that it is sad that you let your own hate against some site -of all things, who hates a site...- overrule any serious talk and actions. The facts are there, you just choose to ignore them and act as if they are not there. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 00:17, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies, I'm not a fan of unverifiable sites being used on Wikipedia. Konami, Namco, Atlus, they send my web site free games for the purpose of reviews. However, my website is not verifiable for use on Wikipedia. And yes, Alexa IS a judge of how verifiable a site is. It's constantly used. Has LotL ever been mentioned on major sites? In major publications? As a source? I doubt it. Ultimatum: Prove that what you say is actually true. Fail, and all you are doing is spamming the link. And no, I do have to reveal to you that without you having said why it's verifiable, there is no proof. And by the way, reverting your linkspam is not vandalism. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mergers will only succeed when it is uncontroverisal. You are ignoring the fact that TTN disagreed with the mergert. It was not a redirect when Axem nominated the article. If he hadn't nominated it, the next step would have been to discuss on the talk page, instead of reverting TTN and redirecting it again. Axem simply stepped in and started the formal procedure to delete the article outright. You are confusing users who are checking out both articles if they are getting redirected to the toehr one.

<dd>This has been discussed and there was a consensus not to use the web site as a source. Despite that, he uses it anyway. The user appears to be biased towards its usage, and at no point has the user ever verified its reliability. The user does not have any concerns with the objections to its usage, so a discussion would just lead to a band-aid. Eventually, he would peel it off just like he did with the first. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 06:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Commenting as an uninvolved user here: Looking at the site, I can understand why it would not generally be a citeable resource. In this specific instance, however, I believe you can make an exception since the site is effectively just acting as an image host for 5 pictures that speak for themselves. The pictures are verifiable, so it doesn't really matter if they're hosted on a fansite, wikipedia, or some guy's photobucket. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 06:28, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey A Link to the Past,</p>
<p>Now that, I hope, things have settled down a bit, I thought I'd leave you a message and some yummyness.</p>
<p>The reason I got upset with your, if so I can call it, apparant crusade against lotl, is that it makes the articles incomplete, or filled with tags, for no reason. As you've seen, I'm not the only one that disagreed with you on some of the 'extremer' cases as with the pictures/videos.</p>
<p>As I have seen that a lack of it has got you into trouble before, a little word of advice would be to do a little research before getting into an argument. In our case, all I had to do in the Triforce reference article is click the link to MIT, and the reference listing you requested <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html#Reliable_sources" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">above</a> also took me no more then 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to say, if we can all -not saying I'm perfect- be a little more flexible, it would save us all a lot of stress and annoyance.</p>
<p>Happy editting</p>

<dd>Yeah, because Wikipedia's about how many people like you, instead of how good Wikipedia is.</dd>
<dd>Allow me to debunk these.</dd>
<dd>Much of your content is blogs using it as a source of news because they read it first at LotL.</dd>
<dd>IGN's mention does not verify LotL to be reliable. It mentions something that only LotL did. They don't just not mention it because an unreliable source said it, they link to where it originated.</dd>
<dd>The video? They went to E3, and someone linked to it. Any source can have that done by another site.</dd>
<dd>Jeux-France mentions NP scans being linked to at LotL. (illegal, by the way)</dd>
<dd>A couple of those links doesn't even work right.</dd>

<dd>I made three reversions. The first edit of the four you show are not reverts.</dd>
<dd>And watch me use my psychic powers - where I had made only three reversion in the past, which resulted in you blocking me for gaming the system, InShaneee making three reversions is not gaming the system. I guess those are the perks of being an admin, policy is not relevant.

<dd>He's right, actually. The edit summary makes it look like a revert, but the change preceding it was to a different RfC listing.

<p>However, in the context of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html#Three_revert_rule" title="Help:Reverting">English Wikipedia three revert rule</a>, a revert is defined far more broadly as any change to an article that <u>partially or completely goes back to any older version of an article</u>.</p>

<dd>You called someone a douche. You blocked someone for violating no policies (and ironically, you violated two policies by blocking for no valid reason and blocking someone for edit warring in a dispute you were involved in). You assumed bad faith and blocked me even though you could not cite any policies I violated (and in fact, existing policies on Wikipedia showed that what I was doing was not trolling; additionally, the block was punitive). You wheel warred while hypocritically telling the other admin not to wheel war. You talked down to another user who told you that wheel warring was bad, feeling insulted about being told policy like a newbie (even though you needed to be, since you did not understand what wheel warring is). You ignored Zscout when he told you not to use reversion software in the way you are using it. You created a disruption on the Paper Mario TTYD article. You accused me of stalking, and ignored me when I gave just-fine reasoning why what I did in the TTYD article was not stalking. You claimed that my user page with the Frank Grimes article in it was disruptive/bad, and refused to even acknowledge the possibility that it was not. You claimed I was baiting you with the TTYD article - which - voila - disrupts Wikipedia. You are constantly hypocritical - you always tell people not to call edits vandalism, or trolling, and you tell people to focus on the articles, not the user. And yet, I have seen you inappropriately refer to users as vandals or trolls, and much of what you've done showed you focus on the user far too often. Whether or not my accusations are "hateful" is irrelevant to the fact that they are valid on their face. Are you ever going to apologize for the vast array of things you have done wrong? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Specifically, Inshaneee removed his RFC from the list of active RFCs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FUser_conduct&amp;diff=97052715&amp;oldid=97017902" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FUser_conduct&amp;diff=97052715&amp;oldid=97017902" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and Link reverted Inshanee's change for the first time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FUser_conduct&amp;diff=99654632&amp;oldid=99501154" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FUser_conduct&amp;diff=99654632&amp;oldid=99501154" rel="nofollow">here</a>, then three additional times thereafter within the next hour and a half.</dd>

<dd>I might be inclined to argue that the block is a little long if Link honestly misunderstood the policy, except (1) Link's summary to his first reversion indicates that he understood exactly what he was doing; (2) Link hasn't shown any attempt to understand and comply with this aspect of the 3RR policy in the future; and (3) this would have been a perfect time for Link to take it to the talk page, rather than making four reverts in 68 minutes. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I understand your concern about the <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripping_Friends_02a9.html" title="Ripping Friends">Ripping Friends</a> article. I did not write the sections you tagged with fact templates and I am in the process of veriying these comments. If they cannot be verified they will be removed. My main concern is that you removed the episode descriptions from the article. I have re-added them for now but I must implore that before you make such sweeping deletions that you discuss them in the talk page first. You added the POV tag without pointing to the reason for it and now you've deleted the meat of the article. If you have a valid reason for wating to delete the episode description, I'm all ears. PLEASE consult the talk page on the article before you make such changes. That's all I'm asking. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddius_2203.html" title="User:Thaddius">Thaddius</a> 12:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What in the world are you doing? You are NOT improving the article by deleting entire sections, you are destroying it.

<p>No, see, A Link To The Past, what we do on most anime articles is we ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS put the Japanese name FIRST when we show both names to reduce any confusion whatsoever. Then we put the English name.

<dd>Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(Japan-related_articles states that the format "English (Japanese characters rōmaji)" should be used for any Japanese term put into WP. I understand that the names for characters for PW are different in English as they are in Japanese version, but most of the people using WP are going to be familiar with the English name (whether a translation or a localization) over the Japanese name. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 00:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but that determines how the names are used within the text, not necessarily the order of the names. The reason I use Japanese names first in all of the articles based on localized Japanese products is to provide a consistent, quick method of saying "Oh, this is a Japanese name... and this is English!" <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 01:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or, "this is the name that is familiar to me, since I'm English. Oh, and that's the Japanese name, huh? Neat." That is how it should be.</dd>
<dd>And, it is irrelevant that anime articles do that. For lack of a better term, the editors are "Japanophiles" - even though this encyclopedia is for people who speak English, they give Japanese details preference for animes that exist in an official English form. If I feel like it, I might work towards fixing this problem. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 02:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't be facetious, it doesn't help your cause. Of course there is a perfectly valid reason for the article being at Shunkan Puzzloop and that is the fact that the 'English title' is not Magnetica. The English title is Actionloop. This sort of thing has arisen a few times in the past and going with the Japanese title is usually the best solution.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 21:16, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Because if I moved it to Actionloop that would just cause yet another European-American argument which is what I'm trying to avoid.<br />
For the rest of your comments...Why are you being so facetious anyway? I hate to use the same word twice there but its the only suitable one. I suggest you look at <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 21:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stop the dumb strawman questions. You know perfectly well that is not what I said.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> title is Actionloop however the North American title is Magneta. Both of these are <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> titles thus <b>there is no one English title</b>.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 21:28, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Or use the European title. Its the most accurate to the original Japanese.<br />
Just because you (an American) say the American title is the best doesn't make it so.<br />
The simple solution is what I am trying for here however you are screaming in the face of logic. Wikipedia naming conventions are to use the original title- which in this case is the Japanese version.<br />
I don't think you will be the only linguistic nationalist about here and having it at the Japanese title satisfies the Nihonophiles a great deal (who are likely to be the ones interested in the article) and shouldn't annoy Europeans and Americans too much for using the others title (at least it shouldn't you are being the exception to the rule)--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 21:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For God's sake see some perspective man! I am getting the strongest feeling that you truly are just trolling me here.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>So Magnetica is recognisable to regular English speakers is it? So if I go out onto the street and ask people if they know what Magnetica is they will all instantly say its a DS game? No I don't think so. Its more likely they would guess its some sort of ice cream.</p>
<p>To fans of the game/genre/DS/some other computer game related category however- the people to whom this article is aimed...Well yes the Americans would realise what Magnetica is straight away. However its also likely anyone with any degree of knowledge would know the original name was Shunkan Puzzloop. European fans who stumble on 'Magnetica' however are going to be left totally bemused. They won't have the faintest idea what it is. And vice-versa for Actionloop.</p>
<p>You are apparently immune to logic though so...I know I'll use your quasi-reasoning line. "Generally, article naming should prefer what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature." English wikipedia is not aimed solely at those who speak English as their native language, it is in essence THE wikipedia. The multinational one. There are more people in Europe then the US so maybe we should use the European title? Would you like that?--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 22:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Don't patronise me padawan. You are the one who is verging on trolling here, not I. It seems that you are somewhat ignorant of the way wikipedia works also. Just look around, you will find this place is full of people to whom English is not their native language. Finding wiki pages is difficult but there is a page floating about somewhere that specificly states that due to English's status as the world's second language and the very small no. of articles in many language's wikipedias this is the world wikipedia.</p>
<p>To go off topic for a brief moment here I must reiterate...Stop the stupid strawman questions. To make two points in one and return to the 'world wikipedia' concept we have here: <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">User:Dwaipayanc</a> is Indian, <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedricD_a128.html" title="User:CedricD">User:CedricD</a> is Belgian, <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmc2_9d46.html" title="User:Emc2">User:Emc2</a> is Italian.

<p>What on earth? You truly are trolling here. I have never once mentioned race. And I'll think you'll find that the fact that this is the English language wiki and not the US wiki makes it multinational from the get go let alone all the non-native speakers who are here. IIRC one of the top three highest ranking people on wikipedia right now is Polish actually--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 23:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Race isn't the same thing as nationality. Despite what some groups would will on the world you can get Britons of every possible colour and creed. Likewise for many other nations of the world too.<br />
Proof? I've just shown you proof!<br />
And what on earth are you babbling about articles in different languages? You are really missing the point here. The English wikipedia is based at a international ENGLISH SPEAKING audience. Nationality matters as you are trying to argue that these people do not exist and this wikipedia is solely based at the countries of the world where English is the first and only language which is just wrong.<br />

<dd>Research? With very few exceptions, the contents of LotL are the same as the list on Wikipedia. And how did they come up with that extra 1.5 million copies for TP? Do they have secret sources, or what? You show me how they came up with an extra 1.5 million copies - when it is obvious to most everyone (with the exception of those who put links on Wikipedia for reasons outside of improving it, such as when someone just feels like spamming a web site) that LotL merely took the list from Wikipedia and repeated it without stating where they got the information. This list was created by Wikipedians, not LotL. You can't just get this list anywhere - it was made with a wide variety of different sources. So no matter what, this list was not made by LotL and it was not made by anyone outside of Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:06, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh? How the HELL is this industry news?! It was CREATED by Wikipedians. Are you implying that, by 100% coincidence, the Wikipedians made a list of best-selling game franchises using a variety of different sources, and a completely different web site used those exact same sources? Why should I trust GameSutra, which doesn't even reference where they got their information? You have managed to fail at giving me reason to believe that LotL didn't get this from Wikipedia. This is information created on Wikipedia. It is your burden to prove that the information on this source isn't from Wikipedia, not mine. And the simple fact that it is almost completely the same as the Wikipedia list gives VERY strong reason to not use the link. If you can't even begin to show how the list isn't from Wikipedia, then how can you argue that it be kept on Wikipedia? I've done a great job showing that the list is from Wikipedia, and in response, you do nothing to explain why LotL couldn't have taken the list from Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:57, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Regardless, Land of the Legend's usage at any place at any time in any situation is highly disputed. But when you refuse to allow it to be removed as a source regardless of the fact that you have nothing to verify that the information is usable and I have a very good reason why it's a bad source, you're not exactly looking at a Barnstar for civility. How about actually explaining why Wikipedia cannot handle not having LotL on it, and why this list cannot be the same list as that found on Wikipedia? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Famitsu magazine has just compiled a list of Japanese all time best selling games. Are you gonna acuse them of using Wikipedia as well? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 01:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>...What?</dd>
<dd>Explain how that is an apt analogy. Did I say "it's a list of games with sales mentioned, must be stolen!"? No, I pointed out the fact that "these two lists are exactly the same!". It is hardly an apt comparison. How can you argue that these are different lists? No matter how well-documented sales are, there is no way that two groups could make the exact list using different references. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's assume good faith and say that the Wikipedia list is well references, and thus correct.</dd>
<dd>If it is correct, how can it be any different from another correct list, also using publisher information.</dd>
<dd>I don't understand, please explain, how you can say that two lists can no be the same and correct. It's either the same and correct, or not the same and one is incorrect. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 01:13, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What's there to understand? No list can be 100% complete. The odds of them ending up with a 100% same list by pure coincidence are almost nonexistant. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it was a total list of single game sales, it might be correct. However, we're talking about numbers of series though, big more important things. Nintendo, for one, releases a list of all-time sales of their series every year. And like that, there are more publishers gladly willing to pimp the sales numbers of their top-selling games and games series.</dd>
<dd>If we'd be talking about reports only from small-time press, the assumption could be somewhat justified. However, Gamasutra, Gamesindustry and Forbes do not fit that describtion. Accepting that it might be an annual publisher report is a more elligble assumption then assuming three big outlets copy a list of wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 01:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I was going to post here so we may swap Emails and perhaps come to a reasonable conclusion of this whole Dark Link war that is raging at the moment without cluttering the talk page with our useless struggles. I'd put up the page anyway but I know full well that you'd tear it right back down, and thereby a bigger war would be started. You seem to be a very aggressive, but intelligent person (and I see you get in more than your fair share of verbal brawls), so if you do agree to these terms that drop me an answer on my userpage. If you don't, then, well, I can continue raging this war as long as you'd like. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Zymeth_bbbe.html" title="User:Lord Zymeth">Lord Zymeth</a> 22:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why did you move this to the European name (and then edit that so it can't be moved back)? You provided no source for how it has done in the UK, while I can provide a source for how it has done in North America (at least in the US). The game has done really well in the US, even making the top 10 games of 2006.</p>
<p>Also, since you deleted Cuccos from the Zelda enemies page, you should fix the redirect (since "Cucco" redirects to he Zelda enemies page). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 03:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks alot, that means a lot to me. I am sorry too that things were so heated. I never thought you were wrong in believing that SPM was headed for Wii, and I wish I would have stayed out of the argument once I had stated my point. It was highly unneccisary for me to continually try to argue. Thanks for taking the time to write to me!
