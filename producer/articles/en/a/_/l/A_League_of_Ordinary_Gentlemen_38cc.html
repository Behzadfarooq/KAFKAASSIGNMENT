<p>Though never a sport of Kings, at one point in time bowling occupied a perfectly respectable place in the pantheon of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> sports. This documentary focuses on the American aspect of the sport. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_pin_bowling#Ten-pin_bowling_in_media" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_pin_bowling#Ten-pin_bowling_in_media" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> It has long been one of the most popular participatory sports in America. When <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Elias_3d0e.html" title="Eddie Elias">Eddie Elias</a> convinced the country's top 33 bowlers to kick fifty bucks into a communal pot in a banquet hall in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_New_York_b662.html" title="Syracuse, New York">Syracuse</a>, NY, in 1958, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_Bowlers_Association_02e8.html" title="Professional Bowlers Association">Professional Bowlers Association</a> was born. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> began televising PBA tournaments in 1962, and as the lead in <i><a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_World_of_Sports_%28US_TV_series%29_2f9e.html" title="Wide World of Sports (US TV series)">Wide World of Sports</a></i>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Schenkel_7a65.html" title="Chris Schenkel">Chris Schenkel</a>'s Saturday afternoon bowling telecast was for many years one of the highest rated sports programs on television.</p>
<p>Then something happened: America ceased to embrace the portly, middle-brow image the PBA was selling, and bowling got kicked to the curb. The sport and its players, many of whom grew up idolizing the sepia-toned gods of bowling's golden era, found themselves wallowing in the backwaters of the popular imagination, alongside rodeos and tractor pulls.</p>
<p>In 2000, three former Microsoft executives (Chris Peters, Mike Slade and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Glaser_0bce.html" title="Rob Glaser">Rob Glaser</a>) scooped up the entire apparatus of professional bowling -- its players, tournaments, trademarks and trophies -- all for about five million dollars and assumption of the league's debt. Their stated goal was to save bowling from the brink of extinction and raise it to new heights, or at least put it on par with the Bass Masters tour, which, at current market values, would represent a tidy return on equity.</p>
<p>The heavy lifting for this mission falls onto the broad shoulders of a man named <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Miller_%28athletics%29_c2a5.html" title="Steve Miller (athletics)">Steve Miller</a>, a former top Nike executive who had played for the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a> and rescued <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_State_University_1bb7.html" title="Kansas State University">Kansas State</a> football from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> cellar.</p>
<p>The film focuses on Miller and four of his charges, professional bowlers at very different places in their careers, and their sometimes funny, sometimes sad adventures on tour as professional athletes - albeit the Rodney Dangerfields of professional sports.</p>

<p>Tracing the historical arc of the professional bowling tour, the film includes archival footage from the sport's glory days in the 1950s and '60s, through its near extinction in 1997. The story takes a twist when newly installed CEO <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Miller_%28athletics%29_c2a5.html" title="Steve Miller (athletics)">Steve Miller</a> sets about modernizing the <a href="../../../p/b/a/PBA_b8e6.html" title="PBA">PBA</a>. In addition to Miller, the chronicle focuses on four pro bowlers. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Weber_62bc.html" title="Pete Weber">Pete Weber</a>, bowling bad-boy and son of legendary bowler <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Weber_7dce.html" title="Dick Weber">Dick Weber</a> whose conservative style doesn't jibe with the direction Miller is taking the new PBA. Pete's nemesis is <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Ray_Williams_1e5c.html" title="Walter Ray Williams">Walter Ray Williams</a>, a strait-laced six-time world horseshoe-pitching champion and, with 36 PBA titles to his name, the dominant player on the tour. Also, there's <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Barnes_%28Ten-pin_Bowling%29_df23.html" title="Chris Barnes (Ten-pin Bowling)">Chris Barnes</a>, a young father of newborn twins, who must leave his wife and sons at home and hit the road to compete for the winnings that his young family is depending upon.

<p>Looking back, we're not exactly sure why we first set out to make a documentary about professional bowling. The movie arose out of some combination of a nostalgia for an America none of us really knew, a perverse interest in polyester and mullets, and a very amateur sociological interest in documenting what we viewed as a potentially threatened tribe of nomadic men who roamed the country, briefly alighting on the outskirts of urban areas to bowl for small amounts of money.</p>
<p>Then in the late nineties, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Putnam_dc81.html" title="Robert Putnam">Robert Putnam</a> published [[<i>Bowling Alone</i>]], a book about the decline of community ties in American society, and our local bowling alley was converted into a day spa. In our minds, the proximity of these events suggested a larger story, a story set within the intimate confines bowling alleys, diners and motels, while unfolding against the grand backdrop of social change in America. At least that was the idea before we began shooting.</p>
<p>In 2000, as the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_Bowlers_Association_02e8.html" title="Professional Bowlers Association">Professional Bowlers Association</a> languished near bankruptcy, three ex-Microsoft executives bought the league for five million dollars and set about restoring professional bowling to its former grandeur. Something about the marriage of pro bowling and Microsoft struck us as funny, and it also added a quixotic quest to the story taking shape in our heads.</p>
<p>In January 2001, we traveled to <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>, the headquarters of the new PBA, to see if they might allow us to make a documentary about their new league, not mentioning that our combined filmmaking experience amounted largely to watching a lot of movies and intermittent PA work on laxative ads. The PBA was interested in the project, so in September 2002 we set out to document the decline and potential revival of pro bowling, propelled by naÃ¯ve enthusiasm and a little money we scraped together from friends and family.</p>

<p>Over the course of ten months, we drove nearly 47,000 miles on the tail of the PBA tour as it cris-crossed America. We shot nearly 300 hours of footage, spending time with the players and executives in their homes, cars and RVs, in motels and diners, and, of course, in bowling alleys. We were constantly surprised by conflicts and tensions and ironies that surfaced in the lives of people we would not have known or thought much about had we not embarked on this project.</p>
<p>The film that emerged after months of editing is a story that is both sad and funny. It interweaves the lives of five individuals whose fortunes are tied to those of pro-bowling, a precarious fate if ever there was one, and it offers a glimpse of the grit and authenticity of people stripped of all pretensions.</p>
<p>Although <i>A League of Ordinary Gentlemen</i> is concerned largely with professional bowling, we hope that the struggles of these five men will also strike a chord with anyone who remembers watching the intense stares and tortured silences of a Saturday afternoon bowling broadcast, wonders what became of this pastime, once an integral facet of community life in America, or identifies with these men, struggling to reclaim their place in a changing society.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/l/A_League_of_Ordinary_Gentlemen_38cc.html" title="Edit section: Filmmaker Questions &amp; Answers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Filmmaker Questions &amp; Answers</span></h2>
<p>Emerging filmmakers <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelmus_Bryan_2a25.html" title="Wilhelmus Bryan">Wilhelmus Bryan</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Browne_8eb0.html" title="Alex Browne">Alex Browne</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Browne_6a31.html" title="Chris Browne">Chris Browne</a> talk about their motivation for making a bowling movie, getting hustled on the lanes by professional players and the similarities between cooking and independent film.</p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to make <i>A League of Ordinary Gentlemen</i>?</b></p>
<p>There were several reasons: outrage that our local bowling alley was converted into a day spa, and ungrounded suspicion that this might be connected to the decline of professional bowling in general. It was our first project of this scope. Had we taken on something like terminal disease or the horrors of war and bungled the film, we might have felt quite badly. If a film about bowling gets bungledâ€¦ no one suffers.</p>
<p><b>How did you convince the pro bowlers in the filmâ€”both veterans and newcomersâ€”to open up to you about their lives?</b></p>
<p>The newcomers were part of the whole <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>/reality television generation, so they were pretty into the project from the start. The veterans we bonded with over time, usually bars in and around bowling centers.</p>
<p><b>What is the most interesting or alluring facet of life on the pro bowling circuit?</b></p>
<p>Alluring is an interesting choice of words. It doesnâ€™t come immediately to mind when describing life on Tour. I suppose the camaraderie of the bowling alleys. Obviously, bowling groupies are totally hot, so that wasnâ€™t bad either.</p>
<p><b>Did you improve your bowling game or pick up useful tips from the pros during the making of the film?</b></p>
<p>Bill: Moderately. I learned to throw the ball with a curve, and added a few points to my average, it briefly hovered above 100. Also I learned to never play for money against professionals no matter how many points they give you at the onset.</p>
<p><b>What were some of the challenges you faced in making this film?</b></p>
<p>Keeping sound recordistsâ€”we went through five on the production. Also maintaining a belief in our own sanity despite our friends, families and colleaguesâ€™ intimations to the contrary.</p>
<p><b>What impact do you hope this film will have?</b></p>
<p>That people watching will be entertained. Generally, we think that if oneâ€™s goal is to provoke social change with a film, you donâ€™t choose professional bowling as your subject matter. However, if positive social changes come about as a result of <i>A League of Ordinary Gentlemen</i> screening on <i>Independent Lens</i>, we will be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p><b>What period of time did filming take place and when did it conclude? Any updates on the people and what they have been doing since then?</b></p>
<p>Filming began in September 2002 and ended in March 2003.</p>
<p>Wayne Webb now works in a pro-shop in <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento, California</a>. He has a <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaoke.html" title="Karaoke">Karaoke</a> business on the side.</p>
<p>Steve Miller has retired as CEO of the Professional Bowlers Association. I havenâ€™t spoken to him in a couple of months, and donâ€™t know exactly how he is spending his free time.</p>
<p>Chris Barnes most recently won the 2006 PBA Tournament of Champions and has won the biggest prize check in the history of the PBA winning the Motel 6 Roll to Riches.</p>
<p>Walter Ray Williams, Jr. is also still on the Tour. In September of 2006 he surpassed Earl Anthony on the PBA's All-Time Title list with his win over Pete Weber in the Japan Cup. He currently has 42 PBA Tour Career Titles.</p>
<p>Pete Weber currently tied Mark Roth with 34 career titles on the PBA tour with his win in the 2007 United States Open. He won the title in the same house, in which, two years earlier, he was bowling a pro-am getting ready for the 2005 US Open when he found out his father Dick Weber passed away.</p>
<p><b>The independent film business is a difficult one. What keeps you motivated?</b></p>
<p>The desire to tell interesting stories combined with a fear of having to apply for jobs with a resume consisting mostly of independent film work.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose to present your film on public television?</b></p>
<p>We didnâ€™t make the film with a specific outlet in mind; we were flattered that PBS wanted to air it.</p>
<p><b>What are your three favorite films?</b></p>
<p>Many, among them: <i><a href="../../../c/r/u/Crumb_%28film%29.html" title="Crumb (film)">Crumb</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/m/o/Amores_perros.html" title="Amores perros">Amores perros</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinatown_%28film%29.html" title="Chinatown (film)">Chinatown</a></i>, any one of the <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Porky%27s.html" title="Porky's">Porky's</a></i> movies isnâ€™t bad either.</p>
<p><b>What didn't you get done when you were making your film?</b></p>
<p>While shooting we forgot to pay our cable and utility bills and neglected our personal hygiene, but other than that we have no regrets.</p>
<p><b>What do you think is the most inspirational food for making independent film?</b></p>
<p>Anything you make yourself can be fairly inspirational, in that there are lot of similarities between cooking and filmmaking. When you cook, you take a lot of different ingredients and try to transform them into something plausibly edible. It is not that different from taking a lot of different images, sounds and voices and trying to make a scene. In one, youâ€™re dealing with flavor and texture, in the other, emotion and narrative, other than that, itâ€™s pretty much the same thing. Making non-independent film is another matter entirely, at least from the epicurean perspective.</p>
<p><b>What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers?</b></p>
<p>We still view our careers as somewhat aspirational. It is a bit presumptuous to be offering that kind of advice at this stage. One piece of advice would be to think about your audience. At the end of the day, itâ€™s not about you. Someone else has to be able to enjoy your work.</p>
<p><b>If you could have one motto, what would it be?</b></p>
<p>Get things done and donâ€™t be annoying.</p>
<p><b>What sparks your creativity?</b></p>
<p>Being in a room with the right people and allowing an idea to build organically.</p>

<p>The movie has a current non-exempt PBA member in it. At the time Bill "Poundcake" Crane of Mishawaka, Indiana (Now Noblesville) was seen in the movie as the kid doing the "The Crotch Chop". This scene was toward the end of the movie at the 2003 World Championships.</p>
<p>The movie also has a clear shot during the Wichita tournament of Wichita State University's coaches Gordon Vadakin and Mark Lewis. They were in attendance watching their former pupil Chris Barnes.</p>
