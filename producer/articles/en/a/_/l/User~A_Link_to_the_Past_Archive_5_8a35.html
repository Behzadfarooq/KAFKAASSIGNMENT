<dd>There's a great difference between using meatpuppets to skew AFD and alerting interested Wikipedians.

<dd>Yes, hardly qualifies as spam, in my opinion; most people don't monitor the AfD.But marking things as "against policy" when you only think they <i>should</i> be against policy is not good policy.

<p>I <i>really</i> wish you had mentioned your concerns in the relevant talk pages (or at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Final_Fantasy_0c21.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy WikiProject talk page</a>) before engaging in your little rampage. In one fell swoop, you've forced an issue I and others have been trying to avoid by gradually shifting information not appropriate for Wikipedia to other venues. You're absolutely right about Wikipedia guidelines, but your behavior here was, frankly, trollish. It would have been nice if you'd given those of us who have been working at these articles a chance to address your concerns before going nuclear on us. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 03:43, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The AfD notices <i>should not</i> have been removed. Though I strongly question your methods, you clearly were not acting in bad faith, and the votes, once begun, should be allowed to run their course. You'll also note that I have not called you a "jerk," nor do I believe you to be one. That some people have been less kind is inevitable, though, considering the circumstances, your failure to even attempt a dialog, and the somewhat inexplicable way you've targetted the FF6 character articles while taking an entirely opposite position <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hachi_894d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hachi">elsewhere</a>. As I've said, I think your reasoning is right, but of my frustration is that you've turned what should have been a gradual, negotiated process into a bloodbath that now seems destined to have the exact opposite effect (by creating a backlash). I <i>have</i> been transwiking numerous <i>Final Fantasy</i> articles (albeit to <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikicities.com/" class="external text" title="http://finalfantasy.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">a <i>Final Fantasy</i>-specific wiki</a>], and not Wikibooks). If you'd taken the time to ask any active member of the WikiProject, you could have found this out, and avoided all this bad blood. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 04:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of things: I, personally, cannot say whether or not anyone involved in the project was responsible for the threats made against you, though I certainly hope they were not. I would, however, have hoped that the events of the past few days indicated the importance of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> and not exacerbating the situation by throwing around even more accusations. Also, please note that the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Final_Fantasy_0c21.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Final Fantasy">project talk page</a> is not the place for you to address your (real or imagined) complaints against individual members of the project, and while I again sympathize with the abuse you have received, the word "drivel" does not appear anywhere on our project pages, and your complaint would best be taken up with whomever it was who issued the comment.– <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 08:34, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not "until"? I think you are suffering under a basic misapprehension of what a WikiProject is, and what it is responsible for. Even <i>if</i> the user who threatened you is a sockpuppet, and even <i>if</i> the user wearing the sock is a member of the project, there is <i>nothing</i> the project can do about it. Membership in a project is voluntary, and there's simply no mechanism through which the project can wield any responsibility over its members. We could strike the offending name from the membership list, but that means absolutely nothing: the user can still edit pages we oversee, and can just as easily re-add his or her name to the list.

<p>Hey, what are we going to call this series? Nintendo Wars seems reasonable on its face, but I can't find anywhere where that name is actually used by Nintendo. (I did a Google test, and got only ~750 hits for "Nintendo Wars," whereas "Famicom Wars" gets tens of thousands of hits and "Advance Wars" gets millions.) Famicom Wars seems like a reasonable name for the entire series, as that's the name Nintendo uses In Japan even on some of the newer games (AW:DS = Famicom Wars DS: Something or another in Omega Land), but it's the Japanese name, and general style on Wikipedia is to favor the English-language names for things. Then again, I'm not entirely comfortable calling the pre-GBA games part of the "Advance Wars" series, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? I was thinking of kicking this over to <a href="../../../c/v/g/WP%7ECVG_903f.html" title="WP:CVG">WP:CVG</a>, but I wanted to hear your thoughts first.</p>

<p>I don't think I follow the logic in #1; I don't mean that the problem is that Famicom Wars isn't the name used for AW1&amp;2, but my problem is that it's not the English-language name, and this is the English-language Wikipedia. Right now I can't make a convincing case on CFD to rename the relevant categories, for either name.

<dd>I mean that while they feature another label, Advance Wars would still be Famicom Wars. And sometimes, you have to make compromises, such as using Japanese boxart for Final Fantasy II, III, IV, V and VI. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:03, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Link, a couple of things should be noted here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referring to someone's writing as "drivel" has, in fact, <i>never</i> been a personal attack. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">The Wikipedia guidelines</a> define a personal attack as, in essence, a derogatory comment directed at editors as opposed to content. While it is perfectly understandable that you feel slighted by the comment, it is unlikely to be an actionable offense.</li>
<li>This is, from my perspective as a third party, being blown <i>waayy</i> out of proportion. Yes, Ereinion's comment was inappropriate and uncalled for. However, it was made only once, in an edit page summary, as far as I can tell. I do understand your annoyance, but I don't quite understand what you have to gain by prolonging the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>My honest suggestion would be to let the matter drop. There doesn't seem to be any good reason to drag things out any further, as I doubt you would be effective in getting Ereinion punished for his actions, and it seems equally unlikely that he will apologize for his actions. You have done nothing that would seriously qualify as vandalism, and I will leave a message for Ereinion restating what I have said to you, and advising him to not throw around the threat of vandal reporting lightly. If he continues to harrass you after you have let the matter drop, then you can revisit the matter and something can probably be done about it. I'm sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear, but I'm not sure there's anything else that can be done at this stage: speaking from experience, I really doubt that this level of complaint is going to be taken seriously by many administrators. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with, though. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 02:34, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly, but I don't think it's going to have much of an effect, anyway. Since he was the one who made the comment, he probably won't care if you ask him to stop, and he probably hasn't done anything in clear violation of Wikipedia guidelines, so there's not really anything you can do other than to ask him. Not a fun situation to be in, I know.... – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 02:55, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I closed VfDs (haven't done that in months), I always erred on the side of caution; I admit I did some hastily. IMO it's better to mistakenly keep an article (instead of merging or deleting), as it can always be VfD'd again and deleted later, rather than mistakenly merging it (which can cause problems if the article is recreated) or deleting it (which has obvious problems).

<p>Hi, I notice you have a number of fair use images on your userpage (48 by <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_Reports_FairUsers_d124.html" title="User:Interiot/Reports/FairUsers">this count</a>).

It is ok to link to fair use images (by typing [[:Image:... instead of [[Image: (note the leading colon (:)), but not displaying them inline on userpages (or user subpages). You can display free licensed images, just not the fair use ones.

<p>I disagree entirely. He maybe just a doctor form of Mario, but their stories and there games are completely different. Although there are many similarities, there are still well enough differences to give them different articles. -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 00:49, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You used the worst example possible. They are both referred to as Wario and their stories are almost exactly the same which makes them the same person. While if you refer to the story of <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Mario_64_3a1f.html" title="Dr. Mario 64">Dr. Mario 64</a> it is completely different to what Mario does. And if they were the same character then how come they are different characters in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>? -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 01:06, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, Young Link=Link just like Baby Mario=Mario. Age differences still count as the same character even though they look and act differently (that is why Young Link is in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>). Dr. Mario is not Mario, but a spin-off of Mario. -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 01:51, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually now that I think about it it doesn't need it's own article (since it is only an alternate-personality), but it needs a section in the Mario article. -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 02:03, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does this really need it's own WikiProject? Why not just start a discussion with WP:CVG and have that project define what is gamecruft or not (in addition to WP's policies and guidelines). If you start the discussion and try to move towards a resolution, you'll get one. I guess I don't see how this project can be an 'active one' after whatever the guideline is is decided upon.

If we rated the notability of all memes against AYB, then pretty much none of them would be notable. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=p4&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22Thank+you+Mario%21+But+our+princess+is+in+another+castle%21%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=p4&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22Thank+you+Mario%21+But+our+princess+is+in+another+castle%21%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">A Google search</a> for "Thank You Mario, but Our Princess is in another castle" yields 1,320 hits which, while not overly impressive, is enough for me. The other thing I think you have to ask is whether you could merge that page into <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Bros._8a96.html" title="Super Mario Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a> without losing any info, and I think the answer is no. I think the current page goes into more detail (and perhaps has the potential to expand) then could be reasonably merged into that page. However, I will hear your comments on this before I vote on that page's AfD. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_Esperanza_9829.html" title="User:EWS23/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>E</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">WS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 19:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your response. However, I'm still of the opinion that the subject is notable enough, and should be kept.

<p>Hey Link, I noticed you put in a peer review last September mentioning that you wanted to promote the article in question to FA standard. While it seems that the article has slightly fallen from grace (you have to admit, it reads link a fan guide ATM) I'd like to work with you on improving the article.

<p>Hey, I hope you'll return soon, sorry your RfA wasn't succesful. If you continue the way you have been working you can certainly count on my support next time.
