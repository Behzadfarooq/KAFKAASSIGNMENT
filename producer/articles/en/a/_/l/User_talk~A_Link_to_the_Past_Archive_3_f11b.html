<p>I'm saying I can't see anything in the deletion policy about notability.

</dl>
<p>Well, I don't know whether I can do that for your definition, as far as I am concerned, the articles I voted on meet my definition. I can't see anywhere in the deletion policy where there is a requirement to establish notability. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 21:25, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You won't even attempt to establish notability for the sole reason that it's not policy? I didn't ask you what my standards are; I'm asking why a half a minute on screen in one episode with no backstory or personality to speak of is worthy of being an article. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 21:29, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think that there is any relevance to the concept of notability in the context of deletion, so I don't have much interest in trying to establish it for articles on vfd. Regarding the Spongebob stuff, it is verifiable, factual and neutral, so I see no reason to delete it. You may want to merge some of the articles to prevent a whole lot of stubs. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 21:33, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, notability IS part of the deletion policy. Who will be deleted first - Mario (notable) or Atomic Flounder (not notable)? -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 21:40, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must have missed it - could you point it out to me? As well, I'd be grateful if you could let me know why Mario is notable and Atomic Flounder is not, I disagree.

<dd>Well, considering the fact that the Mario series has sold more games than any other game series in the history of mankind, and that he has a statue in a museum of prolific figures in history. Not enough for you? Ask 50 people who have not played Mario or seen SpongeBob who Mario and the Atomic Flounder are. I guarantee you that none of them would know who the Atomic Flounder is. He's not even recognizable for the SpongeBob community; he's there for 30 seconds, and never appears ever again. I must assume bad faith in the fact that you won't even explain why the Atomic Flounder is notable. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 21:47, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's an interesting personal criteria, but it's not deletion policy. I'd love you to point out where notability comes in the deletion policy. As I mentioned, I don't think notability (or 'recognizability for the SpongeBob community' or 'selling more games than any other game series in the history of mankind') is relevant to deletion. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 21:53, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, here's a problem - you're saying that it doesn't matter that all content that could be added HAS been added, unless you go more indepth on him than you would any other character, on his, say, skin. Notability is disputed to add it to the policy, and don't say that it's some dictator admin's duty to add it, this is a community. Anyway, by the very definition of notability, this is not notable to any given community. If you think notability is not important - go make an article about each and every relative of Plankton. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 22:02, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure I understand you - where in the deletion policy is the section on notability? I'm not sure I understand your comments about dictator admins. As I mentioned, notablitily, even if it were relevant, is inherently subjective. Thanks for the invitation to write articles about Plankton, I wish to decline, but if someone else wanted to, and could write a verifiable, factual and neutral article, I don't think I would vote to delete them. 22:10, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quality is not the only thing that is involved. Notability is, in fact, involved in the article. If notability is not a factor, Colossal Red Koopa Troopa would have an article, but it doesn't. It's not notable enough to be apart from the Koopa Troopa species, as it is just a variant. If notability were not a factor, then logic states that the bandwith would be getting an ass raping. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 22:15, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Notability is a sort of <i>de facto</i> policy—it is constantly being used as a rationale in VfD votes, and by enough people that to a certain extent, it's almost as good as policy. However, that only applies <i>to a certain extent</i>—whenever it has come up for a vote, enough people (like you) have disagreed with applying any sort of general "notability" policy that it has never <i>become</i> policy. Whenever there is a notability question at VfD, there will most likely be people on both sides.

<p>Dai Grepher: I will do nothing of what you suggested on my talk page, except stop editing the article. That is only because it will not remain the way you want it to for long. That is, if Wikipedia policy is upheld by the admins. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDai_Grepher_9ebd.html" title="User:Dai Grepher">Dai Grepher</a> 03:48, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"No one but you has ever called it a prequel, you're just taking evidence and assuming that it proves it's a prequel"</p>
<p>Dai: You assume that the game is a remake with no evidence to support you, so at least I have evidence. I hope that our letter reaches Sakamoto and he replies just so people like you will learn that you cannot abuse power or twist words to dictate what something is or is not. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDai_Grepher_9ebd.html" title="User:Dai Grepher">Dai Grepher</a> 04:12, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dai: Sakamoto is asked what challenges he faced in making Zero Mission. He begins his answer by saying that any time you do a remake, there is the possibility that it will be taken negatively as a mere port, rather than a truely remade game. So for that reason he and his staff were most challenged with adding enough new elements to make the game fresh and new without straying far from what they originally set out to do, which was remake Metroid's gameplay and return to the roots of the Metroid series. He then stated later that it was not a remake of story. Also, I am not the only one to call Zero Mission a <b>prequel</b>.</p>

I think this speaks well enough to whether Monicasdude is trying to sabotage the FAC process.

<dd>You consider to ignore this one simple fact:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>My first real interaction with Monicasdude was in defense of Kiba, when Monicasdude attacked his statement that the FARC was "bull" (which I already said was a pinch inappropriate). I never said I was uncivil, I was saying that you are focusing on me being uncivil, without acknowledging that it was in response to uncivility. Someone expressed an opinion on an FARC and he implied that <a href="../../../k/i/b/User%7EKiba_b708.html" title="User:Kiba">Kiba</a> was an eight year old. Nothing in the Civility policy protects that, and I would go as far as to say that me and Kiba are "buddies", so to say. I'd apologize for any uncivility I have projected, but certainly not before Monicasdude does. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:39, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have said elsewhere why I think this is a substantial mischaracterisation of Monicasdude's remarks, which I believe were nothing more than cheeky. Furthermore, I do not see any just principle established in making apology for incivility conditional on anyone else's behaviour. Either you're apologetic about what you've said or not; making it conditional on someone else's behaviour is (among other things) hardly a demonstration that one is reasserting self-control where it has previously failed. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 22:56, 21 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, you can't take my comments as cheeky, but when he responds to Kiba not giving a descript reason why it's bull with saying "if you're not an eight year old, sure". He didn't give a reason why it was bull, and he responded to that with the comment in question. I continue to fail to see why the eight year old comment shows civility. "He was being cheeky". Oh, and if you would actually pay attention, I HAD apologized for the comments I've made, and he has yet to apologize for calling someone an eight year old, because he doesn't view it as insulting under any means. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:07, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"I'd apologize for any uncivility I have projected, but certainly not before Monicasdude does": "I'd," as in "I would," which implies that you have yet to do so. Are you saying that you did apologise but didn't really mean it (or don't mean it any more), or that you haven't <i>really</i> apologised because you cannot find sincerity in yourself until someone else does? In either case, I think I've been paying enough attention to notice that you haven't really do so. Anything else I might say would be repeating myself, and I am loathe to continue discussion when the evidence is accumulating that you will only attempt apology after you believe yourself justified. Would it be sufficient for purposes of this discussion to note again that those who are deciding this matter have said nothing that justifies the remark that the FARC was "bull," that Monicasdude was being pedantic, or any of the other wild claims you've made? That entire line of argument was juvenile, yet Monicasdude offered you the chance to reject juvenile argument, which is exactly what you didn't do. There was an opening offered between a juvenile argument and being juvenile, and you unfortunately failed to recognise it, as you are now. You can, however, stop whenever you like. I have nothing further to say on this matter, as we are going through the same exercise here. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 23:47, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't think you have understood where the problem is here.

<dd>Well, I guess if apologizing isn't enough to mediate this, then what is? Sacrifice my account maybe? I'm trying to end the argument, and for some reason, that has now indicated that I am refusing to mediate anything. I am <b>NOT</b> trying to justify anything for the sole reason that I have apologized (ie, taken it back). Let me point out those who are trying to keep this argument going on. For instance, it is not me. I have offered my mediation on the form of an apology, and Monicasdude has offered mediation in... well, telling me to stop messaging him and not even implying interest in apologizing for anything he has said. You don't compare someone insisting that an article be rejected quickly without offering an explanation as to why to someone who gives at LEAST one reason why they object. You just don't. FAD is definitely less harmful to the FAC process than one who offers no advice on how to improve an article. In the FARC, he seemed to want to get rid of it, and showed no interest in having any flaws he saw fixed. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:12, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I realise now that you aren't familiar with the wikipedia mediation process. I'm sorry for leaving that unclear. The idea is that we have a third party experienced in these matters who privately listens to all of us giving our account and then gives us feedback on how to make right of this. Please have a look at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a>. The folks at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a> might very well tell us that we need to put the matter out for RfC, which is essentially soliciting feedback from the community. We can also ask for a third opinion, which is again asking an uninvolved party to comment, but without all the consultation implied by full-blown mediation. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 22:24, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What more mediation is necessary (other than perhaps Monicasdude apologizing, but if he ceases to talk to me, the matter would not be under dispute and would not NEED mediation)? Is it really that big of a deal that I continue to think that the comments he has made on various FA-related votes aren't appropriate? An RfC isn't necessary for the sole reason that there has been a successful mediation; the only one not apologizing for their comments in the argument is Monicasdude, of whom I wouldn't even say earned an RfC yet, because any of my speculation is just that. Doesn't the RfC require that the person under the RfC be continuing the actions that brought up the RfC in the first place? It is very clear that I have no interest in continuing an argument and have gave no indication that I was interested in continuing a fight or harassing anyone. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:37, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

But, here's the deal. I do want you to rewrite the summary. I will allow that. The thing is, the page must be able to keep the opening crawl and everything else the way it is. Much work went into the rest of the article by many of us, and we don't want it deleted. I'm willing to compromise this time. If you will just revert the page, and change only the plot summary, that is by shortening it, it'll be OK with me. I don't think either of us have been exactly civil in our discussions, and a decision has to be made on the article that suits both of us.

<p>I think you fail to realize that this situation is in my favor. It isn't YOUR article, it isn't ANYBODY'S article. The opening crawl will create problems if it ever went onto <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>. It will not make it because of the Cast listing, and it won't make it because of the opening crawl and the plot summary. Unlike you, I'm looking into the future for the article.</p>
<p>Basically, I might consider asking Rdsmith4 to give lenience for blatant vandalism of a user page, but I wouldn't consider it if you continue to revert the article. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:11, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, I won't revert. But, what is wrong with the cast listing? I understand the opening crawl, but the cast listing is a complete list that Copperchair, I, and others have went through many, many, edit wars over, and we are finally happy with it. If you will rewrite the plot summary, that would be great. Don't completely remove it though, write one similar to the ones for the prequels. And, thanks for asking Rdsmith4 for lifitng the block so I can go back to my old identity. Another thing, I don't blatantly vandalize anymore. At one time, I was an extreme vandal of the Bush page, but have since quit, because I was threatened with a year long block. What I have done to the star wars articles isn't vandalism, i don't think, because I'm not trying, nor would I ever try to deface or disrupt them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheAlternateReality_cbb6.html" title="User:TheAlternateReality">TheAlternateReality</a> 20:17, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Since you're involved in that thing at the Empire Strikes Back article, tell me, what do you think of the plot summary at <a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</a>?

<p>It IS considered vandalism. You are continuing to ignore the simple fact that a template should be as small as possible, and absolutely refuse to make it smaller. If you can't give me a SINGLE reason why this is the one and only template that should be huge, then you should stop editing it. Would it be hard for you to strive to keep these articles at a certain level of quality, opposed to putting in what you want and only what you want? From your edits on talk pages, you show clearly that you have an agenda to warp Wikipedia into your own little play-thing. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:11, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have already many times told you why I want the template the way I make it. No, reverting the page is not vandalism, no more than what you are doing. You refuse to see what I mean, as much as you say I have. We just have two very different POV's and two groups of supporters for our ideas. Do I want to warp Wikipedia? No, just set it straight.

<dd>I don't completely get this idea that every single template has to be the same way. Each situation is special. Star Wars is made up of much material. A large template makes room for this. If the template needs to be large to fit these things, it should be large. My goal here isn't to make the articles look like all the others. Each are individual articles. That's my POV. That's how I want it. Having a POV and showing it on a page does not mean vandalism. Adamwankenobi 20:26, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In reply to comments on my talk page</i></p>
<p>Well, it's not really a retcon because the manga and the games are separate works, despite clear inspiration both ways and being part of the same license. (Note that they aren't, however, part of the same <i>continuity</i>.)</p>
<p>To my knowledge, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures_c9e9.html" title="Pokémon Adventures">Pokémon Adventures</a> is ongoing and is currently on the Emerald Saga, and I believe the English localization is still referring to the female with the Squirtle as Blue. I could be wrong on that second point, though.</p>
<p>In any case, the protagonists of the games are more or less nameless; the default names vary between otherwise nearly-identical versions of the same game, and often one or another adaptation of a character will use a different name. (The protagonist of G/S was adapted for PokeAdv and named Gold, but in Pokémon Chronicles he's named Jimmy.)</p>
<p>The games aren't canon for the anime or manga, the anime isn't canon for the manga or games, and the manga isn't canon for the games, anime, or even unconnected manga series. They're all separate continuities in the same franchise.</p>
<p>Also, do note that I moved your rewrite of <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%28Pok%C3%A9mon_character%29_dd2a.html" title="Blue (Pokémon character)">Blue (Pokémon character)</a> over to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_%28Pok%C3%A9mon_character%29_281f.html" title="Green (Pokémon character)">Green (Pokémon character)</a>, as part of getting off my butt and getting the articles under the right titles.

<p><i>In further reply</i></p>
<p>It's not a mistake; it was a conscious decision on the part of the translators. Since it has been upheld through multiple sagas in the only (to my knowledge) official English translation and this <i>is</i> the English-language Wikipedia and all, I think it leads to a lot fewer headaches to have the characters under their English-language names with a note as to the original Japanese names. Contrast this with the FF situation, where later releases use the Japanese numbering to allow for later release of the games not originally released in the US. Here, you only have one name conflict when it comes to using the English-localized names, whereas persisting with the American numbering of FF games would have led to a great deal of confusion.</p>
<p>Bear also in mind that half of the articles are already written with the English-localized names in mind, including the original versions of the Blue and Green articles.</p>
<p>Just FYI, you can reply here. I've got your talk page on my watchlist as long as this conversation carries on.

<dd>For another note, the articles are about Green and Blue, but not exclusively about the manga. FR/LG is also a retcon of sorts, of RBY and GSC, so the fact that he was only Green in FR/LG is irrelevant, since they have not remade GSC. I assume the manga kept with calling her Green, since the plot is much more fragile than in the games. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 07:36, September 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I don't assign names to the protagonists and rivals in R/B/Y/G/S/C/R/S/E/FR/LG when I can avoid it. I've stuck with the euphemistic "Protagonist of (such and such game)" because the default names vary so much. It's not a big deal, because none of the protagonists have any sort of personality, and the antagonists don't need but a few sentences description (which they have in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters_c18c.html" title="List of Pokémon characters">List of Pokémon characters</a>). The only time I've pinned a name to a protagonist is with Red and Blue in their appearances in G/S/C. I've pinned a name to May in the current version of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters_c18c.html" title="List of Pokémon characters">List of Pokémon characters</a>, but I was actually about to rewrite that section next time I got a chance to sit down and work on it. (Probably tomorrow.)</dd>
<dd>FR/LG isn't really a retcon because those characters are more or less ciphers for you to assign your own names to. (Note that in Blue and LG, the hero is Blue/Green by default, and the rival is Red by default, but none of the other games or anime or manga respect this. Why favor Red and FR? Because the naming is more or less arbitrary.)</dd>
<dd>I guess we disagree on a key point about FR/LG; there's no third character. There's the protagonist, who may be male (and looks like manga-Red) or female (and look like manga...whatever you want to call her), and the antagonist, and that's it. FR/LG is influenced by the manga as far as character appearances go, but other than that the two are completely divorced. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 20:42, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>When G/S came out, it was established that Red is the main game in the original series. So Fire Red/Leaf Green, as a remake, would remake this concept.</dd>
<dd>I always felt that Red and Green were made based on the manga. I mean, couldn't you consider that perhaps they didn't change the manga because it's heavily plot-based? The change of FFIII back to FFVI didn't create plot mistakes, changing Blue back to Green in the games didn't damage the plot, because it doesn't have the greatest plot, and changing Toadstool back to Peach didn't, because, like the Pokemon games, the plots aren't as important as the games themselves. I think that, combined with the fact that they have retconned it in the games, we should consider combining the accurate name in Japanese translations with that fact. Also, just curious, have the mangas been released in Canada or Europe? If so, does it use Green or Blue for Green? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:38, September 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The games predate <i><a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures_c9e9.html" title="Pokémon Adventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></i>, both in Japan and in North America. There are only two licensed English translations, one by Viz(?) and one by Chang Yi. Both of them use the North American names (Blue is the rival, Green is the girl.)</dd>
<dd>My point is that the characters in the games and the characters in the manga are distinct, separate sets of characters. You have the R/FR protagonist and antagonist, and then you have Red, Blue, and Green. Arguable retcons to one don't have anything to do with the other.</dd>
<dd>Remember, Pokémon is <i>not</i> one continuity. The protagonist of the games, Red from PokeAdv, and Ash Ketchum are all different characters who do different things and have different stories. Likewise, the rival is not Gary is not PokeAdv Blue/Green.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_19bd.html" title="Red (Pokémon)">Red (Pokémon)</a> needs (and has) a mention of the recurrence of the R/B protagonist as an optional boss battle in G/S/C, and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_ca7b.html" title="Blue (Pokémon)">Blue (Pokémon)</a> (after <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%28Pok%C3%A9mon_character%29_dd2a.html" title="Blue (Pokémon character)">Blue (Pokémon character)</a> is merged into it) needs a mention of the recurrence of the R/B rival as a Gym Leader. Likewise, we should mention that Red in PokeAdv is inspired by the protagonist in R/B, and that Blue in PokeAdv is named Green in Japan and is based on the rival in R/B.</dd>
<dd>Other than inspiration, the games don't retcon the manga, and the manga doesn't retcon the games. <i>They're separate continuties.</i> If at all possible, we should avoid borderline-fanon retcons entirely, and using euphemistic "the protagonist"/"the rival" avoids this neatly. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 23:06, 5 September 2005 (UTC)
