<dd>There's a great difference between using meatpuppets to skew AFD and alerting interested Wikipedians.

<dd>Yes, hardly qualifies as spam, in my opinion; most people don't monitor the AfD.But marking things as "against policy" when you only think they <i>should</i> be against policy is not good policy. Blanking comments from talk pages,however, is against guidelines.

<p>I <i>really</i> wish you had mentioned your concerns in the relevant talk pages (or at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Final_Fantasy_0c21.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy WikiProject talk page</a>) before engaging in your little rampage. In one fell swoop, you've forced an issue I and others have been trying to avoid by gradually shifting information not appropriate for Wikipedia to other venues. You're absolutely right about Wikipedia guidelines, but your behavior here was, frankly, trollish. It would have been nice if you'd given those of us who have been working at these articles a chance to address your concerns before going nuclear on us. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 03:43, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The AfD notices <i>should not</i> have been removed. Though I strongly question your methods, you clearly were not acting in bad faith, and the votes, once begun, should be allowed to run their course. You'll also note that I have not called you a "jerk," nor do I believe you to be one. That some people have been less kind is inevitable, though, considering the circumstances, your failure to even attempt a dialog, and the somewhat inexplicable way you've targetted the FF6 character articles while taking an entirely opposite position <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hachi_894d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hachi">elsewhere</a>. As I've said, I think your reasoning is right, but of my frustration is that you've turned what should have been a gradual, negotiated process into a bloodbath that now seems destined to have the exact opposite effect (by creating a backlash). I <i>have</i> been transwiking numerous <i>Final Fantasy</i> articles (albeit to <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikicities.com/" class="external text" title="http://finalfantasy.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">a <i>Final Fantasy</i>-specific wiki</a>], and not Wikibooks). If you'd taken the time to ask any active member of the WikiProject, you could have found this out, and avoided all this bad blood. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 04:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of things: I, personally, cannot say whether or not anyone involved in the project was responsible for the threats made against you, though I certainly hope they were not.

<dd>Not "until"? I think you are suffering under a basic misapprehension of what a WikiProject is, and what it is responsible for. Even <i>if</i> the user who threatened you is a sockpuppet, and even <i>if</i> the user wearing the sock is a member of the project, there is <i>nothing</i> the project can do about it. Membership in a project is voluntary, and there's simply no mechanism through which the project can wield any responsibility over its members. We could strike the offending name from the membership list, but that means absolutely nothing: the user can still edit pages we oversee, and can just as easily re-add his or her name to the list. This needs to be taken up with an administrator, who would actually have the power to take punitive action. I'm willing to help (in whatever way I can) you resolve this issue, but please be careful in accusing potentially innocent users of wrongdoing. It is a violation of Wikipedia guidelines, and is likely to be seen as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">trolling</a> (of which I am most emphatically <i>not</i> accusing you). – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 08:53, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, what are we going to call this series? Nintendo Wars seems reasonable on its face, but I can't find anywhere where that name is actually used by Nintendo. (I did a Google test, and got only ~750 hits for "Nintendo Wars," whereas "Famicom Wars" gets tens of thousands of hits and "Advance Wars" gets millions.) Famicom Wars seems like a reasonable name for the entire series, as that's the name Nintendo uses In Japan even on some of the newer games (AW:DS = Famicom Wars DS: Something or another in Omega Land), but it's the Japanese name, and general style on Wikipedia is to favor the English-language names for things. Then again, I'm not entirely comfortable calling the pre-GBA games part of the "Advance Wars" series, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? I was thinking of kicking this over to <a href="../../../c/v/g/WP%7ECVG_903f.html" title="WP:CVG">WP:CVG</a>, but I wanted to hear your thoughts first.</p>

<p>I don't think I follow the logic in #1; I don't mean that the problem is that Famicom Wars isn't the name used for AW1&amp;2, but my problem is that it's not the English-language name, and this is the English-language Wikipedia. Right now I can't make a convincing case on CFD to rename the relevant categories, for either name.

<dd>I mean that while they feature another label, Advance Wars would still be Famicom Wars.

<p>Link, a couple of things should be noted here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referring to someone's writing as "drivel" has, in fact, <i>never</i> been a personal attack. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">The Wikipedia guidelines</a> define a personal attack as, in essence, a derogatory comment directed at editors as opposed to content. While it is perfectly understandable that you feel slighted by the comment, it is unlikely to be an actionable offense.</li>
<li>This is, from my perspective as a third party, being blown <i>waayy</i> out of proportion. Yes, Ereinion's comment was inappropriate and uncalled for. However, it was made only once, in an edit page summary, as far as I can tell. I do understand your annoyance, but I don't quite understand what you have to gain by prolonging the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>My honest suggestion would be to let the matter drop. There doesn't seem to be any good reason to drag things out any further, as I doubt you would be effective in getting Ereinion punished for his actions, and it seems equally unlikely that he will apologize for his actions. You have done nothing that would seriously qualify as vandalism, and I will leave a message for Ereinion restating what I have said to you, and advising him to not throw around the threat of vandal reporting lightly. If he continues to harrass you after you have let the matter drop, then you can revisit the matter and something can probably be done about it. I'm sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear, but I'm not sure there's anything else that can be done at this stage: speaking from experience, I really doubt that this level of complaint is going to be taken seriously by many administrators. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with, though. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 02:34, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Possibly, but I don't think it's going to have much of an effect, anyway. Since he was the one who made the comment, he probably won't care if you ask him to stop, and he probably hasn't done anything in clear violation of Wikipedia guidelines, so there's not really anything you can do other than to ask him.

<p>When I closed VfDs (haven't done that in months), I always erred on the side of caution; I admit I did some hastily.

<p>I disagree entirely. He maybe just a doctor form of Mario, but their stories and there games are completely different. Although there are many similarities, there are still well enough differences to give them different articles. -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 00:49, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You used the worst example possible. They are both referred to as Wario and their stories are almost exactly the same which makes them the same person. While if you refer to the story of <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Mario_64_3a1f.html" title="Dr. Mario 64">Dr. Mario 64</a> it is completely different to what Mario does. And if they were the same character then how come they are different characters in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>? -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 01:06, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, Young Link=Link just like Baby Mario=Mario. Age differences still count as the same character even though they look and act differently (that is why Young Link is in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>). Dr. Mario is not Mario, but a spin-off of Mario. -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 01:51, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually now that I think about it it doesn't need it's own article (since it is only an alternate-personality), but it needs a section in the Mario article. -<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendonien_655c.html" title="User:Nintendonien">Nintendonien</a> 02:03, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does this really need it's own WikiProject? Why not just start a discussion with WP:CVG and have that project define what is gamecruft or not (in addition to WP's policies and guidelines). If you start the discussion and try to move towards a resolution, you'll get one. I guess I don't see how this project can be an 'active one' after whatever the guideline is is decided upon. I guess I would need to know a little more of what you have in mind. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 19:51, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like a good idea to make a seperat ewikiproject, or perhaps just revive the cgv article imrpvoement drive nad make this as a primary mission. .

<p>Hi, thanks for your message. If we rated the notability of all memes against AYB, then pretty much none of them would be notable. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=p4&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22Thank+you+Mario%21+But+our+princess+is+in+another+castle%21%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=p4&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22Thank+you+Mario%21+But+our+princess+is+in+another+castle%21%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">A Google search</a> for "Thank You Mario, but Our Princess is in another castle" yields 1,320 hits which, while not overly impressive, is enough for me. The other thing I think you have to ask is whether you could merge that page into <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Bros._8a96.html" title="Super Mario Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a> without losing any info, and I think the answer is no. I think the current page goes into more detail (and perhaps has the potential to expand) then could be reasonably merged into that page.

<p>I am refactoring my user talk page to archive it, and was reviewing some old comments I made while still new to this environment, finding some offensive ones against you (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nintendogs&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=28103578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nintendogs&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=28103578" rel="nofollow">this</a> one). After some time, and finding myself in a similar position that you held back then (most experienced and learned in policies and guidelines trying to get a newbie understand them), I can't help but wonder how is that some don't seem to understand. And reading back our conversation made me realize sometimes newbies put just too much strength when it is not needed, leading to unnecessary discussions. For this, and many other problems I may have brought to you in the past, I want to heartily say I am sorry. I can't promise you we won't have more quarrels, but be sure they will be held in a civilized way. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 21:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see how it's a sub game. I very much consider it a game of its own. How is FS: Adventures not a subgame then? What about the other gameboy games? The Oracles, Link's Awakening, Minish Cap? Aren't those sub games too, then? What is your defenition of a sub game. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Chris</a> 13:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have a valid point; however, in this eof table <a href="../../../z/e/l/Template%7EZelda_series_c03f.html" title="Template:Zelda series">Template:Zelda series</a>, LttP is properly labeled as a remake, but Four Swords is clearly new content. How do we resolve that issuse? Any btw, what is Hyrule Battle? --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Chris</a> 15:28, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Are you refering to the Four Swords dungeon in the LttP port? That is new content that is not in anyway shape or form a new game, but I think the additional "Four Swords" part of the port is worthy of game status if you are going to compare it to additional LttP content. It has a story line, it has bosses, it has dungeons, it has weapons, items, keys, heart pieces, and rewards for completion. How is that not a Zelda game? Because it's multiplayer? I'm not trying to force the Zelda community on wiki to make a seperate article on Four Swords, but I think it is only fitting to split the current article into two parts for the time being, and then consider two different articles in the future. I don't believe that we are doing the game justice by keeping it pinned down in a less important article on a game port. By the very nature of ports, there is little to be said about them in a new article because they are already covered on the original, the SNES one in this case. Four Swords is not a port and is worthy of recognition. This is my belief. If necessary, I may have to enlist outside help to settle this dispute, but first, let me hear your thoughts. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 14:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have only played Kirby Super Star briefly, and not enough to make an opinion on its status. If Four Swords were paired up with another original game much like how those Kirby games seem to be, then I would consider leaving the two in one article. The simple fact that LttP is a remake while Four Swords is most definately not, and can stand on its own without LttP makes it worthy of having its own article; <b>however</b>, to prevent further disagreements, I will let the article stay as one. I will continue to look into the matter and try to establish Four Swords' status as a game or subgame. I also ask that you take pride in such great games and look to better the <a href="../../../f/o/u/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Four_Swords_7946.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords">LttP/FS</a> article, with my help if needed. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 21:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought I wasn't arguing anymore&#160;:( Please answer these questions while I answer them myself: What exactly is it a remake of? Nothing. It is all original content (excluding obvious recycled zelda themes). It is a new game. What is it a multiplayer mode of? Nothing. There was no game like it: the Minish Cap was made well after FS was. It is a new multiplayer game, and the first of it's kind (in the zelda series). If anything, tMC is a single player remake of Four Swords, but I never played tMC, so lets not go there. There is obviously nothing that can change your opinion, so that's why I would like to try to stop arguing this. Let me do us both a favor and provide our lasts words, because we both want to get them in: I think four Swords is an original, independent game worthy of its own article. You think it is a multiplayer mode designed to be part of a remake that should be in the same article as its remake. Am I right?--<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a>
<dl>
<dd>Then why is Four Swords Adventures considered a game if Four Swords is not? Aren't they both new multiplayer modes in the Zelda universe? And you mention this game Phoenix Wright. How is the new content accessed? Is it accessed through normal gameplay of the original game or do you have to specifically select it, like how Four Swords is paired with LttP in a menu and you have a choice of selecting either <i>game</i>. I think this is going to just keep going in circles, don't you?--<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 14:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But FS is not <i>in</i> a game. It's <i>packaged</i> with one. Maybe our definitions of game are different. Do you consider a game to be the physical hardware, a single GBA cart in this case, or do you consider a game the software within like I am, two games, one cart. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 15:37, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're right. They do call it a <i>new multiplayer adventure</i> because it is just that, just like the Minish Cap was a new single player adventure, as well as Wind Waker, and the soon to be released, Twilight Princess. All the Zelda games were new adventures, whether multiplayer or singleplayer, except those remade and brought to the GBA and NGC.--<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 17:48, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The whole point I've been trying to make is that it is <i>not</i> part of LttP. It is only packaged with it. It might share the sword techniques, but it does not share LttP graphics, gameplay, storyline, or content enough to be considered part of it. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 20:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>These colons are getting too long.... anyway, you aren't explaining yourself. I agree that LttP is the game, but I do not agree that FS is a multiplayer adventure mode of LttP, as you seem to do. You still haven't told me how it is a multiplayer version of LttP. To me, a multiplayer LttP would feature a bunch of Link's playing on the same LttP map. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussoc4_d041.html" title="User:Russoc4">Russoc4</a> 14:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! I noticed you made a change to the article about the BS Satellavision game that goes under the Japanese name of Kodai no Sekiban; someone has gone to a large extent throughout the article to ensure that the name "Stone Tablets of Antiquity" is present throughout the article. Given that the title never saw US shores, is "Stone Tablets of Antiquity" really the official name, or is it just original research someone created? I always thought the direct translation was "Ancient Stone Tablets"... <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 12:28, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know that an "official" US translation isn't out there, but I thought that the direct translation of the phrase "Kodai no Sekiban" was "Ancient Stone Tablets", which would explain why people call it that. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 21:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why put something in there such as "It is expected..." if you're then not going to attempt to verify it? That only hurts the quality of the article for an entirely unnecessary reason. Right now the article's basically saying "It's expected that it will be released in 2006 even though it's not expected to be released in 2006".</p>
<p>Also, why put "It is expected..." in front of something that actually <i>is</i> verifiable (the updates to the game: "<i>As with the conversion of IV, the games will be updated for the conversion</i>"<a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/656/656170p1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/656/656170p1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)?

<dd>I've done a little digging and gotten several sources for the updates that the game will get (so that one "It is expected..." can be dropped), but the game <i>is</i> still slated for a 2006 release. There's nothing wrong with that wording simply because it wasn't on a small list of upcoming releases that Nintendo gave out months ago at E3 (if those were all the games they intended to release for the rest of the year, I imagine gamers the world over would have been <i>extremely</i> surprised). <i>Final Fantasy V Advance</i> wasn't on that list either, but just a few days ago, it was confirmed for release in November. Given that the port for <i>VI</i> was announced at the same time as the one for <i>V</i>, it stands to reason that we'll be hearing about the release date for it any day now, and I <i>seriously</i> doubt that they would let the holiday season pass without getting that title out in time.</dd>

<p>Oh, I thought you were referring to the E3 list. In any event, the new press release didn't indicate that this would be all we'd be likely to see in the upcoming months. It, in fact, guarantees the opposite, and only mentions two December titles for that matter (both conveniently coming out early in the month on the 4<sup>th</sup>). I imagine they're a little more ambitious with regard to the holiday season than that. They don't even have a release date for the new <i>Zelda</i> game yet, but — like <i>VI Advance</i> — at last word it was going to be coming out this year... and that last word was <i>in</i> the press release of a few days ago!</p>
<p>They've not offered any indication that these titles won't be getting released this year simply because they've not yet told us their release dates. They provided us a sample of what's coming and are holding out on specific dates while still making promises, probably to keep people hyped. It's likely that the new <i>Zelda</i> will be getting its release at some point past December 4<sup>th</sup> given that they're still telling us it's coming, and the same — as far as we know — is true of <i>VI Advance</i>.</p>
<p>We're not a news site. We're not supposed to interpret information before passing it on to the readers. We just give them the raw data and let them make of it what they will. Until the year has ended without the game coming out, or Nintendo or Square Enix comes out and says "It's possible that <i>Final Fantasy VI Advance</i> will not be released before the end of 2006", as far as Wikipedia knows, it's going to be released in 2006. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. We don't make predictions. We just mention what has been stated and what is verifiable. The list of release dates doesn't take into account <i>Final Fantasy VI Advance</i> <b>or</b> the new <i>Zelda</i> game, despite last word for both of these titles (last word for <i>Zelda</i> even being at the time of the recent press release) being that they're coming out this year.</p>
<p>We can't say "Nintendo has not slated <i>Final Fantasy VI Advance</i> for release in 2006" without saying the same of the <i>Zelda</i> game, despite them telling us that both games are coming this year. We can't say that either game isn't scheduled for release in 2006 without inserting our own speculation and points of view. We can't be the source of speculation, Link. We're to provide verifiable facts (as best we know them to be facts) presented in a neutral manner, and that's about it. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 23:28, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Nintendo press release (which is still promising the new <i>Zelda</i> by the end of this year) came out two days after Comic-Can was over, though, so like I said, at last word, it's coming out this year. While I'm not saying you're wrong about <i>VI Advance</i> possibly not coming this year (the lack of boxart could potentially be quite telling and I've personally been wondering for months now where the hell the release date was), I'm just pointing out that it's not our concern in the capacity of editors. We can't speculate or provide the suggestion for speculation. We're only supposed to provide what we've been told. In other words, we're supposed to act gullible.</dd>

It must also be quite recent since it has that October 12 release date on <i>V Advance</i>. More than likely, you're correct about why it wasn't on that list from the other day: apparently that was just for North America. Again, good find. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 12:03, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's okay because the AfD is not supposed to dictate whether an article is kept or redirected. The debate to keep or redirect an article is one that can be held outside of AfD. An AfD only decides whether an article is deleted or not deleted. That's something that's been established as a precedent for a long time, much longer than the short time I've been on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the consensus (outside of AfD) is for the article to be kept, rather than redirected, I suggest that you go through normal <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> processes to deal with the editor.

<p>Hey, it's tj from AWN, and I'd just like to give you a friendly piece of advice: Try to calm down. I don't know what exactly it is you're disputing over right now, but it would probably be best if you could take it a little bit less seriously. For your own health, and everyone's stress levels. Also, remember that most editors do have the best interests of Wikipedia at heart, albeit by their own interpetation of what that means. (I realize this probably seems totally abrupt and random, but I have a lot of admin talk pages on my watchlist for some reason, and noticed you there.) --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 09:38, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow, kind of forgot all about that mishap. Yeah, I admit I nominated the article in bad faith; it was a mixture of heat-of-the-moment aggitation over the FFVI character articles and a near-complete lack of knowledge of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, as I had only been a user for a few months (which is obvious, because I didn't truly understand your reasoning behind the deletion of the character articles anyway). And I apologize to you personally for having done so, since it appears you've been looking after it for nearly two years now. I'm sorry. But I'm glad you brought it up, even if it did occur ten months ago. Anyway, take care. ~ Hibana 03:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Frankly, I wouldn't care what we called them personally if the information hadn't already existed in the article. (e.g. a simple addition of information) However, if you read the rules on regional differences between english, it says that it is it is "inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change.", and I would assume the same applied to region-based information. In other words, while neither piece of information is of greater value or canonicity, his replacement of the existing information for purely regional reasons was against policy.

<p>My decision was made based on my reading of the <i>reasoned arguments</i> (which are not necessarily mere votes—comments which do not provide a <i>reason</i> for wanting the page moved or not moved are generally not helpful) presented by both sides of the debate. I couldn't care less about either of the topics in question; but, given the evidence that these are multiple topics of similarly common usage, leaving the disambiguation at the main term is the standard approach. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:58, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You moved the article "List of Animal Crossing characters" back to "Characters in the Animal Crossing series".

<p>About a year ago, you expressed interest in elevating this underdog to FA status, and few things would pleased me more. I've reviewed the peer review and tried to include a substantial reviews and legacy section, although upon re-reading it, I felt like I was defending a thesis than writing an objective observation on the game's notability. Could you perhaps assist in cleaning it up a bit? Also, I was thinking of including a "business" section where I could include some sales figures and maybe some other information relating to the business end of the game, but I can't seem to find the information that I need, and Google is out to get me in any case. Do you know of anywhere that I could look? Also, does the article need more pictures? If so, I can easily take some more screenshots of parts that might be relevant to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>“Again, stop acting rude. "Stop bugging me" and "shut up" are not things a Wikipedian should be telling another Wikipedian.” – I found this message (written by you) in my talk page history.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that’s a reason why Wikipedians are so lame. A Wikipedian should respect the wishes of another and not continue to annoy me after I asked them not to! Is that too much to ask for? And besides, I’m no longer a Wikipedian. I don’t need people like you giving me orders and telling me what I can or cannot say, especially if your just going to keep telling me crap like “Find a worthy article to defend” (I don’t need to defend anything on this site), “…don’t whine” (Those who keep wasting my time are the ones who whine), and “Stop acting uncivil” (according to your talk page, you’re acting uncivil yourself).</p>
<p>I said all that stuff earlier because you continued to annoy me about a redirect that I don’t really care about anymore. I was annoyed with the <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zinger.html" title="Zinger">Zinger</a> redirect because you said it wasn’t worthy, despite the fact it had a “Start-Class” rating on WikiProject Computer and video games’ assessment scale, and because I invested a lot of time and effort to get that page to where it was and you had to go and delete it. You’d have been better off if you justed backed off. You will not be told again, do not talk to me anymore by any means (you can keep your comments to yourself for now on. Besides I’m not going to read them). Just mind your own business and don’t waste anymore of my time.

<p>Well dude, all the numbers on there (or the majority) are from VG Charts. Since they are up there anyways why not have them cited to that webpage. It's a hell of a lot better looking than it saying "citation needed". I'm not adding those numbers, just where those numbers came from, because it looks nicer. So I don't know why you deleted the citations. I'll just add the CITATIONS over and over again. Understand?</p>

<dd>NPD numbers are partial estimates. They get information from many retailers. VGCharts is not a reputable source at all - it's run by a Gaming Age Forums member who is the opposite of a professional. There is no comparison between ioi and NPD - the only reason NPD is brought up is because they have to estimate Wal Mart sales and smaller stores' sales. But ioi's estimates com from shipment data - he has argued that how many copies of a game have been shipped gives a good idea of how many have been sold. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:21, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please keep in mind:</p>
<p>Video game sales statistics change on a daily basis. Video game sales statistics are difficult to come by. Video game sales statistics are much lower than the number of copies of games in circulation due to copyright infringement. Although this list strives to be sales world-wide, some data is currently based solely on US or North American sales. Because of these reasons, please:</p>
<p>Think of sales numbers as the minimum amount of units sold, not the precise amount. Help adjust these statistics as new information becomes available, and quote your sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd>VGCharts is estimates. By definition, the numbers of VGCharts have little in common with what the game has actually sold. He does not factor in any number tracking service, including NPD, Chart-Track or Media Create. He creates these numbers by his own self, and by the fact that he does not use the official game sales tracking service of the United States/Canada, he is not to be sourced, ever, on this list. The simple fact is that estimates of sales is very different from sales. We strive to use the best source possible, and a forum-goer with a questionable method of tracking sales figures does not qualify. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 04:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
