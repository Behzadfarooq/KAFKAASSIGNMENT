<p>Hey, you should post the Wario article to the CVG:Peer review. We've been sort of afraid that there wasn't enough animo for this project to be successful, so please don't feel inhibited when you nominate articles. We might have been complaining about people voting for the GCOTW and then not contributing to the article, but that's a different story&#160;;) In any case, in the short time you've been with us you've proven to be a very reliable contributor. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane">Jacoplane</a> 00:12, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you've been adding games to the Nintedo games category, which is something that's been needed for a while, but please be aware that Donkey Kong, Kirby, Mario, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Star Fox games have a more specific subcategory and don't belong in the general Nintendo games category. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 15:19, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was looking for a way to rectify that, but could find none. The LOC and several other free-use website have no Fonda portraits, so I replaced the image with one of the stamp. Still not "free use" (rather "fair use"). If you can find a free use photograph of Fonda, please post it.

<dd>I offered to take up your little Wikilove crap if you took back the statement that I grew angered at the reverting of my deletions as a compromise, and you refused.

<dd>No, quite the contrary. I created this account in accordance with Wikipedia policy because I felt like it was time to start helping out and cleaning things up, but I didn't want my old account caught up in any nonsense, it's mostly just edits to floral and plant and cooking subjects. Wikilove is not "crap", it's policy. Please study up and follow it. And your behavior here is very much showing your temper, which is what I am asking you to control in the first place. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevilbat_23b1.html" title="User:Devilbat">Devilbat</a>

<dd>It's hardly temper. I just call it how it is. Oh, and Wikilove is not policy.

<dl>
<dd>Sigh. I wish you would stop with the flaming. As for why we were made on the same day, my guess is that it is a 1/365 chance of happening for anyone. As I stated earlier, I created this account because I wished to do more for the community but I feared what USUALLY happens when someone steps into the middle of a flamewar or edit war and calls for calmness on both sides, and don't want anything bad happening to my old account as I still intend to use it for those articles when I make contributions. Wikiquette is a guideline you should follow, and Wikilove is something you should strive for. I am assuming good faith and offering good-faith help to you, because I assume that you have an interest in making Wikipedia better. Keeping these two things in mind will help you do just that.</dd>

<p>Thanks for undoing "Gavin"(Gabrielsimon)'s removal of sockpuppet info... it's especially stupid as he says only admins can put it there and the part he removed was an admin's comment. He's not too bright. Anyway... you said it is now "proven" -- is this proof on the admin page where they were investigating it, is it the kind of proof you can document so we can change the tags to Proven? It would also be helpful for me to know, because a couple of unruly editors who agreed withthose two were trying to claim I was only calling them sockpuppets to try to shut them out of the decision making process elsewhere (and one admin believed this and made rude comments and insinuations about it) so it would be nice if I could show the proof to people and get them to realize they were wrong. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:18, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Groovy. Thanks. I found it on his talk page and updated the socks to proven, though the couple of editors and admin arguing with me that I was wrong to accuse the socks of being socks still won't change their minds even when presented proof.

<p>I was just curious what Wikipedia guidlines were on naming royalty, and Princess Peach of the Mushroom Kingdom is what I ended up with.

<p>so even though the site is animal crossing related, and is outside of wikipedia, if it's there, it should be removed? That's unfair. External means outside of wikipedia. And this site has to do with animal crossing. AND, unlike you believe, the site IS NOT OWNED BY ME, so I can't be "spamming Wikipedia with <i><b>your</b></i> stupid site". oh, and also, IT'S NOT SPAMMING.

<p>The information that can be gained on that forum is codes. codes that can't be aqquired anywhere but that site without the codes being taken from the site. compare how many codes are on gamefaqs and how many are on project hyrule. big difference, huh? and try one of the codes in the game.</p>

<p>And also, it isn't a 'small invision board'. The statement after actually was just put there so people wouldn't spam and harrass me going OMGWTF WHERE ARE T3H CODEZ. The codes were made member-only because people kept stealing them and claiming them as their own. Why, the incentive to join isn't the codes, it's the community. Oh, and this site has information about animal crossing you or gamefaqs (which only has junk that is A: useless, or B: well known) don't have in this part of the index: <a href="http://s8.invisionfree.com/projecthyrule/index.php?c=2" class="external free" title="http://s8.invisionfree.com/projecthyrule/index.php?c=2" rel="nofollow">http://s8.invisionfree.com/projecthyrule/index.php?c=2</a> Take a look. They're helping eachother with things in the game. Expanding the amount of AC info on the forum. And a lot of that stuff isn't in the article. Oh, and you harassed me first. that link was as valid as any other, and YOU harassed me. Seeya. I'm going to go contact an admin now (or anything I can do besides that to stop this parade of idiocy we're calling an argument).&#160;:) seeya on the flipside.</p>

<p>Whoever wrote this ...</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Oh, and on this site, UCs for everything but fish, insects, and the forbidden 4 have codes on this site, and on gamefaqs, there aren't that many codes. and these are special UCs not on any other site unless they take them from PH. They had a very smart guy develop the code generator that made them. So they are not the same. And this site had cracked the code system before most of the sites you linked to existed. they just had to get a new site because of an incident with a guy named genji. or do you already know about that? from how you're acting, I'd think YOU'RE genji!&lt;&lt;</p>
<p><br />
I'm curious what you think you heard about why PH had to get a new site, and why you think there was any 'incidences' with Genji? I happen to know exactly why PH had to get a new server, and it's not because of any "incidences" trust me. And yeah, Genji has a bit of an attitude at times, but considering he's probably twice as old as most of the people that he had dealt with on a daily basis and how they tend to act like babies, it's not surprising why he's bitchy now and again! If he wanted to have people yell and groan at him and be children, trust me, he's got three of his own kids to do that on a daily basis lol!</p>
<p>And for the record to everyone else, PH was one of (if not the first) site/forum to create AC "codes", so let's get that part straight. If the codes you're using come from a different source, but when you put them in they say "From Project Hyrule", then make no mistake, they ARE from Project Hyrule. Sheesh! How hard is that to understand people? I can guarentee you that people over at Gamefaqs don't know what they're talking about half the time, and the rest are thieves. If you don't believe me then take a look at almost all the NES/SNES GameGenie codes on the site, close to 90% of every GG code for the NES/SNES were made by the GGCCC (Game Genie Code Creators Club), and that I know for fact since was a vital member of the GGCCC. So it just goes to prove you can't trust Gamefaqs ... or rather, you can't trust the people who have those "codes" faqs out as they are either liars or thieves!</p>
<p>In my opinion, Bisou is doing a darn good job of taking care of Project Hyrule and keeping it alive and active, and it's sad that people want to destroy all the hard work that PH has done over the years. If you think it's easy to create, maintain, and afford a site like PH, you're mistaken, and I can say that from personal experience here. Why people have to lie, cheat, and steal from PH is beyond me, but if anyone ever wants to really see where a code came from first, go become a member at PH and check it out for yourself. You might be surprised at just how many codes and how many members and how much info PH has these days for AC and ACWW!</p>
