<p>this may be just my opinion, but A Perfect Circle is not progressive rock...</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I had once changed it but was reverted so I left it. I'm not sure how I would desribe them... dark rock perhaps? <a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrHate_8284.html" title="User:MrHate">MrHate</a> 00:41, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
nowadays, I find very difficult to describe their genre... I mean... through all the changes from mer de noms, to emotive... damn... I usallay just refer to them as <i>modern rock</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Modern Rock sounds ok to me, and I definitely agree that it's not progressive. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellboy1975_4560.html" title="User:Hellboy1975">hellboy</a> 00:15, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Maybe Alternative or Hard Rock?</p>
<p>APC is just a heavy rock band with progressive influences, much like their brothers in Tool</p>
<dl>
<dd>personally i don't see any progressive influences besides possibly in "The Package".. <a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhale_2d37.html" title="User:Mwhale">Mwhale</a> 13:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They've definitely changed styles over their albums. You could say they were alternative with some post-metal, progressive, and industrial (mainly in eMotive) influences. -CW Werio 23:18, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would not take their last album too seriously. Rather than an experimental work it was obviously made to fill their contract quickly. Much of the sound scene is re-using the earlier albums' solutions. Musically, though, eMotive is high quality, but not due to work effort but talent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Personally, I like to throw them in that ambiguous Alternative Metal genre, its not alt rock though it is alternative, its not metal though it is heavy. Its definitely in between them for me, so it works out even if they aren't from the late 80's/early 90's. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnues_271d.html" title="User:Marnues">marnues</a> 08:32, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is the best definition in my opinion, too.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Please scroll past the following paragraph if you get squeamish when you see references to Jesus</b></p>
<p>If you examine some of the slower, atmospheric APC songs such as <i>Orestes</i>, <i>Brena</i>, and even some faster songs such as <i>Judith</i>, you can pick up some religious undertones in the actual instrumentation itself!! Take the main riff from <i>Judith</i> for example. The first time I heard the song, before the singing actually started, the first images that the riff gave to me were that of anti-jesus and religion. The riff feels like a sharp blade, perhaps one that could be used to "*@$@ your god, your lord, your christ". In <i>Orestes</i>, the neapolitan harmonies are reminiscent of sorrowful 18th century secular and anti-secular music. So IMHO, the music should be classified as Secular Rock.</p>

<p>Does anyone happen to have information on this thing? It began appearing on various Torrent sites, and has since been spreading around the internet; despite hours of searching, I can't seem to find any definitive source on it. Some tracks appear to be demos, others live performances, and in a few cases live performances of what appears to be working versions of the song ("The Hollow" for instance, is obviously a live track, yet uses a piano and features some other minor alterations).</p>

<p>The only thing which I can find that says anythign to the effect of APC being done is that French interview with Maynard. Are there any other sources for this? I'm going to revert the section that talks about it to re-add the "thinks" part since the direct quotes from the itnerview contain that exact word. I wish we had a better source than the one present, but since its all from a French magazine, its difficult to do better. However, if no other sources are mentioned I'm going to change the artciel to show that they are not over yet. It is not the place for wikipedia to speculate. They shouldn't have a disbanded date until they are officially disbanded. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnues_271d.html" title="User:Marnues">marnues</a> 22:30, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Logo is in fact the cresents formed from looking at a ring at a slight left angle. The tips of the juxtaposed cresents are too far apart to be made from the 4 overlapping circles. It is not a matter of what one thinks. It really is a ring. Lecks101 12:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a ring, you just have to look at it the right way. I came to the realization staring at the cover of thirteenth step not long after it came out, and since then it's hard to not see it.65.43.210.170 18:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There IS a music video for The Hollow. It wasn't included on aMOTION and was one of those videos that is a whole bunch of live footage with the album version of the song dubbed over the top. It was plastered all over TV when the single came out. Not a "scripted" video, but it was at least released by their record co. so this line should be altered somewhat to reflect that there is at least a "budget video" :) <a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrHate_8284.html" title="User:MrHate">MrHate</a> 01:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no idea why anons keep changing "A Perfect Circle was" back to "A Perfect Circle is" on the first paragraph of this article. "A Perfect Circle was" is correct, don't believe me, read part of the <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_Perfect_Circle_50dc.html#Hiatus_.282006-present.29" title="A Perfect Circle">hiatus</a> section. Their singer <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maynard_James_Keenan_0c5b.html" title="Maynard James Keenan">Maynard James Keenan</a> told <a href="http://www.fourtheye.net/?p=256" class="external text" title="http://www.fourtheye.net/?p=256" rel="nofollow">French magazine Rock Hard</a> that the band is over for the forseeable future and guitarist <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Howerdel_639a.html" title="Billy Howerdel">Billy Howerdel</a> also told <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1531791/20060515/perfect_circle.jhtml?headlines=true" class="external text" title="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1531791/20060515/perfect_circle.jhtml?headlines=true" rel="nofollow">MTV</a> that he has no idea what the band's future will be. This is the reason why I left this warning: "Note: Please do not change this back to "is". The singer Maynard James Keenan has said that the band is over for now, which means that it should be "was" not "is"." <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_101_9f64.html" title="User:Alex 101">Alex</a> 17:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The band has not officially broken up. What those quotes tell us is that band does not intend to record anything new for now, that's a far cry from being "broken up." A Perfect Circle is and always was something of a side project for each of the members involved, it is perfectly understandable that due to their other commitments, they aren't available to record another album together yet. This does NOT mean that they are broken up.</p>
<p>The next time an A Perfect Circle album comes out, would you then change the Tool article to "was" simply?</p>
<p>A "hiatus" is simply a hiatus. The article should not be changed to "was" unless the group decides to officially break up for good.</p>
<p>67.183.178.171 21:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the warning. But sorry anon, but "was" on this article is correct. Some members of the band claim that the band is done for this time. And no, I wouldn't change "was" to the Tool article if A Perfect Circle ever comes back. Read part of the weblinks I list above otherwise please don't keep changing "was" back to "is". If you revert one more time, I have no choice but to report you for vandalism (especially when you violate the three revert rule). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_101_9f64.html" title="User:Alex 101">Alex</a> 22:21, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They have only said that they don't have any project lined up currently, this is NOT the same as being broken up. They could release another album in 1 year or in 6 years and it would still be the same. They aren't obligated to release every 2 years or so. It isn't your place to state it as a fact that the band has broken up simply because they haven't done anything in the last two years. 67.183.178.171 08:03, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>System of a Down is also on Hiatus, and Serj has also said that they have a uncertain future, but should their article be in the past tense as well? FinalWish 19:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
