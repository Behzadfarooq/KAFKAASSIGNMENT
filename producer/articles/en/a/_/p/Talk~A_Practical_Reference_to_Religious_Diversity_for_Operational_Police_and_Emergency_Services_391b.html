<p>The <i>National Police Ethnic Advisory Bureau</i> conducted a nationwide survey in Australia and identified questions <i>operational</i> police had regarding religious determined behaviors and their impact on policing (see 1st ed. forward) approximately in CE2000.

<p>The first Edition of 'A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police' was produced in response to a growing trend within Australian Police Services to deliver culturally appropriate, customer orientated services to all Australians. It is also the culmination of effort and partnership between police and religious leaders across Australia.</p>
<p>The cultural diversity of Australia embraces many religions. Religiously determined behaviours pose a challenge to operational members who are expected to perform their duties with sensitivity to the community they serve. One of the stumbling blocks to the delivery of culturally sensitive services is a general lack of knowledge and awareness of different religious behaviors.</p>
<p>In an endeavour to equip operational police and emergency services with basic knowledge on this complex issue, the Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau conducted a nationwide survey. The survey identified questions operational police and emergency services have regarding religiously determined behaviours and their impact on policing.</p>
<p>It needs to be recognized that multicultural-ism, i.e.: the development of a cohesive and harmonious society through the valuing and utilization of our rich cultural, linguistic and religious diversity, operates within the framework of Australian and States laws.</p>
<p>These laws and protection apply to all Australian citizens regardless of religious, linguistic and cultural background. While cross-cultural awareness is a skill needed in today’s multicultural society, cultural practices that break Australian laws can not be condoned.</p>
<p>The idea for and subsequent development of this reference are testimony to the partnership that exists between police, emergency services and religious communities. It demonstrates a concerted effort to promote acceptance and harmony within Australian society.</p>
<p>As the title of the publication suggests, this is a practical reference for operational police and emergency services on religious diversity in Australia. It specifically focuses on religions in Australia as identified by police members and emergency services workers: Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, Sikh, Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Spirituality.</p>
<p>The information is based on the questions generated by operational police and emergency services. The responses have been developed by the respective religious leaders and communities.</p>
<p>One cautionary note is in order; the publication should be used as a resource only to assist police and emergency service workers to gain basic awareness and understanding.</p>
<p>This publication should not be viewed as a definitive response to every situation. Generalizations and stereotypes are counterproductive to the aim of the publication since individuals differ, often greatly, even in supposedly homogeneous social worlds.</p>
<p>As such, police and emergency service workers are encouraged to seek further information from either religious leaders or other reliable sources.</p>
<p>The publication is divided into several sub-headings with questions and answers for easy reference. A brief overview of each religion is also provided. In addition, a breakdown on the numbers of people in each of the religions in Australia are included as a chart on page 83. (see below)</p>

<p>I beleive the argument for deletion rests on the fact that existing temp content is the same as a portion of the original article which was a copyright violation. I will add for sense of good faith that I asked a number of people before and as I was writing the article and apparently no one actually looked at it or felt a need to warn me what I was doing was such. In any case I beleive there are a number of considerations about why this temp attempt should be allowed. First some of the content in that part of the original content of the article I wrote isn't from the publication - it doesn't refer to the third edition for example but there are other parts. But it manifestly is not a copyright violation of the publication because the second edition never speaks of the third. Admittedly it's a small part but now it's a larger proportion of the whole. Second, the remainder of the article is mostly intro/acknowledgement from the pubication which seems more generic than the point of the publication (which spends roughly 80 pages outlining a great deal of work) and third this content is a tiny fraction (roughly 3 pages out of more than 80 pages by memory) of the original publication. It reminds me of a fair use kind of argument about copyright though I suppose this mostly comes up when using screenshots or pictures which might mean that content should come by another methodoloy to the screen. Honestly what irks me about this process is everyone who makes any comment about the original publication, if they say anything about it, is that it deserves an article. But every editor who comes along just wants to delete it. No one wants to replace my unworthy effort. I don't care who does it - I think the publication is so noteworthy it deserves an article. I only wish the whole publication could be placed here - the world needs more interfaith awareness and precious few things get to such detail as this publication. I'm not fighting for "my stuff" as much as I want something for this publication to exist in wikipedia so that the original can be found.--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 11:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
