<p>According to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">style guide for external links</a>, Wikipedia articles should never link to sites that illegally reproduce copyrighted material, so you should remove any links to such sites and leave a {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">spam1</a>}} template on the talk page of the user who added the link. If the user continues to add the link or similar illegal links, use {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam2_4c34.html" title="Template:Spam2">spam2</a>}}, then {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam3_ee22.html" title="Template:Spam3">spam3</a>}}, and finally {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam4_3560.html" title="Template:Spam4">spam4</a>}}. If the user continues after four warnings, you should list him at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a>.

<dd>P.S. When leaving warning templates on user talk pages, you should always <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">substitute</a> them. For example, you would type <code>{{subst:spam1}}</code>, which would produce a message asking the user to stop adding links to commercial sites. For general vandalism, you should type <code>{{subst:test1}}</code>, which produces a message directing test edits to the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">sandbox</a>.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Ro2clownconcept.gif</b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">our fair use policy</a>).</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Pair_of_Shoes_4a27.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Pair of Shoes">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box.
