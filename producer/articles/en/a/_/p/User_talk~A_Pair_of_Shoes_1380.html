<p>According to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">style guide for external links</a>, Wikipedia articles should never link to sites that illegally reproduce copyrighted material, so you should remove any links to such sites and leave a {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam1_69f2.html" title="Template:Spam1">spam1</a>}} template on the talk page of the user who added the link. If the user continues to add the link or similar illegal links, use {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam2_4c34.html" title="Template:Spam2">spam2</a>}}, then {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam3_ee22.html" title="Template:Spam3">spam3</a>}}, and finally {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam4_3560.html" title="Template:Spam4">spam4</a>}}. If the user continues after four warnings, you should list him at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a>.

<dd>P.S. When leaving warning templates on user talk pages, you should always <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">substitute</a> them. For example, you would type <code>{{subst:spam1}}</code>, which would produce a message asking the user to stop adding links to commercial sites. For general vandalism, you should type <code>{{subst:test1}}</code>, which produces a message directing test edits to the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">sandbox</a>.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Ro2clownconcept.gif</b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">our fair use policy</a>).</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Pair_of_Shoes_4a27.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Pair of Shoes">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any <b>articles</b> will be deleted after seven days, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
