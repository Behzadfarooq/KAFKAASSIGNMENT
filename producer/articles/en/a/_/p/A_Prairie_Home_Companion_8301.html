<p>The earliest radio program to have this name bears little resemblance to what is currently heard on Saturday evenings. <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> was originally a morning show running from 6 to 9 a.m. on Minnesota Public Radio.</p>
<p>After researching the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Ole_Opry_b36d.html" title="Grand Ole Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a> for an article, Keillor became interested in doing a variety show on the radio. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">July 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, the first live broadcast of <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> took place. That show was broadcast from St. Paul in the Janet Wallace Auditorium of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macalester_College_9e17.html" title="Macalester College">Macalester College</a>. Twelve audience members turned out, mostly children. The second episode featured the first performance on the show by <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Thompson_7781.html" title="Butch Thompson">Butch Thompson</a>, who became house <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianist.html" title="Pianist">pianist</a>. Thompson stayed with the program until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, and still frequently performs on the show.</p>
<p>In 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in St. Paul, which was renovated in 1986 and renamed the <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fitzgerald_Theater_b578.html" title="Fitzgerald Theater">Fitzgerald Theater</a> in 1994. This is the same location that the program uses today.</p>
<p>The show went off the air in 1987, and Keillor married and spent some time abroad during the following two years. He returned to radio from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> with <i>The American Radio Company of the Air</i> (renamed <i>Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company</i> in its second season.) In 1993, this show moved to Minnesota and was renamed <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>. While most of the episodes originate from St. Paul, the show often travels to other cities around the U.S. and overseas to do the weekly broadcast.</p>
<p>The show was originally distributed nationally by Minnesota Public Radio in association with <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Radio_International_32a4.html" title="Public Radio International">Public Radio International</a>. Its current distributor is MPR's distribution unit, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Public_Media_66bd.html" title="American Public Media">American Public Media</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/p/A_Prairie_Home_Companion_8301.html" title="Edit section: Format">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Format</span></h2>
<p>Each show opens with the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_Williams_7f78.html" title="Spencer Williams">Spencer Williams</a> composition "<a href="../../../t/i/s/Tishomingo_Blues_c4aa.html" title="Tishomingo Blues">Tishomingo Blues</a>" as the theme song, but with lyrics written especially for <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>. Before 1987, the show's theme was Keillor's singing of the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Snow_7d02.html" title="Hank Snow">Hank Snow</a> hit "Hello Love".</p>
<p>Each show features a story-telling monologue from Keillor, claiming to be a report from Keillor's fictitious hometown of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Wobegon_eb1a.html" title="Lake Wobegon">Lake Wobegon</a>, "the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve ... where the women are strong, the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average." The opening words of the monologue usually do not change: "It's been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, my hometown, out on the edge of the prairie." The News from Lake Wobegon does not have a set structure per se, but often features recurring characters and places, such as the Chatterbox Cafe, the Sidetrack Tap, Pastor Inqvist of the Lake Wobegon <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheran_Church_51c1.html" title="Lutheran Church">Lutheran Church</a>, Father Wilmar of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, the Lake Wobegon Whippets sports teams, various members of the Bunsen and Krebsbach families, and an assortment of nearby "<a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_American_1dec.html" title="Norwegian American">Norwegian</a> bachelor farmers". The lengthy monologue is generally delivered without reference to notes.</p>
<p>The show is "sponsored" by the fictitious product "Powdermilk Biscuits", whose slogan is "Made from whole wheat raised in the rich bottomlands of the Lake Wobegon river valley by Norwegian bachelor farmers; so you know they're not only good for you, but pure ... mostly. Buy them ready-made in the big blue box with the picture of the biscuit on the cover, or in the brown bag with the dark stains that indicate freshness. Whole wheat that gives shy persons the strength to get up and do what needs to be done. Heavens they're tasty, and expeditious!" Powdermilk Biscuits has its own theme song, sung by Keillor every week.</p>
<p>Other original "sponsors" have included</p>
<ul>
<li>Be-Bop-A-Re-Bop Rhubarb Pie and Be-Bop-A-Re-Bop Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling ("One little thing can revive a guy, and that is a piece of rhubarb pie; Serve it up, nice and hot; Maybe things aren't as bad as you thought.")</li>
<li>Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery ("If you can't find it at Ralph's, you can probably get along without it," the inspiration of the name of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretty_Good_Privacy_f844.html" title="Pretty Good Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a> cryptographic software)</li>
<li>The Sidetrack Tap</li>
<li>Mournful Oatmeal ("<a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> in a box")</li>
<li>Raw Bits breakfast cereal</li>
<li>Jack's Auto Repair and Jack's Warm Car Service</li>
<li>Midwestern Discount Store</li>
<li>Guy's Shoes ("Guy's steel-toed shoes—so even when you strike out (ping!) you can walk away")</li>
<li>The Bon Marché Beauty Salon</li>
<li>Bertha's Kitty Boutique</li>
<li>The Ketchup Advisory Board</li>
</ul>
<p>An occasional sponsor is Monback Moving &amp; Storage (a mover is heard directing a moving truck [as a backup alarm can be heard beeping]: "Monback ... Monback ... <i>(crunch)</i> That's good.") Recently, the show has also been "sponsored" by <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xanax.html" title="Xanax">Xanax</a> Salad Sprinkles (for those times you need people to relax). "The Lives of the Cowboys" normally has its own, Western-themed sponsors, such as Prairie Dog Granola Bars ("healthier than chewing tobacco and you don't have to spit").</p>
<p>Other recurring bits on the show include fictional commercials, including those for The Catchup Advisory Board (its name being a compromise on the two spellings of the condiment, "catsup" and "ketchup", and proclaiming the good news about its "natural mellowing agents"), the American <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duct_Tape_7e53.html" title="Duct Tape">Duct Tape</a> Council, Marvin and Mavis Smiley seasonal bluegrass albums, Fred Farrell Animal Calls, the Professional Organization of English Majors, Earl's Academy of Accents, the American Society of Sound Effects Specialists, and the Cafe Boeuf.</p>
<p>Radio comedy <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skits.html" title="Skits">skits</a> featuring Keillor and the ensemble are performed, such as the satirical "<a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Noir_b259.html" title="Guy Noir">Guy Noir</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_investigator.html" title="Private investigator">Private Eye</a>", which pokes fun at <a href="../../../g/u/m/Gumshoe.html" title="Gumshoe">gumshoe</a> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_noir.html" title="Film noir">detective films</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_dramas.html" title="Radio dramas">radio dramas</a>. Guy Noir's popularity is such that the first few notes of the theme, or the first lines of the announcer's introduction ("A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets...") often draw applause and cheers from the theatre audience. A 2006 Guy Noir skit about <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>, titled "Broadway Tourette's", prompted a press release from the <a href="http://tsa-usa.org/news/Garrison-Keillor.htm" class="external text" title="http://tsa-usa.org/news/Garrison-Keillor.htm" rel="nofollow">TSA</a>, (<a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_Syndrome_Association_4d69.html" title="Tourette Syndrome Association">Tourette Syndrome Association</a>). Also regularly featured are the adventures of Dusty and Lefty, "The Lives of the Cowboys." In these skits, Dusty (played by Tim Russell) is a rough and tumble stereotypical cowboy, while Lefty (played by Keillor) is his sensitive counterpart. For a short period in the fall of 2001, the show aired a series of spoofs of NPR's <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Wertheimer_ff77.html" title="Linda Wertheimer">Linda Wertheimer</a> speaking with correspondent John Knotwright in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> while being plagued by problems with satellite delay.</p>
<p>Also, greetings from members of the audience (which are frequently humorous) to friends and family at home are read each week by Keillor just after the show's intermission.</p>
<p>Music is a strong feature of the program; the show is a significant outlet for <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_folk_music.html" title="American folk music">American folk music</a> of many genres, especially <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluegrass_music.html" title="Bluegrass music">bluegrass</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_music.html" title="Gospel music">gospel</a>, but the show also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music including <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">classical</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> and from a number of different countries. <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Atkins_db4e.html" title="Chet Atkins">Chet Atkins</a>, noted country musician and former record company executive, appeared many times on the show, as have singer-songwriters <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Knopfler_6aba.html" title="Mark Knopfler">Mark Knopfler</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Lang_b7e0.html" title="Jeff Lang">Jeff Lang</a>.</p>
<p>While much of the show is directed toward <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_comedy.html" title="Radio comedy">radio comedy</a>, a portion of the show is usually devoted to some more sentimental and sometimes dark stories put together by Keillor and others. The program occasionally features political satire, which usually reflects the liberal nature of Minnesota politics.</p>
