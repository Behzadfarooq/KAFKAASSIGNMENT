<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The film is set during the period of growing influence of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_independence_movement.html" title="Indian independence movement">Indian independence movement</a> in the British <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raj.html" title="Raj">Raj</a>. It begins with the arrival in India of a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> woman, Miss Adela Quested, who is joining her fiancé, a city <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magistrate.html" title="Magistrate">magistrate</a> named Ronnie Heaslop. She and Ronnie's mother, Mrs. Moore, befriend an Indian doctor, Aziz H. Ahmed. Dr. Aziz meets Mrs. Moore for the first time in the moonlight at an abandoned <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a> on the river <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges.html" title="Ganges">Ganges</a>, and he soon finds that Mrs. Moore possesses a sensitivity and unprejudiced attitude to native Indians which endears her to him. When Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested profess an interest in seeing "the real India" (as opposed to the Anglicised environment Ronnie and his friends have constructed for themselves), Aziz offers to host an excursion to the Marabar Caves (to avoid asking them to his shabby bungalow), a local geological oddity.</p>
<p>Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore agree readily, and the outing goes reasonably well until the two women begin exploring the caves. Mrs. Moore experiences an overwhelming sense of horror which completely quenches her good humour; worse, Miss Quested forms the delusion that Aziz is making sexual advances toward her. She flees the cave in a panic and is discovered running headlong down the hill, bloody and disheveled. Aziz is immediately jailed to await trial for attempted rape, and an uproar ensues between the Indians and the Colonials.</p>
<p>Miss Quested is not a vindictive or even an unusually neurotic person; rather, she is suffering from an abnormal mental state brought about by multiple factors--the remorseless heat, the strangeness of her surroundings, her growing dismay over her future husband's small, mean character, and (perhaps) her feelings of attraction, fraught with shame, for Dr. Aziz. Even as her case becomes a <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cause_celebre.html" title="Cause celebre">cause celebre</a> among the British, her mind gradually clears and she realizes she has made a mistake. There is also a subtext present in the film concerning Mrs. Moore's feelings concerning old age and her impendng mortality. Though she waits bed-side with Miss Quested in support, she makes clear to Ronnie that she firmly believes in Aziz's innocence. Because of her refusal to testify, and the fear by the Anglo-Indians that she would bolster the case of the defence Mrs. Moore leaves for England. She subsequently suffers a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_attack.html" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a> on the voyage.</p>
<p>To the consternation of her friends, Miss Quested clears Dr. Aziz in open court. The Colonials are forced to make an ignominious retreat while the Indians carry Dr. Aziz out of the courtroom on their shoulders, cheering wildly. In the aftermath, Miss Quested breaks off her engagement and leaves India, while Dr. Aziz doffs his Western attire, dons traditional dress and withdraws completely from Anglo-Indian society. Although he remains angry and bitter for years, the final scene shows Miss Quested at home in England, reading a letter from Dr. Aziz conveying his thanks and forgiveness.</p>

<p>While the film is relatively faithful to the novel, the ending is changed. The book ends with a bitter Aziz talking about how the British must be driven out and telling his British friend that because of their nationalities they can no longer be friends; while it is implied that someday British and Indians might be friends, the book concludes that it could not happen in the present. While scenes invoking Aziz's anger at the injustices foisted upon him and all native Indians, and his resolution to quit British India, the film concludes with a later scene of Aziz forgiving Miss Quested. It may be argued that this waters down Forster's original didact about racial tensions and Indian independence.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Guinness_c31c.html" title="Alec Guinness">Alec Guinness</a> agreed to the role as Godbole despite having quarrelled with David Lean in the early 1960s. Lean had wanted him to play the title role in a proposed film about <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi.html" title="Gandhi">Gandhi</a> (a project ultimately scrapped). According to Guinness's biography, Lean wanted him to play Gandhi because he felt "Hindus couldn't act". Guinness and Lean quarreled again on <i>Passage to India</i>, as they had on most of their other collaborations, and most of Guinness's scenes were cut for timing reasons. Guinness called it the worst role he ever did. (<a href="../../../p/i/e/Piers_Paul_Read_7d61.html" title="Piers Paul Read">Piers Paul Read</a>, <i>Alec Guinness: The Authorized Biography</i>.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/2E/m/E.M._Forster_ed0f.html" title="E.M. Forster">E.M. Forster</a> told <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Ashcroft_a294.html" title="Peggy Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a> he hoped she would one day play Mrs. Moore when he met her in 1960s, during the run of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santha_Rama_Rau_18f6.html" title="Santha Rama Rau">Santha Rama Rau</a>'s stage adaptation of <i>Passage to India</i> in London. Ashcroft was indeed cast in the film, largely due to the lobbying of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Guinness_c31c.html" title="Alec Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>. <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celia_Johnson_16c0.html" title="Celia Johnson">Celia Johnson</a> was also considered for the part. (<a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Brownlow_4803.html" title="Kevin Brownlow">Kevin Brownlow</a>, <i>David Lean: A Biography</i>, p. 650)</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_O%27Toole_925f.html" title="Peter O'Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> was Lean's first choice for the part of Fielding but the role eventually went to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Fox_228f.html" title="James Fox">James Fox</a>. (Brownlow, 672-3) Fox's brother <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Fox_0491.html" title="Edward Fox">Edward</a> is erroneously listed by several sources as the performer of the role. (see, for example, the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087892/fullcredits" class="external text" title="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087892/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">IMDB Cast List</a>)</p>

<p>The "Marabar Caves" in the film and novel were based on the Barabar Caves, some 35km north of <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaya.html" title="Gaya">Gaya</a>. Lean visited the caves during pre-production but found them unphotogenic; concerns about bandits were also prevalent. Instead he used two separate hills a few miles from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, where much of the principal filming occurred, and the caves themselves were created by the production company. <a href="http://www.mapability.com/travel/p2i/marabar.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mapability.com/travel/p2i/marabar.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lean_b22d.html" title="David Lean">David Lean</a> isolated much of the cast and crew by taking solo credit for the editing and screenplay despite the collaborations of others.

<p><i>A Passage to India</i> did moderately well at the box office, taking in some $26 million in the US, but was not a blockbuster hit. However, the film was a critical success and revived Lean's reputation as a great film maker. Today, the film is highly thought of, but is generally considered not on a par with his earlier epics.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>According to Peter McLuskie of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Broadcast_Communications_622c.html" title="Museum of Broadcast Communications">Museum of Broadcast Communications</a>, <i>Passage of India</i> can be linked to "a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history" <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/J/htmlJ/jewelinthe/jewelinthe.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/J/htmlJ/jewelinthe/jewelinthe.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. McLuskie suggests that other films n this cycle include <i><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi_%28film%29.html" title="Gandhi (film)">Gandhi</a></i> (1982), <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_and_Dust_7e60.html" title="Heat and Dust">Heat and Dust</a></i> (1983), <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Far_Pavilions_80d7.html" title="The Far Pavilions">The Far Pavilions</a></i> (1983), <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jewel_in_the_Crown_9c8d.html" title="The Jewel in the Crown">The Jewel in the Crown</a></i> (1984) and <i>Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy</i> (1985). This preoccupation extended to "escapist" fare like the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> adventure <i><a href="../../../o/c/t/Octopussy.html" title="Octopussy">Octopussy</a></i> (1983), and even the Hollywood film <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_cece.html" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i> (1984), which were also primarily set in India.</p>
