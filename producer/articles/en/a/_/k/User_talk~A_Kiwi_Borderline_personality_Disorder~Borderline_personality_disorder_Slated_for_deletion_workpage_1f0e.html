<p>People with BPD, who are often distressed by at least some of their symptoms, often seek psychiatric help and are typically put on one or more <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoactive_drug.html" title="Psychoactive drug">psychoactive drugs</a>, testing to see what helps a particular patient the most while causing the least of the most undesirable side effects. Many patients go off their medications periodically and sometimes, when results have been poor and the side effects intolerable, go off their medications completely. Some patients who have successfully completed courses of certain psychotherapies are able to wean off their medications, sometimes able to stay drug free for the most part, with some of them taking medications for short periods of time when symptoms reappear.</p>
<p>Many researchers have long focused on non-pharmacological treatments, such as <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectical_behavior_therapy.html" title="Dialectical behavior therapy">dialectical behavior therapy</a> because it was not recognized or believed that there were <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoactive_drugs.html" title="Psychoactive drugs">medication regimens</a> that could be beneficial. Medications were more likely to be seen and experienced as routes to suicide attempts. - - &gt;</p>

<p>Often, an SSRI or a SNRI drug is prescribed to a patient with BPD without proper supervision and involvement of family caregivers, or explanation or warning of side effects. The drugs often cause singificant agitation and insomnia initially and for some people these problems may persist. This can pose problems in someone who may have been having suicidal thoughts when they begin treatment. Many people can experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when stopping which can lead to the impression they are 'addicted ' to the medication.</p>
<p>The impulsivity, suicidality and possible lack of supports in borderline patients may render them much more vulnerable to self-harm than those without these vulnerablilies should these problems arise. It may be difficult for the treating physician to make the distinction between side effects that are worsened by increase of dose and the symptoms that a patient is experiencing from the disorder. Increasing the dose to address the worsening symptoms can be dangerous if the symptoms are in fact a side effect of the drug.</p>

<p>It once was the case that a prescription for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tranquilizers.html" title="Tranquilizers">tranquilizers</a> was written for anyone complaining of <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervousness.html" title="Nervousness">nervousness</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/x/Anxiety.html" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>. However, research studies have indicated and psychiatric practice has demonstrated that most anxiety is best treated with antidepressants. Most anxiety is actually a masking over of depression. Give an anxious jittery borderline a <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valium.html" title="Valium">Valium</a>, and they may very well be suicidal by the next day. This is because the anxiety is a barrier, shielding the person from awareness of their true <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotional_state.html" title="Emotional state">emotional state</a>. Take away the anxiety, and the person is suddenly up close and personal with the depths of their depression and they are overwhelmed. This type of depression is called an <a href="../../../a/g/i/Agitated_depression.html" title="Agitated depression">agitated depression</a>. - - - &gt;</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that this old mainstay, the first mood stabiizer ever discovered, has such an important extra benefit. There is almost no current research, nor much inquiry in many decades. This is because no one holds an exclusive marketing patent on lithium. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithium_salt.html" title="Lithium salt">Lithium salt</a> is very modestly priced; and so there is not enough profit to pay for new research. - - - &gt;</p>

<p>The newer "atypical" antipsychotics have encouraged doctors to extend their use for the treatment of more patients, both children and adults. When other mood stabilizers do not effectively manage symptoms and signs, they are increasingly utilized for both those with bipolar disorder (BP) and with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Some think that doctors are prescribing antipsychotics too rapidly and soon, rather than taking the long route of trial and error with the less dangerous antidepressants and antiseizure medications.- - - &gt;</p>

<p>Atypical <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipsychotic.html" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotics</a> are notorious for often causing considerable weight gain and all the typical health complications associated with obesity. They also can cause the onset of diabetes, even in children who have not gained any appreciable weight. Atypical antipsychotics tend to cause more weight gain than conventional ones and weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia. While all are implicated, clozapine and olanzapine seem to be the worst. Conceming the underlying mechanisms of the weight gain, it is thought they interfere with central nervous functions regulating energy balance; patients report about: increase of appetite for sweet and fatty foods or "food craving" (for antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotic drugs). Additonally, atypical antipsychotics can cause and weight gain despite even reduced appetite and stable caloric intake which can be explained by an altered resting metabolic rate. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> For these reasons, these drugs should not be considered first-line pharmacotherapy, but used only as backup if other mood stabilizers (such as <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithium.html" title="Lithium">lithium</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzodiazepine.html" title="Benzodiazepine">benzodiazepines</a>) are not able to control problematic behavioral symptoms.</p>

<p>Many of the available antiepileptic and antipsychotic medications, as well as lithium, can cause varying amounts and types of cognitive dulling, with some more likely to have pronounced effects on such things as word retrieval, mental quickness, the ability to absorb and understand difficult material. It can also cause minimal to severe impact on memory. These cognitive side effects are the most difficult of side-effects for most people to tolerate, for they are not likely to diminish over time. - - - &gt;</p>
