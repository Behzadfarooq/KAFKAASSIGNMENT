	    <p><i><b>A Kestrel for a Knave</b></i> is a book by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Hines_f8bd.html" title="Barry Hines">Barry Hines</a>, published in 1968. It is set in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnsley.html" title="Barnsley">Barnsley</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and tells of Billy Casper, a young working class boy troubled at home and at school, who only finds solace when he finds and trains a <a href="../../../k/e/s/Kestrel.html" title="Kestrel">kestrel</a> who he names 'Kes.'</p>
<p>The book was made into a film <i><a href="../../../k/e/s/Kes_%28film%29.html" title="Kes (film)">Kes</a></i> and is often used in <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_Stage_4_dc0b.html" title="Key Stage 4">Key Stage 4</a> assessment in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, as part of <a href="../../../g/c/s/GCSE_097d.html" title="GCSE">GCSE</a> English courses. The book is so named because of a poem found in the Boke of St Albans. In <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medi%C3%A6val.html" title="Mediæval">mediæval</a> times, the only bird a knave could afford to keep was a kestrel.</p>

<p>In the opening pages of the book we see the protagonist, Billy Casper, and his brother Jud sleeping in the same bed in a deprived household. Billy tries to encourage Jud to get up to go to work, but Jud only responds by punching him. Jud finally gets up and soon afterwards so does Billy, only to discover that Jud has stolen his bicycle. As a result, Billy turns up late for his paper round, and has to deliver all of the newspapers on foot. Billy then returns home to find a man whom he does not recognise leaving his house. He talks to his Mum, and we find out that this person is Reg, a man she came home with the night before. At this point, it is apparent that Billy's father is absent. Billy's Mum then tells him to go to the shop to get a packet of cigarettes. He is also told to place a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">bet</a> for Jud. When Billy declines, she chases him out of the house, threatening him with <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_punishment.html" title="Physical punishment">violence</a>. Billy then walks to a shed at the bottom of the garden to talk to his <a href="../../../k/e/s/Kestrel.html" title="Kestrel">kestrel</a>, Kes.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashback_%28literary_technique%29.html" title="Flashback (literary technique)">flashback</a> then occurs. After seeing a kestrel's nest up in a tree in the woods, Billy attempts to withdraw a book from the library. Because he is not a member, he is refused, and instead steals it. He goes home to read it and converses with Jud and Mum. Jud has a night out and comes back home drunk. Billy then leaves the house and goes out and steals a <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawk.html" title="Hawk">hawk</a>. The flashback ends.</p>
<p>Later on in the day, Billy is at school, where Mr Crossley is taking a register. After the name Fisher, Billy shouts out '<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Bight_ff78.html" title="German Bight">German Bight</a>', a reference to the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping_Forecast_8c8b.html" title="Shipping Forecast">Shipping Forecast</a>, inadvertently causing the teacher to make a mess of his register. The class then proceeds to the hall for an assembly run by the strict head teacher, Mr Gryce. During the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>, Billy starts to daydream, and after the prayer has finished, Billy remains standing after the rest of the people in the hall have sat down. Billy is told to report to Gryce's room after assembly. Billy goes to Gryce and gets <a href="../../../c/a/n/Caning.html" title="Caning">caned</a>. He then goes to a class with Mr Farthing, who is discussing 'Fact and Fiction'. One of the pupils, Anderson, tells a story about tadpoles. Then Billy is told to tell a story, and tells a story about his kestrel. Mr Farthing takes an interest. The class then has to write a tall story, and Billy writes about a day when his father comes back home and Jud leaves to go to the army. After the lesson Billy gets into a fight with another boy, which is eventually broken up by Mr Farthing.</p>
<p>After break, Billy goes to <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">PE</a> with Mr Sugden. Billy has no PE kit, because his mother refuses to pay for it, so he is forced to wear clothes that do not fit. He goes onto the football pitch, and is told to play in goal. After a very long lesson, which involves Billy performing acrobatics on the goalpost, the class goes back inside and each take a shower. Billy is humiliated by Mr Sudgen who forces him to take a cold shower. After this, Billy goes straight home to feed Kes. He takes her out and flies her, and is approached by Mr Farthing, who is apparently impressed by Billy's skill. Mr Farthing then leaves, and Billy goes out to place Jud's bet. However, he finds out that the horse is not very likely to win, and instead uses Jud's money to buy a portion of chips.</p>
<p>Billy returns back to school, and whilst sitting in a maths lesson sees Jud walking towards the school. The lesson finishes, and Billy leaves hurriedly. He tries to hide from Jud before he bumps into Gryce, who reminds him that he is supposed to be in a Youth Employment Meeting. Billy goes along to his Youth Employment Meeting, and the Youth Employment Officer finds it very difficult to recommend anything, as Billy claims that he has no hobbies. After the Youth Employment Meeting, Billy goes straight home and finds that Kes has disappeared. He frantically searches for her, and returns home. Jud is there, and he tells Billy that the horse he was supposed to place a bet on won, and that he has killed Kes. Billy then calls Jud a 'fuckin' bastard' and has a fight with him. His mother criticises Billy's language, and Billy runs away. Another flashback takes place in which Billy visits the cinema with his father. When they return home, Billy's father finds that his wife has been having an affair with Billy's 'Uncle Mick'. He punches him, and leaves the house. After the flashback has ended, Billy returns home, buries the kestrel and goes to bed.</p>
