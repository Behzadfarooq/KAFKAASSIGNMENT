<p>"A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/r/Talk%7EA_Room_with_a_Moose_1aa0.html" title="Edit section: Removal of Proposed Deletion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Removal of Proposed Deletion</span></h2>
<p>I removed a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> tag because I don't believe that this article should just be deleted without any discussion. I'm sure that User:Ohemgee thinks that this article "is hardly notable," but that's the personal opinion of someone with only seventeen edits, eleven of which were for talk pages. I don't think that these are the credentials of a Wikipedia veteran with lots of experience on what should be on the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I will agree to one thing: this probably isn't very notable outside the subculture of Invader Zim fans. Is that deletion-worthy? I'm not sure. Wikipedia presently has tons of articles on Biblical passages, most of which aren't very notable outside the subculture of hardcore Bible geeks. Wikipedia has nearly five hundred articles on individual Pokemon -- and those <i>definitely</i> aren't notable outside the culture of Pokemon fans. Tomorrow's featured article will cover the music of the lesser Antilles -- a culture of 3 to 4 million people total. More people watch <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_the_City_edf3.html" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a>, which is -- again -- something that isn't very notable outside the culture of Sex and the City fans. (It's quite possible that Invader Zim has reached a culture of 3-4 million people by itself; but I don't know the stats. At the very least, an Invader Zim petition on PetitionOnline.com has 190,000 signatures, so we know that there are at least 190,000 fans who love Invader Zim, have access to the internet, and care deeply enough to sign a petition about it).</p>
<p>Bottom line: this should not be proposed for deletion without a considerable amount of discussion; and that discussion needs to be far more general. If favorite episodes of popular television shows are no longer notable, then there are <i>lots</i> of articles that <i>need</i> to be deleted; and that discussion needs to happen at a much higher level than petty deletion squabbles. As long as television episode articles are allowed in general, User:Ohemgee can keep his opinions to himself.</p>

<p><br />
Holy fuck. You didn't just compare Invader Zim to the Bible, did you?</p>
<p>This page is for one unimportant episode of a somewhat popular but cancelled show.</p>
<p>Those articles about individual pokemon should probably be merged or deleted, too. The fact that those articles are still up does not prove that this article is notable.</p>
<p>Also this is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, not only "wikipedia veterans," right? Ohemgee 01:02, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Ohemgee: The fact that you're not a Wikipedia veteran means certain things. For example, you are unaware that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> is for articles that are <b>uncontestably</b> deletable. But that's just the problem: I am <b>contesting</b> this nomination with you. Just to help you along, the relevant template says:
<dl>
<dd>"You may remove this message if you improve the article, <b>or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason</b>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It should be treated to a full <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">AfD</a> debate, not just ousted because you don't believe it's so. Meanwhile, you didn't rebut my point: which was that present policy allows for articles on television shows, and considers them "notable." Your claims that these articles are <i>not</i> notable must be viewed in that light.</dd>
<dd>Come now, don't be bitter just because there are trolls killing all of your webcomic articles.</dd>
<dd>--<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 18:29, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You did not supply any legitimate sources showing this is notable. You don't need an article for each fucking episode. A page for Invader Zim, yes. EVERY episode? No. That's for this show and pretty much every show. Or, alternatively, if you're going to set the threshold for notable so low, then other articles shouldn't be deleted.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm bitter. Ohemgee 02:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't need to supply "any legitimate sources" showing that this episode is notable. I just need to object to the deletion of this article for <i>any</i> reason, and your particular method is thwarted.</dd>
<dd>My particular reason, of course, is that what you're asking for amounts to a <i>new policy</i>--one that hasn't been proposed, written, reviewed, voted on, nada. Are your ideas sensible? Maybe, or maybe not; I don't know. I'll leave that up to the community as a whole.</dd>
<dd>I can put in the proposal for a policy review, if you'd like. But until the policy explicitly states "No articles on individual TV episodes because they're not notable," I'm not going to let you do a proposed-deletion of a page that merits an AfD debate.</dd>

<dd>(Post scriptum: It should be noted that notability is a guideline, not a policy. TV episodes may or may not constitute an exception -- I don't know.)</dd>
<dd>(Post post scriptum: I have begun the process of discussion with a pre-draft essay at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28TV_episodes%29_8fd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (TV episodes)">Wikipedia:Notability (TV episodes)</a>.) <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 07:31, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikified. I regretabbly forgot how the episode ended, however. Feel free to fix it. -JeebusSez 20:57, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think this needs to be morphed, fused, whatver with the Invader Zim article. -<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchor_THE_91ee.html" title="User:Anchor THE">User:Anchor_THE</a>
<ul>
<li>I disagree. The moosiness is beyond a subheading in another article. PhoenixJ 18:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li>The episode ends with Dib getting the buss back to earth, Zim throwing a tantrum, and GIR watching kiddy shows</li>

<p>Why is Dib so freaked out by a moose eating walnuts?</p>
<p>The above user does not understand the humor of invader zim <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevilmaycare_a5f0.html" title="User:Devilmaycare">Devilmaycare</a> 07:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, that's it for the most part. The answer to that is "for the same reason that they put Dib in a 'crazy bucket', and everyone always makes fun of his 'huge head' even though it's really not that much larger than the others." Having said that, I often (jokingly) pose that question to anyone in the room when watching that episode.</p>
