<p>Hi! I'd like to point out that as of Jan 1 2007, ISBNs are now 13 digits instead of 10, which is why I put those in the JBC article. You can read more at <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Standard_Book_Number_c023.html" title="International Standard Book Number">International Standard Book Number</a> and on the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/13digit.html" class="external text" title="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/13digit.html" rel="nofollow">Library of Congress website</a>. The ISBNs I found are from Amazon.com - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cabellian-Harmonics-Warren-McNeill/dp/0766161439/sr=11-1/qid=1168067571/ref=sr_11_1/103-6234952-6615837" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Cabellian-Harmonics-Warren-McNeill/dp/0766161439/sr=11-1/qid=1168067571/ref=sr_11_1/103-6234952-6615837" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/James-Branch-Cabell-Centennial-Southern/dp/0807110280/sr=1-2/qid=1168067670/ref=sr_1_2/103-6234952-6615837?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/James-Branch-Cabell-Centennial-Southern/dp/0807110280/sr=1-2/qid=1168067670/ref=sr_1_2/103-6234952-6615837?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'm not an expert on either JBC or on the reliability of Amazon, but those looked valid to me. As for the "eds" part of the Inge book, your change looks right to me.

<p>Hi Ramachandran. Let me assure you that my tags on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantra.html" title="Mantra">mantra</a> has little to do with <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. That paragraph is sourced from an article written by a Nitin Kumar, an employee of Exotic India <a href="http://www.exoticindia.com/article/om/aff10490" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exoticindia.com/article/om/aff10490" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a company that sell Aum motifs. This original research seems to be intended only as a promotion of their product, and is not supported by any kind of scholarship. Please see on your left the Tamil version of the <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable.html" title="Syllable">syllable</a> Aum. If the Devanagari symbol, which clearly comes from merging the devanagari "अ" (A) "ऊ" (U) and "ँ" (M), and not created by joining semicircles and dots symbolizing various things, is the Tamil symbol inferior in some way? What about the Gurumukhi, Tibetan and Chinese symbols of Aum? The Exotic India Store website is not a reliable source of information, and this was my reason for adding the tags.

<p>I <b>do</b> think the person is behaving like a [personal attack removed] -- which is a quite mild comment in view of his behaviour. But what puzzles me is where is a similar warning from you to that anonymous user (a sockpuppet for user Maleabroad, I suspect)&#160;? Nothing. A bit odd, don't you think&#160;? A bit of even-handednedd would be nice. I spend time correcting the text and adding diacritics and this guy comes along -- repeatedly -- and blanks all my efforts, and those of others, by a blanket revert. He shows no respect for any Wiki conventions, total contempt for other Wiki users and, might I add, insults them, with his insinuations about their religious affiliation.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 02:03, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice constructive reply. Well, why not save yourself the trouble and not get involved in things that have a very long history. Less hassle for yourself and others. If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing properly. But believe me, a lot of people have remonstrated with this infuriating person to no avail. He is quite happy to ignore anything anybody says or does just to get his own way.

<p>Hi, thanks for the note. Yes, I am a teacher of YGS's organization. I haven't been editing the page for a while, but I noticed that the page is in a really sad state of affairs - and nobody without any conflicts of interest (whether pro YGS or otherwise) has undertaken editing it. I might mention that terminator iii also is a teacher of a "competing" organization - thus his intensity of reactionism. Therefore, we are left with a dilemma: should this page stay in its current lackluster state of affairs or should someone with a conflict of interest be allowed to edit the page and improve its quality? Your help would be appreciated in this regard. If you would like to volunteer to undertake a revision of this page, I'll be happy to supply you with any links to sources that I have regarding YGS and assist you in any other way that you might request. In my experience on wikipedia, I have found it rare to find articles being written by 3rd parties with no conflict of interest, especially with spiritual organizations that have not yet achieved large-scale pop recognition. If that were the case, then most of the most heated disputes would be non-existent. I wish this were the case. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 21:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I might also mention that many of the pages that I've attempted to edit in the past have met with high to enormous resistance from editors with conflicts of interest, making editing of those pages with objectivity impossible and futile. Those pages are to this day being "guarded" from being altered by these editors in a way that is unsatisfactory to them. I'm sure you must have run into this kind of behavior before. It makes editing on wikipedia very difficult. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 21:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for putting in the effort to edit the YGS page. It looks fine in most respects. However, the "Differences with Traditional Views" sections is unfounded. The sources cited are taken out of context and in no way represent traditional views of Hindu vedanta or any oral or written tradition. These have been discussed ad nauseum in the archives, if you want to take a look. I believe this section was devised by "competing" editors with conflict of interest in an attempt to undermine the integrity of the page. I obviously have my own "conflict of interest", but I tell you with objectivity, that if you show this information to any Indian yogi, satguru, brahmin, or swami, or otherwise expert on the varied topics introduced in this section (Shiva Shakti Kriya Yoga, the personage of the yogi Gorakshanath, or the Sat Guru parampara) you will find that these stated "differences" are not in congruence with fact. The diff that I added to Sfacets talk page demonstrates some sources which elucidate this points of view (at the bottom). <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 13:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out - I'm aware that the article is being revived. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> and I have talked about one of the other articles he's trying to get back to adding his Guru to, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriya_Yoga_78d8.html" title="Kriya Yoga">Kriya Yoga</a>. I also notice <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a>'s comments here. I have no problem with the YGS article being a vanity or promo type of article (claims of being a SatGuru or a Master are typically absent from articles about self-realized Gurus on WP since it's unencyclopedic). But if there are other false claims that are unencyclopedic (with references showing they are false and unencyclopedic), then I'll take a closer look. As the article stands now, I'm ok with it, but I'll keep an eye on it. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> <small><i><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPriyanath_7e03.html" title="User talk:Priyanath">talk</a></i></small> 16:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't mind having the claim of being a satguru removed. Again, I'm not interested in editing the article if it will cause editors with conflicts of interest to start vandalizing the page. I'd rather have the article deleted altogether. I'm going along with this process only because both you (A Ramachandran) and Sfacets are guiding the process - thus leaving me out of the final decision making. My part in this is solely as commentator at this time, as I realize that though there is some info on YGS, neither are there enough 3rd party sources available to me on YGS to create a cogent full length biographical article, nor am I without a "conflict of interest" as an editor of this page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But Priyanath does bring up a good point - I did make an edit (which was reverted) and subsequently initiate a discussion on the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriya_Yoga_78d8.html" title="Kriya Yoga">Kriya Yoga</a> page regarding placing references to YGS on that page, as he is part of the modern history associated with that topic. This appears to be controversial and merits mediation if you have a minute to look. Thanks <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 19:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But YGS is not part of modern 'history' associated with Kriya Yoga. Many people make similar claims - a new one pops up every week (see "Mangeshda"). There is no notability, and certainly no <i>verifiable</i> proof that YGS met <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahavatar_Babaji_e971.html" title="Mahavatar Babaji">Mahavatar Babaji</a> and received Kriya Yoga. And it is impossible to ever prove. I.E., it's unencyclopedic to add YGS to the Kriya Yoga article. And this is still an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> <small><i><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPriyanath_7e03.html" title="User talk:Priyanath">talk</a></i></small> 23:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if this is an appropriate place to have this discussion, but I'd be happy to come to some resolution at the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Talk%7EKriya_Yoga_d3a3.html" title="Talk:Kriya Yoga">Kriya Yoga discussion</a> page if <a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_Ramachandran_bc06.html" title="User:A Ramachandran">A Ramachandran</a> is willing to mediate. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 02:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm more than happy to have <a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_Ramachandran_bc06.html" title="User:A Ramachandran">A Ramachandran</a> mediate, if he wants to go there. By the way, I'm not opposed to the comments on the YGS page about his devotees thinking he's a Sadguru. I won't remove that statement. I appreciate the respect they have for him. It just isn't remotely encyclopedic, for so many reasons, like much of what you're trying to promote here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> <small><i><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPriyanath_7e03.html" title="User talk:Priyanath">talk</a></i></small> 02:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'd have to say that the "differences" section appears to be there to address precisely these non-encyclopedic claims. For example, if there was simply an identification as a <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">guru</a>, rather than a claim to be a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sat_Guru_cf2f.html" title="Sat Guru">Sat Guru</a>, then there would be no point to the first "difference" and it could be removed. So, I guess it depends on how strong the desire is to assert one vs. how strong the desire is to remove the other. I'd happily assist <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> to both make the article encyclopedic and remove some if not all of the section he finds objectionable at the same time, if he is willing. <a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_Ramachandran_bc06.html" title="User:A Ramachandran">A Ramachandran</a> 02:58, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm very willing. I'd rather it be 100% encyclopedic. Go ahead and make the changes Rama, and I'll comment if I find something unsatisfactory to me. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 04:02, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello A Ramachandran. As you know, mediation has been requested for a dispute that you are involved in. I am willing to serve as the mediator in this case.

<p>Regarding your revert. <i>08:33, 18 January 2007 A Ramachandran (Talk | contribs) (uh, no, you have to provide citations for your facts, see WP:V)</i> the editor took that passage from the Shugden article.

<p>Thanks for that last note. To be clear, I was just trying to make a strong rational case. It's not a big deal. I hope you understand that I'm keeping out of the final decision making for a reason (to work towards resolution, and not to be iron-fisted against detractors from my opinion), and that I've not made a single edit since you signed on to mediate. I was not wikilawyering intentionally, nor to instigate conflict, but simply to demonstrate my point of view on the matter as fully as possible. I wrote a lot because it's a very confusing and ambiguous mess of a point, so it requires some modicum of comprehension. However, I will refrain in the future from wikilawyering and putting you to sleep. Please come back and mediate, if possible. I do not want to argue directly with other editors who have conflict of interest as I do. It has never worked well in the past. I will paraphrase that long boring commentary in a concise way, as you've requested. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 18:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for mediating on what has been such a contentious article in the past. For the first time, it's beginning to read like an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>Regarding the Differences with Traditional Views section, and those two sub-sections I added in the past, I'm fine with the entire Differences section being removed, with a couple of minor caveats:</p>
<p>1. If any more claims are re-added to the article purporting that YGS has met "Mahavatar Babaji", or that Shiv-Goraksha-Babaji is the same as "Mahavatar Babaji", then the second of the two Differences sections should be added back. 2. If any claims are made that ShivGB is the same as Mahavatar Babaji, then the first of those two sub-sections should <i>also</i> be added back.</p>
<p>Also, to make the article more encyclopedic, "perennial yogic techniques called Hamsa Yoga and Mahavatar Babaji's Kriya Yoga" needs to be changed to "perennial yogic techniques that YGS calls Hamsa Yoga and Mahavatar Babaji's Kriya Yoga", since it's just him calling the techniques that.</p>
<p>And "culminated with a visionary experience in 1967 of Shiv-Goraksha-Babaji" should be changed to "culminated with a visionary experience in 1967 of a person he calls Shiv-Goraksha-Babaji." All of these suggestions and changes, I believe, make the article more encyclopedic. Thanks again, <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> <small><i><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPriyanath_7e03.html" title="User talk:Priyanath">talk</a></i></small> 02:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Evidence Ekajati (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log) is under a two month ban for sockpuppetry. Currently confirmed sockpuppets of Ekajati are Hanuman Das (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log), A Ramachandran (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log), and Tunnels of Set (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log). Hanuman Das changed his account name and was previously under the user name Adityanath (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log). While still under the Adityanath account, two accounts were found to be sockpuppets of the Adityanath account: Baba Louis (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log) and Chai Walla (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log). See here for findings.</p>
<p>Since Hanuman Das is a sockpuppet of Ekajati, then accounts found to be sockpuppets of Hanuman Das are therefore socks of Ekajati.</p>
<p>As of 1/29/2007, Chai Walla is working on Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath [1]. This means Ekajati is using this sock to evade the ban.</p>
<p>However there is also this: [2]. They claim the shared IP was because they were all using the same laptop on a trip together.[3] --Pigmantalk • contribs 03:57, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note: User:Ekajati is currently participating in the Starwood Arbcom case. Investigation into these allegations is also proceeding there.
