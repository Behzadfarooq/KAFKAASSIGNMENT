<p>Yes, that appears to the case-- this entry should be rewritten to confirm to normal copyright specs.</p>

<p>Huh wha...? To say "A Rose for Emily" is "strongly referenced" in that MCR song seems like more than a little stretch. "To The End" may have similiar themes but unless someone can show me where the band makes this connection, it seems pretty forced to me. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPariah23_961f.html" title="User:Pariah23">Pariah23</a> 21:46, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not think that Homer likes to look at men. During the time period that Faulkner was writing this story, the term "he liked men, and it was known that he drank with the younger men in the Elks' Club" does not always mean he was gay. It acually means that he liked to hang out with young men but did not have sexual relations with them, always remember the time period in which it is written.</p>

<p>I have several issues with this article.</p>
<p>1) Homer Barron is most certainly not gay,75.31.15.59 01:56, 25 January 2007 (UTC)I disagree with you because homer was meeting tobe at the back door and he meets emily at the front. This could resemble a sexual relationship between homer, tobe and emily which would make homer bisexual.Think about what it means when the author say s that they met at the back door which could resemble tobe taking one up the but. And also when he meets emily at the front door which resembles regular male female sex. and was never suspected to be. As said above, it is simply an expression that can be taken the wrong way in today's society. The statement in the story that gives this impression is only ment to say that he liked to drink with the guys and wanted to remain a bachelor in order to continue his partying. In fact, many picture him as being manly (or at least not feminine) due to his involvement in construction and his position as foreman.</p>
<p>2) If this article is to include the spolier (and I think it should, due to the fact that the main dispute over A Rose For Emily is in regard to the ending), the arguments and ideas about what actually happened should be included, as well as the generally accepted ideas. For example:</p>
<p>-It is accepted (even though it is not explicitly stated in the writing) that Emily poisoned Homer Barron.<br />
-It is also therefore conjectured, especially because he is described as "not the marrying type," that he would not marry her, which supplies her motive for the poisoning (keeping in mind that her family had a history of insanity, and that she wanted Homer to stay with her as her husband, whether he was alive or not).<br />
-Her response to her father's death (when women come to the door to give her their condolences, she sends them away saying "My father isn't dead.") foreshadows her actions involving Homer's corpse (denial of death, acting as though they had married and he was still alive).<br />
-Some (well, most) say that she had sexual relations with his corpse, which explains the gray hair found in the pillow next to it.<br />
-Some claim that she did not have sexual relations with the corpse, but slept next to it, as if he were still alive.<br />
-One very rare opinion is that she only lay with the corpse at death/shortly after death. This opinion is supported by the fact that they had to break into the room, and that it appeared as though it had not been disturbed for 40 years. However, there is some dispute as to whether she had gray hair at the time of his death or not.<br />

<p>I've just removed this: "Yet another theory is that the corpse is not Homer's at all, but rather that of Emily's long-deceased father. Daughters of domineering fathers may find it hard or even impossible to part from the paternal figure, and Emily may have wanted to preserve him, and not Homer, forever."</p>
<p>The story clearly states that her father was buried.</p>

<p>I'm a bit worried about the Civil War allegory given. It claims that Homer can be viewed as the South and Emily as the North, but then does not offer an explanation for why Homer was portrayed as a Northerner and Emily as a Southerner, which would contradict the allegory. Without any citation for the allegory, it's highly unbelievable. Citations for the other points in the article would also be nice. 129.2.194.197 03:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kudos, whoever you are. I was about to say the exact same thing, but you had beat me to it.</p>
