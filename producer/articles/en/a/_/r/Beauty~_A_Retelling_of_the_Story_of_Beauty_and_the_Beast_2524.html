<p>Honour is the youngest daughter of Mr. Huston, a widower, and believes that she was the ugliest, most expendable of her father's three daughters: Grace, Hope, and Honour respectively. Not understanding the appeal of her name, she declares that she'd rather have a name like Beauty and her nickname sticks -- even when she grows up to have oversized feet and big, bulky hands. When her father's shipping company goes bankrupt and her older sister Grace's fianc√© is presumed dead, the small family has an auction to sell off a majority of their luxurious belongings.</p>
<p>Gervain, the local blacksmith and the object of Hope's affection, visits and offers Mr. Huston a very gracious deal. He admits that he wants to marry Hope, and that if they threw their fortunes together they could afford a house in Gervain's hometown. Gervain also mentions that his aunt would tidy it up for them and have it ready by the time they arrived. The family agrees and they pack to leave. Before they do though, a young man named Tom Brady comes to give Beauty her riding horse. She initially refuses, but Tom tells her that "he'll only do what you tell him to" so she keeps Greatheart with her. A week and five days after the auction, they leave the city and head for Blue Hill. When they arrive, the owner of the Red Griffin inn and Ger's aunt, Melinda Honeybourne, greets them warmly and shows them around. The house faces a huge forest and a clear stream runs through the black woods near their home. While life is hard for the pampered family, the girls do not complain. After a time, they are welcomed into the Blue Hill community, and Beauty finds a place for herself and her horse, Greatheart.</p>
<p>One particular day though, Ger catches Beauty collecting deadwood in the forest and chastises her. He expresses his embarrassment at believing in magic but says that the forest is enchanted, "not haunted". Ger also says the stream is enchanted, since it flows from it. He tells her of a castle and a garden in the heart of the woods that contains a vicious monster. The monster, he says, was a man once but committed crimes too terrible to say. Gervain makes Beauty promise not to enter it again. But she does drink the water, as a way of disregard. Eventually Hope and Gervain's wedding day comes and the entire town is invited. Beauty also meets a boy named Ferdy, an apprentice blacksmith who shows interest in her but her no interest in him.</p>

<p>Ten months to the day of Hope and Gervain's wedding, Hope had twins: a girl, Mercy, the name of her late sister; and a boy, Richard. But when her family receives news that one of her father's ships presumed lost at sea has returned, Mr. Huston must go to the city and take care of the resulting business. When asked to bring anything back, Hope jokingly says to bring ropes of pearls and rubies for their next meeting with the King and Queen. Beauty notices that her father is hurt by this and in seclusion, she asks him to bring her rose seeds so that they can have a garden. He agrees to this and leaves. On the way home he finds himself desperately lost in a snowstorm and then in the castle of a seemingly absent sorcerer. He grudgingly accepts the castle's hospitality and leaves, but not before taking a single red rose for Beauty. An angry Beast appears, enraged at his current violation of hospitality. He leaves Mr. Huston with a choice. He must either return to the castle in a month's time to die or let one of his daughters come in his stead to live peacefully, unharmed. Beauty's father brings back this fateful news along with the rose, which the family soon discovers is actually enchanted gold. Seeing as how Grace was already traumatized by the loss of her husband, her father and the rest of the family decided against her going. Hope was a mother and could not be lost. Beauty courageously decides to go, and reluctantly her father says that she can. In one month, she would be called for, and the rose which Mr. Huston stole was the time teller. Along with the rose, the saddlebags that he brought along with him are filled with gold, silver, copper and brass coins; earrings of garnet and ruby, bottles of brandy, and other expensive things. Grace and Hope each receive a box of golden necklaces and ropes of pearls and diamonds, and for Beauty: rose seeds. Later that night, Beauty tips out the contents of the box and finds a golden griffin ring with diamond fangs. She dons it and finds her and it inseparable.</p>

<p>Beauty plants her roses in the hopes of seeing them grow before she leaves, and miraculously there would be entire vines of them encircling the house before her departure. The family has agreed to tell all the village folk that Beauty had been called away to live with her aunt in the city. After the promised month, Beauty leaves with her trusty steed, Greatheart for the castle. Finding it is easy: all they have to do is get lost in the enchanted forest and they would be in the presence of the towering citadel. Beauty eventually comes upon the castle and is instantly amazed at the splendor it displays. The gardens are very large and there is a giant hedge surrounding the grounds. It is here that she notices the wall of roses and where her father met the Beast. After placing Greatheart in a stable(whose doors open on approach), Beauty heads to the main doors. Across the silver arch of the doors is an elaborate carving which begins to move. The figures come to life and tell a silent story. A hunting party can be seen riding through the country until they reach the forest. For an inexplicable reason, all refuse to enter it. This might have been a clue as to what occupied the dark woods. As Beauty walks around the castle, she notices a presence in the form of a breeze and hears whispering. When she tries to listen however, the voices still. After more meandering, she finds the dining hall and is treated exquisitely to dinner by the enchanted dinner objects.</p>
<p>She finishes dinner and walks around for hours before discovering her room, which bears the plaque "Beauty's Room". It, too, is elegant and magnificently kept. The breeze returns to Beauty and bathes and dresses her. She then walks down the corridor until she finds a room with a door partly open and enters it. In the room is a large fireplace with two chairs sitting before it: one is empty and in the other looms a bulking shadow. She recognizes this to be the Beast and is frightened as he says hello to her. The Beast then asks her if she came of her free will and she replies in assent. Surprised by her honesty and courage, he tells her that her stay was meaningless and that if her father had only returned to him alone, he would've let him go. Beauty cries in disbelief that she went there for nothing but the Beast replies that if she hadn't, then she would've become so ashamed of herself that she would grow to hate her father. Beauty then asks the Beast if he can see the future, and he says that he cannot see the future but that he can see her. Beauty retorts in a timid way that she cannot see him, and so the Beast stands up. Immediately she is overwhelmed by the tenacity of him and is unnerved by his staring. He apologizes for it but says that he's short-sighted and wants to see her up close.</p>
<p>Beauty asks the Beast if he wants to eat her, but the Beast is revolted at the thought and assures her that he would not harm her in any way. He also says that he is lonely and wanted a companion to be with. Coyly, Beauty admits that she is not fond of her nickname and doesn't think that it suits her. The Beast looks at her and says that it suits her very well, amused at her lack of self-confidence. After a while, he asks her her "real" name and she replies that it is Honour. He smiles and says that he welcomes both Beauty and Honour, then randomly asks if she wants to marry him. Horrified, Beauty says no and hurriedly bids him good night before she runs to her room. She dresses in her nightclothes but finds that she cannot sleep, so she decides to go visit Greatheart. However, the doors will not open and she hurts her hands trying to pry them open. Upset, she goes to bed but the breeze gently mends her hands while she sleeps and materializes into two female voices who seem to express pity for her.</p>
<p>Beauty eventually becomes accustomed to living in the castle, regularly taking Greatheart out for rides and strolling with the Beast during the day and sunsets. Constant though was the question of marrying the Beast. After every dinner, the Beast would ask her and every time Beauty would decline, though even she began to notice how much she grew to dislike hurting his feelings. She also yearns for her family and thinks of them often. In her spare time, she lays seeds out for birds(since she claims that even enchanted castles have birds). Beauty also regards the placid nature of the weather and how it never shows a bit of cold or discomfiture. One day it rains and Beauty is disappointed by it.</p>
<p>The Beast visits her and she sadly mentions that it is raining, and the Beast says that even he cannot control the weather. He also adds in an apologetic note that it usually rains after nightfall. He knows that she takes rides with Greatheart around this hour. The Beast's concern for her shows in his every word, and Beauty takes notice. He then offers her a tour around the castle and Beauty agrees wholeheartedly. He first takes her to a portrait gallery, where she for the first time in the castle, sees art depicting human beings. She also notices a family resemblance which is especially prominent among the males: brown-haired and brown-eyed and a grim smile. Though no man in that portrait compares to the one she sees in the last painting. It showed a handsome younger man with curls of brown hair and arrogance shining in his dark eyes. When the Beast asks Beauty what she thinks of the picture, she mentions that she thinks he died young. The Beast nods but says nothing, then takes her to the library.</p>
<p>Beauty is astonished as she sees bookshelves stretching from floor to ceiling. She approaches the nearest shelf and pulls out a book called The Complete Poems of Robert Browning. She rather haughtily says that she has never heard of him, nor <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes_3f94.html" title="The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudyard_Kipling_8a10.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. The Beast, who at this point is very amused with Beauty, states that nothing is wrong, but that the majority of his books haven't been written yet. After this brief interlude, Beauty goes to take Greatheart out since the rain cleared up. The Beast says that he'd see her in the evening, but Beauty begs him to go with her. He quietly says that beasts, namely horses, were nervous around him, but he finally caves in. Greatheart throws a fit but Beauty steadily calms his nerves and chides him for being stubborn, and the Beast watches in amazement as Greatheart comes over to him. Shortly after this the Beast leaves, Beauty somewhat disappointed at this.</p>
<p>The first time that we learn of Beauty's affections for the Beast is when he fails to come read with her one particular day in the library. She finds him and scolds him for not coming, and he smiles before promising not to miss another reading session again. The second was during dinner when she offers him some of her dessert. The Beast shyly admits that he cannot use a knife and fork but Beauty boldly replies that he doesn't have to and comes around the table to feed him some. He says that it is good and she returns to his side to feed him some more. He laughs and says that it will probably disagree with him, which makes Beauty laugh and the tension between them break. Once again though the Beast asks Beauty to marry him, and she answers this time that she wishes that he would not ask her because she cannot marry him but she cannot stand to hurt him like this every time. He darkly replies that he has no choice and knocks over a wine bottle. Beauty worriedly asks if he is alright and he says that it is nothing but that he is a fool. He leaves the room and Beauty alike.</p>
<p>The next morning, Beauty carried out her daily routine of horseback riding and walking in the garden with the Beast. The previous night, Beauty had dreamed of her family: Hope and Grace, and the little babies, and most of all, the gorgeous roses that covered the wall of the house. This made Beauty upset and the Beast worry about her. He asks her several times if she is alright, but she replies with empty assurance. Beauty does not mention the source of her anguish because she does not want to hurt the Beast by asking to return. Eventually at dinner she tells him that she misses her family, and the Beast asks her sadly if she would leave him. She wants to know how her family is but if she could return to him. To her surprise and dismay, the Beast refuses to let her go. Beauty realizes that she could be trapped inside the castle forever and runs to the door, trying to leave but she ends up fainting.</p>
<p>Beauty slowly regains consciousness in the Beast's arms, immediately letting go of him and pushing herself away from him. He mentions hurtfully that she would not let him go when he tried to carry her so he was holding her. She bolts through the door of the drawing room up to her room and underwent a restless sleep. When she awakens she hears the voices, each one criticizing her in turn but expressing deep concern for her well-being. Beauty replies that she can hear them but they do not stop speaking. The voices begin to call each other Bessie and Lydia: Bessie being the mild-mannered one and Lydia, the more assertive one. As they fuss with Beauty's clothes, they talk about how angry a certain "he" was and how hard it was to tend to him last night. Beauty realizes that this was the reason for their absence last night and also that she might be the reason for his anger.</p>
<p>And throughout the day, Beauty begins to gain a sense of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perception.html" title="Perception">perception</a>, the ability to know and feel where the Beast was. While keeping him in her mind's eye Beauty apologizes to the Beast for her behaviour and he accepts. She then sees that he's below her window on the 1st story. He then asks if she is coming down for her usual walk(with him) in the garden and she says yes. He, her and Greatheart go for a walk and he explains that she is somewhat absorbing the enchantment. So in turn some of the rules that were not able to be broken have become broken, like the birds that visit her windowsill. Later for dinner, Bessie and Lydia try to dress Beauty in an impossibly extravagant gown, which she thinks she is too ugly to wear. Eventually they reduce her to tears for being so persistent, and the Beast gets angry to the two and yells at them. They leave promptly and allow Beauty to wear what she likes. As the Beast asks her to accompany him downstairs, Beauty asks in answer to his question whether he would offer her his arm. He does, and they descend.</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autumn.html" title="Autumn">autumn</a> approaches, Beauty learns just how much she cares for the Beast. When he asks her to marry her, she is not all that willing to say no. One night, she dreams a dream of her family so vivid that it almost moves her to tears. When she encounters the Beast, he greets her with a good morning and she does the same, not meaning to let him know about the dream. When he asks whether it was about her family, she agrees. He also mentions that he sends her family dreams to comfort them. Beauty inquires as to how he knows, and the Beast replies that he can see them. He takes her to the room that he was in the first night that he met her and pours out the contents of a glass on the mantelpiece. The pool of liquid slowly clears and shows Beauty her family. She learns of her sister Grace's reluctant plans to marry the minister, and that her fianc√© is actually alive in the city which they left. Beauty pleads with the Beast to let her go, for she couldn't bear to see Grace live her life in unneeded <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misery.html" title="Misery">misery</a>. The Beast gives her a rose to remember the time by and tells her to wear her ring so that she would not forget him. To Beauty's sadness, he also says that as the rose dies, he dies with it. One week he allows her, and she packs hastily, mounts Greatheart and rides home.</p>
<p>She arrives home and Hope greets her first, then Mercy and Richard and finally her father, Gervain, and Grace. Her family graciously fills her in on all that has happened in the six months that she has been gone. Beauty in turn tells her family the nature of the conditions that she lives under at the castle. She knew that it would be unfair not to mention the Beast's kindness toward her but also knew that from her family's viewpoint, it would be hard to locate any kindness in the Beast and his actions. In her saddle-bags are exquisite clothes and jewelry for the family, and Beauty lovingly thanks the Beast in secret. She decides that it would be too much, too soon to tell Grace of her husband and so she waits. The kind village people occasionally stop in to see how she is, and she begins to realize how big her family truly has gotten. On the third day of her stay, Beauty confesses to Grace why she has really come home. She tells her of her husband, Robbie Tucker, and that he is still alive. Her father somewhat doubts this for the same reason that he doubts the Beast: the fear of the unknown. Ger also knows that the source of her information was magic but he doesn't comment. He mentions a man by the name of Callaway who is going to the city shortly and that they could give him a message to take to Robbie. Grace agrees to write him also and the next day, Callaway leaves with Grace's and Mr. Huston's letters. On the sixth night, Beauty says that she wants to leave, but her family persuades her to wait out the full week. She reluctantly stays but finds that her dreams were invaded with visions of the castle and the Beast, who was nowhere to be found. Later that evening, not a word was spoken, for by the next morning, Beauty would be gone. Once again her dreams were of the enchanted castle, but this time the Beast in her dream was dead. As she looks into the bowl of water, she saw that it was quickly dying.</p>
<p>Riding Greatheart, Beauty desperately scours the forest for the road that led to the enchanted forest. But it was nowhere to be found. Eventually <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twilight.html" title="Twilight">twilight</a> comes and they are still no closer to having found the enchanted castle, twelve hours already passed. As they search by moonlight, a faint line of gray appears, the road which leads up to the enormous silver gates of the castle. The magic however is unapparent, and everything which used to be opened with magic now had to be opened by hand. Beauty hurriedly places Greatheart in his stable and runs inside the great front doors. She can't find the Beast anywhere, searching through thousands of room and finding no sign of him.</p>
<p>She comes at last to the room where she first met him and sees him sitting, motionless, in the same chair that she had left him in. Beauty weeps as she kneels by the side of the chair and finds herself helpless. She grabs his handkerchief and wets it, gently dabbing his face with it and for the first calls him her love. The Beast wakes up slowly and sees her. He was afraid that Beauty had broken her promise, and she admits that she started on her journey later than she should've. Beauty then tried to stand but is too fatigued to withstand her balance and falls into his lap. He consolingly tells her to go rest and that she is safe at home now. Beauty replies that she has to tend to Greatheart but that there is something she has to tell him. Before she does though, Beauty asks what would've happened if she had not have returned. The Beast says without emotion that he indeed would've died and that the enchantment would have died slowly away with him. After this, Beauty confesses to the Beast that she loves him and that she wants to marry him.</p>
<p>All at once, the Beast disappears and there is the sound of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">cathedral</a> bells and cheering and the castle is filled with light. In the place of the Beast stands a man in golden velvet with brown eyes and curly brown hair which was slightly streaked with gray. Beauty does not recognize him and begins to go on a search for "her beast". The man tells her to wait, and as she turns to face him, Beauty realized that the man standing before her <i>is</i> her Beast. She also realizes that he is the young man from the portrait. Now he tells her the nature of the curse. The "Beast" came from a family that was overly <a href="../../../z/e/a/Zealous.html" title="Zealous">zealous</a> and proud, and the local magician grew so tired of them that he placed a curse of ugliness on every male. For them to return to human form, they had to find a maiden that would be willing to love them even for their beastly appearance.</p>
<p>Beauty then blurted out that she should not be the one marrying him because he is of <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a> and deserves much better. He takes her to a mirror and shows Beauty how beautiful she truly is. She does not recognize the beautiful red-headed, green-eyed girl in the mirror, but the "Beast" assures Beauty that it is her. He also informs her that her family will be coming and that the "things" in the castle would be "waking up", or returning to their human forms as well. Along with her family are hundreds of <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a> and the village. The "Beast" again asks Beauty to marry him, only this time she says yes, and he takes her into his arms and kisses her. They descend down the main staircase to hear the sounds of servants bustling around in the halls, and Beauty hears Lydia and Bessie. She admits all of the details of the conversations that the two had and how they spoke of "it". Beauty also mentions the difference of their taste in dresses, and the "Beast" asks her with a smile if she was wearing the dress that she refused to leave the room in. She says yes and they laugh. Beauty then comments that she does not even know the name of her groom, and he admits that he does not remember, but that she can name him. And Beauty and the Beast leave the hall to welcome her family and her friends, a cheer sounding out as they walk outside arm in arm.</p>
