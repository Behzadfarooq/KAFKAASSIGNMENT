<p>"A Rose for Emily" recounts the story of an eccentric spinster, Emily Grierson. An unnamed narrator details the strange circumstances of Emily’s life and her odd relationships with her father, who controlled and manipulated her, and her lover, the Yankee road worker Homer Barron. When Homer Barron threatens to leave her, she is seen buying arsenic, which the townspeople believe she will commit suicide with. After this, Homer Barron is not heard from again, and is assumed to have returned north. Though she does not commit suicide, the townspeople of Jefferson continue to gossip about her and her eccentricities, citing her family's history of mental illness. She is heard from less and less, and rarely ever leaves her home. Unbeknownst to the townspeople until her death, in her upstairs room she hides all day with the corpse of Homer Barron, which explains the horrid stench that emits from Miss Emily's house.</p>
<p>The story’s complexities have inspired critics while casual readers found the work one of Faulkner’s most accessible (and shortest) works. The popularity of the story was due in no small part to its gruesome ending.</p>
<p>The story explores many themes, including the society of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">South</a> at that time, the role of women in the South, and extreme <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychosis.html" title="Psychosis">psychosis</a>.</p>
<p>In the story, the townspeople's points of views on Emily actually reflect the society's value at that moment to some extent. Although the townspeople don't have direct contact with Emily, their views on her and her family greatly affect her life. Their praises and admiration influence her father to keep her sheltered longer than she actually needs to be. Her father controls her thoughts and lifestyle. Emily feels that she is released when her father is dead. She dives into love with Homer and neglects people's judgments on her. When she realizes that Homer intends to leave her again, she makes sure that he would always be with her, whether he is alive or not. In his death Emily finds eternal love which is something no one could ever take away from her.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2) There are many arguments and ideas about what actually happened. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is accepted (even though it is not explicitly stated in the writing) that Emily poisoned Homer Barron (using the rat poison bought earlier in the story).</li>
<li>It is also therefore conjectured, especially because he is described as "not the marrying type," that he would not marry her, which supplies her motive for the poisoning (keeping in mind that her family had a history of insanity, and that she wanted Homer to stay with her as her husband, whether he was alive or not).</li>
<li>Emily is not insane. The traditions of the South, which consisted of severely limited roles for women, especially of Emily's upper class status, are represented by the narrator, townspeople, and her father. Emily's murder of Homer was a sane act which allowed her to finally take something for herself. There is indeed doubt about her sanity, yet the townspeople use this doubt as an excuse to relieve themselves of responsibility.</li>
<li>Her response to her father's death (when women come to the door to give their condolences, she sends them away saying that her father was not dead.) foreshadows her actions involving Homer's corpse (denial of death, acting as though they had married and he was still alive).</li>
<li>Another explanation is that the town's older males, in order to preserve Old South ideals of a woman's dignity, were complicit in the murder and chiefly responsible for the cover-up.</li>
<li>Some say that she had sexual relations with his corpse, which explains the gray hair found in the pillow next to it. Others argue that she did not have sexual relations with the corpse, but slept next to it, as if he were still alive.</li>
<li>One very rare opinion is that she only lay with the corpse at death/shortly before death. This opinion is supported by the fact that they had to break into the room, and that it appeared as though it had not been disturbed for 40 years. However, it seems to be clear that her hair began to turn gray after Homer's disappearance.</li>
<li>It is possible that Tobe, Emily's Negro servant, is the murderer. He has been Emily's only companion for decades, served her humbly and thoroughly, and upon learning that Homer would not marry her and was going to leave her, he may have killed him so he would "stay" with her. This would also explain the title of the story: after receiving flowers, and especially roses, they are left to desiccate so they can be preserved. In this context, Homer would be Tobe's "rose for Emily," that the woman, indeed insane, more or less gladly accepted. This is also supported by the first paragraph of the short story where we are told that Tobe is "a combined gardener and cook," so he may have been the one to use the poison in the cooking to kill Homer Barron.</li>
<li>There has also been speculations that the title "A Rose for Emily" could be a dedication to the south. That "Emily" is the south and won't give up her "ways" that even though she should. An example of this is when she says her father isn't dead and also that she won't pay her taxes. The "taxes" example is one of great value, because "Emily" or the "South" won't change her way, and is very stubborn with not changing.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) The name 'Homer' is similar to the word 'homosexual', which many people speculate to be the character's sexual orientation. He may have been deliberately named Homer, making reference to the common misspelling of 'homersexual'. Also, it should be noted that within the text it says Homer "prefers the company of men" and is also (as previously stated) "not the marrying type." which support the possibility of Homer being homosexual.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/r/A_Rose_for_Emily_4e27.html" title="Edit section: As an Allegory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">As an Allegory</span></h2>
<p>A Rose for Emily can be read as an allegory for the Civil War, and the relationship between the North and the South afterwards. Homer says he is leaving Emily. To keep him from doing so, Emily murders Homer. This describes the South's secession, and the North's military action and invasion. Like the South, Homer's reasons for leaving were not quite sound, but Emily's reaction is certainly not justified. Emily keeps Homer's rotting corpse in her house, which represents the North keeping the South as part of the country, but the South is economically and morally devastated from the North's actions (in the story, Homer's death at Emily's hands). The main point of the allegory is Emily's . This would represent the North's exploitation (particularly economically) of the South decades after the South had been "killed". To understand this, one must keep in mind that in the twenties and thirties, when the story was written, the South was still significantly poorer and less stable than the North, so the effects of the Civil War could still be seen, and Southerners felt that they were still being exploited. Though the North's prosperity and stability are lessened by the Great Depression and crime during Prohibition, respectively (which could be represented by Emily's death), the South had been poor and unstable far longer, and was still poorer during the Depression, like Homer who had been dead for years.</p>
