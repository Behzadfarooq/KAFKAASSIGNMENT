<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction to Article</span></h2>
<p>The fact that "A Course in Miracles" is sometimes referred to as "ACIM" or simply "The Course" is not original research. It is common knowledge for anyone who is at all familiar with ACIM. We are using these abbreviations in our discussions here. I have already posted this in these discussions and it was deleted. <b>Please do not delete or change discussion material posted by others.</b>--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 04:16, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All you are saying is that based on the opinion of several editors here on WP that the statement is true. That in itslef is pure original research by defintion. <s>I will mark the section disputed.</s> Consider the section disputed. Adding a tag would be confusing. Also keep in mind that the statement itself about "ACIM" is confusing since an equal statement could be made "Foundation for Inner Peace" is sometimes referred to as "ACIM" by the same reasoning as you suggest for the statement; i.e. original research. Ste4k 03:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a quote from another WP article: "The Internet (also known simply as the Net)..." <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Do you consider this OR as well? I and two other editors do not consider this OR. Once again, it is common knowledge for anyone who is at all familiar with ACIM. The "Foundation for Inner Peace" is not referred to as "ACIM", it is referred to as "FIP". I am finding your remarks and edits pedantic (unduly emphasizing minutiae) and obstructive. You have stated that you have little or no knowledge of ACIM. Perhaps your editing time would be better served in an area where you do have some knowledge?--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 04:16, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you'd like to go work on the other article, that's fine. It is up to you and/or the other editors to demonstrate that it is not OR, not up to me to remove OR from the article. As mentioned earlier, this is disputed. Please familiarize yourself with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>,<a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>,<a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>The problem is not the WP policies. The problem is that you are applying them in an obsessive manner that obstructs rather than advances the article. Your use of these policies is to carry them to the extreme. Once again, look at these articles as two examples: <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 14:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ste4k keeps bringing up the notability of this and other ACIM articles. I think it helps to address the notability issue. Ste4k did not object and thought it was fine as long as it was part of her stub article. I hope you do not mind but I am going to revert. If we cannot even come to agreement on this simple introduction I do not see how the more complex issues can be resolved.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 04:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction of ACIM</span></h2>
<p>I see that there was a very slight change in the title. It is slight but I think it needs to be reverted. This is not an introduction to the book. It is part of the book itself. It is therefore the introduction of the book.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 17:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Course Versions</span></h2>
<p>Please allow me to present some initial information on the formation of The Course and the three primary versions to the best of my ability. This can then act as a platform for discussion. The Course began as a cooperative venture between two well respected psychologists. Helen began to hear an inner voice. She called Bill and they both devoted much of their lives over many years to bring the "dictation" of this inner voice to paper. Most of the "dictation" was written by Helen in notebooks with her own style of shorthand. She then either typed it herself or read it to Bill who typed it. It appears that some of the material Helen spoke to Bill and he typed this directly.</p>
<p>The earliest typed version that is known to exist is called the Urtext. The Urtext itself appears to have been derived from at least three earlier typed versions. Some of this material may be lost to time. ACIM consists of three parts: Text, Workbook, and Manual for Teachers. The vast majority of differences are in the Text.</p>
<p>In the Urtext "the voice" designated Bill as the editor. In late 1972 Bill finished the editing of all three parts. The Text portion was found in the A.R.E. Library and has come to be known as the HLC (Hugh Lynn Cayce) version. This is perhaps a poor name as HLC had no known input to the material although he is mentioned in it. Bill added Chapter and Section breaks and deleted material.</p>
<p>In early 1973, I believe, Ken Wapnick was given a copy. He further edited the material to form the Criswell version and subsequently the FIP first edition often known as the "blue book". There may have been other variations involved. The second edition contains additional material and an outline numbering system which is still under a valid copyright.</p>
<p>Since then there are now multiple variations both in print and online that stem from these three primary versions.</p>
<p>Despite much sometimes heated debate, all three versions seem to contain the essential material of The Course. Some prefer one version and some use all three.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 18:55, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reading this book referenced in the article would be a start:</dd>

New York: Foundation for A Course in Miracles. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-933291-08-6</a>.

</dl>
<p>There appears to be confusion regarding versions of ACIM. I believe the article should address this in a short topic. I suggest this as a starting point:</p>
<hr />
<p>There are three primary versions of The Course. These are the Urtext, the HLC, and the FIP first edition. There are also multiple variations of these both written and "electronic". The Urtext is the earliest publicly known version. Within the Urtext <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">Dr. William Thetford</a> was the designated editor. The HLC is the version edited by Bill and completed in late 1972. He added the organization of the chapters and sections. Unfortunately, original material was removed. The FIP first edition was a further edit of the HLC by Ken Wapnick. Some material was changed and some was deleted. In addition, FIP released a second edition. This second edition includes additional material and an outline numbering system. The additional material and the outline numbering system remain under copyright.</p>
<hr />
<p>There has been a long discussion here on sourcing. Sourcing for this addition includes the works themselves as well as the already referenced "Absence from Felicity".--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 18:51, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You haven't mentioned any version from the Endeavor Academy at all. I suggest that you look at that article and check it for accuracy. Apparently it is pointing to this article on the premise that the version of "A Course in Miracles" written by Charles Anderson is directly related to these three versions. In my opinion, that link is ambiguous and misleading. If you disagree, then you might want to add the category cult to this article as it is listed in the other. Ste4k 03:38, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just noted your addition and although it reads well, etc. It is completely unsourced. I am removing it until such a time that you can <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">supply references</a>.

<p>The EA version is new. It is included in "There are also multiple variations of these both written and "electronic"." I see no point in this article in discussing all of the derivations from the three primary versions. If this is thought to be useful then a separate article can be written on this. I appreciate the complement about the addition reading well. The addition was sourced from the primary works and the existing references. Because there is confusion about these primary versions, I believe it is an important addition. I do not appreciate your removing it. If you wanted more source material you could simply have added a comment. It is beginning to appear to me that you simply wish to obstruct work on this article.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 04:39, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am incredibly concerned that, after the extensive discussion on this talk page about the importance of sources and general agreement that work should be done on the problems with the sourcing of the existing text that a new section was added that was completely unsourced. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=63897741&amp;oldid=63814110" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=63897741&amp;oldid=63814110" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> As if there aren't enough links to these policies on this page already: <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>Yes, it is difficult to come up with results based on a loaded poll with only two people voting, a "random" passerby and most of the editors who work on this page distracted by an RfC. You shouldn't have acted unilaterally to revert only 30 minutes after unprotection. The passerby's comments may apply to the version he was commenting on, but it is also an accurate descrption of the current version, which is unsourced and full of POV. Do you have a plan that has a realistic chance of fixing that? If not we should just do the page over, starting with research and then writing, with close citation. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 17:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came to this page looking for more information about this book and I'm really embasassed for Wikipedia after reading it. Considering how much discussion has taken place on the talk page, the article is <b>tiny</b> and extremely poorly written. The first sentence should at least give an idea of WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE.

<dd>Setting an artificial time limit is, IMO, unrealistic. The person who has written many of the ACIM articles reports that he is about to be married. It will take time. I do not think we need to be in a rush here, I think we need to get it right.</dd>

<dd>I have not been involved in a RfC before so I do not know how this compares to others. You had asked me about the references. I think (as has already been mentioned) they will be hard to come by. I think the various versions are primary sources. The Urtext has not been published in book form that I am aware of, only on the net. I think "Wapnick, Kenneth (Apr1991). Absence from Felicity. Foundation for a Course in Miracles. 0-933291-08-6." is an excellent source. Wapnick arrived on the scene shortly after the HLC version was finished. He is one of the few people still alive from the early days. In the stub article, Ste4k included one court document that I recall. When I tried to check its source I was taken to the court site for that district of NY. I did not see the pdf file. There are numerous court documents that would be good secondary sources. Do you know if they are online at the NY court site?</dd>

<dd>Yes. We should make it clear how anything we say is either cited or follows very trivially from simple laws of logic. Afterall, other articles don't have to cite extremely basic laws of logic to back up what they say. Logic is taken for granted. I say we take logic for granted here as well. In that case, we will need to cite and reference that ACIM <i>does actually</i> say that its fundemental doctrine is that only what is coherent is real. Everything else will either be a simple corollary, or be cited. A lot of this article follows via trivial logical laws, but what doesn't should be removed. That way, there won't be original research, and the article will be compliant. This appears to be a small task, however. Most of the article follows from very simple logic, and repeats itself many many times. According to <a href="../../../a/b/u/Wikipedia%7EAbundance_and_redundancy_0089.html" title="Wikipedia:Abundance and redundancy">Wikipedia:Abundance_and_redundancy</a>, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Can anyone make the argument that our repeating ourselves so many times is bad? If not, I don't know what many editors are talking about when they carry on about original research. In most cases, if you show me were it is, I'll show you how it is a trivial corollary of what has already been said, and if you dispute it, you must dispute the original cited principle the Course endorses. But if you dispute it, you must dispute that the source doesn't actually say what it says, and that's why we have references, so you can look it up yourself. Alright! Does everyone understand now? I did recently vote to keep original research in this article but now I see that Wikipedia can't allow this. Fortuanatly, almost none of it is original research. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 23:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough ... apply the guideline to sections then, which seems natural. Material from different sections may overlap, and this should be okay. This will also explain our article's length to some extent. And I agree, an article in an encylopedia should contain just enough information to allow the reader to understand the cited point. It's natural to dedicate an uncited sentence to explaining an obvious point, which despite its obviousness, some miss anyway. Sometimes it takes a number of sentences to make the material further accessable, even though the point explained might be considered obvious. Surely WP should be very very accessable, though, and so it may take a great many sentences to say the same thing enough times in enough ways to get everyone onboard, and yet none of it would be original research because it is saying the same thing in different ways. None of it is new or original. None of it would be unique synthesis or analysis or new ideas, statements, or concepts. What would be the point of an article on ACIM if it was not accessable enough to get most people onboard with the one <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_priori.html" title="A priori">a priori</a> statement that is not even different in the first place, being a priori. If you are not agreeing, it must mean I need to write even more statements of the exact same nature, not fewer. Somehow the audience is not understanding the (should be) cited point. An enclyclopedia should put cited points in context that they can be seen as coherent and understandable, and yet we are still not one in our understanding. Ah, we must need more explanitory material. Original research would just make new points to add to the confusion and would be totally counterproductive. How could we hope to understand one point if I kept adding new ones? That's why we have to stick to a single point, as most of the article (which to you might seem uncited for your thinking they are new points) does. The point is that they are not new points. That's the point. Are you seeing now how your claim that much of the article is original research is making much of the article look like original research to you?

<dd>Your response to my point about not repeating things was itself repetitive. Perhaps this was intended as a joke&#160;;-)? Anyway,
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../a/b/u/Wikipedia%7EAbundance_and_redundancy_0089.html" title="Wikipedia:Abundance and redundancy">Wikipedia:Abundance_and_redundancy</a> says that <i>articles</i>, not different sections of the same article, can "overlap" in terms of the information they provide. Per general rules of good writing, the same article should not repeat itself. Remember, the reader of an encyclopedia article doesn't want to read the same information over and over again. A well-written article will convey information clearly and concisely.</li>
<li>The point of the article shouldn't be to "get everybody on board" with ACIM, but to explain its beliefs and impact. It's an encyclopedia article, not a tract. (Now I'm repeating myself.)</li>
<li>Any "further explanation" of a cited point should come from other sources. Surely, there have been books explaining all this.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I am happy to see you working on the article. Perhaps you and other ACIM students could work on explaining ACIM beliefs (in line with <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> of course) while the rest of us could start on secondary source material to discuss the movement's history/impact? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 00:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>On point 1</i>, you are right that a section is not an article. I was appealing to the <i>motive</i> for the guideline, rather than the guideline itself. Hopefully we would anticipate how particular instances of something could be generalized. If the rule is that twice twenty apples is forty apples, hopefully we could also say that twice twenty apple slices is forty apple slices without dispute that the rule strictly has to do with whole apples. Yes, it says apples and not apple slices. Now I'm going to generalize appropriately, noting that the rules that apply to a good article apply to a good section. However, I think we will notice that this is not important to make my overall point. Tell me if I'm wrong, but you are thinking that how dare I use guidelines misleadingly to promote a viewpoint. It is good that that is not what I am doing, because I don't like to see them misused either. <i>Again on point 1</i>, if it were true that the reader of an encyclopedia did not want to read the same information in more than one way, an encylopedia would have no use for analogies, cross-referencing, examples, or other material used to disambiguate and sharpen what is being said. Although the explanitory material is repetitive, that does not mean it does not serve a clear function. A sharp idea has multiple associations with other things, because that is what it means to understand something as I'm sure you can verify in your own experience. We agree that what serves no function to aid the understanding in an encyclopedia has no use, so it is good that this does not apply to much of what is said in this article. <i>On point 2</i>, you will discover upon inspection that I did not say that an encyclopedia article on ACIM should get everyone on board with ACIM, whatever that means for you. An encyclopedia article should get everyone on board with understanding the very beliefs and impacts you believe an encyclopedia should explain. It is good we agree. <i>On point 3</i>, you are thinking that when I talk about further explaination, that I am refering to original material because I am making new points. If I was making new points in my further explanations, I would certainly need additional sources. You will find that I have already said that I am not making any new points. If I can cite that all apples are fruits, I am not making a new point in explaining this by saying that if I had an apple, I would have a fruit. It is an immediate logical and evident consequence, yet you must be thinking that if I make such a claim, all immediate logical and evident consequences would be evident without mentioning them. If that was true, then everyone would find mathematics to be utterly easy and trivial, but this is not the case. <i>On your proposal,</i> I don't know what the difference is between an ACIM student and a non-ACIM student, so I don't know how you are coming to the conclusion that I am one, and that you are not. However, I will naturally help were I think help is wanting. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 02:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did not think you were being intentionally misleading, I was just disagreeing with your interpretation of the policy. We seem to be talking about some of these issues in the abstract. It could be more useful to talk about them in reference to specific passages in the article, when they come up. And I get your point about their being no distinction between an ACIM student and a non-ACIM student, because "ACIM is a required course," right.&#160;;-) I was suggesting that we might more efficiently use our time if people who are already familiar with the Course itself concentrate initially on the section on its teachings while those of us without such knowledge should start on the history and impact sections.

<dd>(edit conflict) Supposedly, the author worked from sources but just did not cite those sources. If people familiar with the teachings are able to go through and put in the correct citations, I'm inclined to let them do so. I've just gone over the article again and it appears that parts of it describe the basic teachings, albeit with titles like "unique aspects" and "comparisons." If this is true and they could be scrubbed of any OR synthesis, the material might be acceptable in a "Beliefs" section. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 23:14, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I have studied the article in some detail. I have to concur with Guy that at least some and perhaps most of it is not appropriate for inclusion in an encyclopedia. No comment on its general quality, you understand. I have looked around a bit and think there is sufficient secondary source material to write an article on this subject. The article should focus on the beliefs of ACIM and its history and impact. The current version of the article reads more like a recruitment tool, inviting people who may be interested in one of the ACIM organizations to "refer to the external links below." Religions have every right to prozelytize and there's nothing wrong with that. But it's just not appropriate for an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 23:14, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The book itself is not a collection of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">Doctrine</a> (Where are the sources and citing? Should this article be marked as OR?). The book is about transformation. It is about transformation so that we realize the truth or the reality of our own nature or identity as well as the truth or reality of all that is.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Several Concerns Before Proceeding</span></h2>
<p>I have several concerns before proceeding:</p>
<p>1. If we assume good faith on the part of the original author, all of the material in the article is in the cited sources. I have learned that it is much easier to destroy rather than create. All it seems to take is one editor to come along to destroy the article without even obtaining the cited sources. Are the books already cited acceptable to WP? If they are, why should I spend the time and money to buy the books to verify/improve the article only to have it destroyed again by a single editor in the future?</p>
<p>2. If I decided to buy the references and improve the article, I will need help. I do not understand the WP citing system at this point.</p>
<p>3. To my knowledge, there are two major authors that write on the material in ACIM itself. These are Wapnick (FACIM) and Perry (Circle of Atonement). I have not checked but I suspect that they have written books on an introduction to ACIM. Would these be acceptable to WP?</p>

<dd>You raise some valid concerns. My best advice is to read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and make your own judgements on how you think it applies to a source. However, I can give you my thoughts. On point one, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is usually applied to conversations between editors on talk pages. I have never heard it suggested that it should replace <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Somewhat inconveniently, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> does specifically cover what is and is not considered a reliable source in articles about religious subjects. Generally, I would think that books or other sources published by the religious organization itself are reliable sources as to what beliefs the organization promotes or teaches. Also, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published_sources</a> would seem to apply, so anything self-published could be relied on for information about history and impact, but the material would have to be treated cautiously and preferrably verified by independent sources. Some of the sources seem independent and a few seem critical. Independent sources are the best, but someone with a personal bias is less reliable than someone who simply looked at the available material and made an independent judgement. If a biased source is used, its assertions may have to be qualified. However, for all I know, the critical sources are simply people who looked at ACIM (or religion in general) and didn't like what they saw. To respond to your further concerns under point one, I have found that it is generally difficult to remove material that is well-cited. The reason that material in previous versions of the article (and related merged articles) was vulnerable was that it was not cited. As to point two, I would advise putting your sources in parentheses in the text. This is acceptable under <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or any editor can make a references section if he or she desires using these cites. On point three, I think these would be great resources for the section on ACIM beliefs. I hope that this has been helpful. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 23:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have ordered several books about ACIM so that I can help with the citing. I am waiting for these. I have not compared the two sections. It seems that the Highlights section should focus on ACIM and the Comparison with Christianity focus on that. It seems there may be some overlap but I do not see this as a problem. Although ACIM has elements of philosophy, psychology, and theology; I believe it is primarily about transformation. I am in a holding pattern until the books arrive.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 18:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I see it, ACIM includes elements of theology, psychology, and philosophy. Ultimately these work together toward its goals of psycho-spiritual transformation. ACIM is teaching us to perceive in a completely different way. I wonder if we need to do some re-writing to address all 4 aspects of ACIM in different sections? The comparison with Christianity would fall within the Theology section.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 18:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the surface this looks like a good idea. I'd like to know more about what you have in mind when you mention Psychology and Philosophy and Psycho-spiritual transformation, and how parts of the current article would fall into these categories. For example, I'm not sure what content could fall into the area of psychology, as opposed to the others, and I'm not sure how philosophy can be distinguished from psycho-spiritual transformation. I take the division to mean that you will compare aspects of ACIM to various philosophies/movements in the philosophy section, but when you arrive at psy-trans, what you have left will still be theology, philosophy, and perhaps psychology, but perhaps at a more abstract level. And what can we say then that won't fall back into these other categories?<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 23:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Before I begin, thanks for fixing the references!</dd>
<dd>This is just a thought. It was brought about by several factors including your comments. The reference books will probably not arrive for 7-10 days and then I need to read them. Whatever is written must not be OR. From reading what people have written here, I get the impression that those not familiar with ACIM think it is a book of theology that is just supposed to be believed. It does have its theological elements but the reader is not asked to accept them on faith. I think the psychological elements are centered around the nature of the ego and how it uses attack, fear, anger, guilt, and projection to maintain our perception of separation. The philosophy section can be brief as ACIM does present reality as mentalistic monism. I think the heart of ACIM is its transformative aspects. This combines the theology and psychology presented in the Text with the lessons of the Workbook to transform our perception of the world. Does this help?--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 00:09, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critical reviews - Negative</span></h2>
<p>I see there is some interest in this section. I have not progressed this far in the article yet but will move my research to this area. Perhaps best to begin with:</p>
<p><a name="Cult_allegations" id="Cult_allegations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Cult allegations</span></h3>
<p>I think the first place to start is to examine the source: <i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power</i> by Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad. One reviewer at Amazon notes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"there are some real problems here. Kramer &amp; Alstad don't document a single thing they say, other than to refer to their other equally undocumented essays. Thus, ironically, this screed against authoritarianism must be accepted as the raw authoritarian assertion of the authors' views. It functions just like the type of revelation they condemn."</dd>
<dd>"I'm not convinced they understand the inner spiritual and moral dynamics of either Buddhism or Christianity as well as they try to make themselves appear to ... I felt that at many points Kramer and Alstad were dealing in the fantasies of their own stereotypes and straw persons about these beliefs. They don't seem as widely read as they claim..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Patrick Miller in <i>The Complete Story of the Course</i> also states that the Kramer &amp; Alstad book is not sourced. When Miller attempted to contact Kramer &amp; Alstad about their writing he received a letter from Alstad that included:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"we are not interested in involving ourselves in a dialogue about the value of <i>A Course in Miracles</i>."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I conclude that <i>The Guru Papers</i> is not a reliable source.</p>
<p>If we turn to the Course itself the Preface states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It [the Course] is not intended to become the basis for another cult. Its only purpose is to provide a way in which some people will be able to find their own Internal Teacher."</dd>
<dd>"At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher."</dd>

<p>The remaining source is Miller's <i>The Complete Story of the Course</i>. In this book Miller devotes two chapters to Negative reviews. The first chapter is focused on comments from traditional Christianity. To sum up this chapter there are differences in the theology of traditional Christianity vs. ACIM. Miller quotes this passage from ACIM, however:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"All terms are potentially controversial, and those who seek controversy will find it. Yet those who seek clarification will find it as well. They must, however, be willing to overlook controversy, recognizing that it is a defense against truth in the form of a delaying maneuver. Theological considerations as such are necessarily controversial, since they depend on belief and can therefore be accepted or rejected. A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed. Here alone consistency becomes possible because here alone uncertainty ends."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Miller's second chapter discusses criticism from "anti-authoritarian thinkers." He states that "these critics have apparently conducted far less through analysis and are unwilling to discuss their published conclusions." After studying the chapter in detail I could not find any valid negative reviews. Miller concludes by writing, however:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"we still lack any exhaustive, reasonably impartial assessments of the quality of this new guide to transformation."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suspect this is perhaps true of any spiritual path. I will therefore remove the other unsourced material from the article.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 17:58, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a new source. I wonder if we could have some discussion on whether it is a reliable source per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. The article is not entirely factually correct. It seems to be just the personal opinion of the author. The author seems to wish ACIM to conform to facts as used in science. The subject of religion/spirituality, perception, emotions, as well as many arts, do not fall within the realm of science. A quote from Albert Einstein: "The most beautiful and most profound experience is the sensation of the mystical."</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">Brainwashing</a> article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Brainwashing, also known as thought reform or re-education, is the application of coercive techniques to change the beliefs or behavior of one or more people usually for political or religious purposes. Whether any techniques at all exist that will actually work to change thought and behavior to the degree that the term "brainwashing" connotes is a controversial and at times hotly debated question."</dd>
</dl>
<p>ACIM is not coercive. One choses it or not. The article raises the question as to whether "brainwashing" even works.</p>
<p>I do not think it is a reliable source. What do others think?<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 12:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have been editing the section "negative criticisms". The citation that "many see it as brainwashing" is a very generalized statement that could (though should not) appear in a criticism of any or all faiths or spiritual disciplines. Negative criticisms of the Course should be relegated to thoughtful discourse regarding the content of the material or ways it is practiced, not blanket rejections by the religious. My recollection is that K. Wapnick (not a fan) and a priest co-wrote a book wherein they discourse regarding the differences between differences between Christianity and ACIM. Might such a book provide insightful criticisms of the Course that would befit this section of the article? - Joe091174 ...p.s. I'm very new at wiki editing, posting, etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that "many see it as brainwashing" is not supported by the citation. The citation is the POV of one person who makes at least one factually incorrect statement elsewhere in the "article". He says it is brainwashing because people are asked to repeat thoughts. The citation points out that this is how children learn. Adults learn by repetition too. The citation seems to be saying that learning by repetition is brainwashing. This is not meaningful. I will remove it based on all of these comments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am fairly new to WP editing too and am trying to learn how to do it better. The discussion between Wapnick and the priest is summarized in the Miller book. It and other comments in the Miller book are the basis of the one valid negative criticism: the theology of ACIM and traditional Christianity differ. The book may be helpful in the theology section of the article. I have ordered 4 or 5 of the book references in order to try to improve the article. Do you have the Wapnick book? I might order it as well to try to better reference the theology section. Please let me know what you think of the book and/or use it to improve the theology section.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 17:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critical Reviews - Negative - "defenders of the faith"</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be some controversy regarding <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_apologetics.html" title="Christian apologetics">Christian apologetics</a> or "defenders of the faith". Miller in his book devotes an entire chapter to this subject. The chapter discusses how some of the theology of ACIM differs from that of traditional Christianity. In that chapter the word "apologetics" is defined by the author:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The word apologetics is a theologic term meaning "defense of the faith"."</dd>
</dl>
<p>We seem to have a bit of a problem here as I do not think that definition is used at WP <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_apologetics.html" title="Christian apologetics">Christian apologetics</a>.</p>
<p>My dictionary defines the term "apologetic" as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) offered in defense or vindication *the apologetic writings of the early Christians*</dd>
<dd>2) offered by way of excuse or apology *an apologetic smile*</dd>
<dd>3) regretfully acknowledging fault or failure &#160;: CONTRITE *replied in an apologetic tone*</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first definition seems to fit.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2005/carddulles_intervw_july05.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2005/carddulles_intervw_july05.asp" rel="nofollow">this article</a> it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Making the case for the Christian faith—apologetics—has always been part of the Church's mission. Yet Christians sometimes have had different approaches to defending the faith..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It appears to me that Miller is using the term to describe those who defend or protect the theology of traditional Christianity. Since we are using this author's book as the source I think we should defer to his definition. Perhaps the wikilink should not be used as it sends the reader into an article that is distracting to the point being made.</p>

<p>After studying the WP article <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_apologetics.html" title="Christian apologetics">Christian apologetics</a>, it does include the definition being used here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the <b>Doctrinal Christian apologetics</b> section it states "In this type of apologetics, various Christian doctrines are defended...".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is there a way we can change the wikilink to point to this section? I will play with it.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 13:15, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The question seems to be once again the approrpiateness of including Christian apologetics as criticism of the Course. The reason I would argue it is inappropriate is because the Course is not an attempt to revise, reedit or stake claim to Christianity. (reference?) The Course is a different path altogether. As I argued earlier, Christian apologetics belongs no more in a critical assessment of the Course than it does in criticizing Islam, Church of Latter Day Saints, or any other belief system. The Course's use of "Christian" terminology is the only commonality between the Course and the traditional faith and this merely speaks to the universality of the language and both paths' personifications of the historical figure, Jesus.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand your concern in that as far as the Course by itself, it is not a criticism. In reading the Course, it is Christian. ACIM is written in the first person with multiple references to the historical Jesus. Some of the theology is different from traditional Christianity. It is criticized by traditional Christians for both the theological differences and the authorship. I think that this is legitimate.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction to the article</span></h2>
<p>It now says: quote A Course in Miracles (ACIM), sometimes referred to as the Course, is a book of "spiritual psychotherapy" or spiritual transformation that has spawned a religious movement. It was co-written by Helen Schucman and William Thetford. It is asserted the actual origin was dictation from a divine source through a form of channeling that Helen Schucman referred to as inner dictation.</p>
<p>Since it was first released to the public between 1973 and 1975 over 1.5 million copies have sold worldwide in 15 different languages. [1] It is written in Christian terminology, but some of the teachings of the Course are inconsistent with commonly-accepted Christian beliefs. Forgiveness is its central teaching. The great majority of the book is now in the public domain. unquote</p>
<p>It should say:</p>
<p>quote A Course In Miracles (commonly abbreviated as: ACIM, sometimes referred to as the Course), in form is a self-study program in what might be called "spiritual psychotherapy, or spiritual transoformation. While the Course explicitly states that: "It is not intented to become the basis for another cult."(Preface p. viii), there can be little doubt that some are using the book in a way to form what appear to be new semi-religious movements. The book was produced in a collaboration by Dr. Helen Schucman and William Thetford, Ph.D. professors of psychology who worked at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons at the time of these events. Helen recorded the material in a process she referred to as "inner dictation," perhaps a form of what is commonly known as "channeling." Thetford assisted mostly by typing out Helen's shorthand notes as she read them out loud to him.</p>
<p>Since it was first published in 1976 it has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide in 15 different languages. [1] The Course uses Christian terminology in numerous instances, but provides explanation of such terminology which is not in line with main stream Christian terminology. Forgiveness is the central teaching. Due to a recent court ruling, an early version of the Course, which was circulated in a small circle without a copyright claim, is now considered to be in the public domain, but the present second edition from the original publishers, which is commonly known as "the Course" is not as such, because subsequent corrections and enhancements were satisfactorily protected by copyright. unquote</p>
<p>My suggested correction here conveys the same information, with the main difference being that it is historically accurate. The original text presented here was inaccurate on many levels. Example: to say that the source of Helen's "inner dictation" (Jesus) was "divine" mixes apples and organges, for the notion that Jesus is divine is typically a Christian concept, while in the Course this is absolutely not the case, and Jesus presents us as our "elder brother" and emphasizes that there is nothing he has and we don't.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is similarly flawed, because it evidently gets a lot of contribution from parties who have an axe to grind, rather than from sources representing the Course, and who actually represent what it says. Unfortunately a situation such as this with a lot of potential for controversy, may be an example of where the Wikipedia model fails, without a firm editorial hand.

<dl>
<dd>I have not studied the recent changes but the introduction has had a lot of work by multiple editors. Hopefully the recent changes address your concerns. Although the Course does present Jesus as our "elder brother" it also presents Jesus as divine as it does you and I.</dd>

<p>The article had 2 tags: {{ActiveDiscuss}} {{unreferenced|date=August 2006}} Recently, another tag was added: {{NPOV}}</p>
<p>I think the 3rd tag just "overtags" the article. The first tag already says: "Some statements may be disputed, incorrect, biased...". The 3rd tag is therefore redundant. In addition the NPOV refers to discussion on the talk page and there is none. Although the article stills needs work, I do not find that there is a problem with the neutrality of the article.</p>
<p>For both of the reasons above, I will remove the additional tag.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 18:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please provide me with a cite to WP policy where it discusses "overtagging." Articles should have as many tags as are necessary to alert editors/readers to problems with the article, and there are a lot with this one. As the article reads now, it reads like it is trying to convert people to ACIM. Some of the many, many examples:</dd>
<dd>A Course in Miracles, however, is not like any educational course. Its goals are profoundly different.</dd>
<dd>A Course in Miracles is deeply psychological. It contains a remarkably extensive and intricate theory of the mind</dd>
</dl>
<p>These passages are not balanced by any criticism. Once this has been done the tags can be removed. Note that the NPOV tag says that neutrality is disputed. I am disputing it and I know that there are other experienced editors and admins on the project who have serious neutrality problems with this version of the article as well. The {{ActiveDiscuss}} tag does not provide a strong enough warning to readers who are expecting an encyclopedia article and find themselves reading a tract. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:09, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does a large portion of this article consist of quotes of other people's assessment of the book/course/whatever? For example, "Basic tenets" has 2 screens worth of quotes cut/pasted from other author's books. Instead, it should just say "the basic tenets of ACIM are X, Y and Z" and then provide a reference to these sources if necessary. This continues throughout the article. If you look at other book articles (ie, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Dianetics%7E_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health_6043.html" title="Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a> or <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States_2998.html" title="A People's History of the United States">A People's History of the United States</a>) they don't include huge chunks of content from other people's summary of the text.

<dd>Honestly, very little of the article as it now stands is written in an encyclopedic fashion (as numerous editors have pointed out). I've done some research into the topic and the article also seems largely inaccurate as it spends a good deal of its time trying to convince the reader that ACIM is a form of Christianity. In fact, ACIM teaches that Christ is not the only son of God and that his crucifixion did not redeem humankind's sin. In fact, it seems more based on eastern religion, but put into a Western historical context. We really don't need to either convince the reader that it is Christian or try to convince him that it is a heresy or make any judgment on it whatsoever. All we need to do is relate the basic facts about the topic. This article does not do that. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 15:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<b>First step: Talk to the other parties involved</b></dd>
<dd>The first resort in resolving almost any conflict is to discuss the issue on a talk page. Either contact the other party on that user's talk page, or use the talk page associated with the article in question. Never carry on a dispute on the article page itself. When discussing an issue, stay cool and don't mount personal attacks. Take the other person's perspective into account and try to reach a compromise. Assume that the other person is acting in good faith unless you have clear evidence to the contrary.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both at this stage and throughout the dispute resolution process, talking to other parties is not simply a formality to be satisfied before moving on to the next forum. Failure to pursue discussion in good faith shows that you are trying to escalate the dispute instead of resolving it. This will make people less sympathetic to your position and may prevent you from effectively using later stages in dispute resolution. In contrast, sustained discussion and serious negotiation between the parties, even if not immediately successful, shows that you are interested in finding a solution that fits within Wikipedia policies."</dd>

<dd>"Look, I added a tag saying you cannot change the article. That means you cannot change the article." Give me a break. You are also assuming that this is somehow the "preferred version" of the article. As you know, this assumption is extremely dubious and has been contested by several editors. Also, I've read up on ACIM and now know that the article is completely misleading. As you also know, edit warring (which is what you are doing by serially reverting Not a dog's edits, even those that are merely style changes, in their entirety) to protect false content can lead to serious consequences.

<dl>
<dd><b>Second step: Disengage for a while</b></dd>
<dd>A simple solution to a dispute is to stop having it — by leaving the article and/or bringing in an outside editor. This is particularly helpful when disputing with new users as it gives them a chance to familiarize themselves with Wikipedia's policy and culture. Focus your contributions on another article where you can make constructive progress. Avoid going back to the page of dispute. Respond to questions about it on your user talk page and direct the questioner to take their issues to the article talk page to keep all relevant discussion in one place.</dd>
<dd>Take a long term view. In due course you will probably be able to return and carry on editing it, when the previous problems no longer exist and the editor you were in dispute with might themselves move on. In the meantime the disputed article will evolve, other editors may become interested and they will have different perspectives if the issue comes up again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article size</span></h2>
<p>There has been a concern expressed about article size. Please see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article size</a>. I would like to draw attention to these aspects of the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the past, because of some now rarely used browsers, technical considerations prompted a strong recommendation that articles be limited to a maximum of precisely 32 KB in size, since editing any article longer than that would cause severe problems. With the advent of the section editing feature, and the availability of upgrades for the affected browsers, this once hard and fast rule has been softened and many articles exist which are over 32 KB of total text.</dd>
<dd><b>No need for haste</b></dd>
<dd>Do not take precipitous action the very instant an article exceeds 32 KB. There is no need for haste. Discuss the overall topic structure with other editors. Determine whether the topic should be treated as several shorter articles and, if so, how best to organize them. Sometimes an article simply needs to be big to give the subject adequate coverage; certainly, size is no reason to remove valid and useful information.

<dd>Dude, you continue to deflect my pleas for you to discuss the substance of my changes/concerns by pasting all kinds of lenthy sections of policy, which, combined with your imposition of requiring <i>any</i> change be discussed first, concerns me as it regards to issues of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WP:WL</a>. Anyway, I've never expressed concern about the entire article's size, but only in relation to hesitations about the Psychology &amp; Tenets sections noted above: I'm not at all convinced that lenghty quotes from ACIM are appropriate here. This also involves issues of <a href="../../../q/u/o/WP%7EQUOTE_12ae.html" title="WP:QUOTE">WP:QUOTE</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/s/WP%7ENPS_2b55.html" title="WP:NPS">WP:NPS</a>. Care to address this substantively? <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_dog_07fd.html" title="User:Not a dog">Not a dog</a> 20:06, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You were the one that brought up your concern about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article size</a>. I tried to respond to this concern about article size even though I am trying to take a wikibreak. It seems that each time I try to answer a concern of yours you bring up two or three more that take me further and further away from your initial concern. If article size is not a concern of yours then please do not bring it up.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 17:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My main point is that I'm concerned about large quotes, and then you just paste a bunch of policy, without actually <i>discussing</i>, which is what you lobbied so passionately for above. You are not discussing any of my suggestions, just throwing policy quotes in my face in an attempt to ensure your work isn't changed in the article. That hardly seems to be in the best interest of this article. We're trying to create a good encyclopedia article.</dd>
<dd>And if you're trying to take a wikibreak, then stop logging onto the site (and accusing me of being a sockpuppet just becuase you think I'm learning policies too quickly). <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_dog_07fd.html" title="User:Not a dog">Not a dog</a> 17:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She is discussed in the article, and seems like an appropriate link for additional info.

<p>It appears that it is time to archive again. I am prepared to do this leaving anything that appears to be under active discussion or that are marked for not archiving.
