This material developed into the book. Both Schucman and Thetford and the text itself claim that the true author was the historical Jesus, and it is written in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_person.html" title="First person">first person</a>, though authorship is not attributed in the published version and the original copyright claim filed for the book lists the author as "Anonymous".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>"</p>

<p>In addition to the substance of the notes themselves, Schucman claims to have received instruction from the "Voice" that directed how the notes were to be processed and used. The "Voice" directed that Thetford was in charge of the editing. After completing the original full set of notes, sometimes known as the <i>Urtext</i>, Thetford and Schucman then edited, rearranged some of the material, and added chapter and section headings to it.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The book was published and distributed between 1995 and 2000 by Penguin Books, but this appears to have ended with the dispute over copyright. The 1975 asserted copyright was finally voided in 2003 on the grounds of general distribution prior to obtaining copyright, thus placing it in the public domain. The previously registered Trademark on the acronymn, "ACIM" was cancelled by the US Trademark Office on 10/25/2005 and the previously registered Servicemark on the book title, "A Course in Miracles" was canceled by the US Trademark Office on 8/10/2005.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><i>the Course</i> displays a strong orientation toward the concepts of mentalistic monism (see also <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monism.html" title="Monism">philosophical monism</a>), particularly Attributive Monism, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">philosophical idealism</a>), and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Responsibility_assumption.html" title="Responsibility assumption">responsibility assumption</a>, in its prescription that the mind and its thoughts are causally responsible for the everything in the physical world. <i>the Course</i> shares this outlook with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Thought_Movement_e2e0.html" title="New Thought Movement">New Thought Movement</a>, including <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Science_63ad.html" title="Religious Science">Religious Science</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ%2C_Scientist_837b.html" title="Church of Christ, Scientist">Christian Science</a>. In contrast to these belief systems, <i>the Course</i> focuses heavily on <i>inner</i> healing, as opposed to <i>outer</i>, physical healing, which is a consequence of <i>the Course'</i>s complete disassociation of self-identity and limited physical bodies. Focus on <i>outer</i> healing over <i>inner</i> healing <i>first</i> would be similar to taking an aspirin to remove the symptoms of a far more serious problem underneath.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some observers have noted the fact that <i>the Course</i> teachings have many things in common with the teachings of Christian Science, including the metaphysical appeal to a perfect, absolute, divine reality of which material existence is a distorted perception, or unhealed thought; the Idealist idea of healing or resurrection through improved thought and understanding; the subordination of imperfection as illusory; the reformulation of the Atonement; the reformulation of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>; and the emphasis on God's love and forgiveness rather than eternal <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damnation.html" title="Damnation">damnation</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>A great deal of controversy has arisen regarding <i>the Course'</i>s teaching that, “Strictly speaking.. (it) is impossible (for) the Word (to be made flesh).””<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, in reference to the Biblical quote from the book of John <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> about the relationship between God and the Christ. Some have taken this quote out of context to imply that <i>the Course</i> teaches that the historical Jesus was never fully human in the same sense as all other humans are. <i>the Course</i> does teach specifically that, “Jesus is the name of one who was a man <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>", however <i>the Course</i> also teaches that all humans are not truly the bodies that they seem to be, but that all bodies are essentially illusory. This includes Jesus’ body as well. Thus, the manner in which <i>the Course</i> differs sharply from traditional Christianity in its interpretation of all of the material world as being fundamentally illusory, is cause for some theological debate on the question of the nature of Jesus’ incarnation.</p>

<p><i>the Course</i> professes <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_pluralism.html" title="Religious pluralism">respect for various other spiritual methods and paths</a> that may be used to reach the same goals it pursues. <i>the Course</i> describes its main benefit as saving time toward the eventual remembering of the unity of the seemingly separated parts of Christ, and cites <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical_relationship.html" title="Ethical relationship">interpersonal relationships</a> as its special mode for doing so. The theology of <i>the Course</i> is decidedly <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monism.html" title="Monism">Monistic</a> in its orientation.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One striking feature of the methodology laid out in <i>the Course</i> is the great attention paid to the nature of the faulty <i>belief system</i> of the ego. <i>the Course</i> goes to great length to evaluate the psychological underpinnings and dynamics that support this belief system, attempting to shift one’s focus away from seeming external causes to awareness of internal states, claiming that everything we see "outside" of us actually has an internal mental cause. Accordingly, our state of peace and happiness (or lack thereof) is not caused by the state of things around us, but by our mental reactions, evaluations and judgments about things. It then describes what must be accomplished in order for one to achieve release from, and afterwards to continue to avoid a return to this belief system. Such subjects as the root causes of anger, guilt, shame, projection, denial, and dishonesty are thoroughly addressed in <i>the Course</i>, as well as the best methodologies that one can use to overcome such perceptual limitations. It also spends considerable time discussing the <i>special relationships</i> of the ego (<i>special</i> as in... "I don’t have what another person has" and so it’s OK not to love them or, conversely, "Another person doesn’t have what I have" and so again it’s OK not to love them), and the Holy Spirit's equivalent transformative equivalent to this, the <i>holy relationship</i>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Some conservative Christian reviewers have expressed concerns that the doctrines of <i>the Course</i> may incorporate some <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cultic</a> tendencies.

Some such reviewers hold that <i>the Course'</i>s doctrines are subversive to the proper functioning of a rational society, as nowhere does <i>the Course</i> encourage its students to actively attempt to improve or change the world for the better, and instead <i>the Course</i> teaches that the material world is merely an illusion.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the Course's <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_cosmology.html" title="Religious cosmology">cosmology</a>, God the Father and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a> the Son are united in a single purpose, for God is understood as creating perfectly like Himself, sharing his whole Self with Creation, eternally and changelessly. <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a> is said to be <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipresent.html" title="Omnipresent">omnipresent</a>, but this cannot be realized without letting go of all misperception and judgement. Such cannot do the Son justice, for, according to <i>the Course</i>, to give is to receive, and who condemns another, seeing him as less than a Son of God Who creates only like Himself, is not spared the effect of the guilt. Who believes he can see another as capable of separating or distancing himself from God, must believe that he himself can likewise separate himself from God. Since sin and evil go against God, and going against God is impossible, the Course argues sin and evil must have never been possible. However, so long as we do not see that there are no orders or differences in sins or evils, we will will not look at our mistakes and ignorance, fearing they have separated us. If this were true, such mistakes would be unforgiveable, blameworthy, and not mere mistakes at all, but sins. Separation would render us as contradictions, according to the Course, for what goes against God is eternally at war and will never find peace. But, the Course emphasizes, contradictions are nothing at all, and none exist.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Course claims that if we believe our reality lies somewhere between the extremes of Heaven and hell, it is only for our lack of recognition that changing the form of our thinking or or its circumstance never changes the content, for such an insane notion is the very same insane arrogance of the thought that we could have had the power to distance ourselves from God in any way.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>According to <i>the Course</i>, Atonement is realized in the instant we allow sin to be forgiven, for such a thought at last recognizes the true sinless nature of the Son, at last doing him justice, seeing him truly. Again, to give is to receive. Atonement is the means by which the entire "reality" of sin is undone, for we see that we had never anything to fear, and we are left only with what must be true.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is understood as the Voice of God, whose purpose is healing, so long as healing is necessary to bring us into awareness of our exceptionless union with God and the Sonship (collective humanity), so we might share in His creation and perfection.

<p>Within the terminology used by <i>the Course</i>, the term <i>miracle</i> still incorporates its original meaning, but additional connotations are added. These are roughly synonymous with those usually associated with the term <i>love</i>. As such, the book shifts its focus towards teaching various aspects of love and its presence in one’s life.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Within the terminology used by <i>the Course</i>, the term <i>ego</i> is roughly synonymous with the term <i>self-concept</i>. As such, the ego as described by the Course is something which is often misinformed or confused about itself, and which by definition requires correction.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One point of note regarding <i>the Course</i> standard phraseology is its nearly exclusive use of masculine pronouns.

<p>While <i>the Course</i> does not specifically state whether or not Jesus suffered during the crucifixion, it does consistently teach that the knowledge and awareness of God’s love is capable of removing <i>all</i> pain and suffering in <i>every</i> psychological and/ or physical circumstance. From this teaching it can be inferred that according to the teachings of <i>the Course</i>, one with the awareness that <i>the Course</i> claims that Jesus had, would not have truly suffered, even as he was rejected and crucified. This apparent teaching of <i>the Course</i> is in marked contrast to the Biblical teaching found primarily in the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistles.html" title="Epistles">Epistles</a> of the New Testament, that Jesus did indeed suffer greatly during the crucifixion, and that his suffering in this was somehow necessary in order to prevent God from justly punishing the rest of mankind, being some form of a <i>substitutionary</i> punishment.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The teachings of <i>the Course</i> place little importance on theology, stating that "a universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary." Still, a very definite, consistent, and unique theology can be derived from the teachings of <i>the Course</i>. The theology of <i>the Course</i> provides a radically different perspective regarding many common concepts.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Because of <i>the Course'</i>s perspective on reality, separation, and forgiveness, <i>the Course</i> does not accept <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a>, or <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice.html" title="Sacrifice">sacrifice</a> as being real. <i>the Course</i> rejects the definition of sin as an <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a> act having unalterable consequences and necessarily deserving of <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punishment.html" title="Punishment">punishment</a> by God or by others. This is because under its cosmology sin exists only as an illusion or a mistake, and therefore the most logical response to it is to simply correct the mistake, rather than to give it more weight via punishment. <i>the Course</i> defines mistakes as mental misconceptions having no real (eternal) consequences beyond the need for correction. Accordingly, all acts of others are to be <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpreted.html" title="Interpreted">interpreted</a> either as expressions of love, or as calls for love, and nothing more. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Death is both illusory and ultimately meaningless for <i>the Course</i>, because of its position that only by salvation, and not by death, do separated minds cease to believe in the illusory world of separation and return to unity in the Sonship. Sacrifice is similarly impossible for <i>the Course</i> because of the eternal wholeness of the Sonship. <i>the Course</i> thus rejects the more traditional Christian belief that Jesus's <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a> was meant as a sacrificial proxy in payment for the sins of mankind. Instead <i>the Course</i> explains the crucifixion as a necessary part of the lesson of the resurrection. As such it is a part of an amazing demonstration of the invulnerability of the spirit and of love.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Trinity_1d2e.html" title="Holy Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> of most Christian denominations is present in <i>the Course</i>, but the definitions that <i>the Course</i> uses for the Son, and for the Holy Spirit are somewhat different from most traditional Christian definitions. The Son, or Christ, is the unity of all of God’s creation, rather than being synonymous with Jesus only, and thus encompasses all of God's children. The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> is the Voice for God and the means given to the seemingly separated (yet in reality, united) minds of God's Sonship to first remember and then to return to their natural inheritance of unity with God. The Holy Spirit is the aspect of God the Creator that understands the world we live in. The Holy Spirit is aware of the perceptions of people, and is simultaneously aware of the knowledge of God (Heaven's version of perception). The Holy Spirit is the aspect of God which leads us back home to Heaven, as it sees clearly the way back home, which is where God would have us be.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The teachings of <i>the Course</i> about how the world will one day end (or the <i><a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">eschatology</a></i> of <i>the Course</i>) differ significantly from most traditional <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_eschatology.html" title="Christian eschatology">Christian eschatologies</a>. <i>the Course</i> makes only one prediction regarding the future. <i>the Course</i> predicts that the Atonement (when all seemingly separated minds have recognized their unity as Christ) will require millions of years to complete. In <i>the Course'</i>s counterpart to the Biblical prediction of the Apocalypse as expressed in the book of Revelation, <i>the Course</i> teaches that the illusory material world will not be tumultuously destroyed by fire, famine, and pestilence, but instead that it “will simply cease to seem to be,” once it has fulfilled its true purpose of enabling the Atonement. It will then be gently replaced in our awareness by the <i>real</i> world of God's eternal love. Should one interpret the apocalyptic symbolism of the 'lamb' ruling over the 'beast' as portrayed in the book of Revelation, as the power of peace, gentleness and innocence, reigning over the powers of war, brutality, and sin, then this particular symbolism might be considered to be consistent with the teachings of <i>the Course</i>. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Regarding the question of reincarnation, although <i>the Course</i> does contain passages that would seem to imply the likelihood of the existence of reincarnation, nowhere does it unequivocally state it as fact. In comparison to Biblical statements about reincarnation, this is actually a less firm endorsement of it than some of those who adhere to a belief in reincarnation would claim can be found the Bible. These adherents to this belief in reincarnation point to the Biblical description of the origins of John the Baptist as found in the Gospel of Matthew, which states that "John <i>is</i> Elijah". These adherents to this belief assert that if this Biblical assertion is to be taken literally, then it can only mean that John the Baptist was the reincarnation of Elijah. (Most Christians do not accept this interpretation of this verse.) <i>the Course</i> neither directly supports, nor does it directly deny the possibility of reincarnation. Instead it attempts to focus one's energies on gaining a fuller awareness of the present moment, to the exclusion of concerns for the past or for the future.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The preface of <i>the Course</i> advises that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"(</i>the Course<i>) is not intended to become the basis for another cult. Its only purpose is to provide a way in which some people will be able to find their own Internal Teacher."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book states that religion is best when it is practiced at the internal, personal level, as an act directly between a person and God, or another person. Accordingly, no central organization or authority exists within <i>the Course</i> that is fully analogous to the central authority structure found in most other spiritual belief systems. Neither does any system of formalized membership, or membership tracking exist amongst the majority of the students of <i>the Course</i>. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The teachings make no attempt to codify or structuralize any system of earthly spiritual authority. Instead the material stresses that true authority comes from within the individual who has come to see God truly. <i>the Course</i> teaches that setting up a <i>spiritual</i> authority from one person over another is inherently unnatural, and temporary at best. <i>the Course'</i>s teachings state that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Freedom cannot be learned by tyranny of any kind, and the perfect equality of all God's Sons cannot be recognized through the dominion of one mind over another."</i></p>

<p>The teachings of <i>the Course</i> also make it clear that anyone who would 'teach' <i>the Course</i> must also be able to 'learn' from each person he or she meets, because teaching and learning are understood as synonymous.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> This egalitarian type of teaching is found consistently throughout the material and appears to contrast sharply with most contemporary interpretations of the Christian Bible.

<p>If most theologians agree about any of this then they need to be referenced as sources, and cited. Moving this section to discussion.</p>
<p>Most theologians agree that some of the most radical spiritual principles first introduced by the historical Jesus include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus' teaching about radical forgiveness.</li>
<li>Jesus' radical reformulation of the old Jewish law to highlight the need for 'brotherly love' to mean <i>neighbor-as-self</i>.</li>
<li>Jesus' teaching regarding the <i>parental</i> relationship between all men and <i>"God the Father"</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these three radical departures made in Jesus’ teachings from all prior religions, many Christians have noted that the Bible provides precious few details about what exactly was meant by the teaching of these three new spiritual principles. Some passages in the Bible regarding these principles appear to be slightly inconsistent with other Biblical passages regarding these same principles. For example: Jesus, teaching in the 'Lord's Prayer' about forgiveness, says, "God forgives our trespasses just as we forgive (the trespasses of) those who trespass against us." This seems to be slightly inconsistent with other Biblical passages describing how we are forgiven only through "Christ's blood, even the forgiveness of sins<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>".<sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research." style="white-space: nowrap;">original research?</span></a></i>]</sup></p>

Regarding forgiveness, <i>the Course</i> goes into far greater detail, providing far more instruction regarding the logic of, the purpose for, and the practical application of this principle, than does the Christian Bible. Many students of <i>the Course</i> who are (or have been) involved in traditional Christian churches, and who have faithfully studied <i>the Course</i> for a significant length of time, report their sense that the teachings of <i>the Course</i> on forgiveness have finally clarified for them, in very practical ways, how forgiveness can now be fully realized in their daily lives.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The following appear to be original research based on reading the book(s). They need to come from a reputible resource, quoted, and cited.</p>
<p><i>the Course</i> does radically reinterpret the crucifixion and the resurrection to be an example of how the power and example of Christ's forgiveness was so great that ultimately even the greatest of physical assaults could not hold or affect him <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>. Still, nowhere does <i>the Course</i> teach that a 'Savior' is unnecessary for salvation. In fact, the need for a 'Savior' is stressed consistently throughout <i>the Course</i>. According to <i>the Course</i>, only full recognition of the exceptionless presence of the sinlessness of Christ, the 'Savior', in the Sonship is required for salvation <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><i>the Course</i> material also advises that formality in religion is only useful if it has a clear, practical purpose. The truest type of church or formal institution for <i>the Course</i> is more of an inner habit of reverence for the presence of God, seen in everyone, rather than any kind of sanctified external physical building or human organization. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><i>the Course</i> places no specific limits on the methods by which it may be learned or taught, emphasizing that all spiritual and non-spiritual paths alike must eventually lead to the same awakening. However, according to <i>the Course</i>, some paths will take far longer than others, and the purpose of the Course is to minimize the time this takes. Accordingly, <i>the Course</i> students are free to seek out whichever learning-teaching format works best for them. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>At least two organizations are known to present the teachings of <i>the Course</i> in an environment that appears to be similar in some ways to a more traditional Christian church setting. These organizations provide traditional style gathering places for weekly Sunday morning services, a pastoral staff, ordained ministers, seminary training, and many of the other institutional systems and practices that are normally associated with more traditional Christian churches. These are the <i>Community Miracles Center</i>, situated in the Castro district of San Francisco, California, and the <i>Pathways of Light Center</i> in Kiel, Wisconsin.

<li>This article isn't about, nor closely related to the website itself. We do not have any content speaking about Alexa ratings, nor the number of user's that visit the A Course in Miracles Web Site daily. It would be off topic, completely. Do you agree? Ste4k 17:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The link connected for me.
