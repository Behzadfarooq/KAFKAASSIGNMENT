<p><i><b>Between Silk and Cyanide</b></i> is the title of a book by former <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Operations_Executive_8413.html" title="Special Operations Executive">SOE</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">cryptographer</a> <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Marks_c634.html" title="Leo Marks">Leo Marks</a>, describing his work during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. The title is derived from an incident related in the book, when he is asked why spies in occupied Europe should have their cryptographic material written on <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk.html" title="Silk">silk</a> (which was in very short supply). Marks said that he replied that it was "between silk and cyanide," meaning that it was a choice between a spy surviving, and having to take a <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_pill.html" title="Suicide pill">suicide pill</a>.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>At the age of 8, Leo Marks discovered the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Game_8e4c.html" title="The Great Game">great game</a> of code-making and -breaking in his father's <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> bookshop (located at <i><a href="../../../8/4/_/84_Charing_Cross_Road_cd2e.html" title="84 Charing Cross Road">84 Charing Cross Road</a></i>), thanks to a first edition of <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allen_Poe_0d13.html" title="Edgar Allen Poe">Poe</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gold-Bug_0808.html" title="The Gold-Bug">The Gold-Bug</a></i>. At 23, as <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> was being played out in earnest, he hoped to use his cryptographic talent for the British war effort. However, as Marks's witty memoir <i>Between Silk and Cyanide</i> relates, he failed to get into British Intelligence's premier cryptographic department at <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bletchley_Park_0226.html" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a>.</p>
<p>While everyone else who took the assessment test appears to head off to Bletchley ("the promised land"), Marks is instead sent to what his Sergeant describes as "some potty outfit in Baker Street, an open house for misfits." This outfit was the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Operations_Executive_8413.html" title="Special Operations Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> (SOE), which was instructed, in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s stirring phrase, to "Set Europe Ablaze." Marks's duties included monitoring code security so that <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">secret agents</a> sent into occupied Europe could report back as safely as possible.</p>
<p>When Marks arrived at SOE, the common wisdom was that it was easiest and sufficiently secure for men and women in the field to use <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poem_code.html" title="Poem code">poem codes</a> to encrypt their intelligence reports before transmitting them to Britain in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morse_code.html" title="Morse code">Morse code</a> via portable radio sets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the Germans had equal access to the classics of literature poem codes were not very secure; over time, and especially if an agent used the same words of his poem repeatedly, <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicherheitsdienst.html" title="Sicherheitsdienst">Sicherheitsdienst</a> cryptographers could work out the poem being used and then easily break any subsequent encryption sent by that agent. "Reference books," as Marks remarked, "are jackboots when used by cryptographers".</p>
<p>While unable to immediately change official SOE encryption policy, to make poem codes more secure Marks insisted that agents should write their own poems or use his original works instead, several of which are cheerily obscene ("Is de Gaulle's prick / Twelve inches thick," etc). While the use of original poetry as an encryption key was more secure than using poems published in books, Marks soon felt that original doggerel was just as dangerous, since even slight misspellings could render encrypted messages indecipherable and risk agents' lives by their being asked to re-transmit a corrected copy.</p>
<p>His first solution was the development of "WOKs" (Worked-Out Keys), preferably printed on <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk.html" title="Silk">silk</a> so that they could be easily concealed within clothing and be undetectable if the agent was <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisking.html" title="Frisking">frisked</a>. An operative would use one key, send the message, and immediately cut off and burn the strip of code alphabet which had been used. This would ensure no code alphabet would be used twice, making decryption of each transmission more difficult for the enemy. Due to the heavy demand for silk to make <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute.html" title="Parachute">parachutes</a>, Marks had to persist in his efforts to obtain a supply. While occasionally landing him in comic terrain, his project was deadly serious: he impressed the importance of screen-printed silk for his WOKs on a disbelieving officer who asked what the difference was between printing the codes on silk instead of on paper by replying "it's the difference between silk and cyanide". Codes written on paper could be found more easily and would confirm that a searched SOE agent was in fact a spy, leading to their arrest, torture and execution by the <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>. For such eventualities agents were issued with a <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_pill.html" title="Suicide pill">suicide pill</a> made of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium_cyanide.html" title="Potassium cyanide">potassium cyanide</a>, although some did not choose to exercise that option or were unable to if the pill was found and confiscated.</p>
<p>In one of the book's great <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdote.html" title="Anecdote">anecdotes</a>, Marks visits Colonel Wills - perhaps a model for <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Fleming_7c1f.html" title="Ian Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s character <a href="../../../q/_/%28/Q_%28James_Bond%29_6f19.html" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a> - in order to sort out the best ways to print his code keys. Before solving this minor problem (invisible ink), Wills showed Marks several new projects - one of which involved an exotic array of dung from different animals, courtesy of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Zoo_73b8.html" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a>. This gadgetmaster planned to model life-sized reproductions of the droppings of various species from around the world and pack them with explosives, personalised for all parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. "Once trodden on or driven over (hopefully by the enemy) the whole lot would go off with a series of explosions even more violent than the ones which had produced it," Marks quipped.</p>
<p>Another project of Marks', named by him "Operation Gift-Horse", was a deception scheme aimed to disguise the more secure WOK code traffic as poem code traffic, so that German cryptographers would think "Gift-Horsed" messages were easier to break than they actually were. This was done by adding false duplicate indicator groups to WOK-keys, to give the appearance that an agent had repeated the use of certain words of their code poem. The aim of Gift Horse was to waste the enemy's time, and was deployed prior to <a href="../../../d/-/d/D-Day_72ea.html" title="D-Day">D-Day</a>, when code traffic increased dramatically. He also promoted the use of <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-time_pad.html" title="One-time pad">one-time pads</a> by SOE agents, with mixed success.</p>
<p>Despite many amusing and irreverent observations, the author never loses sight of the importance of his vocation, and <i>Between Silk and Cyanide</i> is as poignant as it is engaging. Marks evokes pathos with the story of his own personal loss (encapsulated in his poem <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Life_That_I_Have_82df.html" title="The Life That I Have">The Life That I Have</a></i>), and shares with the reader his despair and frustration as he records agents blown - lost to the enemy both by misfortune or by folly. Readers will find it hard to forget Marks's personal recollections of famous SOE agents such as <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violette_Szabo_23d8.html" title="Violette Szabo">Violette Szabo</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noor_Inayat_Khan_6858.html" title="Noor Inayat Khan">Noor Inayat Khan</a>, and the "White Rabbit", Flight Lieutenant <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._F._E._Yeo-Thomas_6b15.html" title="F.
