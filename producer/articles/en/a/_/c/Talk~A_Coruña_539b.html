<p>"<i>At this point the name Corunna entered English (with the Gallicized spelling Corrugna also appearing in the 18th century), although this name is now being forgotten, and tends to be replaced with the local names, which as noted above are La Coruña in Spanish and A Coruña in Galician.</i>" This strikes me as a POV.

<dd>I beg to disagree. "La Coruña" has been used in Spanish for centuries. The fact that the Galician spelling has been made the only official name in Spain in recent years does not mean that the Spanish name does not exist. Why have you deleted all references to the name in the article? Even if you think that "La Coruña" shouldn't be used nowadays, the article should mention the name, since it is still the most common one in English texts. Personally, I would prefer to use the English traditional name "Corunna" for the article. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelRiesgo_3ead.html" title="User:AngelRiesgo">AngelRiesgo</a> 02:38, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"A Coruña" is most certainly not the name that is used in English. The current location of this page is against wikipedia policy. It is either called "Corruna" or "La Coruña" in English. I have never seen "A Coruña" until just a moment ago. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 21:59, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since 90's National Geographic Atlas (or Times, or What You Want) only states "A Coruña". It has been the official name both in Galician, Spanish and Chinese since 1983. And yes, in 1600 text you can find "Corunna", and surely in AD75 ones "Portus Artabrorum".212.51.52.4 22:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope we can definitively finish the matter of the name: the only legal name for the city is A Coruña, whatever the language you use within Spain, and I think it is fully aplicable the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conflict#Types_of_entities|Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conflict#Types_of_entities|Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">policy and style guide</a>] -the trouble is not on Galician side but in nationalist Spanish one which simply does not want to use the current official and legal name, with the most pintoresque argumentations. The most known name for the city in English was the Spanish one the whole 20th century at least. 212.51.52.7 08:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have reverted your edits. According to <a href="../../../n/c/o/WP%7ENCON_841b.html" title="WP:NCON">WP:NCON</a> (which you linked to) the most <i>common name</i> should be used as the article name. It's my understanding that in this case this is also the legal name. However, <a href="../../../n/c/o/WP%7ENCON_841b.html" title="WP:NCON">WP:NCON</a> does not mean other names should not be mentioned. On the contrary, Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i> and shall represent all notable viewpoints and facts: "NPOV says that the article should fairly represent <b>all significant viewpoints</b> that have been published by a reliable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each." See: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. In this case, both the local "conflict" and the fact that readers might be interested to know what other names are used/have been used, qualify as notable. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">Steve Hart</a> 14:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid I explain too bad, please excuse me and excuse my poor English. "Corunna" is really a Spanish word, and from Spanish it entered on English. You of course know the Spanish "letter" ñ is (or was, as you prefer) a double nn, it is not the case of the French La Corogne, for instance. An English term, like canyon (also from Spanish cañón) would be Corunya. By the way, it is unclear that roman Brigantium was A Coruña, but it is true that some historicians believe so. Corunna, as you can read in the links you supply me, is an out-of-date term, in public Libraries here I found a 1973 edition of Chamber's Encyclopaedia as the term is La Coruña, in Spanish of course. I mean, until 1983 in the English-speaking world it was known so, and Corunna is a very old term like many others out of use and not cited in Wikipedia, but of course it is true you can find "Corunna", and the older the text, more you read. And, the use of "La Coruña" or "A Coruña" is not neutral, of course it is in English, but not in its spanish context. I disagree with the term "Galician nationalists", it is true that many "Galician nationalists" take part in a kind of political battle, but not all, and not only "Galician nationalists" are in favour of "A Coruña". For instance, the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) or the Galician (regional) branch of PP, in a stronger rejection, are publicly against the use of "La Coruña" (and curiously as you know, not the PSOE ex-mayor, belonging to it by now, who was the main figure supporting "La Coruña"). The only strictly true is that "Spanish nationalists" are who supporting "La Coruña", and no other people. Many people not nationalist of any side, not even Galician (or Spanish) at all, supports "A Coruña" simply because it is the legal term since 1983 and they have no interest on boost Francoist flames. It is the legal name! How can be possible that "Galician nationalists" are defending the legality agains "Spanish nationalists"? I think this point is not well explained since is seems to be a confrontation between nationalists of two sides, and it is an artificial debate which clear intention to call attention. I live here and it is not a conflict at all (for instance, ALL local newspapers use A Coruña, and in Spanish), i.e., people do not talk about it, nor worry, I mean the name ("Galician" or "Spanish"), what really is a big problem, is the continuous defy of the law by the ex-mayor (only him) who in all cases has lost all trials: it was the Municipality the main (and only) supporter of "La Coruña". Note that this problem simply does not exist with <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ourense.html" title="Ourense">Ourense/Orense</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrol.html" title="Ferrol">Ferrol/El Ferrol del Caudillo</a>, which theoretically would be the same case.

<dd>Thank you very much for your time (and work). From a non-NPOV, the subject is the ex-mayor had a great interest in diverting public opinion out of his familiar and personal bussiness which are not matter of interest here, and of course, many other people with certain ideology had also interest in support it. Please also note that ALL trials before the High Court of Galicia and High Court of Spain were unfavorable to him (they were paid with Municipality funds). I think it is no case for a major "natural" debate. About the English name, I think "old English" is a bit exaggerated, maybe I'm wrong but, for instance, <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zaragoza.html" title="Zaragoza">Saragossa</a> was the only English name for the city (of Zaragoza) until recent times, and it is no longer in use, including the Wikipedia itself, and Zaragoza is a city of greater importance than the town A Coruña is. The only major event in history where the name Corunna appears is <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Corunna_8c7e.html" title="Battle of Corunna">Battle of Corunna</a>, in fact "Battle of Elviña" (the place name where the battle was fought, nowadays a suburb of A Coruña). 212.51.52.7 00:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can Anyone provide any English texts that use the term "A Coruña". I have always seen either "La Coruña" or "Corunna," usually the former, and certainly the former in sources post-1983 (if anything, I'd say that up through the 1960s, "Corunna" was probably used," so that "La Coruña" has largely come into use in the period when it has <i>not</i> been the official name. Anyway, sources for use of "A Coruña" in English are earnestly requested. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:18, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not very hard find a lot of them. Use of "La Coruña" in English I think is by far prior to 1983, but usually in older texts it can appear "La Coruña (Corunna)". I suppose the article (A/La) means an strange particle to English (like "La Habana" = "Havana", but "Las Palmas (de Gran Canaria)"). Problems are that web searchers usually does not resolve "A Coruña" from "Coruña" or "La Coruña", the "letter" ñ, and that perhaps the main origin of news about A Coruña is its soccer club which names itself with the former name La Coruña.

<dd>La Coruña (also spelled without the diacritic) seems to be the denomination preferred by the BBC in English <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?q=la+coruna+-deportivo&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;scope=all&amp;tab=all&amp;recipe=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?q=la+coruna+-deportivo&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;scope=all&amp;tab=all&amp;recipe=all" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> (I have removed entries related to the football team Deportivo La Coruña). The problem is that picking La Coruña over A Coruña may offend some people, and A Coruña is not common in English (road maps would indeed use the local official name in order to stop motorists getting lost, of course). Corunna is also used but this usage has decreased in the last twenty years. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion"><font color="blue"><b>Asterion</b></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAsterion_28cc.html" title="User talk:Asterion"><font color="green"><b>talk</b></font></a></small></sup> 00:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Husond, the website is written in three languages. It is "La Coruña" in English as well as in Spanish, and "A Coruña" in Galician. We English-speakers, of course, are just as free to spell it differently from the way the Galicians do as the Spanish-speakers are. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:27, 25 September 2006 (UTC) Or differently from the way the Spanish spell it, or differently from both, of course. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:29, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>The spelling of Place Names</b></dd>
<dd>The spelling of place names also presents difficult problems, especially in foreign areas. In this atlas the principle followed is that, for settlements at least and where the Roman alphabet is used, the indigenous spellings are used, except for a relatively few places which are so well known that the indigenous spelling would be confusing to the reader. For many of the names in this latter group alternative spellings are also given. For example, on pages 114–5, the Italian spelling of a number of major cities is used as the primary spelling, but the common English spelling is added in parentheses, as for Milano (Milan) and Torino (Turin). On maps of smaller scale, such as that of Mediterranean Lands (pages 110–11), only the better known English spellings are employed, a convention widely adopted by cartographers and with many advantages.

<dd>And "A Coruña" is Galician, <i>not English</i>. And "La Coruña" is Spanish, <i>not English</i>. The only one that is clearly <b>English</b> are <b>Corunna</b> and <b>Coruna</b>. But the Catalan version "La Corunya" is more often used in English than the Galician form "A Coruña".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, "La Corunya" is most definitely <b>not</b> necessarily Catalan. In fact, that "ny" is a quite common transliteration of the "<a href="../../../e/n/y/Enye.html" title="Enye">enye</a>" into English: witness words such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canyon.html" title="Canyon">canyon</a>. Of course, even that "enye" name itself gives you a pretty good clue as to why this happens; in fact, that's basically how this letter with diacritics arose anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, <i>La Coruna</i> is a distinct and <b>different</b> spelling, one resulting in different results in entering something the box on Wikipedia and hitting "Go" or "Search", one resulting in different treatment in search engines and largely unpredictable results in the treatment in various searches in many of them, one which results in a different default sorting in Wikipedia categories is no sort key is added, and it is a <b>legitimate and proper</b> spelling. It is every bit as much as deserving of consideration here as any of the other alternatives which have been suggested. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 02:51, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, "La Corunha" was only an afterthought in any case, not one of the <b>serious omissions</b> beging discussed in this section. I don't really care if you classify "La Corunha" as an error—even though it does have over 1,000 hits each in both Spanish and Portuguese, and that has been borrowed in a few English language pages. For the sake of this argument, let's just assume that it is a mistake, and get back on track.</p>
<p>The important ones are <b>La Coruna</b> and <b>La Corunya</b>, with hundreds or thousands of times as many hits.</p>

<p>Gene, your results are not completely accurate. Not only the figures, as shown below, but you fail completely to understand the way Google works for discrimating languages and determining whether a page is in English or not, that is using metatags such as &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Language" CONTENT="EN"&gt;. The problem is that unless the webmaster does alter the preferences on their software, it will default to Spanish or whichever other language they use generally, therefore making it something like &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Language" CONTENT="ES"&gt;. As an example, every single one of the results for <i>Spain "La Coruña" -wikipedia -Coruna -site:en.wikipedia.org -deportivo</i> without even using the setting "English language only" in the first six pages is in English, which basically proves my point. So, it seems that, at the end of the day, La Coruña is indeed the most widespread name in English language. Personally, I would still prefer Corunna for historical reasons but I think we needed to put the record straight after your comments above. Regards, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion"><font color="blue"><b>Asterion</b></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAsterion_28cc.html" title="User talk:Asterion"><font color="green"><b>talk</b></font></a></small></sup> 15:40, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't show that "La Coruna is indeed the most widespread name in the English language." It doesn't even attempt to do so, it is only looking at two of the possibilities.</dd>
<dd>You are right that limitations by language aren't very reliable at all. I've often pointed that out myself.</dd>
<dd>Taken as a whole, the Google and AltaVista results are pretty good evidence that "La Coruna" is more common in English than "La Coruña" is.</dd>
<dd>You don't disprove that by looking at <b>six</b> pages (of how many hits; that's user specifiable, of course) out of <b>four million, six hundred twenty thousand</b> hits (or even out of <b>two hundred eighty-two thousand</b> hits, if thats the one you used), especially when you are looking at them in the search in which the spelling "Coruña" is likely to be <b>weighted</b> (see <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weight_function.html" title="Weight function">weight function</a>) more heavily in the results than the spelling "Coruna" is, so that the <i>Coruña</i> spelling is predictably more likely to occur in the first <b>six</b> pages. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 01:09, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As <i>weighted results</i>, you should know these are the most popular, most linked to, pages. Therefore La Coruña is more widespread than La Coruna in English. I am not sure whether you would be able to overcome your hate for diacritics and accept this. Best regards, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion"><font color="blue"><b>Asterion</b></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAsterion_28cc.html" title="User talk:Asterion"><font color="green"><b>talk</b></font></a></small></sup> 14:10, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Totally wrong. Note that "popularity" and "linked to" are different things, and even taken together they are a small part of the weighting process used by search engines. Putting a minus sign in front of a word is another part of it; in logical search engines, that means the results do not include any articles with that word, but obviously (to anybody familiar with <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, at least) Google does things differently. Other weighting factors used by Google include more weight to the spelling actually used to the search than to alternative spellings or synonyms, and changing effects based somehow on the number of search terms. Like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine.html" title="Search engine">search engine</a> tells us, "Google and most other web engines utilize not only PageRank but more than 150 criteria to determine relevancy." Then, just set your hits to display to 100 and look at the flip side of the coin from the one you looked at, the first page of hits for the Spain "La Coruna" -wikipedia -Coruña -site:en.wikipedia.org search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Spain&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=La+Coruna&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia+Coru%C3%B1a&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=off" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Spain&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=La+Coruna&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia+Coru%C3%B1a&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 00:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Quote:</b> <i>The city has a football club in Spain's top division, Deportivo de La Coruña (note that the club name still uses the Francoist spelling).</i> In La Coruña we use to talk in Spanish. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdalbertofrenesi_15d1.html" title="User:Adalbertofrenesi">Adalbertofrenesi</a> 18:21, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing this out. There's no need for that sort of comment. I got rid of the POV text.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion"><font color="blue"><b>Asterion</b></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAsterion_28cc.html" title="User talk:Asterion"><font color="green"><b>talk</b></font></a></small></sup> 18:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/_/c/Talk%7EA_Coru%C3%B1a_539b.html" title="Edit section: La Coruña vs A Coruña">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">La Coruña vs A Coruña</span></h2>
<p>A typically stupid Spanish argument. The simple fact of the matter is that the name La Coruña is the Castillian Spanish name for the city. A Coruña is in the Galician language.</p>
<p>The sign with the city name on it as you enter says, La Coruña, although someone has spraypainted over the letter L. I know because I see it every day.</p>
<p>Certain members within the Galician National Party (BNG) insist that the name be A Coruña, as opposed to a large percentage of members within the Spanish Nationalist Party (PP) who insist that it is La Coruña. It is a politacal argument that has been going on for 25 years, when it is simply the name of a city in 2 different languages. Much the same as London vs Londres.</p>
<p>I really hope we are not going to start seeing petty Spanish political arguments thrashed out here.</p>
<p>All 3 names are valid as all have been used at variuos times in history. And obviously 2 are stll being squabbled over.</p>
<p>sincerely</p>
