<dd>Can hardly qualify as harrassment when it was posted here and is factual. You have indeed attempted to have all of the above ACIM-related articles deleted. I think another editor pointed out something important about your activities: you don't understand that Wikipedia is not a "paper encyclopedia". I will certainly agree that it will be a long, long time before ACIM is written about in Encyclopedia Brittanica. But Wikipedia is not Encyclopedia Brittanica. Wikipedia has an article about <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_sex_tape.html" title="Celebrity sex tape">Celebrity sex tape</a> for pete's sake! As the other editor noted, "notability" on Wikipedia is a lot more lenient than in most print encyclopedias. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And the last person to remove the section from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgiveness.html" title="Forgiveness">forgiveness</a> was me, since I agree absolutely that ACIM is of insufficient significance to justify its inclusion in that article. It discusses the major religions, minor sects have no place there. I have also edited the above comment to reduce it's unnecessarily combative tone.

<dd>But forgiveness is the major aspect of ACIM. How many spiritual systems are primarily focused <i>on</i> forgiveness? Forgiveness is the centerpiece of ACIM. I don't think that can be said of any other spiritual system. Within the context of an article about forgiveness, I think that makes ACIM notable. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the information provided by the top comment and that both of these non-profit organizations bear the same trademark, they are at least a conglomeration or partnership and are also, as pointed out, the sole source of this book, which defines them, then, as self published resources. The information they provide can be used about the book, but do not provide any sort of notability for the book. Please read section 6.3 of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources guidelines</a> which are used to establish <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiability</a>.

<p>According to the first cited source, this book was written by hand by a psychologist while channeling "The Voice". The specific question which this article does <b>not</b> address and which all articles on books <b>certainly should</b> address is the name of the author of this book. Are the contents of this book the exact same as the original writings that took seven years to produce? Is there an objective third party reference that can verify this? Ste4k 07:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is actually a topic that I hope will be addressed in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> article. You seem to be unable to grasp that within the ACIM "community" the very authorship of this book is hotly debated. I mean, click on the above link and SEE. Or, actually, you should recall how heated it gets.</dd>

<dd>In short, no, what is presently published is NOT exactly what Helen Schucman took down. In point of fact, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a> and Kenneth Wapnick worked with Helen Schucman to edit ACIM and prepare it for publication. In the original manuscript, there was a great deal of personal information and advice for Helen and William. This was one of the major aspects of the court case; people accused Kenneth Wapnick of trying to control ACIM, and of actually rewriting it to his own liking and to interpreting it to his own liking. Further, there are differences between the first edition of ACIM and the second edition of ACIM (which was published after the deaths of both <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a> <i>and</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a> and was primarily overseen by the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> and Foundation for Inner Peace); the second edition contains a numbering system and a book not in the first edition, a book called "Clarification of Terms". -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the page looks like what Wikipedia calls "Original Research". This is because it is. The article was written by a (very kind) man who reads the Course and who was simply trying to provide information about it. He isn't in any way making money off of the Course. He simply likes to write articles about ACIM on Wikipedia. I am attempting to edit this page to make it more neutral, because, frankly, I like the thought of that. I'd like this page to be crisp and "cold" (what I mean is, I'd like this page to be completely without any flowery prose; flowery prose has its place, but usually not in such articles). -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Initial Image</span></h2>
<p>I believe the initial image should be removed. This is simply an ad for one variation of one version of ACIM. I do not believe the article should begin with advertising for FIP and FACIM. ACIM is available for free as public domain on the internet. This second edition of the FIP version has material that is not public domain including an outline numbering system and additional sections. It adds to the length of the article without adding content. Discussion? -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 18:31, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is an image of the written form of the book helpful to the article?

The image that this article has now is basically the same thing, since it has never been previously published. But also, this article should probably be renamed to "A Course in Miracles by Foundation of Inner Peace" since the name it has right now is causing a considerable amount of ambiguity and because the only version mentioned in this article and its references is the version by that publisher. Do you agree? Ste4k 17:16, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Does Wiki have legal permission to publish this image? If there is any uncertainty on this the image should be removed now until this is resolved. I believe that the image as is adds bias to the article. I do not agree that the article should be renamed as suggested. This would induce tremendous bias. Let me start a discussion on the versions. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 18:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If the article were renamed, then the main entry "Course in Miracles" could be given a dismabiguation page which is a normal practice on WP. Each version of the book could then have it's own article, and edit wars caused by ambiguity could be avoided in the future. It's seems like a very fair and neutral suggestion.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please do not rename the article. There is not enough variation in the versions to warrant separate articles at this time. Doing this would only increase the division that arose during the "Course war". This is my personal opinion but I believe that this article should mainly help someone not familiar with ACIM to answer the question, "What is "A Course in Miracles"?" As this page is refined it may be useful to have breakout articles relating to Course versions, the philosophy of ACIM, etc. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 19:07, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What exactly is the "Course War"? The fact that editors cannot agree on things only further substantiates that the name is highly ambiguous. I am still completely neutral on all of this, but the ambiguity seems to be the underlying problem. Some editors think X, and others think Y. Either an disambiguity page that seperates the topic should be done, or, the article should include all of the various factions and be sperated by sub-topic. In either instance the ambiguity that appears to be the base problem would be eliminated. As an encylopedia we should be striving to resolve ambiguity rather than become victims of it ourselves.

<p>It is quite common that editors (and people in general) do not agree. Perhaps we should focus on this topic of discussion - the initial image. I think keeping the image places Wiki at legal risk as it may violate FIP's copyright. It introduces bias at the beginning of the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Needs splitting</span></h2>
<p>The article probably needs splitting into A Course in Miracles (book) and A Course in Miracles (movement); the book can be described neutrally without reference to the movement, the movement would be a suitable merge target for a lot of material which AfD seems to think should be merged rather than given its own (largely uncited) treatment. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:15, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that the movement of students that this book has generated is inseparably related to the book itself, and that as such, any article about the movement would need to have an in depth treatment of the evolution of the book within it. To try to discuss the movement without such an in depth treatment would result in an incomplete article. Thus I feel that such a separation of this article would not be practical. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 12:35, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The book states that it is intended as a <i>self study</i> guide. Nowhere does the book state that it was written with any intention of starting a <i>movement</i>. Therefore it seems to me that even the use of the term <i>movement</i> becomes possibly confusing or possibly even controversial when attempting to describe the majority of the students of this book. The majority of those who study this text have no formal organization to which they belong, but prefer to gather only to read and directly discuss the text itself. To attempt to define the dynamics of such a group without directly discussing the text in detail would seem to me to be rather difficult and conterproductive. Separate articles for what I would refer to as <i>splinter groups</i> such as Endeavor Academy does seem to me to be in order. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 14:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually that is pretty much my point.

Have a look at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, by the way - look at the references, the way it's written, the tone of the article. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:41, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are certainly correct that there is a major difference between the Bible and Christianity. But in so far as I know, the majority of the students of ACIM could be described in a single sentence as those who consider ACIM as their primary written source of spiritual wisdom and inspiration, but who, in accordance with the recommendations of this book, have no official membership organization. Does this sentence deserve its own article?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Pruned" material</span></h2>
<p>I believe we have lost much valuable information as a result of JzG's "pruning" efforts. We should start an "A Course In Miracles (doctrine)" page for the fruit JzG dislikes. If it were not for JzG's positive intentions, I would call the result vandalism, so let's do better. I agree that there is much redundant information on this page, but the article is shifting too heavily toward contrasting ACIM with Christianity. A proper article on ACIM should describe its doctrine first, as it was meant to stand on it's own merit, and only afterward highlight obvious differences betwen ACIM teachings and non-ACIM interpretations of the standard interpretation of Christianity. JzG is assuming that a proper interpretation of ACIM is as Christian supplemental material, rather than the Christian Bible being supplemental ACIM material. He is not "playing the game", so to speak, and so long as he doesn't, this article <i>can't</i> be neutral, for playing ACIM's game is what it means to be charitable, and charity is what it means to be neutral. — <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler">Antireconciler</a> 21:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Only if it can be sourced from reliable secondary sources. The major problem with it was that the whole thing was completely unreferenced and read like a dissertation or homily. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, it's an encyclopaedia distilled from the body of knowledge as presented in reliable, independent secondary sources. Read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The problem is not with the truth, if truth it be, but with the fact that it is funcitonally indistinguishable from opinion. So, do start woith citations to reputable seocndary sources <i>outside</i> the movement. Commentary in standard texts on comparitive religion, references from psychological texts and so on. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:37, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Understandable. Surely Wikipedia is not a soapbox, nor should it provide incredible information, so I can understand your reasons for wanting to remove it. No one should be lead into misinformation at the hands of article writers who write to validate their own opinions instead of from a true objective desire to spread genuine knowledge. Such actions bring down the credibility of the entire encyclopedia, and thus its effectiveness.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, it's understandable to want to quote only reliable secondary sources outside the movement, for these will be objective, able to see outside ACIM's world and look in safely, untouched. And in ACIM's world, only the perfectly inclusive is true, and as such, to stand outside the movement and look in as an outsider ... well, this will be necessarily to miss the point, for this perspective is an <i>impossibility</i> for ACIM, and so ACIM will naturally be misperceived by a view from nowhere that tries to say anything meaningful about it. For one cannot understand by standing on the outside looking in objectively. Only those inside will understand, for inside is all there is to those inside, and the man on the outside is <i>inside not knowing it</i>. If ACIM <i>IS</i> true, then the man on the outside who is inside not knowing it is speaking as if he knew what it was like to be inside but cannot for the fundemental reason that the <i>error he makes cannot be contained as if it were an isolated instance</i> by the <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_explosion.html" title="Principle of explosion">principle of explosion</a></i>, which is a natural consequence of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_noncontradiction.html" title="Law of noncontradiction">law of noncontradiction</a>. Where Wikipedia has demanded an outside, separate, objective view, must the system fail where separation means nothing, for no concept is more critical for ACIM to make <i>any sense at all</i>, again, by the aforementioned principles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Where separation means nothing, then, allow us to plea an exception to Wikipedia's rules, which <i>must</i> fail in such instances. Perhaps if we post a disclaimer in the "main tenets" section that the information is <i><b>in principle</b> unverifiable and unintelligible by objective outside means</i>, we will be able to post valuable information of such a nature on Wikipedia. Otherwise, we have done ourselves a disservice. Despite the demise of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_positivism.html" title="Logical positivism">logical positivism</a>, many will still believe that scientific, objective verifiability is what it means for a statement to be meaningful.

<dd>I'm not sure I understand you correctly Antireconciler. I haven't ever read any of the books with this title, but I can read. I have found several secondary sources about various things to do with this specific version of this title. One does not need, in fact, it is in my opinion detrimental to the process to know anything at all about the subject matter as an editor. If a verifiable source is found, then it's quite an easy task to add content to an article. Just repeat what that source says. *poof* voila! Everything just falls into place. Nobody expects that to be rocket science, of course, <b>BUT</b> the good part is, there are many, many editors on WP that will come along and clear out the POV, the misspailings, the awkward grammar, do cite checks, rearrange for aesthetic quality, etc., etc. Anything else that doesn't come from a verifiable secondary source, is just opinion and belongs in the opinion bin under the heading original research.

Your comment reminds me of Woody Allen's joke that he cheated on a metaphysics exam by looking into the soul of the person next to him.

<dd>Science does have its role. It is does not encompass all of academic study which is usually considered to fall both within art and science. This is particularly true of philosophy, psychology, and religion.

<dd>Just in case you aren't able to complete the effort, I have reapplied the tag. You were able to knock it down by 3K which is good. The other article hasn't anything to do with this article. The other article is about all of the various books that stemmed from the original texts. This article is only about one specific book printed by one specific publisher, The Foundation for Inner Peace (a.k.a. FACIM and highly associated with the acronym "ACIM" which is their trademark).

<p>The article is now down to 33 kilobytes. I believe this is focused on one specific book with multiple variations published by numerous sources. FIP and FACIM are two different but closely tied organizations. The trademark on "ACIM" has been revoked by the US Patents Office (see elsewhere). It may be useful to retain the tag for now to help prevent unnecessary additions. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 21:24, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All templates applied to this article are both being actively discussed on this page as well as serve the primary purpose of attracting the attention of other editors who perform cleanup to this page. There is nothing at all derogatory about a template which is being used to help improve the article. I think that you misunderstand the purpose of such templates and should be instead happy that many other editors will be notified that this article needs help. You should avoid becoming too attached to any specific article since there are <a href="../../../b/a/c/WP%7EBACKLOG_2f07.html" title="WP:BACKLOG">WP:BACKLOG</a> quite a few articles on Wikipedia that could use your attention.

<p>Ste4k, please be advised that as a Wikipedia editor it is not your appropriate place to inform fellow editors of the appropriate state of their emotional ("happy" or "sad") reaction with regard to the placement of templates in given Wikipedia articles, e.g, <i>"I think that you misunderstand the purpose of such templates and should be instead happy that many other editors will be notified that this article needs help."</i> This is not a therapy session but an encyclopedia article. The time saved from informing others of the appropriate emotional reaction may allow you to take your own advise and devote your considerable energies to the large backlog of various articles that could use your attention.

<p>My Contributions are readily available if you believe that I spend an undue amount of time in that regard. Per advising my use of the word "happy" you should be aware that it is the resolution of a complaint and a suggestion for consensus.

Please refer to the guidelines for such matters, specifically <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> regarding personal attacks, and suggestions on ways to prevent them.

Helen Schucman's reluctance to endorse the Course and her eventual descent into psychotic depression is cited as evidence that she was initially Thetford's unwitting dupe but finally came to understand the nature of the movement she had helped to initiate.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>"</dd>

<li>The second source,<a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina31214.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina31214.htm" rel="nofollow">A Course In Miracles (ACIM). The Miracle of Brainwashing</a>, doesn't offer any actual analysis for the claim made. It also states that Schucman was influenced by "Jewish propaganda" growing up and that the heterodoxy of ACIM can be attributed to her being a Jew. It is just a rant, not a well-thought out criticism and it is not claimed to be the view of anybody beyond the author. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 01:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Example?</span></h2>
<p>In the comparison section on forgivness, etc., There is a cited statement: "For example: Jesus, teaching in the 'Lord's Prayer' about forgiveness, says, "God forgives our trespasses just as we forgive (the trespasses of) those who trespass against us." This seems to be slightly inconsistent with other Biblical passages describing how we are forgiven only through "Christ's blood, even the forgiveness of sins" and the note refers to a passage in a bible: "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace." This seems to be a either a very poor example, or confusing, or both. How can a statement made about a person after death based on that person's teaching be contrasted to that person's teaching using that person's own words? It seems to be rather contradictory to say that the person agrees with himself as an example of how two perspectives contradict themselves. Either way, it looks like OR using the A = True, B= True, therefor synthesis A + B = C must be true. I didn't delete it, but I think someone else should take a close look at it. Ste4k 17:23, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The passage discusses Christian teaching, which includes both the Lord's Prayer and Ephesians (in which the cited passage is found). Most Christians would think that both are the inspired word of God, so comparing them is valid. As an aside, the passage quoted above mischaracterizes the Lord's Prayer, which is an entreaty to God and does not guarantee forgiveness from him if someone forgives other people. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 18:13, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also agree that OR could be a problem here, but cites have been promised, so let's give other editors some time to go back through their source material. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 18:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
