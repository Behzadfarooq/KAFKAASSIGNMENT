<p>Malcolm, you removed the following from the article: Yeah Malcolm, jesss</p>
<dl>
<dd>The film caused some controversy at the time in Britain for its violence, with the press blaming an attack on a homeless person on the influence of the film: the outcry annoyed Kubrick so much that he personally withdrew the film from distribution in the United Kingdom. As a result, the film could not be seen in Britain for some 27 years, until after Kubrick's death.</dd>

<p>Seems to be useful information if true. Why not include it? --<a href="../../../l/m/s/User%7ELMS_bc9d.html" title="User:LMS">LMS</a></p>
<p>Oops...I must have deleted it accidentally when I added the plot summary. And, yes, it's true. I saw it when it was released, I remember the press outcry shortly after (as if teenage males have ever required <i>any</i> reason other than alcohol for unprovoked assaults) , and I remember it being almost totally impossible to see it in the Uk for all that time, barring a few unauthorised showings here and there. When it finally became available on video in the UK last year, it hit the bestseller charts for some weeks.- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolm_Farmer_a328.html" title="User:Malcolm Farmer">Malcolm Farmer</a></p>

<hr />
<p>IIRC: The novel as written and as published in Great Britain is divided into three parts of seven chapters apiece. The first American edition, upon which the movie was based, omits the 21st chapter. In this closing chapter, Alex is presented as having survived and recuperated somewhat from his manipulative experiences. He encounters Pete, another former member of his gang, who has become a responsible citizen (in contrast to Georgie and Dim, who became brutal policemen). Presumably, the American publisher removed it to make the book more, well, what we'd today call "hardcore".</p>

<dd>Is the US version still minus a final chapter?

<dd>I didn't get much info on the usage of the phrase. One website says the phrase was in use in the 1920s. where as the book's author Anthony Burgess was born only in 1917, and the book written in 1962. If there are any Londoners here, they can research on the origins of the phrase.</dd>
<dd>By the way, Burgess himself, in the preface of the book says he took the title from the phrase.

<p>Burgess's title is the first recorded use of the phrase, and no-one knows if he made it up or not. There are analogies in Cockney ("As queer as a bottle of chips", for example) but no known 'clockwork orange'. Garrick92 13:33, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Growing up in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a> in NE England in the 50's and 60's, I must have heard the expression "You're as useless as a clockwork orange", or "You're as useful as a clockwork orange" quite a few times. When the movie appeared I had no trouble with the "source" of the title. If the novel caused a stir among the chattering classes in London ("doon tha Smoke" was the local way of referring to the place) it didn't penetrate the North. Burgess probably knew as much about working class slang as the first Pres. Bush knew about supermarkets. One of the hazards of a class-ridden society, I'm afraid. Burgess wouldn't have even bothered to name a source if he'd been a prole - the expression would have part of his environment. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdaedalus_ce55.html" title="User:Djdaedalus">Djdaedalus</a> 19:40, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe the Italian translation of "Clockwork Orange" is actually "Arancia Meccanica", as in "Mechanical Orange". But I suppose the meaning is the same...</p>
<dl>
<dd>The title of the first Italian translation of the book (1968) was indeed the literal "Un'arancia a orologeria". The 1971 film was translated as "Arancia meccanica". Recent reprints of the book have adopted the film title, most likely because the expression has become with the years a catch-all phrase in the Italian language to indicate any sort of juvenile group violence.

<p>I've noticed that we now have a paragraph about <i>A Clockwork Orgy,</i> the pornographic take-off of Kubrick's film. The article mentioned this particular "derivative work" before, but the passage was claimed to be irrelevant and therefore got nixed. My thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version we had before was marginally more informative. It gave the title and indicated that ultra-violence had been replaced by "ultra-sex" (which makes the tagline "rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven" a bit of a pleonasm, doesn't it?).</li>
<li>To my knowledge, neither Burgess nor Kubrick had any invovlement with the filming of <i>A Clockwork Orgy.</i> Shouldn't the article spend more time discussing the stage version, for example, which Burgess <i>did</i> write?</li>
<li>Claims about a pornographic movie's quality are highly contestable. Saying that <i>Orgy</i> is "surprisingly well-produced" verges on POV; the previous version made some comment about "production values", which (to me) implies more a financial than an artistic judgment. When I saw <i>Orgy,</i> at a party several months ago, a young woman commented that Alexandra was not as talented as she should have been.</li>

<p>As for the names of the new articles, ACO is straightforward enough: the book came first, and the film was adapted later. The case of 2001 is perhaps more controversial, since Kubrick and Clarke worked on the screenplay/novel(ization) simultaneously. In this instance, I’m going to favor Kubrick: 1) The film was released first and 2) The film is undoubtedly the more better known of the pair (and thus the more likely target of a search).</p>

<p>"As the colour orange can be a symbol for protestantism, the title may be making a specific statement about British Christians or British Christianity."</p>

It reeks of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> and it's very worrying to connect Protestantism with a film about "rape and ultra-violence" without citing any sources.

Alexander's friends have names such as Z. Dolin and D. B. da Silva). It should probably be edited though. Casey.Kitty 19:36, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A few fans of both <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Warriors_dd79.html" title="The Warriors">The Warriors</a></i> and this piece would argue that Alex's gang is actually part Baseball Furies and part Hi-Hats, the gang seen in the beginning that looks a fair bit like mimes. One way or the other, it's fair to say that Kubrick's work greatly inspired The Warriors.--207.218.96.3 15:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that Wikipedia articles tend to attract too much plot detail for their own good. That is, the presence of a plot summary tends to attract more people who "can add something" and add another detail, until any encyclopedic value of the summary is swamped like a high school book report with detail. Things like " sleeps until he is woken by Dr. P. R. Deltoid, his post-correctional advisor, whom he then has a conversation with." I propose radical surgery on the plot to reduce it to the relevant points. This might also reduce the constant need to pick out contributions from people who have confused film and book. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Two points here: first, it seems to me this section should be named "Nasdat" as that is the only topic covered in the section.</p>
<p>Secondly, the theories put forth about Bugress' invention and use of Nasdat seem to be either "original research" (and hence should be removed), or require citations. Is it true that Burgess used Nasdat to avoid the book getting dated? Or that he wanted to distance readers from the violence by using a "linguistic veil?" Neither argument seems compelling to me, but regardless of my opinion, they are opinions (original research), in need of citation, or striking.</p>
<p>This slavic connections seems stupid to me, so what if some names could be russian WHO CARES, people dont read these articles to find out if dim could be a russian name shortened. im deleting it from the article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackinaw_2763.html" title="User:Mackinaw">Mackinaw</a> 22:40, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have spent a great deal of time analyzing this book and i have read and edited the article, but what I really want to know is why is there no section on references to other literary works? I mean, while reading it i picked up several parallels to fight scenes in Shakespeare and references to Greek mythology. Am I the only one who noticed? <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENargleFishHat_8333.html" title="User:NargleFishHat">NargleFishHat</a> 22:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it isn't really about what you or I noticed. What did critics and literary analysts notice? Everything in the article should be from a reliable source; Wikipedia's editors shouldn't be seeking or finding stuff in the text. At least, that's my interpretation of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 23:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right, I understand that, but i spoke with one of my teachers and he said that it was an important part of the novel, and that Wikipedia should have them listed. I tragically am too dumb to recognize all of them to make an accurate listing or even suggest adding the topic, the discussion page is fine with me. 71.113.44.5 05:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
