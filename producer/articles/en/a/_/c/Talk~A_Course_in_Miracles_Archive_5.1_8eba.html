(Note: This discussion material is from a period when four or five editors, some of whom had admittedly not read any of the ACIM material, attempted to create an unusual POV fork article. One of these editors was permanently banned from Wikipedia due to his generally divisive behavior as a result of this. The POV fork article was ultimately also voted for deletion. Some constructive changes to the article did eventually result. I am not certain as to exactly how there appear to be two overlapping discussion archives for this period, however I have created this archive 5.1 in the interests of not losing this information. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 13:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">References</span></h2>
<p>The book "Foundation for Inner Peace; Wapnick, Kenneth (Feb 1, 1997). Concordance of 'A Course in Miracles'. Viking Adult. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0670869953</a>." is not a reference source. I own the book. It is a concordance for ACIM. It is not a reference source and I think it should be removed.

<p>I do own "Wapnick, Kenneth (Apr1991). Absence from Felicity. Foundation for a Course in Miracles. 0-933291-08-6." I believe it is a useful reference source for the article.

<p>"Branch, Rick (1994). The Watchman Expositor: A Course in Miracles Profile. Watchman Fellowship, Inc.. Retrieved on July 18, 2006." I did find this article on the net. It seems useful as an online reference.

I do own this book as well as a number of other versions of ACIM. It is a primary source.

<p>Do the editors involved with this article really wish to understand the material and work together in good faith to improve the article? If so, this will require obtaining and studying the references. I am willing to do so.

<dd>Why is there a references section in the first third of the article, and then another one at the end? There should only be one references section, IMO.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I agree. I do not understand the WP reference software yet. I am asking for help with this. I also question which of the references meet WP criteria.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 17:32, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just learned that "A Supplement to A Course in Miracles" appears to no longer be available. Perhaps it should be removed from the references?--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 23:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am in the process of obtaining the reference books for this article. Since the ref. above is not available I am going to remove it from the article.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 15:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I looked at a book that I do have that can be used for Terminology section. I added it to the References. When I went to the website, I see it has been replaced by a new edition. Any suggestions? Does my reference need to be corrected or augmented?<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 15:27, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that we should retrieve the articles. I would like to re-visit whether each article should be merged or stand alone with a link from the main page. It also depends on the vote on the new poll in terms of which article will be the beginning. In any case, I think the information should be retrieved and perhaps placed on the sandbox page.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#008080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 20:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, some of those may need to be revisited. I also think the <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_25fc.html" title="A Course in Miracles (book)">A Course in Miracles (book)</a> AfD was irregular and should be reviewed too.

<dd>I agree. The material from Attitudinal Healing was maybe a pair of sentences that I deleted earlier because they really were usless. The original article must have been a very short stub. I also think it was nonsense that the material from A Course in Miracles (book) was deleted. If there is not a more effective means of reintegrating the material, I have a copy of it at its prime. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 02:15, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, some of the mergers were very minor, but we should at least mention the topics. The "A Course in Miracles (book)" AfD deleted the name, but the contents should certainly be included here. On reflection I suppose there's no need to review the AfD, since the name wasn't helpful. Any admin, myself included, can dig out the deleted material from A Course in Miracles (book), in case Antireconciler's copy isn't complete. That stuff (at least the NPOV, verifiable material) should go in here too. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">was bold</a> and shortened this section. It now only presents "basic tenets" of ACIM, rather than lengthy quotes. I also removed many of the "our" and "we" formatted references since that tone is not encyclopedic.

<dd>Ok, then tell me how my edit made the article "worse." Just being well-written and sourced doesn't mean the content is appropriate. This section is called "Basic tenets". The first sentence notes that it has roots in psychology and englightenment. Why do we need additional mention of that at length further down in teh section. You don't. Just state what the <i>basic tenets</i> are, cite the source, and move on. This isn't supposed to be a book report or instruction manual. Further, sentences like this are inappropriate for an encyclopedia: <i>the Course focuses on our awakening to our oneness with the Divine. Our perception changes so that we no longer see ourselves as separate.</i> This sounds like a recruting brochure or personal testamony, not an encyclopedic description of what the book's "basic tenets" are. And the "In summary" paragraph is redundant to the opening paragraph. I could go on. IMO, this section <i>is not</i> well-written, and should be trimmed accordingly. (BTW, not <i>every</i> change should have to be discussed. This is a wiki, afterall) <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_dog_07fd.html" title="User:Not a dog">Not a dog</a> 14:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) Let's also discuss: the article should continue to present ACIM as a form of Christianity even though it's not. I plan on making some changes to the article this weekend and will <i>not</i> wait for your preapproval. You had no problem when, earlier this week, I added positive material about ACIM. Why do you have a problem with NOt a dog's changes now. Most of the reliable sources I have found present ACIM in a postive light incidentially. It's the article's unencyclopedic, prosyletizing tone that is the major problem here. I have tried to discuss the differences between ACIM and Christianity above, but you did not respond to that. Work has been needed on this article for a long time. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 23:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am tired of the conflict here and am taking a wikibreak. You say that ACIM is not Christian. There are many definitions of what a Christian is. My Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a Christian as "one who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ." Please see Wiktionary <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/christian" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/christian" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In the WP <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> article the first paragraph gives a few simple beliefs of Christians. Even though these are only a few beliefs it is noted that not all Christians hold all of these beliefs. ACIM itself has its foundation on the Christian Bible (as noted in ACIM) and the author as Jesus Christ makes many references to his life on Earth and the Christian Bible. You may also wish to do a Google search on the Unity Church and ACIM. I do agree that some of the teaching of ACIM are different from most Christian churches. What is perhaps most threatening to Christian churches is that ACIM focuses on a direct relationship with God through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit rather than going through the intermediary of clergy and churches, although it is not in opposition to clergy and churches. Hope this helps.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 02:54, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Enjoy your wikibreak. The reliable secondary sources I have found characterize ACIM as eastern, possibly a form of <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedanta.html" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a>, rather than Christian. These are from within the New Age movement itself or from friendly scholars like Hanegraaff, not from Christian ministers, incidentally. My own reading in ACIM would tend to confirm this as ACIM seems to be inconsistent with the great majority of the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>. To call it Christian would be to take an extremely broad definition of that term! Saying that it is Christian because it contains a teaching from Christ is relying on an unproven assertion that the voice Schuchman heard really was Christ. We shouldn't be making a judgment on this one way or the other. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:18, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I am still on my wikibreak, I thought I would take a few minutes to respond. I have never heard of the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>. In reading the article there are many Christian groups that do not accept it. Even in those that do, there is controversy between versions. The dictionary seems to provide a broad definition of Christians as those who believe that Jesus Christ is Divine. ACIM is somewhat different than other scripture that appears to rely on belief. The purpose of ACIM is not a universal theology but a universal experience. What attracts me to ACIM is the theoretical framework which I find internally logical and consistent with my many peak spiritual experiences. I am a "doubting Thomas" and have difficulty accepting something on faith. I am not saying that one has to believe that the author was Jesus Christ. Almost any assertion about religion is unproven. Religion is outside the scientific model. I am saying it is Christian because ACIM, as it is written, identifies the author as Jesus Christ whether one believes that or not. A similar argument would apply to the Christian Bible. The Bible relies on the unproven assertion that Jesus Christ is Divine and that that the unproven material in the Bible is true. I agree as editors it is not our place to say if it is true or not. I believe our place is to present to the reader what ACIM is about. As noted in the Basic tenets section, Christianity is only one category that ACIM fits into. It also fits into Eastern spirituality. I hope this makes sense.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 04:50, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, my main point above was that the reliable secondary sources (those external to ACIM) do not regard it as Christian. It's what <i>they</i> think that's important, not what we think. ACIM is a new religion trying to expand. Nothing wrong with that. It would obviously like to piggyback on a major brand. That is not our problem. My main concern is that the article implies that ACIM is not that different from Catholicism, Protestantism, etc., when even the most basic beliefs are completely different.</dd>
<dd>In response to your post, the Nicene Creed is a statement of the basic beliefs of Christianity and is well-known to Christians, whether you have heard of it or not. The article does not say there are many groups that do not accept it. There are a few who do not regard it as authoritative because it is not contained in the Bible (<i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_scriptura.html" title="Sola scriptura">sola scriptura</a></i>), but even they agree with its praecepts. Even though there are different versions of the creed, ACIM is vastly different from any of them.</dd>
<dd>I would propose we solve this by limiting claims on whether ACIM is Christian or not to claims in reliable secondary sources. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, still on wikibreak but I thought I would address this. I read the <a href="../../../q/u/o/WP%7EQUOTE_12ae.html" title="WP:QUOTE">WP:QUOTE</a> article. I think that quotes are useful. Although I have not looked at the Basic tenets section recently, I think the use of quotes there is good.

I think the <b>Summary style</b> and <b>Rationale</b> work well for this article. If a reader wants a little information they can just read the Introduction. If they want a little more they can read the Basic tenets. I they want more they can read the entire article and then See also and External Links. I agree that the theology and psychology sections are a mess right now. To properly develop those sections will take some time as sources need to be studied, outlined, and then the sections need to be written and re-written. My intention was to begin to work on the theology section next (I think the psychology section depends on the theology section). Rather than trimming them right now, please consider putting a stub or some other tag there. My intention is to replace these sections with well written material that is sourced and cited. It does take time and I have only so much time to devote to WP.

<dd>Hi. The size is no longer an issue as the article is now below suggested article size. I think JChap and I are content with the quotes as they now stand (last I checked). Although many articles are above the suggested size, perhaps someone could write a second article on the teachings of ACIM that would go into more detail on the theology, psychology, and relationships. On the other hand, I think these would be useful in the main article with a size over suggested limits.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 15:28, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On the role of the Savior</span></h2>
<p>The theology section needs much work, but particularly, the "On the role of the Savior" has a number of inconsistencies and unsupported claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>The claim that the course states "Jesus is not the only savior" isn't supported by the following text. All that is indicated is that the Course doesn't need a savior. Nowhere is it presented that there could be more than one (unless this is referring to the fact that people are the source of their own salvation).</li>
<li>After saying that there is no need for a savior, and the people are the source of their own salvation, the section goes on to say that "nowhere does ACIM teach that a 'Savior' is unnecessary for salvation" This is some kind of double-negative statement, which is philosophically weak, and seems inaccurate since just above it is noted that "We do not need a savior."</li>
<li>Again, after quoting the book of saying "we do not need a savior," the section goes on to argue that "the need for a 'Savior' is stressed consistently throughout ACIM" This is highly inconsistent.</li>
<li>The statement "only full recognition of the exceptionless presence of the sinlessness of Christ, the 'Savior', in the Sonship is required for salvation" isn't supported by the citation given "When brothers join in purpose .. (recognizing the Christ in one another)... they quickly reach the gate of Heaven itself."</li>
</ol>
<p>Are these errors in the writing of this section, or do such inconcsistencies exist naturally in ACIM? Based on the provided info, I suggest the following re-write for this section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Course strays from traditional Christian theology in that recognition of Jesus Christ as the Savior is not necessary for salvation. ACIM interprets the crucifixion and the resurrection to be an example of how the power and example of Christ's forgiveness was so great that ultimately even the greatest of physical assaults could not hold or affect him.</i></dd>

<dd>As this was all uncited I removed it. In terms of your suggested re-write, the first statement is controversial. The second statement, IMO, is true. ACIM places the emphasis on the Resurrection rather than the Crucifixion.

<dd>I was just trying to work with what was there, as I have no intimate knowledge as to what the actual beliefs re JC are. However, when you say the first statement is "controversial," do you mean that it is contested within the ACIM community? It if is a true statement, which happens to be a controversial one, it should still be included, no? <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_dog_07fd.html" title="User:Not a dog">Not a dog</a> 19:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have tried to work with what was there as well but we do not know who wrote it and it was unsourced. JChap wanted to start all over. As you have pointed out we do not want to add uncited material. Perhaps "controversial" is the wrong word. ACIM is written in the first person with Jesus as the author. It is not a text of religious dogma that requires blind faith. It is a transformative guide to change the way we perceive the world so that its teachings become self-evident. ACIM has many aspects in terms of our awakening. These include Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and each other. Jesus does have a pivotal role. Here are a couple of quotes:
<dl>
<dd>"I inspire all miracles, which are really intercessions. They intercede for your holiness and make your perceptions holy. By placing you beyond the physical laws they raise you into the sphere of celestial order. In this order you ARE perfect."</dd>
<dd>"I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. When you offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you do it to YOURSELF and me. The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily. My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not otherwise correct. When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself...The power to work miracles belongs to you. I will provide the opportunities to do them, but you must be ready and willing. Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, because conviction comes through accomplishment. The ability is the potential, the achievement is its expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of God, is the purpose."</dd>
<dd>"The Holy One shares my trust, and accepts my Atonement decisions because my will is never out of accord with His. I have said before that I am in charge of the Atonement. This is only because I completed my part in it as a man, and can now complete it through others. My chosen channels cannot fail, because I will lend them my strength as long as theirs is wanting."

<dd>I read the lessons you mentioned. Part of the lessons mention the Holy Spirit. I think ACIM and mainstream Christianity would agree that both Jesus and the Holy Spirit play a pivotal role in our salvation. What I think these lessons add is that our true Self also plays a pivotal role. I believe this is the Christ Mind that we share. Is this what you are saying?<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 14:47, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I am not associated with the sites or people. I think <a href="http://facim.org/" class="external text" title="http://facim.org/" rel="nofollow">Foundation for A Course in Miracles</a>and <a href="http://www.circleofa.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.circleofa.org/" rel="nofollow">Circle of Atonement</a> are similar sites. Both people are well known within the Course community. Both offer additional resources. I removed "Robert Perry's site" to make it consistent with the others and because COA is more than just Robert Perry. I suppose "Kenneth Wapnick's site" could have been added to <a href="http://facim.org/" class="external text" title="http://facim.org/" rel="nofollow">Foundation for A Course in Miracles</a> instead.</dd>
<dd>There is a long list of other sites that could be included. <a href="http://www.awakening-mind.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.awakening-mind.org/" rel="nofollow">Foundation for the awakening-mind</a> appears to be a one person site. He is not published except for material on the net that I know of. I do not know this person. I have not come across him in my readings. The main page has a place for "Donations" and "Make a Donation". This site appears to be added for advertizing reasons.</dd>
<dd>If we wish to add a much more extensive list of internet resources then I am not opposed to this as long as the site does not contain material that may be in violation of existing copyrights.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 18:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not at all suggesting creating a long list of links (see <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>), but if the existence of a "Make a donation" disqualifies a site, then quite a few external links would have to be removed across Wikipedia, including <a href="http://www.circleofa.org/circle/donation.php" class="external text" title="http://www.circleofa.org/circle/donation.php" rel="nofollow">Circle of Atonement</a>. Also, just to be clearn, whether or not you have "come across him in your readings" is not a satisfactory reason to remove a link. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_dog_07fd.html" title="User:Not a dog">Not a dog</a> 23:15, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Links that are added to promote a site, that primarily exist to sell products or services, with objectionable amounts of advertising, or that require payment to view the relevant content, colloquially known as external link spamming." This is a spam external link for David Hoffmeister who (according to the site) received $28,357 in donations in 2005. This paid for his personal travel, occupancy, telephone, and other misc items.</dd>

<dd>I'm familiar with the policy, thanks. You were suggesting, however, that the mere existence of a "donations" page meant this site was inserted for "advertizing reasons" I'm just saying that isn't a valid assumption, nor a de facto reason to prohibit a site.

<dd>Actually it is a guideline rather than a policy. I was simply trying to make my reasons more clear. I do not have any personal objections to David Hoffmeister or his site. I noticed that other external links have been removed that I thought were useful to the reader. I do not think we should link to material in violation of copyright. If we can all agree, I would be happy to extend the external links to a dozen or so including David's. I think they would be helpful to the reader. By providing a selection we would not be biasing the article to one person or group.

<dd>No the Foundation for the awakening mind was not put there for advertizing reasons. It is a valuable external link just as the Circle of Atonement link is. I am not going to check every day if you removed it or not. I really don't see the point in going back and forth adding and deleting a couple of links. It should be fine to have a few external links. including those two.</dd>

<dd>Some versions of ACIM are still under copyright or the copyright status is unclear. I think the FIP 2nd edition remains under a valid copyright.
