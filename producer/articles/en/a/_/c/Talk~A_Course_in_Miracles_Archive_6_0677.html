<dd>Well, according to the GtL, maybe when you have some other methods described you can carve it into sections. Btw, why do you keep adding that trivia about the copyright stuff into the topic paragraph? It's off topic since the article isn't about copyrights and stuff but about the Course in Miracles. I mean, who cares? It's trivial and digresses the paragraph. <a href="../../../z/g/h/User%7EZghost_945b.html" title="User:Zghost">Zghost</a> 12:50, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason I think that the title "methodology" is inaccurate is that it is too broad. What is being desrcibed is how ACIM uses language. As this is the only aspect of the methodology described thus far the title is misleading as it suggests that this is the entire methodology. Perhaps semantics would be best. It would be helpful if the use of male nouns and pronouns could be discussed here as this is a point of confusion.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 12:03, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>This may be laughable to him but then so would be Christianity or any other spiritual/religious work that uses male or female nouns or pronouns. It is my belief that this reflects the limitations of the English language rather than God being male. The Course describes our true identity as spirit rather than bodies. Sexual terms refer to bodies. In the English language male terms may enclude everyone such as "mankind" as opposed to "womenkind".<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 11:54, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Without access to the source, I can't verify the accuracy of the quote, but while both of you should calm down, I agree mostly with Who123. If the text quoted by him is correct, then the quote deleted was a minor misquote. More appropriate would have been to correct it. I agree with Zghost on this: whether you disagree with the criticism isn't the point. If you think it's being given undue weight, the argue for its deletion on that, or delete it with that comment. If the reason is misquoting, then correct it. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 03:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does not seem reasonable to include a criticism that finds a religious work laughable because it uses male nouns and pronouns to refer to God. It is not saying God is male; it is a limitation of the English language. This person would then find laughable any religious work doing this including all of Christianity and other major religions. The source is an online source and is available.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 12:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_Opinion_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Third Opinion">Third opinion</a>: I've now read the quote (thought it was a book reference). The quote <b>was</b> accurate: "Meanwhile another important question demands to be answered: Why pay attention to a book that comes across as <b>astonishing if not irritating or laughable?</b> Why waste our energy on a movement of students that people with ‘common sense’ regard a movement of other-worldly people?" And this is a criticism of the entire book, not the side reference to the use of male pronouns. There was previous characterization as "laughable" the fact that the 'Voice' is Christ. The male pronoun remark is in an inner paragraph, with the text "Almost as irritating, or in accordance with personal mentality as laughable, may come across the fact that, for example God as source of love and the Holy Spirit are referred to as being male.". So I would now say a) the quote was in fact an accurate quote, and b) the quote does reflect the overall opinion of the critic of the work, and c) I don't see that that critic put much weight into the male pronoun argument, since they followed it immediately with "But it is especially all the seemingly christian concepts, because next to the central concept of forgiveness, the text is teeming with concepts like sins reconciliation, redemption, Holy Spirit, The Kingdom of God, Heaven and sin." Also, the writer is not a native English speaker. So overall, on this issue, I'd say I agree with Zghost. Also, as per before, if your argument is with the quality of the criticism or that it's non-notable, make that argument here. Having read it, I think it's totally appropriate to have this link in a criticism section. Details of what text should be quoted or how the criticism is characterized can be argued, but the male pronoun argument is not a strong one.
<p>I'm also astonished by the number of edits on this page. Guys, <b>slow down</b>, if you're doing extensive rework discuss it first, maybe even float some proposals. There were so many edits I got lost trying to find the edits this controvery started about. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 13:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not opposed to including the reference. My main concern is that a certain amount of sensitivity and respect for each others religious beliefs be maintained on WP. Some might find the idea that Jesus rose from the dead or that God dictated the Koran to Muhammad laughable. Some might find atheists (those who believe God does not exist) are as laughable as theists. I do not think this is suitable for a WP article. In addition, pointing out that the author of the article was bewildered is simply saying that he does not understand the material.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 16:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Resetting indent level) Ok, so the proposal on the table is to delete the astonishing...laughable quote based on POV reasoning. I.e. including the quote doesn't add to a neutral article. I can see that; the wording is mildly inflammatory. Summarizing the criticism (in a NPOV manner) is reasonable in a section on criticism. The current 1-sentence (or so) summaries could be expanded, though it would probably be better to write an overall cohesive paragraph or two on criticism with &lt;ref&gt;'s rather than a series of links and short summaries. "Wikipedia is not a link farm". Comments on this proposal, then? Proposal: leave that quotation out. Alternatively either replace it with a better textual summary or better quote (propose one here), or take a shot at rewriting the entire criticism section as a section instead of a listing of links. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 17:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I am saying is that POV opinions that are derogatory (especially in sensitive areas like someone's religious beliefs) do not belong on WP. I think the references are fine. I think the other criticisms are reasonable. Perhaps this author's criticisms to ACIM could be summed up without his personal POV about it being astonishing...laughable or him being bored or bewildered by it?

<dl>
<dd>The legal stuff is not trivia. After the death of Bill and Helen the now invalid copyright was used to stifle Course discussion though lawsuits and threatened lawsuits. Authors could not publish their works as they first had to be approved. Even fair use was not allowed through the intimidation of lawsuits. Discussion groups could not use "A Course in Miracles" or "ACIM". Much of the Course discussion over the past number of years has involved this oppression and the lawsuit. It is important for readers to know that it is OK to use "A Course in Miracles" and "ACIM".<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 12:13, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>well, thats all covered in the sentence above that says the copyright was voided. The details are trivial. The court said it was void, and thats that. The other thing you didn't answer was where you cited that info from. The reference only has one sentence on the end that says the judge ordered it void. The article can't have more in it than the references support. When you can answer that question and explain how/why the trivial details of how a copyright is voided is important to the average Joe Q. Public, let us all know. Is it real important to you for some reason? <a href="../../../z/g/h/User%7EZghost_945b.html" title="User:Zghost">Zghost</a> 12:59, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks to me like you are disagreeing with yourself. Let me repeat what you just said and point out the heart of the matter by replacing one word: It is trivial to inform the public that they, as well as the copyright, have been voided if one can simply look it up on-line at the US Trademarks site. Let me explain that a little better... the only people that would care about such details are people that are trying to register a new copyright or their lawyers. The project goal is to create an encyclopedia. It's not to keep track of redundant trivia that only special groups of people are extremely interested in. The information itself does not support the article in any manner. There aren't any sentences that leave questions in the mind that this information answers. The flow of the intro paragraph in centered on the Course, the texts. As a topic, the Course is the theme in all of the sentences in that paragraph. The digression I was speaking of occurs when that theme changes from "What is the Course" to "How exactly was the copyright on the Course voided". And the manner in which the copyright was voided is *not* atypical in any respect. For example, the Queen of England didn't issue an edict, no buildings were torn down trying to find the filing cabinet, and Hurricane Katrina wasn't blamed on being an act of God in retribution for the voiding of this copyright. Its trivial. It wasn't the first copyright to ever be voided, and it certainly won't be the last. So, I repeat my question to you...</dd>

<dd>In my estimation, it is usually easier to first get right to the point and to discuss specifically how one feels the article might best be improved, or made more accurate than to do anything else first. For example, it seems that if someone else may have inadvertently inserted inaccurate information, it would be easier to first state here exactly what information you feel is more accurate and why, than to simply tell the other that you feel their information is inaccurate. For me, the first type of approach has sometimes seemed to keep the discussion more civil and informative for all, whereas the second type of approach has tended to usually end up in bad feelings and "edit-war" type of behavior. I am glad that you have started this dialogue thread here and that you are obviously trying to work this out here on the discussion page first.</dd>

<dd>Hi Scott. I agree that any editing that causes controversy should be brought to the Talk page. This is the approach I have taken all along. If there is a specific area of controversy then let's bring it to the talk page for discussion with a short specific title. Working on WP should be a pleasant and rewarding experience. As this article has been so controversial for so long I think the tag on this Talk page should remain for now.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 13:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh..... I had hoped that the tone of "dispute" and "heated debate" might have been gone beyond here by now. This talk page was generally an area of consensus for years up until last July when I got married and didn't have the time to attend to it and others started arguing and having edit-wars here. I still very much hope that a tone of civility and consensus might be able to return to this page at some time in the very near future so that those sad tags could soon be removed by a consensus of the current editors. I hope to be able to devote more of my time to this article over the next few months.</dd>

<dd>Hi Scott. I understand your disappointment and frustration. I used to check on this article from time to time and it remained mainly unchanged. I dropped in when this all started when one editor (now banned) seemed to be on a quest to delete all ACIM related articles. You left for your wedding (hope all is great) and I was left as the only one trying to keep the article from being destroyed. I think the article as is, is fairly good. I think it could use some expansion in regards to more detail on its theology and how it uses psychology &amp; relationships in its spiritual path. I think at this point there can no longer be OR or uncited material.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 16:42, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The best article is the most accurate one. The best editor is the most accurate editor. Ideally, all of Wiki is simply owned by the principle of accuracy. It seems to me that it is only when inaccuracy begins to creep into an article that the contents of an article begin to seem "threatanable".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting references to the FIP edition of ACIM</span></h2>
<p>Hey Who123, It appears to me that information about the only widely distributed print edition of ACIM is noteworthy information and enhances the accuracy of our article. Why did you <i>delete</i> this information from the article? Certainly the other editions bear noting here too, but I cannot see why you seem to prefer to delete this informaion about the only edition available via traditional book distribution channels such as bookstores and Amazon.com, and that most Course students are the most familiar with while apparently wanting to highlight only informaion about the far more obscure print versions which I believe are only partial (excluding the workbook) and are only available via private offerings outside of traditional book distribution channels. Could you please explain what your logic is here so we might be able to better justify your deletion of this information?</p>
<p>What other regular full print editions are available via traditional book distribution channels that I am unaware of? I would imagine that Endeavor Academy may have some obscure print offering that is not available via traditional book distribution channels and is not ISBN listed, but I don't see why such a private offering should take priority here over the FIP edition that is now in print and has sold 1.5 million, and is available in most bookstores? Could you please explain youre deletion and your logic here more fully? &#160;(The comments, observations and/ or pertinent supporting facts of other editors would be most appreciated here too.)</p>

<dd>Hi Scott. I am not associated with EA. I am not trying to promote any specific version. I think including all the extra information about the FIP version biases the article by promoting that version. I am sorry for the confusion but the information added was on the servicemark and trademark, not on the versions. I believe that 'The FIP edition is not the only written version currently in print in English.' is true. I am not sure what "normal" system of publishers and bookstores is any longer.

<dd>Actually, the Urtext is a handwritten and partially typed draft that was never properly published. Drafts and duly published works are not normally treated as being on the same par in most scholarly works as far as I know. Why do you wish to portray a handwritten draft as being no different than an in-print literary work? The self-printed work put out by EA, that as far as I know is printed on their mimeograph machine, is not carried or "in-print" anywhere else. It also does not carry significant parts such as the Clarification of Terms. Neither does this self-printed work carry an ISBN in as far as I know. Why do you feel that we should not mention these sorts of things in the article? I think the readership is capable of interpreting this publication information on its own without it having to be censored, don't you?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification of terminology: "edition" vs "draft" vs "version"</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that we may be suffering here from a certain unclarity in the specific usage of the word "edition" in this article. Normally, in the book publishing world, the word "edition" refers to an ISBN registered, book-store carried, print release. Vanity publications and other publications that are not ISBN registered and are not carried by bookstores are usually not included under this definition as used in the publishing world. It seems to me that these unregistered, private promotional drafts of ACIM that are carried primarily by Endeavor Academy and by Tom Whitmore, and by nobody else that I know of, should properly be referred to only as earlier drafts of ACIM, and not as bonafide "editions", until after they have successfully passed through the same process that all other "published books" normally pass through before they are properly referred to here as truly "published books".</p>
<p>It seems to me that by attempting to represent these drafts as if they were on a full par with an actually "published" book that is properly registered, and truly distributed does a great disservice to confuse the readership and to mislead them into believing that what really amounts to obscure early drafts of ACIM that are being promoted by Endeavor Academy are no different from what most folks would consider to be the only actually in-print "published" edition of ACIM. This seems to me as if it may be an attempt by some folks who may be associated with EA to use Wikipedia to promote their own narrow interests as against the interests of the Wikipedia readership which is to simply find out the facts of the full, duly "published" edition as they are.</p>

<dd>Hi Scott. First, I am not associated with EA. I think the term that is commonly used is "version". There are multiple versions both online and written. The only time "edition" is used (I think) is to refer to the FIP editions.<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 13:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for finally acknowledging the difference here. Can I assume by your acknowledgement of this then, that you would agree with me that the rather obscure pre-publication drafts of the FIP edition that EA is promoting are far less culturally significant than the FIP edition? You see, the FIP edition is the edition on whose coat-tails EA is riding, in trying to promote these rather obscure pre-publication drafts that they have uncovered.</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that this article is not well served by your deletion of a well documented acknowledgement that the FIP edition is by far and away the best known, most widely circulated, and only truly print-published edition. If you are a student of ACIM, I am rather surprised that you seem to be unaware of this fact and that you seem to be trying to delete it from this article. I have been a student of ACIM for the last 17 years, and have participated in ACIM study groups from Florida to Michigan to New York to California. If you are not at all associated with EA, your actions seem amazingly aligned with their agenda of promoting these early drafts. Can you please explain?</dd>

<dd>I believe that the FIP first and second editions may have been the most that were printed in the past but I do not have a citation to document this and I do not think it is pertinent to this article. The world is different today and more people may read various online versions now; I do not know and I do not think it can be known. To add additional material to make the 2nd FIP edition special is to promote it. It is not unbiased. It seems that the article should mention the various major versions equally. Once again, I am not associated with EA. I believe that they have their own version that they are promoting and selling. I do not know which of the primary versions it is based on. I have not seen it.

<dd>Please refer to the citations that you deleted from the article for this information. Again, you have mentioned that you are familiar with the material, yet you appear not to be aware of the fact that the FIP edition is the only commercially and regularly distributed edition of this work, and you have for unknown reasons deleted this information from the article. Why do you insist on deleting out such information and trying to imply that there is no difference between the only commercially available print edition and a self-printed unregistered short-run exclusively offered by Endeavor Academy? Please forgive me but I am growing a bit tired of your strange line of reasoning which you do not seem to be able to justify here. Why do you seem to be so vigorously promoting an abridged and unregistered self-printed work? Please explain.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ACIM versions</span></h2>
<p>Dear Who123,</p>
<p>I wish I could better understand why you seem to me to have some sort of negative feelings about the FIP editions of ACIM, yet I do believe you when you explain that you are not associated with EA. If someone somehow came across an early draft of a Shakespear play, then wrote an article about Shakespear in which the early draft and the final work were treated as if there were no difference and essentially equal in quality and cultural impact, don't you think that that author would be doing his readers a disservice? I just cannot get my mind around why you seem to feel that the 2nd FIP edition and these early drafts ought to be treated similarly. I know that Robert Perry has expressed some personal reservations about Ken Wapnick's editorial abilities. Could this have anything to do with your views re the relationship between the FIP editions and the earlier drafts?</p>
<p>I honestly do feel that unless the article clearly acknowledges the fact that the FIP editions have always been by far the most widely distributed version of the Course and as such are considered by the great majority of ACIM students to be the 'standard' editions, that unless this information is clearly and prominently incorporated into the article, then we will be doing a grave disservice to those who might be wanting to know more about ACIM. This seems to me that it would be like telling first year freshman english students that they should consider first reading early Shakespear drafts before they begin studying his finished works.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are of the same mind as Robert Perry, but the fact that 1.5 million readers have voted with their wallets to support the FIP editions and not any other, seems to me to be proof enough that the FIP editions do stand out far above any of the earlier drafts. Still I wouldn't mind hearing why you feel otherwise.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<dd>Hi Scott. It seems that we should be able to sort this out. I am not associated with any faction regarding ACIM including Robert Perry. I do not have negative feelings of the FIP editions. I have both the first and second editions. I think all three of the primary versions have advantages and disadvantages. I agree with you in that I believe there have been more FIP versions sold than any other, although we would need a cite for this to include it in the article. I do not know which versions people are most likely to get <u>now</u> as the earlier versions are now available to be downloaded for free. I suppose more material could be added to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the versions. This may be beyond the scope of the article and it would all have to be cited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the Bible would be a better analogy than the Shakespeare analogy. I think many people would find it very exciting to find the earliest writings that formed the Bible. 1.5 million readers did not vote with their wallets because there was no choice before and so no vote. Now people have that choice. Some seem to prefer one version over another. Where I am coming from is WP's NPOV policy. Now that various versions are available, I do not think the article should be biased in directing the reader to one version over another. Does this make sense?<span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#1E90FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">123</font></a> 11:36, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I like your Bible analogy, but along that same line, consider the need in a Wikipedia article to clarify the relationships between say the KJV Bible and the sections of the Bible found in the 'Dead Sea Scrolls'. If we were to posit that these two versions of the Bible need to be treated in Wiki as if there were absolutely no difference, this would seem to me to possibly do a disservice to the readership.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also it seems to me that there is a significant difference between ACIM and the Bible. All earlier drafts of ACIM are simply that, earlier drafts that were all agreed upon by the same group of editors, namely Helen, Bill and Ken. This is not so with the Bible. The Bible has had numerous undocumented edits by numerous unknown hands.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that to claim that: <i>the earlier drafts of a published book, that the editor/authors never chose or agreed to publish, are somehow fundamentally equal to the finished version that they finally chose to relaease for a successful publication</i>, would need a good unbiased supporting citation documenting this claim of fundamental equality. Either this, or in Wiki we would now need to start treating all early drafts of all published books as if there were no fundamental differences between these and the finished publications. Could you be dissatisfied with the editorial process that Helen, Bill and Ken all agreed upon and could you then be attempting to express your dissatisfactions with their editorial process here?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Eastern concept of 'Enlightenment' vs: the goal of ACIM</span></h2>
<p>I have removed R. Perry's claim that the goals of ACIM are identical with the Eastern goal of 'Enlightenment'. Perry does not appear to understand that ACIM's goal is not purely internal, but also includes the need for one's ability to master 'forgiveness' which could be viewed as somewhat external. Eastern enlightenment is typically viewed as an individual and internal accomplishment whereas the teaching goal of ACIM also stresses the importance of also achieving a certain harmony with one's brother through 'forgiveness'. This distinct element is essentially absent from most Eastern views of 'Enlightenment' and Perry fails to recognize this important difference.</p>

<dd>I do not have time to complete this round of editing that I plan to complete in the near future. There no longer seem to be any objections to clarifying the fact that the FIP publications are distinctly different from all earlier draft versions of ACIM by nature of their widespread distribution, recognized copyrights, general acceptance, and the greater amount of 'inner dictation sections' that they contain. As such, I will add these references and others soon. Thanks.</dd>

<dd>While the methods of eastern religion may be different from ACIM, I think ACIM explicitly states that the end of all paths are the same, so it could only be from a perspective external to ACIM's system that we could say the ends are not in fact the same. ACIM seems to go to great lengths to collapse the student's perception that there is a difference between an internal and and external world, which might make our former claim about ACIM inconsistent. Also, even if eastern religions do not expressly state that there is no difference between individual and universal enlightenment, perhaps we should not equate ommission with denial, and thus assume difference over arbitrariness. I don't mean to dispute your decision, rather, I'm glad for your investment in the article. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 00:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Based on memory, many of the ideas there come from the Hanegraaf book (although I did not write that particular paragraph). It's one of the few scholarly works on the New Age Movement, by the way. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 16:28, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Yeah.... what I am after is clarity. As it reads now, the paragraph has about five claims and states them as facts</p>
<p>1)(it) is atypical. now cited 2) It teaches true other-worldliness 3) it has been characterized as a Christianized version of non-dualistic Vedanta where the world is just an illusory chimera that offers violence, sorrow and pain. (at least phrae "has been characterized is there, but who characterized it this way) 4) This is very rare in the New Age movement. 5) Students of the Course seek the ultimate goal of existence in a radically different mode of being than that found in this world.</p>
<p><br />
None of these are actual facts- they are all opinions. If they are going to be in the article, and what I am after is a clear presentation of who said them and that they are merely claims, by a specific group/person/author. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 18:51, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, I do not still have the Hanegraaf book, but you could find it at any decent research library. Normally, a source footnoted at the end of a paragraph would indicate that the information in the paragraph came from the source, but you are right to be skeptical given the history of this article and I wouldn't advocate simply attributing such claims to Hanegraaf until we have confirmation. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 20:44, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you can't find Hanegraaf, the encyclopedia entry for the Course in Melton is also useful. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 00:47, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Inconsistency" id="Inconsistency"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inconsistency</span></h2>
<p>As stated, I think the fourth paragraph in the Course material section is anomalous.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>This passage from the article:</i> The Course fully accepts the Freudian concepts of the conscious mind, the unconscious mind.</li>
<li><i>This passage from the reference for the passage from the article:</i> Like Freud, the Course views the mind as a veritable battleground, filled with conflict between the conscious and unconscious [...]</li>
<li><i>This passage from the Text (my italics):</i> T-7.VIII.4. You cannot perpetuate an illusion about another without perpetuating it about yourself. 2 There is no way out of this, because <i>it is impossible to fragment the mind.</i> 3 To fragment is to break into pieces, and mind cannot attack or be attacked. 4 The belief that it can, an error the ego always makes, underlies its whole use of projection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Boiled down, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Course fully accepts the Freudian concepts of the conscious and unconscious mind.</li>
<li>The Freudian concept of the conscious and unconscious mind is that it is a veritable battleground, filled with conflict.</li>
<li>The Course states that it is impossible to fragment the mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, let's stipulate,</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a fragmented mind could be a battleground.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that these statements form an <b>inconsistent quartet</b>. At least one <i>must</i> be false. If it is the reference which is in error, we should be sure to be clear about what we mean when we talk of the "Freudian concepts of the conscious mind [and] the unconscious mind," and explicitly reject the reference's interpretation of Freud. If it is not the reference which is in error, the article as it is written must be.</p>

<p><br />
Ummm. Well, it is true that you think they form an <b>inconsistent quartet</b>, but it is true that within the framework of the Course they do?</p>
<p>Nothing personal, but I don't see you (or me) as meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> so your or my thoughts about the Course or Freud, how they are in alignment or how they aren't in alignment doesn't really matter in terms of an article. What does matter is the Course says, what Freud says and what someone who meets WP:V says about the two of them together. Find someone who sees the inconsistency you think you see and sight them. That would be within the scope. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 20:35, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite right, and I'm afraid you've misunderstood my intention. I don't wish to challenge the references. Nor am I proposing that we change the article concerning this. I'm discussing the article, <i>not</i> changes I want to make to it. The inconsistency is a formal inconsistency. That means it is not subject to differing interpretations or frameworks. I've noted your thoughts. Thanks for sharing. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 05:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">(book), rewritten</span></h2>
<p>As a tribute to Ste4k, I want to revive the material formerly at <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_25fc.html" title="A Course in Miracles (book)">A Course in Miracles (book)</a>. It contained a well-written and well-sourced (!) account of the history of the Course's primary literature. At the same time, I think it is too unrelated to the <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a> article to warrent a merge. Without objections, I will create a page at History of A Course in Miracles, place the material there, and add a link to it in the Origins section of the A Course In Miracles article. I welcome any feedback. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 07:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Well said not a dog... given that the current Course page is much shorter then the previous- I say- put it on this page and then if the page gets too big we move it. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 20:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you're right. The article is almost nothing without history, and so history should go there. The two articles are not "unrelated" as a matter of the Course being something more than its history, but unrelated as a matter of one being dry and uninteresting, and the other (the current article) being somewhat more tolerable. You can judge for yourself though. I'll copy and paste the article into the origins section. An interested wikipedian can then go about making the sources play nice with each other, as I have no such interest myself. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#B22222;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#CD950C;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 05:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Merge Notes</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The merged article <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_25fc.html" title="A Course in Miracles (book)">A Course in Miracles (book)</a> was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_7d2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/A Course in Miracles (book)"><b>deleted</b></a> some time ago. Do your history.</li>
<li>I've pasted the length of ACIM (book) into the "Origins" section of ACIM. The merged article covers the information that used to make up this section, but the former, shorter, Origins section may still be worth integrating, so I've commented the former section out for now rather than deleting it.</li>
<li>ACIM (book) used a different (probably older) citation style, where its reference information was placed in the reference section with {{cite}} tags, rather than integrating them in the main body as ACIM does and relying on the &lt;references/&gt; tag at the end. The &lt;ref&gt; tag in ACIM (book) was instead used for collecting footnotes. Something should be done about this mismatch.</li>
<li>ACIM (book) features a "quote barrier" where its author was not confident in the information proceeding after it. I've left it in, but it should be removed when we can match up and verify the sources.</li>
<li>ACIM (book) contained several images whose links had to be removed from the article because the images themselves were no longer on Wikipedia. If we can find the original source of the images, they should be reincluded if possible, most noteably, Skutch Whitson and Thetford.</li>
<li>If you find the new Origins section too dry, my former offer of spliting the article still holds.</li>
