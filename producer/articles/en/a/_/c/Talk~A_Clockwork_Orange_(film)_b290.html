<p>A good portion of the text here is the same as the text for <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">the book</a>. I know that these two articles were originally together, then they were split (see <a href="../../../a/_/c/Talk%7EA_Clockwork_Orange_1b94.html" title="Talk:A Clockwork Orange">Talk:A Clockwork Orange</a>). But given the overlap, and given the fact that most novels that have been adapted into movies share information on both the book and the film, I think that this article should be merged back. <a href="../../../g/a/v/User%7EGavindow_a4cc.html" title="User:Gavindow">gavindow</a> 02:03, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. I think there is too much information information to just merge the articles together. That said, the content that belongs with the movie needs to be segregated from that which belongs with the book and vice versa.</dd>

<li>Exactly. One should hope that the movie and book are similar, but they are still two different items, and therefore two different entries.

<dd>DISCUSSION:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the film provokes thought regarding the decision making process that is instilled in so-called civilized people. "Bad" behaviour is discouraged through law, religion and shame. One could argue that these things were not properly instilled in Alex as he matured and thus he's not responsible for his actions. Rather his parents, the church and the government are.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The film also draws attention to what happens when one tries to rule with an iron fist. Alex treats his droogies poorly (and later the police are shown abusing their power) so they will respect his power but they eventually rise up and overthrow him as leader of their gang. Point being: excersing power is important but maintaining the respect of your followers is equally important and if you wish to control people, you must combine fear with respect.</dd>

<p>I don't think that making Alex adverse to Beethoven's 9th was an "unintended side effect." It was a deliberate part of the Ludovico technique. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyt_3bbe.html" title="User:Tommyt">Tommyt</a> 14:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>~It was not intentional. When the song was found to make him uncomfortable, it was unethically used to punish him (but it was only a coincidence that Alex liked the Ninth Symphony and they chose to have it as the background score). It was not planned and I doubt that they thought that the relatively short exposure to it in that context would have had the effect it had. So it was an 'unintended side-effect'. 211.29.251.50 05:25, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quote of the sequence in the film:</p>
<p>ALEX (V.O.) It was the next day, brothers, and I had truly done my best, morning and afternoon, to play it their way and sit like a horrorshow co-operative malchick in the chair of torture, while they flashed nasty bits of ultra-violence on the screen; though not on the soundtrack, my brothers. The only sound being music. Then I noticed in all my pain and sickness what music it was that like cracked and boomed. It was Ludwig van, 9th symphony, 4th movement.</p>
<p>ALEX Stop it... stop it, please!!! I beg of you!!! It's a sin!!! It's a sin!!! It's a sin, please!!!</p>
<p>Brodsky leans forward and turns down the sound.</p>
<p>DR. BRODSKY What's all this about sin?</p>
<p>ALEX That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.</p>
<p>DR. BRANOM Are you referring to the background score?</p>
<p>ALEX Yes!!!</p>
<p>DR. BRANOM You've heard Beethoven before?</p>
<p>ALEX Yes!!!</p>
<p>DR. BRODSKY You're keen on music?</p>
<p>ALEX Yes!!!</p>
<p>DR. BRANOM (quietly) What do you think about that, Dr. Brodsky?</p>
<p>DR. BRODSKY (softly) It can't be helped. Here's your punishment element perhaps. The Governor ought to be pleased... I'm sorry, Alex, this is for your own good, you'll have to bear with us for a while.</p>
<p>...then later...</p>
<p>RUBINSTEIN The, um, newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.</p>
<p>ALEX Well, uh, I think that was something that they, uh, didn't plan for. You see, Missus, I'm very fond of music, especially Beethoven, um, Ludwig van Beethoven. B... E...</p>
<p>He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.</p>
<p>RUBINSTEIN It's alright, thank you.</p>
<p>ALEX It just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.</p>

<p>"The film ends with a surreal image of Alex raping a woman, surrounded by applauding Victorian gentlemen, an image that suggests that his aggression is accepted by society now that Alex will be working with politicians instead of criminal outcasts."</p>
<p>The woman is smiling or laughing, and she is on top. It appears to be some kind of crazy wedding, not a rape. 24.117.154.106 10:51, 29 April 2006 (UTC)Justin</p>
<p>I vote to remove any and all lines like: "an image that suggests [X]". Kubrick detested such neat and narrow interpretations, and so do I. Also, since the scene in question is actually another one of Alex's fantasies, to say that the "image suggests that his aggression is accepted by society now" is a fallacious analysis. Exacta 02:34, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, but during his meeting in the ward with Anthony Sharp's minister character, it is made quite clear to him that his newly regained aggressiveness will be utilised to the government's benefit. I like the ambiguity that Kubrick leaves the viewer with here. At first it seems better on one hand that Alex's belligerence will be utilised for the benefit of the state. Or will it be beneficial, will he just be used as an attack dog by the state, possibly against he state's political enemies? In any case, Kubrick makes a very good point about the subjectivity of the definition of a hooligan, or whatever else one may wish to label Alex as. Is he any less of a bad person because his aggression will now be used *by* society, rather than against it?</p>

<dd><i>" [...] during his meeting in the ward with Anthony Sharp's minister character, it is made quite clear to him that his newly regained aggressiveness will be utilised to the government's benefit."</i> Disagree strongly with this claim, which is actually a personal interpretation IMHO.

<p>Alex's "job" is unspecified, but there is no suggestion that his violence will be used by the Government. Rather, his (envisaged) post-deconditioning rehabilition is to be used as a PR exercise by a Government that has blundered badly.</p>
<p>(My POV: It's dramatic double-irony. The Minister is placatory, intending to produce a 'kiss-and-make-up' media triumph while rehabilitating an offender. Alex, on the other hand, has nothing on his mind except a return to health and previous form - his final fantasy suggests he foresees mingling with a higher social set, although he foresees no change in his attitude towards other people.

<li>I actually object to this, depending on what exactly it was originally about. Yes, Beethoven is in the book. But for instance the William Tell Overture is not, nor is The Thieving Magpie, Pomp and Circumstance, or Funeral Music for the Queen Mary. Those as far as I recall from the book are all hallmarks of Kubrick.

<p>I think - I repeat, I am NOT sure - that before Alex has sex with the two girls from the record store, he gets them drunk. If I do in fact remember correctly, I think this should be included briefly in the description of the scene, perhaps nothing more than "...nonetheless, he takes them home and, after a few drinks, has sex with them both." As well, it mentions later in the article that, as opposed to in the novel where Alex rapes the young girls, the sex here is consensual. I don't think that's entirely the case here, since Alex is essentially drugging them first. Thoughts? Zhankfor</p>

<li>No. Alex is walking through the record store, to the sound of part of the electronic version of <i>Beethoven's Ninth</i> (the same section that will later be playing during his aversion therapy session featuring the Hitler footage) and finds the two chicks looking through the album bins. He hits on them a bit and offers to let them come to his place to list to music filled with "angel trumpets and devil trombones... you are invited!" The film cuts immediately to his bedroom and the highly sped-up threesome scene to the strains of an electronic <i>William Tell Overture</i>, which if you watch it at normal speed, you see that nothing actually happens, it's just a bit of comic relief. Unless Kubrick pulled such a scene from the final cut of the film, Alex does not get the babes drunk first. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:47, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, thanks. Maybe I'm mixing up the book with the movie, it's been a long time since I've looked at either. [[User:Zhankfor|Zhankfor}}

<p>well im not an expert on drugs (though i have done my far share) but aren't "angel trumpets and devil trombones" some kind of a psychoactive drug?</p>

<dd>No, they're trumpets and trombones (respectively). There <i>are</i> fungi named after trumpets and devils and angels, but any similarity ends there. Garrick92 15:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently the gent at 172.159.252.65 disagrees with me, but I'm absolutely positive Alex isn't left unconscious after being hit with the milk bottle. He is, in fact, screaming about being blind and calling his former droogs bastards. I could be wrong, but generally unconcious people don't talk.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're right; he was momentarily blinded and/or disoriented by his "friends" smashing the full milk bottle across his face, filling his eyes with milk, but apparently not glass. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:24, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article claims that Burgess was a "devoted Christian". The WP article on Burgess states that Burgess "lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth", with no suggestion that what he "lapsed" into was any other variety of Christianity. I suspect that the Burgess article is right and this one is wrong (for instance, the first quotation at <a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/bushcoolframe.htm#BURGESS" class="external free" title="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/bushcoolframe.htm#BURGESS" rel="nofollow">http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/bushcoolframe.htm#BURGESS</a> doesn't sound very Christian), but I don't know. Anyone have anything more authoritative? <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_McCaughan_2f50.html" title="User:Gareth McCaughan">Gareth McCaughan</a> 01:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Burgess regarded himself as a lapsed Catholic, but in his two volumes of autobiography he still tends to talk of himself as a Catholic. On other occasions in the same works, he comes across as agnostic, and on other occasions outright gnostic (there's one marvellous description of God and sinners in which he compares God to 'a field of sentient snow, which screams when you absent-mindedly piss on it'). I don't think 'lapsed Catholic' is the same as 'non-Catholic'. The same as you supposedly can't be an ex-Jew. More theologically-minded contributors might be able to phrase that more succinctly.

<p>I enjoyed the text that gave credit to A Clockwork Orange for providing the influance for Cygnus X's "The Orange Theme". However, the only text that remains of that reference is simply the name and title under the "soundtrack" section. Since the song was not included on the soundtrack, and no reference for its inspiration is given, i am deleting it from the article.

<p>Ah. So he doesn't have the same name as the actor credited with playing the role, and he doesn't look anything like him either, but he <i>does</i> sound like him?
