<p><i>The Pretty Committe Strikes Back</i> is a Clique novel by <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisi_Harrison_7002.html" title="Lisi Harrison">Lisi Harrison</a>, written in 2006. Wait a minute, the Pretty Comittee <i>Strikes Back??</i> Ahem, copyright infringement? (It's bad enough that "Pretty Comittee" is probably the most cheesy, repulsive name in recorded history)</p>

<p>The novel starts out with how excited 'The Pretty Committee' or the most popular girls at Octavian Country Day (OCD) School are excited about going on a school field trip. The field trip is with the Briarwood boys, Briarwood being the all-boys school next door to all-girl OCD. Each girl in the Pretty Committee is in a different situation, but the most desperate one would have been of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Lyons_d8b0.html" title="Claire Lyons">Claire Lyons</a>. Claire just went through a heart-breaking break up with her ex-boyfriend Cam Fisher, and was accused of cheating on him, when she did not, but then at the same time she did. She sends Cam ultra desperate emails, but she does not get a reply and is ignored. Meanwhile, Kristen Gregory, the less rich and broke girl in the Pretty Committee is depressed because she cannot afford to go on the trip. The other girls offer to pay, but she rejects them with several 'It's okay's. At the same time, the alpha and uncontested ruler of clique...</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/s/Massie_Block_060b.html" title="Massie Block">Massie Block</a>, is trying to prove to people she has experience with boys and seducing them. She opens a club and makes girls at OCD take lessons, her being the teacher, on how to kiss boys. Her first class doesn't go well, and if it weren't for her undiminishing popularity, it would have been clear she had no experience. When they finally get on the bus, and travel to Lake Placid, New York, to their dismay the Pretty Committee (excluding Kristen) find that they are not allowed to use any electronics, and can only wear two outfits during the entire trip. Massie is very pressured, learning that she can not use her PalmPilot for the 'Current State of the Union' but the worry doubles over on how to teach the 'M.U.C.K' girls how to kiss. She also confronts her crush, Derrick Harrington (better known as Derrington) and is always worrying about how to behave in front of him. Whenever in front of him she plays hard to get, but she also whispers in his ear about how she didn't want to attract so much attention over to them. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Rivera_ba89.html" title="Alicia Rivera">Alicia Rivera</a>--the prettiest girl in the Pretty Committee--is worrying about how her crush, Josh Hotz, likes another girl, who apparently turns out to be Claire Lyons, the one who kissed him in the previous book. Alicia is struggling to find out who the girl is, while Claire is biting on her nails more than ever, when she finds Cam flirting with another girl. Massie confronts Claire on teaching her how to kiss boys and give a lesson about it. Claire shows Massie, and Massie gives an excellent lesson, and it may seem her troubles are over. But they are far from over. As are Claire's--Alicia sets out her friend Olivia Ryan to somehow get Josh to tell which girl he's crushing on. Olivia, who is otherwise stupid, finds a clever way to get the girl's name out of his mouth, by giving him two girls, and asking him which one he'd rather lip kiss. Olivia's aim is using the process of elimination, but when she says, "Claire or Alicia?" Claire finds a way to quickly distract her before Josh replies. Everything in Massie Block's life is going smoothly, except when Derrington over hears her bragging about how she had tongue-kissed a boy before, and Derrington, who had been in love with Massie for a long time, loses his temper and is extremely disdainful about it. He thinks that she was talking about another boy, and he tosses the 'M' pin Massie gave him in the previous book, in the dirt. Massie is extremely hurt, but then the girls who had been given the lessons by Massie see that she is nothing but a pretender. Massie then faces her friends, whom she also lied to, except Claire who knew everything, preparing for burning resentment, but instead gets supporting and comforting hugs. Massie goes to bed that night feeling utterly perplexed, but is shocked to find Kristen Gregory under her bed. Kristen then plunges into a story about lying to her mother about going on a soccer field trip and coming here alone. With the entire clique united, not all of the girls give the 411 to Kristen, except Dylan Marvil, who is absolutely depressed about her mother flirting with their teacher, Mr. Myner. Massie thinks with her alpha and confident brain, and soon finds a way to make her social life perfect again, but discovers she'll need help. She talks to Claire, saying that if Claire would help her, she'd get her and Cam back together. Massie doesn't break her promise to Claire, and gives her an excellent plan. During the pitch darkness of the night, Claire sneaks into the Briarwood cabins, dressed as a boy, and explains to Cam about everything that happened, about how she still loved him. Things are bumpy at first, but finally Cam understands, and not only do they make up, they schedule their first kiss with each other for tomorrow. But as Claire leaves the cabin, she smells Angel perfume, also known as the perfume Alicia Rivera wears. She panicks that Alicia heard everything she said, about kissing Josh. Meanwhile, Massie orders FedEx to bring her new and fresh clothes, for her kiss with Derrington. She decides that the plan be her explaining to Derrington, and then kissing him so the M.U.C.K. girls can see, and her reputation would be restored. She confronts Derrington, who is still angry at her, and she catches him off guard with a lip kiss. Derringon is utterly surprised and confused, but the M.U.C.K. girls don't notice his shock and confusion, for their attention is entirely focused on their kiss. Massie then acts and hollers at Claire (who led the M.U.C.K. girls to Massie and Derrington) to leave, and when they do Massie uses her charm and persuades Derrington to give her a chance. At this point of the book you would think that everything is perfect in the Pretty Committee, but trouble is still a-brewing. Claire, in order to help Massie, had to reschedule her kiss with Cam. She unwisely gave Alicia a note to reach Cam, but Alicia, already knowing what happened, instead tried to kiss Cam and that was what Claire found when she went eagerly to the place her and Cam were supposed to be kissing. Cam then protests he thought that Claire ditched him, but as he says that, everything becomes clear. Hurt and angry, Claire storms off to the girls' cabins. But during the night, Cam sneaks into the girls' cabin, dressed as a girl, and Claire forgives him, and they finally kiss. But Alicia and Claire, unfortunately, are still at war. In the morning, Mr. Myner makes an announcement, saying that he had found a pair of underwear lying around in the woods. The underwear had a deep red stain in it, and was obviously a girl's, who was dealing with her period or <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menstrual_cycle.html" title="Menstrual cycle">menstrual cycle</a>. Claire recognizes it as her friend Layne Abeley's underwear. But instead, some people accuse the underwear being Claire's, who had actually lent Layne the underwear. But Claire, in order to avoid humiliation, takes matters in her own hands and says that the underwear belongs to Alicia. Alicia's 'It's not mine!' protests ae ignored, and suddenly, the entire cafeteria is chanting a chorus of: 'Alicia Rivera's Underwear-a'. Alicia, mortified, runs out of the cafeteria, her friend Olivia Ryan following her. Claire then feels instant remorse at what she had just done. She, Massie and Dylan leave the cafeteria as well. A few minutes later, Mr. Myner finds them there, and Dylan, in a temper, accidentally reveals that Kristen is under Massie's bed. Kristen hesitantly comes out of under the bed, and Mr. Myner then informs her that he is calling her parents. She runs out the door, as does Dylan. Alicia follows them, as does Massie, and the last one to leave is Claire. Unfortunately, the entire Pretty Committee runs and gets lost in the woods. They encounter a bear, and Kristen, who has all of the trails in the woods memorized, has no idea what to do. When the bear finally goes away, Massie orders everyone to apologize, and Claire and Alicia make up. Once out of the woods, they are faced by an angry Mr. Myner, and several worried faces. Mr. Myner allows them to have lunch, and tells them that he will have a 'talk' with them after they eat. After lunch, they go to his cabin, and he informs them that they are expelled from OCD. He ignores their desperate protests, and Alicia screams at him that her father will sue him and get them back in OCD. Things are especially bad for Kristen, who has just lost her scholarship. The girls pack their things, and take a bus home.</p>
