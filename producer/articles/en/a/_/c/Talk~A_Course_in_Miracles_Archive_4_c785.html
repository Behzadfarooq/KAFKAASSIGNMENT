<dd>I agree that the page looks like what Wikipedia calls "Original Research". This is because it is. The article was written by a (very kind) man who reads the Course and who was simply trying to provide information about it. He isn't in any way making money off of the Course. He simply likes to write articles about ACIM on Wikipedia. I am attempting to edit this page to make it more neutral, because, frankly, I like the thought of that. I'd like this page to be crisp and "cold" (what I mean is, I'd like this page to be completely without any flowery prose; flowery prose has its place, but usually not in such articles). -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This claim of no sources appears to be written by some who have not read the material. Otherwise they would not be making a blanket request for sources but would be pointing to specific sentences which they believe to be incompatible with the source text. Unless someone is able to point out a single sentence in this article which they are certain is not supported by the text, I submit that this claim of being unsourced is rather a stab in the dark by those who are unfamiliar with the material. The article on the Christian Bible does not have a footnote on every sentence because those who read it are already familiar with the Bible enough to know that the content is supported by its source text. I would ask that if this <i>uncourced</i> template is to remain, that those who are placing this blanket statement support their claim with at least a single instance of material which conflicts with the source text. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 12:07, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about starting with the first sentence. It reads "A Course in Miracles (sometimes referred to as ACIM or simply the Course) is a self-study book of "spiritual psychotherapy" or spiritual transformation. The author of the book Dr. Helen Schucman, asserts that she "scribed" the book with the assistance of Dr. William Thetford under divine inspiration. It was first published prior to 1976 and has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide in 15 different languages." It cites <a href="http://www.acim.org/translation_section/translation_program_intro.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acim.org/translation_section/translation_program_intro.html" rel="nofollow">The Translation Program</a> as it's source. www.acim.org is owned by the organization publishing this version of the book. That makes this source a primary source. According to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, "<i>We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a reliable publisher.</i> See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>". About the source itself, on that page (currently) there is no mention of Schucman or Thetford. There isn't any mention in the text about "sometimes referred to as ACIM", and the only "ACIM" written on that page is the trademark for the particular version of the book written by that publisher. There is no mention about X-million number of copies, etc., etc. Ste4k 12:31, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless the publisher's reputation has been tarnished, it is generally accepted practice in the publishing world to accept a publisher's statement at face value a factual statement of the number of copies it has published. If you might be able to somehow significantly tarnish the reputation of FIP, then perhaps its accounting of the number of copies published might be considered worthy of question. Otherwise we will have to begin deleting references to the number of books published by every book whose publisher you happen not to believe. Nobody but a publisher normally keeps such records. How else do you suppose they are normally tracked? Unfortunately someone seems to have recently deleted the article on FIP so it now becomes rather difficult to track them. Go figure. (BTW, FIP is the publsher, not acim.org.)</dd>

<dd>Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, "Joe at worms" then we write "Joe ate worms". About tarnishing any reputation, that isn't the point at all. And about accepted practices in the publishing world, this is Wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call "<i>policy</i> and "<i>guidelines</i>" since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. About people keeping records of how many books were published, I think you missed the point there. Publisher's Weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. They are a secondary source. Do you see how that's different? About the article on FIP, it hadn't any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted. The only references which it had on the bottom were "See Also" references that pointed to this article here, and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here. FIP and ACIM.ORG are the same entity. FACIM is also the same entity. This is known. Having the same board of directors, as well as sharing the same registered trademark "ACIM®" , etc., makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources. Ste4k 20:51, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you are saying that unless Publisher's Weekly (or some other such publication) repeats the actual publisher's information on their site, then the information is unrepeatable on Wiki? All publication numbers are ultimately merely a repeat of the publisher's data by default. I still don't follow you here. I apologize. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 23:38, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Uhm, no, what I am saying here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. Publisher's Weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books. If you need to know how they arrived at that number, you should ask their research department. It is highly likely that they were given proprietary information that they were able to verify at two sources, and would probably be under a non-disclosure agreement regarding that content. But you can contact them and find out how they arrived at that number for yourself if it interests you. Non-disclosure agreements usually have an expiration date attached.

<dd>Let's be plain here, Scott, the first sentence is only one sentence in this article. Every sentence needs to be verifiable. Everything that isn't verifiable is simply opinion and original research. Original research can be deleted by any editor at any time. I am hoping that you will want to improve this article rather than squabble about it. If you haven't made yourself familiar with the policies in this regard <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, etc., I highly suggest that you read them.

<p>I believe this topic is different. ACIM is both a book and a religious movement. There are <b>no</b> reliable secondary sources. In many ways it is like the beginning of Christianity. There is much controversy and conflict. There are differences in interpretation of ACIM. Some organizations, although "non-profit", have used ACIM to turn their founders and their families into millionaires.</p>
<p>I believe the introductory section needs to be re-written. Most that are very familar with ACIM know that Helen did not consider herself to be the author. She considered herself (as indicated in the Urtext version itself) to be an equal and co-scribe with William Thetford. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 22:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope that a re-write does not include adding material like, "Most believe the author is Jesus Christ."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=63286141&amp;oldid=63169350" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=63286141&amp;oldid=63169350" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It's generally impossible to verify the opinions of "most". -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>True, it is difficult to verify "most". Like many religious works the origins are obscure and filled with controversy. To the best of my knowledge, Helen never considered herself the author of ACIM. This arose out of the interaction of both Helen and Bill. I believe it would be true to say that ACIM was "co-written" by both Helen and Bill. The words originated from an inner voice within Helen's mind that she identified as not her own but from Jesus Christ. Those close to her did not believe she could have written the work. The work itself is in the first person and clearly identifies himself as the historical Jesus. The question of authorship came to the forefront during the major legal case of the Course. Due to pre-copyright distribution the original 1975 copyright was overturned as were the servicemark on "A Course in Miracles" and trademark on "ACIM". This places the publication date as somewhere between 1973 and 1975. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 03:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are actually <b>some</b> secondary sources that have been found during the interim of this conversation. Also, what is said and by what source is crucial to being a secondary source. For example, although we have already determined that the sources written by Ken Wapnick should not be cited for any statements except (as a primary source) about Wapnick, FIP, or FACIM, anything that Ken Wapnick has said about the NCCFE/EA group, or the JCIM group, or others, would qualify as a secondary source, "as long as it was previously published". We also have one small mention in Publisher's weekly to date, and there are probably a few others out there in the press discussing either this topic on the whole, or various factions of this topic. I think Will Beback will probably agree that until this article has sources and content that refer to the NCCFE/EA group, that this particular article hasn't anything to do with the other groups. I believe that at least two other editors involved in the NCCFE/EA articles would probably be happy to associate this article with that group, because they have insisted on doing so several times prior even though this article currently hasn't anything to do with that other topic matter.

<p>I believe there is a problem in this article with requiring secondary sources. There has been a great deal of friction between FACIM/FIP and many others. FACIM/FIP has used the wealth and legal power of their invalid copyright to file and threaten lawsuits against many including Marianne Williamson, Robert Perry, and EA. Much of this appears to be an attempt to suppress both the truth and open discussion. This has resulted (until very recently with the end of the major lawsuit) in everything being skewed by FACIM/FIP. Because of the lawsuit between FACIM/FIP and EA I do not think they can act as secondary sources. We are dealing with much more than a book here. We are dealing with a religious movement in its infancy. I believe the best that we can do is to continue the discussions to provide the reader of the article with the most useful information that we can as reached by consensus. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 16:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to at least three editors currently working on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Buell_Anderson_2c75.html" title="Charles Buell Anderson">Charles Buell Anderson</a> the exact opposite opinion is true and that articles should be written that have only negative opinion in the references supplied. Their opinion is particularly based on the argument that this current article is fairly representative of all and everything to do with the title "A Course in Miracles". I think that over a period of a month which has been allotted to the editors of this article, that during the interim this article is causing confusion and leading to disruption due to its name. I will suggest that this article be moved/renamed to "A Course in Miracles by Foundation of Inner Peace". Ste4k 17:28, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd seriously like to put the entire subject matter behind me. Until doing serious research on this topic, I hadn't ever heard of it, still haven't ever seen any of it mentioned in the media in any serious way, doubt that it has any real significance to world wide politics, religion, society, charities, wars, or anything else that is going to significantly change the planet any time soon. The fact that it does require an enormous amount of research indicates only that it is an obscure topic. That so many editors have so many different viewpoints on the matter only indicates that nobody can reach consensus and that the subject matter is ambiguous. The article along with its neighbors has caused significant amounts of abusive remarks to me for simply researching the matter which indicates that the presence of the article causes more problems than it serves to provide any information. Providing information is the primary objective of the encyclopedia. Consensus is the primary means that this encyclopedia changes it's content. And disambiguity is the primary tool for accomplishing that goal. Ste4k 21:06, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There appears to be basic error in this discussion. That basic error is insisting that all sources are secondary. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>. I point out these two paragraphs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources (examples would include apple pie or current events), but these are exceptions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is quite clear that primary sources are encouraged. The Course itself is a primary source. In addition, because of the nature of this article paragraph 2 comes into play.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 17:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although primary and/or secondary sourcing is very important, much of this material falls under paragraph two above. I think some of this insistence on sourcing is anal or compulsive. For a comparable article please see: <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>.

<dd>Sorry to burst your bubble, but, even though you have tried to compare <i>the Course</i> to the bible before, there isn't any possible way that you could convince me that it relates to Mom's Apple Pie. I suppose to you it rates right up there with hot-dogs and America's all-time favorite pass-time baseball, but unfortunately, there aren't any <i>Course</i> vendors around, and if you went to your local corner stop for gas and asked ten or fifteen strangers you met there if they had ever heard of it they would probably mistake you for a Hari Krsna imposter and give you directions to the airport. If you asked fifteen people if they'd ever heard of apple pie on the other hand, I am willing to bet that at least three of them would ask you how much you were selling it for, and the store manager would probably think you were trying to use the store to sell your merchandise. This encyclopedia is supposed to be used to present notable facts to the public at large. In order to achieve that goal it relies on facts that are already previously published by reliable sources, for example, the press, the media, scholarly works and certainly not the least of all court records. There is a two part concern that must be addressed for anything to be included. Sure we can use a primary source, but there are clear restrictions on what may and may not be used from a primary source and <b>that</b> appears to be a point that you refuse to understand. Pulling out one single part of the policies to refute another part doesn't make any sense. The policies on WP are not contradictory. Ste4k 03:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a difference between common knowledge in general and common knowledge in a specific field. Please see the Internet example above. It is common knowledge that the Internet is often referred to as the Net for most familiar with the Net. For those who are not it is simply explained in the Internet article that the internet is often referred to as the Net. This does not require a source. In physics, if someone were to mention "string theory" most would have at least a general idea about string theory. In the general population I suspect most would be able to say little if asked to explain their understanding of string theory. Almost everyone familiar with The Course knows that ACIM is an abbreviation for A Course in Miracles. As mentioned, a common search engine gave over 1 million hits on "ACIM".</p>
<p>In terms of this article in general, as has already been stated, there are few (if any) unbiased secondary sources. Much of the sourcing for this article will require primary sourcing (ACIM itself) as well as the best secondary sources we can find.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 15:38, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This acronym "ACIM" is a registered trademark. Judith Skutch Whitson and her husband started the Foundation of Para-Sensory Investigations, Inc. (FPI) in October of 1971. She was a teacher and lecturer at New York University on the science of the study of consciousness and parapsychology. She was introduced to Schucman, Thetford and Wapnick in May of 1975. In June of 1976, the Foundation for Parasensory Investigation changed its name to The Foundation of Inner Peace due to Schucman's distaste for the former name. Dr. Schucman died in 1981. Two years later control of the copyright was essentially transferred to the Foundation for "A Course in Miracles" (FACIM) in 1983 when it was organized by Wapnick, the Board of Directors being himself, Judy Skutch Whitson, and her husband Robert Skutch. Due to a suit by Penguin, and TFIP, brought against the Church of the Full Endeavor for teaching students with the manuscript they had obtained, it was found that because of preliminary distribution of the work that the contents of the book are considered public domain. There is absolutely no reason to advertise on this encyclopedia.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The use of "ACIM" in this article would certainly not constitute advertising. It would instead constitute an attempt to succinctly describe a book with a relatively long title. Even if using "ACIM" were indeed advertising, I am aware of no Wikipedia guideline that says that one cannot refer to the advertising slogans or acronyms of given products, copyrighted or not.</p>
<p>Further, I may state that this is an unsourced claim by Ste4k. I see no advertisements for ACIM anywhere, least of all ones that use the the acronym "ACIM". Lastly, Wikipedia allows for the use of advertising acronyms anyway. Please consult the article <a href="../../../k/f/c/KFC_5346.html" title="KFC">KFC</a>.

If you look at that page on the top you will see the tradmark being used. This web site has the same board of directors according to the court documents listed here on top of this sub-topic. The acronym is listed approximately seventy times (to date) in the article. Please see <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESte4k_acim_count_255c.html" title="User:Ste4k/acim count">a sift</a> of the page. Unless this document intends to give equal time to the other books by other authors using this same title, then how can it be considered to be fair use of that trademark rather than advertising?

<dd>The use of abbreviations is common in language. Sometimes multiple abbreviations are used. I think these two statements are common knowledge. If one doubts that ACIM is a common abbreviation simply go to a common search engine and type ACIM. Its use is extremely common in multiple ways and by multiple organizations. A.C.I.M. is also used. It is not as easy and quick so it is not my preference but it is another abbreviation. Sometimes The Course, the Course, or the course is used. This is simply common knowledge just as the net is used for the internet. Please see the other discussion on this. If we cannot agree on something as simple as this then I do not see how any advancement can be made on this, or any article in WP.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 16:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rationale for proposed ACIM article group restructure</span></h2>
<p>Apparently user User:Ste4k has decided that this article ultimately needs to be deleted and replaced with her own article at <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_25fc.html" title="A Course in Miracles (book)">A Course in Miracles (book)</a>, and also a second article which she apparently plans to create later on to be titled something like <i>A Course in Miracles (movement)</i>. This user has also nominated multiple ACIM related articles for deletion, some deletions of which have succeeded. A discussion about User:Ste4k's plans to effect these changes is under way at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29" rel="nofollow">Nomination to delete Ste4k's article on ACIM (book only)</a>.

<dd>ACIM is surrounded by bias, conflict, and heated differences of opinion; as are most religious discussions. I do not believe that any of us is without bias or has a neutral point of view.

<dd>I actually haven't seen much bias, except perhaps in citing primary sources. I haven't read any of these versions. I have read the court cases and seen a lot of web sites which are frankly all involved in selling one or another version of the book in one way or another. The first time I had ever heard of <i>the Course</i> was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jesus_Christ_as_source_of_%22A_Course_in_Miracles%22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60261032" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jesus_Christ_as_source_of_%22A_Course_in_Miracles%22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60261032" rel="nofollow">three weeks ago</a>.

Many that study ACIM are not affiliated with any of the major organizations and some of these are fairly neutral and rational.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Referring to factions</span></h2>
<p>The article section on organization should be rewritten. The FACIM is <b>not</b> the organization of ACIM (the acronym "ACIM" is not the FAICM's trademark as it has been revoked by the U.S. Patent Office). FACIM is only one organization involved with publication of ACIM. It is highly controversial. This section reads like an ad for the FACIM which has turned its founder and family into millionaires. This should be about ACIM and not the FACIM. I suppose Wiki could include a article about FACIM but this would basically be an ad for the organization. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 23:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>ACIM is used extensively by the group "Foundation of Inner Peace (FIP). FACIM also uses this term extensively. The acronym is used in both of their web-sites where they share the same trademark as well as it being a portion of their domain names. They both share common members on their Boards of Directors. They were co-defendents in a trial over copyright issues. In the media, the works are commonly referred to as "The Course". In the court proceedings, the works are also referred to as either "The Work", or "the Course". If you look below in this article at the references, you will notice that most of them are primary references and associated with ACIM/FIP/FACIM/Wapnick/Skutch/Skutch Whitson which are basically one entity and group. According to WP policy and guidelines, we can only use primary sources for statements that they make about themselves, specifically in regard to their notability. This means that the references being used written by Ken Wapnick and Robert Skutch cannot be used to source any material in this article except to speak about FIP, FACIM, or themselves personally. It also means that the version of the work published by FIP called "A Course in Miracles" cannot be used as a source for any material in this article unless the quoted citations are speaking about the book itself for it's own notability, or about FIP, or FACIM. If there is a preface in the book that speaks toward the notability of the book or the publisher, then <b>that content can</b> be used. Anything else, hasn't a reliable source and is therefore un-verifiable. Anything unverifiable, of course, is simply <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Ste4k 18:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once again, the trademark on "ACIM" has been revoked. If one were to do a search on "ACIM" in a search engine one would find thousands of references to many people and organizations other than FIP and FACIM that use it. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 21:31, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's fine, but we can only use what has already been printed, not our own research. The trademark on ACIM has not been revoked, the copyright on the Urtext, though, has been declared void. These are two different things. If it was revoked sometime in the past three days, though, then please advise. Thanks. Ste4k 22:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just double checked: The Patent and Trademark Office database shows that both phrases are no longer trademarked. The only relevant trademark still in force is a design combining the phrase "ACIM" with a logo, which is registered to Foundation for A Course in Miracles. You may recall we already discussed this on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7ECharles_Buell_Anderson_8833.html" title="Talk:Charles Buell Anderson">Talk:Charles Buell Anderson</a>. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 01:24, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and as I pointed out in that discussion, two things, 1) The index that you used to call up that design was "ACIM". 2) both the FIP (who uses acim.org as their domain name) and the FACIM who both share common members on their boards of directors use the acronym ACIM as brand name and also mark this acronym with the ® registered trademark symbol even in places where they are not granted the right to do so. Basically, they use ACIM as their face value brand name regardless of the limitations set out by their registration. The issue here has nothing to do with whether they are granted permission or not. These are the same groups that were publishing without rights to a copyright as proven in court. The phrase "the Course" is short and very generic, avoids any of these issues, is used by reputible secondary sources in the media, and also by the court, and there isn't any reason not to use that for shortening the title, especially when even between you and I it is clear that some controversy exists over the use of the other acronym "ACIM". If between you and I there exists this controversy, then certainly a fair number of readers in the future will feel the same way. For these reasons and in support of NPOV, we should be using "<i>the Course</i>" rather than "ACIM". Ste4k 02:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are correct that "ACIM" was an invalid trademark. It is not a trademark now. I was mistaken about doing a search on ACIM and finding thousands of hits. I just used a well known search engine and received 1,080,000 hits. To avoid using ACIM continues to support the false trademark on it. If there is confusion about the legal status of "ACIM" then the article should help to resolve this confusion rather than foster it. I suggest that each of us is free to use ACIM as we wish. We should not attempt to stifle each other. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 17:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Original research is research without a citation. I apologize but that information was fully cited. The URL number happened to be the URL address that pops up when viewing the page in Foxfire. I fail to see the need to repeat the name of the Publisher 3 times. Once seems enough to me in the citation. It seems to me that you may be obscuring the question here, by confusing the terms "original research" with the term "citation", the term "obscure" with the term "redundant".

<p>Your accusation about obfuscation is unfounded and appears to be personal rather than topical regarding this article. Removal of information regarding a reference is obfuscation by definition. As you mention information in this article does need a reliable resource and must pass <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a> which states, (fyi), "Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources." It refers to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> which states, (fyi), "A primary source is a document or person providing direct evidence of a certain state of affairs; in other words, a source very close to the situation you are writing about. The term most often refers to a document produced by a participant in an event or an observer of that event." and also "We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a reliable publisher." Therefore, failing to have any reliable source for information yields only <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> original research which is by defintion: "a term used on Wikipedia to refer to material placed into articles by Wikipedia editors that has not been previously published by a reputable source." The specific publisher of this specific version of this book is "Foundation for Innner Peace" and therefore is a primary source. The only information that should be included into this article from the primary source is covered by policy (fyi) in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves</a>, and as stated, must be "relevant to the notability of that group or organisation". You should be aware also, that according to policy <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, (fyi), "Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it." And this is why, as I stated before, in my opinion, other editors of this article, including myself, have indulged you sufficiently with patience regarding the matter of sourcing this article.

<p>There appears to be basic error in this discussion. That basic error is insisting that all sources are secondary.

<dd>Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources.

<dd>In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources (examples would include apple pie or current events), but these are exceptions.</dd>

Until such a time as all of the aforementioned as well as other groups affiliated with "A Course in Miracles" can be represented fairly and equally, the tag {{unbalanced}} should remain.

<p>You seem intent on imagining several factions within the ACIM community. I know of only two. The Endeavor Academy group which probably constitutes less than 1% of those who study the book, and the other 99% or so. You seem intent on imagining that the public domain versions of ACIM are as you wrote, "written by different authors", and quite popular, when in fact they are all slightly resequenced versions of the same original Urtext, all written by the same original author, and edited by the same original group of editors. I know of nobody outside of the Endeavor group who considers anything other than the 2nd edition as their primary study material source. All of these facts were noted in the previous article group, yet you have attempted to significantly mistate them and alter them beyond all recognition. What type of personal agenda do you have regarding this material? -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 22:10, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

My intentions for this article are to clarify this topic on the whole so that anyone that hasn't ever heard of this topic can be readily informed, in an easily understood manner by the content of this article on the topic in the whole.

<dd>On this aim, I think we agree. To write an article that that can be easily understood by one who has no previous knowledge of the material. But I believe that the article should also offer helpful information that is more in depth for those who have some cursory knowledge of the material as well, as one would expect a good encyclopedia to also offer.

<dd>Yes, there are three primary versions. These are commonly known as the Urtext, the HLC, and the Wapnick version. There are also multiple variations of these both written and "electronic". The Urtext is the earliest publicly known version. Within the Urtext Bill Thetford was the designated editor by "the voice" rather than Helen. The HLC is the version edited by Bill and completed in late 1972. He added the organization of the chapters and sections. Unfortunately, he removed important material. The last version was a further edit by Ken Wapnick after studying the HLC for only one year (today this length of study would be considered that of a beginning student). He deleted more material and changed much of what remained. I do not have a favored version. I use all three. My complaint is that the image is nothing more than advertising for the most limited of the three versions. It is also deceptive as it suggests that this is the only form both in print and available for free on the internet as public domain material. Last, it adds nothing but advertising to the article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 12:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For myself, I can't tell yet how many there are in number, but the contents are significantly different. Between versions, there are edits, omissions, additions, etc., so that the basic underlying flow is there, but in our own WP lingo, the best way to state it, is that there were several POV forks on the original work. According to the court, the work put forth by Schucman and Thetford, was distributed at several stages to many people without a copyright. One of the earliest of these went to the Edgar Cayce group, and is called the HLC version. AFTER that version had been given, Ken Wapnick entered the picture and made many editorial contributions. Wapnick joined forces with Skutch, and his wife Skutch Whitson who had a corporation called the Foundation for Parasensory Investigations (FPI). They later changed the name of that group to Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP), and became board members with Wapnick in the organization he founded with them called FACIM around 1983. During the years betwen 1975 and 1983 the work was distributed to many other parties without a copyright mainly by Skutch Whitson (according to the court records). The amount of POV added before those parties themselves published is debatable, but nevertheless, this is a book that discusses changing one's mind. Therefore, in my opinion, any subtle edits, even on a subliminal basis, could have drastic different outcomes in the readership of the versions. The easy way to put it is that there are several books with several authors all under the same title that carried the legacy original work by Schucman and Thetford. Even after the court case between Penguin/FIP/FACIM and NCCFE/EA, FIP having it's copyright determined void by Federal court, modified their version again, adding a preface, numbering system, and appending another section to the end. Penguin's contract was for $2.5 million to lease the copyright for a period of five years ending in December of 2000. This contract was made between Penguin and FIP. Another earlier printing of the book was funded with $440,000 by a philanthropist, and this funding was also given to FIP. Ste4k 02:30, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for comment suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Dear Ste4k, You seem intent on acting in what seems to me to be an irrational manner towards this article. You are now deleting the work of others wholesale without comment, making inaccurate poorly researched statements about the publishers, and seemingly refusing to listen to any reason whatsoever. I am therefor proposing that before you (or I) make any further edits to this page, that we submit for comment your recent assertion that the 1.5 million figure must be listed as "unverified", your apparent plans to assert that there is now an official 3rd edition out by the publisher, and your recent deletion of my work in the Contents section. Could you agree to this?</p>

<dd>I think you should do some more research and re-read my comments on this page. I believe that I make myself specifically clear in all regards. It is not up to me to produce for you any verifiable sources for statements that you wish to include on this page. Please refer to <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html#The_policy" title="WP:VER">WP:VER#The_policy</a>. There shouldn't be any doubt in your mind nor any reason for RfC in this regard. I do appreciate, though, your concerns over what could turn into edit-wars and I don't believe that edit-wars do anything to help an article in any way. I will agree to leave the content as is, if you agree to allow the templates to remain so that other editors may be appropriately advised about the matter of this article needing some help. But I agree on condition that you do not further add material to this article's existing content, and that you consider balancing the topic of this article with the information from the other articles concerning the other factions which you also started; i.e. Charles Anderson and Endeavor Academy, and that you propose them to be merged. I think you should also address the third and a possible fourth faction in this article so that it does not turn into the "rehash" of a court battle which has already been decided. I think this would address the concerns of at a minimum, seven editors in regard to this entire category. Ste4k 21:18, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has already been stated that there are almost no secondary sources outside of the two groups named. That is a <i>serious</i> problem for Wikipedia. If it is genuinely true then the article should be deleted as unverifiable from reliable sources. So, what is required is references to secondary sources - <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> ones. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:50, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A book search on Amazon.com, placing "A Course in Miracles" in the title bar results in 230 plus books that list ACIM in their title. I believe that at least some of these books could be considered as secondary neutral sources. Amongst these is the book by Patrick Miller. A book that has sold 1.5 million, spawned at least 230 spin offs, and yields .6 million hits in Google seems to me to be worthy of an article, and a significant article, in Wiki, written by at least some editors who have actually read the material. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 22:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to agree with the concerns expressed about the lack of sourcing and OR in the article. To take one of many examples:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Most theologians agree that some of the most radical spiritual principles first introduced by the historical Jesus include:
<dl>
<dd>Jesus' teaching about radical forgiveness.</dd>
<dd>Jesus' radical reformulation of the old Jewish law to highlight the</dd>
<dd>need for 'brotherly love' to mean neighbor-as-self.</dd>
<dd>Jesus' teaching regarding the parental relationship between all men and "God the Father"."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is no source whatsoever for this statement. The depth of presumption is mindblowing. Ignore for a minute the sloppiness in not limiting the statement to Christian theologians: How did the editor know what "most theolgians" think? It seems implausible that there would be such broad agreement on an amorphous, value-laden classification like "most radical." The entire comparisons section is completely OR. Only two of the subsections have footnotes and even these are problemmatic. The cited sources appear to support only the proposition that ACIM teaches X. The author then contrasts this to Christian teaching Y. This is a synthesis, which is still OR per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position</a>. Any comparisons between ACIM and other religions should rely on a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that compares the two. Although the original authors of this page undoubtedly worked hard to put it together, the writing process used was exactly backwards: you don't write an article on the basis of "what I know is ..." and then source it when challenged, you consult sources and then write the article on the basis of the sources. I would support removing large chunks of the article and simply starting over. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 00:31, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is incorrect. I am relatively familiar with the genre and just about everything this editor has included is more or less accurate. Unless this editor (Scott P.) is himself the author of every other source I've previously read about ACIM, it would be virtually impossible for him to have not done research before writing this article. He didn't make this stuff up. It is out there for anyone who wants to, ahem, do the research to find out. I certainly agree that it is preferable to cite sources in the articles. But accusing this editor of doing no research prior to writing this article, or of writing the article "backwards," is not fair. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondary_Source_e086.html" title="User:Secondary Source">Secondary Source</a> 06:14, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but "more or less accurate" is a pretty low standard to shoot for. I'm sure the editors of this piece (Scott and others) have done some reading in ACIM, perhaps even a lot of reading. However, there is simply no substitute for having source material on hand when writing and citing that source material for the propositions contained in the article. A major benefit of close sourcing is that it forces a writer to discipline him/herself so that the approximations and sloppiness present in a "more or less accurate" article are eliminated. This is why citing sources is not merely "preferable," but crucial. You seem to suggest that the intended reader of an encyclopedia article (who almost by definition is not very knowledgeable about the subject of the article) should go out and do research to verify the material in the article. There are two problems with that. First, it limits the usefulness of the encyclopedia. An encyclopedia is supposed to provide people with a brief overview of a topic so that they can quickly acquaint themselves with it. If the infomation is only "more or less accurate" and the reader is forced to do further research to figure it out for him/herself which information is accurate and which is not, this convenience is lost to the reader. Second, the reader (who, remember, is a novice in the subject) won't necessarily know where to look to find the sources to verify the information in question. I am very impressed by the enthusiasm of the editors who work on this article. I am confident that this can become a great article if they follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 03:56, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I am suggesting is that Wikipedia editors should not accuse fellow editors of not doing research when they themselves have not done the research either. I am also suggesting that there is a very real difference between <i>doing research</i> and <i>citing the sources of the research</i>. They are two different issues. It's rude for the rest of you to say he didn't do research. It's also inaccurate. He has done research. What he failed to do in some instances is <i>cite</i> the research. (And the rest of you seem very uptight about which sources you will allow to be cited, which makes writing an article about a relatively new spiritual phenomenon very difficult.)</dd>

To clarify, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> requires that the editor who originally inserts the material in the article provide the citation. It is much easier for him/her to do so than for a later editor (who may not know all that much about ACIM to begin with) to come around and chase down a cite for some material. After all, no one wants to spend hours trying to find a cite for some proposition only to find out that it is not true. The good news is that there seems to be some work proceeding on sourcing the article.</dd>

<p>I'm still awaiting Ste4k's response regarding the other RfC request. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 01:16, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Although I think Ste4k could slow down a bit, I believe his overall concern is sound- this article does a lot of talking, explaining, etc., with almost no sources. I believe much of what is in here CAN be sourced, but it will take lots of time. So, I propose that Ste4k and other editors bent on deleting a lot, instead insert lotsa "fact" requests and give other editors a month or so to reply.... I ask for a month, because 90% of the article is unsourced! <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 03:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Consider balancing the topic of this article with the information from the other articles concerning the other factions which were also started by the original author of this article; i.e. Charles Anderson and Endeavor Academy, and in the interests of balance as well as disambiguity of the title "A Course in Miracles", I propose these to be eventually merged. I think we should also address the third and a possible fourth faction in this article so that it does not turn into the "rehash" of a court battle which has already been decided. I think this would address the concerns of at a minimum, seven editors in regard to this entire category. Do you agree? Ste4k 16:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I have studied the material over the years, the major split in ACIM is between Ken Wapnick (FACIM) and everyone else. Now that the major court battle is over, it has been my experience that those who are very familiar with all three primary versions of ACIM do not prefer Wapnick's version and do not agree with many of his thoughts in regards to ACIM. One major problem with quoting secondary sources is that FACIM used its financial wealth and legal power (derived from the now invalid 1975 copyright) to only allow publication of material that met his approval. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 04:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a relatively inaccurate statement. Kenneth Wapnick is the president of the Foundation for A Course In Miracles, which publishes many books and has many students. All you have to do is read their website <a href="http://www.facimoutreach.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.facimoutreach.org/" rel="nofollow">Facimoutreach.org</a> in order to see that many people do indeed trust Wapnick and FACIM (also, check the Amazon sales rank of their many books). The major split is not between Wapnick and everyone else. Wapnick has a lot of students. It's not Wapnick vs. the rest of the ACIM community. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondary_Source_e086.html" title="User:Secondary Source">Secondary Source</a> 06:30, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that Wapnick has a lot of students. There would not be a split if he did not. The financial and other sources of power that Wapnick has accumulated are derived from the copyright that the U.S. Court has recently determined to be invalid. He has used that power over the years to suppress dissent through actual or threatened legal action. It is therefore not surprising that his organization (FACIM) and supporting companies such as "Fearless Books" have thrived. On the other side of of the split are many students of ACIM as well as several organizations. Some of these are:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I suggest that the material on FACIM be deleted from the "Organization" section of the article. The FACIM is not the organization of ACIM. A short statement that ACIM does not have a formal organization would be much more accurate. Several organizations have formed around ACIM, however. Much of the study of ACIM is on an individual basis or in small groups both on and off the internet. This would provide a more accurate and balanced view, eliminate advertising for FACIM, place the focus back on ACIM itself, and shorten the article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 12:53, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reiterate my suggestion that the Endeavor Academy articles be merged into this article and that the third and possibly fourth version of books under this title be fairly represented in the content. I have recently found another version of the book printed in Hungary called the "Illuminate Edition". It's content does <b>not</b> match the content of some of the other versions of this book and in a signifant manner, but it obviously comes from the same source authors (Schucman and Thetford) Ste4k 17:11, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you'd like to archive the discussion, I'm all for it. It gets extremely tedious trying to find things.</dd>
<dd>The articles were up for deletion. The discussion is twice as long and tedious. One is a biography that, imho, hasn't any biographical information, doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and is based on hair thin sources that are only complaints about the subject of the biography. I nominated it for deletion recently along with the article for the Academy, which doesn't meet <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, nor <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and is again resting only on hair thin sources all of which are basically biased against the subject. In my opinion, if the topic matter is "the Course", the subjects of these other two articles would help to balance any POV in this article on <i>the Course</i>, and they certainly haven't reason to exist stand alone. Also in my opinion, in order not to have this article on <i>the Course</i> turn into a replay of the court trial, the third and maybe other versions of <i>the Course</i> should also be added; i.e. in a balanced fashion.

<dd>You must be looking at some other article then. This page is 32 kilobytes long, currently. There is very little if any fact in the article at all. The sources are all from the same company that produces the version of the book that is being presented. The scant few secondary resources are extremely unreliable. The article doesn't even establish why this particular version is notable in any way. The article does not address any of the other versions that have the same title, nor their etymology. There isn't any mention of any scholastic value to this work, nor is there any mention of how it has impacted society at large. I would think that with 32k of space being eaten up that the article could at least answer why it is important. Ste4k 03:51, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestions For A Different Approach</span></h2>
<p>It seems that if we wish to improve this article it would be better approached with a team effort rather than an adversarial one. I suggest that we agree to discuss the article from beginning to end and reach a consensus before making additional edits. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. We should be able to work together to add our strengths.</p>
<p>If everyone is OK with the OR template and the Introduction then perhaps we should proceed to the History. If not, perhaps we could discuss the previous items in the sections below.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The "normal" way that is done on articles like this is by moving most if not all of the content into sections for discussion. After consensus is agreed upon by several editors to include some specific piece of material, it is included into the article and nobody has any doubts or contention since consensus has already been achieved. I suggest that we archive this discussion again since it is far longer than the article and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. That in itself would allow for a consensus forming discussion regarding sections of the article. Ste4k 03:57, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If we continue to argue and work in opposition no helpful outcome will come from our energy here. I suggest that we all work together to improve the article.

Although Scott P. has said that he does not have time to work on this article due to his upcoming wedding, I would not be surprised if he also left because of this adversarial approach. Most of us have limited time to help with WP, some more so than others. If I am going to work on this article I want it to be enjoyable where people are working together to improve the article.

<dd>Ste4K, may I say that this is quite an unusual way of going about this? You may want to ask these editors that worked hard in adding the material to provide references, before doing what yoy are doing, and if in a reasonable time period, let's say 10 days, they do not provide sources, you may then remove material. Also note that primary sources about the subject are allowed in the article in a comesurate manner. I am reverting all your deletions and asking editors to provide references by July 28th. At that time you may discuss with other involved editors what needs removing. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 05:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Regarding unusual, it is actually the normal way of doing things, and if you would like some examples, I would be more than happy to point a few out. The number of editors that actually included the bulk of the material is "one" and perhaps "two". Neither of them are participating in the discussions anymore. The reasonable time period of 10 days appears moot since in the actual time period which has been for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;oldid=61191521" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;oldid=61191521" rel="nofollow">three weeks</a>, has been quite enough since nothing has changed at all regarding the problems except bickering over "tags".

<dd>There may be plenty of resources, but the one you just added was a primary and discussed below in the section you started called "references".

The environment here is conducive. Reverting good research and citation efforts on the other hand, is not conducive.

<ul>
<li>I am strongly opposed to setting any artificial deadline. This is a reasonable article that is referenced. Could the article be improved? Yes. It should take place in the time it takes.

<dd>But once this all settles down, we need to impose some deadline for getting unsourced material out of the article or it will just remain indefinitely. We shouldn't be just assuming it's accurate.

<p>This "poll" is an embarassment. No one is going to vote that "original research" should be included in an article. This is a diversion from the real issue: Ste4k's massive removal of information.

<dd>So you feel that some articles are different than others when it comes to policy? I don't. They are all the same to me. You can call the Course whatever you'd like, I prefer to refer to it in the same neutral tone as Publisher's weekly, and the U.S. District Court. If the Course has been purchased by so many people, then why isn't there a reliable secondary source quoted as saying so in the article? You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=64721892&amp;oldid=64715231" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=64721892&amp;oldid=64715231" rel="nofollow">removed</a> the reliable secondary sources that I provided. Since neither article has any reputible sources, they are the same to me, i.e. non-compliant, and especially for an article this size. Back to the question then, why do such large amounts of OR/POV <b>remain</b> in the article rather than being discussed in an organized and productive manner, compliant with policy, off of the article and in the discussion area where the first step in dispute resolution is to occur? Nothing was deleted, nothing destroyed, everything that was moved off of the page had a clear and concise reason for doing so, was preserved in the discussion area where each and every section, statement, chunk, external link, etc., could be discussed and consensus built upon. Edit wars avoided, no more "unsightly tags", these were the very things that you yourself and Who123 were striving for. True? Ste4k 20:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Why an encylopedia article on ACIM must by necessity contain original research.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>No one should be lead into misinformation at the hands of article writers who write to validate their own opinions instead of from a true objective desire to spread genuine knowledge. Such actions bring down the credibility of the entire encyclopedia, and thus its effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, it's understandable to want to quote only reliable secondary sources outside the movement, for these will be objective, able to see outside ACIM's world and look in safely, untouched. And in ACIM's world, only the perfectly inclusive is true, and as such, to stand outside the movement and look in as an outsider ... well, this will be necessarily to miss the point, for this perspective is an <i>impossibility</i> for ACIM, and so ACIM will naturally be misperceived by a view from nowhere that tries to say anything meaningful about it. For one cannot understand by standing on the outside looking in objectively. Only those inside will understand, for inside is all there is to those inside, and the man on the outside is <i>inside not knowing it</i>. If ACIM <i>IS</i> true, then the man on the outside who is inside not knowing it is speaking as if he knew what it was like to be inside but cannot for the fundemental reason that the <i>error he makes cannot be contained as if it were an isolated instance</i> by the <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_explosion.html" title="Principle of explosion">principle of explosion</a></i>, which is a natural consequence of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_noncontradiction.html" title="Law of noncontradiction">law of noncontradiction</a>. Where Wikipedia has demanded an outside, separate, objective view, must the system fail where separation means nothing, for no concept is more critical for ACIM to make <i>any sense at all</i>, again, by the aforementioned principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where separation means nothing, then, allow us to plea an exception to Wikipedia's rules, which <i>must</i> fail in such instances. Perhaps if we post a disclaimer in the "main tenets" section that the information is <i><b>in principle</b> unverifiable and unintelligible by objective outside means</i>, we will be able to post valuable information of such a nature on Wikipedia. Otherwise, we have done ourselves a disservice. Despite the demise of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_positivism.html" title="Logical positivism">logical positivism</a>, many will still believe that scientific, objective verifiability is what it means for a statement to be meaningful. They should reconsider.</p>

<dd>Antireconciler, I think what you say is very true. I do not demean science and it has it role. Spirituality simply does not fall within the realm of science. I think we can use primary sources (the various versions of ACIM) as well as secondary sources. Unfortunately, the secondary sources are few and not without bias. This means some interpretation of the primary source (which is all a secondary source is). ACIM is decentralized and this makes it more difficult to pin down. One of the teachings of ACIM is to seek our inner teacher which is not dissimilar to 'the Kingdom of Heaven is within you.' This makes it even more difficult to pin down. I think our role as editors is to try to present to the reader the best introduction to ACIM that we can. Other areas such as factions or detailed information should be split off into linked articles.--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123">Who123</a> 02:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not really sure why this means an article on ACIM must contain original research. Discussing the belief system laid out by A Course in Miracles is not original research since the concepts have been previously published (in the book itself). I think much of what has been removed could be replaced and sourced to the orginal text of A Course in Miracles. --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey"><font color="#000080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>N</strong></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>scheffey</strong></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">C</a>)</sup> 04:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Nscheffey, I think you have a good point. I'm not sure how to answer, so let me explain it to myself, for everyone. My main point is that no one can "stand on the outside" of the ACIM system and understand it. This is because supposing yourself outside of ACIM contradicts <i>the</i> foundation of ACIM, which is that no one can be on the outside, that is, separate. It is like <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parmenides_of_Elea_4725.html" title="Parmenides of Elea">Parmenides of Elea</a> says, who argues that Being(-with-a-capital-B) is One. Then, what use is the view from outside the system, which by the system does not exist? And to look in on the system from a view from nowhere, well, quickly do all manner of contradictions follow. Please don't mind my language. None of this is complex unless you make it that way. Complexity requires a multiplicity in multiplicity of arrangements. "Being is One" is the opposite of that. So, who writes of the system is a part of the system, else, contradiction. Even though I say, "you are a part," I don't mean you are a separate division of it. Unless "Being is One" is incoherent, I must mean you are <i>identical</i> to it, an expression, or extension of it. This is an important distinction, so please pay attention. Then, to understand the system is to understand that you are a part of it first. To be a part of a system and then write about it, collecting passages from the primary text as you find them meaningful, this I call original research. This is not to be unobjective in its subjectivity. A personal subjective perspective can simultaneously be objective and shared. This is a trivial consequence of "Being is One." Naturally a multiplicity of true perspectives that are not identical is what it means for reality to be divided. This is, by our hypothesis, an absurdity, and an absurdity without it, for nothing makes sense without it. This is the opposite of complex. That what is unverifiable is simultaneously verifiable, what is original research is simultaneously thouroughly unoriginal ... this is what ACIM means, because ACIM means Being is One. This is not complex, and because it is not complex, you will not have difficulty understanding it. If you are having difficulty, it is not for the system you have it, but for some notion you must already support. This is as obvious as daylight and cannot possibly be missed. Naturally, I don't mean any attack on science. Unless "Being is One" is nonsense, ACIM includes science, and not in part. I can not say, "science is applied to the realm of the world, ACIM to the spiritual." What can separate, divided realms with different laws mean? Surely nothing. Law is one ... which is the Law. It should be clear, then, why heralds of WP:Ver are taking no action at all. What are they doing? No really. <i>What are they doing?</i> (pause 5 seconds and reread) They are doing nothing. They are splitting the indivisible. Is doing the impossible meaningful? Only if dreams are first! And I tell you, dreams are not meaningful because they are not real. If they were real, they wouldn't be dreams. Is this making more sense? If so, I need say nothing further to convince anyone that verifiability heralding here is like a triangle with four sides. <span style="color:grey;">—</span><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler"><span style="color:#005500;font-variant:small-caps;">Anti</span><span style="color:#00B000;font-variant:small-caps;">reconciler</span></a> <span style="color:grey;">◊</span> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntireconciler_b23a.html" title="User talk:Antireconciler"><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:grey;">talk</span></a> 05:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In response to the question "Should original research, unreliable sources, questionable links, and unsourced statements be moved to discussion, or remain in an article?", Original research should be tagged with {{fact}}, and if it isn't referenced in a day or two, it should be moved to the talk page.

<dd>Is moving material from the article to the talk page <b>within 48 hours</b> a WP policy? I disagree with this notion. This particular subject is a difficult one. One key member has stated that he is just about to be married and does not have time at the moment. Time is limited for all of us, some more so than others.

<p>The version preferred by Ste4k is a good starting point - and I emphasise <i>starting point</i> - for a proper article; it has none of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> which has been so much a problem with this article in the past.</p>
<p>Starting from this foundation, I suggest that people expand the article <i>including only verifiable, cited content</i>. That is: content which can be verified from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary sources</a>, and for preference sources completely unconnected with the warring factions of FACIM and their ilk. We do not need a dissertation on the book, nor do we need to be told how unique and precious it is, <i>unless</i> we can cite independent commentators who say that. We can say "According to Oprah..." and that is well and good. We should not say "According to Joe Schmoe..." where Joe Schmoe is one of the competing vendors of programmes based on the book. This is an encyclopaedia, not an advertisement hoarding.</p>
<p>So, I'm not endorsing Ste4k's <i>content</i>, but I strongly endorse her <i>approach</i>, which is to prune back to what is verifiable and verifiably neutral, and work up from there, preferably a paragraph at a time. By this method we should get a good article. I see plenty of evidence that editors here do actually want to produce a good article. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Start afresh if you'd prefer. I want to see the back of the original research. Start with a stub and work up, by all means, and debate line by line on Talk. I'm told that some great articles have started out that way. As long as we stick with what is verifiable from neutral secondary sources I'll be happy. Will's version was much better than a lot of what had gone before (by virtue of being much <i>shorter</i>); I think the itme has come to be really bold and essentially kick out the original content altogether, since it was anything but neutral. I freely admit to being biased in that I thought the earliest versions I saw were quite nauseating, I have a low tolerance for people erecting their soapboxes on Wikipedia's street corner. Anyway, start small and expand with references will work just fine for me.

<dd>Polls Are Evil<sup>TM</sup>. Honestly, every time I read this article I have the strong urge to simply delete it out of process. There is so much arm-waving and hyperbole left from the original fan-page. As I said, I don't endorse the text at all, what I endorse is the approach: to ruthlessly remove anything which is not verifiably neutral, by reference to independent secondary sources, and build up slowly to an article which tells the story right, so that anyone - believer or sceptic - will see it as fair. The orignal article would have been fine on Wikinfo, but not here. But I'm not wedded to any version in particular, what I want to see is the neutral article which - if I were not in the middle of moving house - I would want to research myself. This subject has piqued my interest and I'd really like it to inform me without trying to either sell me the damn book or persuade me that they are a bunch of charlatans&#160;;-) <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Should we not do another poll to address this underlying issue so that we can work by consensus from this point on?

<dd>At this point I am just as interested in the process as the result. I think the key is conflict resolution through discussion and consensus. Ultimately issues will require some form of vote. This is a microcosm of the world. It is an example of democracy within the policies of WP. We do not want the tyranny of the minority <b>or</b> the tyranny of the majority. BTW, What exactly is a straw poll? Do our votes need to be straw polls?--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#008080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 23:12, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have another idea. I think our main motivation should be the reader. If we decide to start over with a stub, perhaps we should do this on another page like A_course_in_miracles_build and leave the full article up for the readers?--<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho123_626e.html" title="User:Who123"><font color="#008080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who</strong></font><font color="#9400D3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>123</strong></font></a> 17:35, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
