<dd>The dictionary I keep here by my computer - <i>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary</i> - gives <i>a capella</i> as a variant spelling. If I were voting in an election, I would vote to standardize it as <i>acappella</i>, since in English that <i>a</i> there by itself (not connected) can sometimes look confusing. Probably best here is to stick with the proper usage. I do wonder, though, if this sentence shouldn't be modified some way - "Often you find the wrong spelling a capella with one p." - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 03:03, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now someone has added a couple of times - "Correct is only a cappella - with two p and two l." This makes it even worse, especially since the sentence itself isn't even very grammatical.</dd>

<p>Eastern Orthodox christians (especially Russian and other slavic groups) insist on singing unaccompanied by instruments. I didn't want to change the corpus of the article itself since I am still not completely familiar with the Wikipedia protocols.</p>
<hr />
<p>For groups that already have Wikipedia entries, is it really necessary to have a direct link to the official page for the group from the a cappella article? <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentura_94ad.html" title="User:Ventura">Ventura</a> 22:27, 2004 Aug 20 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think probably not. I added <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_4.html" title="Anonymous 4">Anonymous 4</a> with a link to their website, because at the time there was not an entry on Anonymous 4. After I started one, I didn't remove the link (and also forgot to add the link to the entry). I'm going to remove the link from the a cappella article.

<p>The list of groups is a bit out of hand. It should probably contain a few prime examples of each a cappella style (lay Church, religious, collegiate, etc.), and not all these minor groups. A simple link to the CASA listing of collegiate groups should be more than enough. It's walking the line of using Wikipedia for self promotion. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 07:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I came to make a suggestion/question, and found SparqMan already posted this regarding the list, so I'm putting my comments here. I don't know in general whether the groups listed are "shameless plugs" or "useful listings", not being at all familiar with most of them. If there are articles on groups, a list such as this does make it an easy "jumping off point" to find them. BUT the list is getting quite long. My thought is that if some of these are college a cappella ensembles, those could be moved to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_a_cappella.html" title="Collegiate a cappella">collegiate a cappella</a> article. Just a thought. Maybe some of them should be deleted altogether. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 19:10, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That makes sense. Groups with articles get a link from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_a_cappella.html" title="Collegiate a cappella">collegiate a cappella</a>, and the rest can be found from the CASA listing. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 21:12, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sparqman, looks like though we discussed this, neither one of us did anything. The list just keeps getting longer. What do you think? So we move on this? Another possibility, I suppose, would be to create a page called List of a cappella ensembles. Or is the original idea better? Any more thoughts?? - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 03:28, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem has certainly gotten worse. List of collegiate a cappella ensembles probably requires it's own list. That way we can link to both articles and have external links to websites for groups without articles. The CASA listing (<a href="http://www.collegiate-acappella.com" class="external free" title="http://www.collegiate-acappella.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegiate-acappella.com</a>) isn't exceptionally comprehensive or useful. So maybe name of group, school they're affiliated with, and the city, state. Perhaps a table? And I guess we can make a list for non-collegiate ensemble list too, although that doesn't seem to be where the traffic is coming from. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 00:49, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SparqMan, the table idea sounds good. Do you want to take the lead in this? I'm not familiar with making tables, though I suppose I could figure it out. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 03:28, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I personally don't consider any of them 'minor groups'. I like this list, and I believe it should stay. Some of these groups are actually pretty major, just unheard of by many people not all that familiar with a capella.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One problem I see is that some of these might be "pretty major" in a smaller class (such as collegiate a cappella), while being relatively unknown in the larger genre of a cappella music (which is what the article is about). - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 03:28, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I went ahead and made a move toward changing the ensemble listings. None were deleted. I moved all that were college-related, as best as I could tell, to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_a_cappella.html" title="Collegiate a cappella">Collegiate a cappella</a> article. I think they will be more fitting and appropriate there. I did leave the Yale Whiffenpoofs link, since they are the oldest collegiate a cappella group. Someone should check over the remaining list and see if any others ought to go to more specific articles. SparqMan, you still might want to move forward with your table idea at some point. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 15:32, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the last line of "Modern A Cappella", which appeared to be a plug for someone's school group: <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_Preparatory_School_9bef.html" title="St. John's Preparatory School">St. John's Preparatory School</a>, in Danvers, MA, has an award winning a cappella group, <i>Swingtown</i>.

<p>One can argue the origin of the genre; I have always believed that A cappella music originated from Negro Spirituals, Seeing that Afro Americans could not afford instruments. I have also been taught that it was a way of socialising, correct if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Gregorian Chant far predates slavery in America, and was originally a cappella.204.69.190.75 01:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would have imagined some African slaves working together in cotton fields harmonising songs. I would ague that this music originates in Africa or slavery.</p>
