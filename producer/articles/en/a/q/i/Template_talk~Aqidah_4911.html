<p>I'm not sure how I feel about this template yet, but replacing the existing template on a bunch of pages is inappropriate - I think they should all be reverted until more people have looked at and discussed this template. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been thinking this over, and I am leaning towards supporting this template. My initial reaction was that it was too specific, and brought people in to a level of detail that is not necessary if someone came from another page that was linked to (for example) <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>. But on the positive side, this template does a nice job of linking together lots of related pages. My one wish would be that everyone work on expanding the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_Muslim_Beliefs_c6d5.html" title="Basic Muslim Beliefs">Basic Muslim Beliefs</a> page, which will be a very important one as lots of pages will link to it through the large text at the top of the template. If this is a good page, I think it will address my main concern about not allowing non-Muslims to jump to a friendlier overview page. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 04:20, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is improper to mix Shia and Sunni beliefs together as if they were part of one community. If you are going to mix these two together then why not mix all of the sects in one page. Each section should be separate.</p>

<p>You cannot just have a Sunni and Shia template. It suggests that Islam condones division and free religious thought and opinion so long as one believes in Allah when it clearly does not. Everyone who claims Islam is not Muslim and thats just a simple fact. If we were to suggest that certain groups were within the realm of Islam because of their claim then you must add Farakanism to the template. After all, they claim Islam. The purpose is to teach ISLAM and not everyone's personal view of what they believe Islam to be. So again, adding Shiism and Sunni together is an error and contributes to the non-muslims misunderstanding that Islam is divided into two major groups. Islam is one and therefore ONLY ONE viewpoint should be expressed. Zora's claim that there is no central authority to define beliefs is incorrect. Muslim beliefs are defined in their holy book and in the guidance of their Prophet. No need to sugar coat anything here. How is a non-Muslim supposed to learn what Islam really is? Is it Sunni or Shia? Is it Sufism or is it Ahmadiyyah? Is it this or that? Is it left or right? etc. When Muhammad taught Islam he did not teach various paths leading to the center rather he taught one Islam and that same Islam still exists today and shall exist when we are all gone. Those editing this forum have a great responsibilty ahead of them. Either you will guide the people to that which is correct or you will lead the people astray. Now setting up other forums about the history of this sect and that sect is something totally different then teaching about ISLAM.</p>
<p>Sunni Muslims, at least, have tolerated a wide range of belief. As long as a Muslim prayed, paid zakat, kept Ramadan, and did Hajj, he/she was accepted as a Muslim. Declaring other Muslims to be non-Muslims was discouraged, as fitna. Some academics have said that this makes Islam an orthopraxy more than an orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Emphasizing belief over practice is inherently contentious. Chosing which groups get to be on the template and which don't is inherently contentious. If you add ALL the groups recognized as Muslim, or claiming to be Muslim, you're going to have a template a foot long. You're going to have to add Ibadis, all the varieties of Salafis and Wahhabis, Barelvis, Deobandis, all the Shi'a sects, etc. etc. What about the Ahmadis? The Qur'an Alone Muslims? Differences within the Qur'an Alone Muslims? What about the various schools of fiqh and kalam?</p>

<dd>Man, stop whining, whats wrong with you? You cant have a template since it would be to long if everybody would be in it? BAH! There was NO problem excluding the shias from the Islam template, when it only displayed the Sunni Five Pillars and not even hinted that Shia dont use them, justifieng that was covered in the article, but NOW, ALL OF THE SUDDEN, the inability to include EVERYONE makes the template "a bad idea". i KNOW that you KNOW better that so, i dont get what you are after... --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:40, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are both right. I think Zora's concern is that by making a belief template, we are forcing one particular viewpoint upon the reader of what groups Islam is divided into, the relative importance of each, and the belief system each has. But Striver is also correct that the current Islam template already is forcing a particular viewpoint. Zora, I don't think we have to include every Muslim group in the template, but obviously a line must be drawn somewhere. The only other option is to have a simple "beliefs" link to a page that *does* contain every group. To some extent, many of the templates and pages on Wikipedia are already guilty of oversimplification: it's just not feasible to list every group or exception when making a quick reference list of almost any kind. Questions for you both.&#160;:) Zora, do you see the problem with the current Islam template? Can you think of a way to fix it? Do you have constructive criticism for the new template, in regards to where we should draw the line (if you had to)? Striver, can can you be a little nicer in your responses? We are all working towards a common goal here, and Zora raised a legitimate concern. Where would you draw the line? How you would respond to groups that did not make the cutoff? If this new template does not work out, how would you recommend fixing the main Islam one to better reflect a more balanced viewpoint? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:27, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Im harsh on her, since i feel she is persecuting me, editing everything i do, deleting everyting i add, reverting everyting i do, voting against everything i propose with words like "a bad idea", "abominanation" and "no good". IN THE SAME TALK PAGE! She can have it, she deserves the harsh words, maybe that will make her realise she is upseting me. Do you see me using the same tone against other people? I feel she have been stalking me for over 6 month, deleting a whole new section only because she does not like the prose, calling it "sub standard english", instead of fixing it to her HIGH AND MIGHTY LEVEL OF PERFECT ENGLISH MASTERY. She deletes whole section of shia belifes, only cause she thinks it bazar gossip, EVEN THOUGH I CLEARLY WROTE THAT ITS NARRATION SHIA QUOTE and did not state them as facts. I HATE HER BEHAVIOR! For other examples of how she treats Shia editors, talk to random Shia editor.</dd>

<dd>Regarding your question, i have no objection to any proposal, as long as i get a templa that includes the Shia roots and branches and i can have it on the appropia articles- really, i dont care.</dd>

<dd>I propose to have Shia, Sunni and Ismaili, the other groupes are to small to be included. If anybody complains, let them expand the template to included them, i dont care.

<hr />
<p>Why does it say Sunni Ahl Al Sunnah wa Al-Jama'ah; it sounds very redundant. If the inclusion of links to both <b>Sunni Islam</b> and <b>Ahl al Sunnah wa Al Jama'ah</b> is what we're going for, then we should break it up and write out "Sunni Islam" and place "Ahl al Sunnah wa Al Jama'ah" under it do lessen the confusion.</p>
<p>I should also point out that Striver made a new template (without any prior assent or discussion that I can find) and that a little discussion about its inclusion is needed before placing it on pages: <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProphets%2C_salaf_and_caliphs_4bc3.html" title="Template:Prophets, salaf and caliphs">Template: Prophets, salaf and caliphs</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoa_2d5a.html" title="User:Stoa">Stoa</a> 18:01, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good point. I suggest we remove the Ahle Sunnah wal Jama'a part and just keep Sunni Islam as the head - since this wiki is in English. How come the Sunni heading has 2 lines? It makes it look more important than all the rest - doesn't seem fair to give the whole Arabic name for Sunni Islam and not for the rest. Perhaps. the first heading should read 'Sunni 5 pillars of Islam' as one heading. Or perhaps we could make all the other boxes have 2 headings, like:<br />
Shia Twelvers<br />
Roots of Religion<br />
Branches of Religion (we'd take out the shia twelvers part from that one) and<br />
Shia Ismaili<br />
7 pillars etc. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliasad_942d.html" title="User:Aliasad">aliasad</a> 01:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does the final section of the box say "Shia Druze"?
