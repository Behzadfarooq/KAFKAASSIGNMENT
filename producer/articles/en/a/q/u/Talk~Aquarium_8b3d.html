<p>I would like to point out that the function of an air pump as stated in the third paragraph under Design, is to circulate the water and thus providing more airation rather than airating the water as to be presumed in the quote form the article: "Air pumps are employed to adequately oxygenate (or in the case of a heavily planted aquarium, provide carbon dioxide to) the water." in case of CO2 disolved CO2 is used.

<p>I've heard that different types of livebearers (mollies, swordtails; no hybrids) were taken to Europe in the early 19th century in tin cups. Anyone have a source that might support this claim?

<dd>No. Look for the date of the first scientific description of the guppy. Some early shipments from the mid-Amazon were made by steamship. More satisfactory were the early air flights. The first neon tetras went to Paris in the 1930s.

<p>Here is the discussion on Peer review regarding this article:</p>
<p>It's a lovely article, and very useful, but could someone please write something about freshwater aqaria? I've done lots of work on this article (several weeks ago at this point), but would like some feedback on it, specifically on organization and what information might be better relegated to other articles. Also, I harbor fantastic dreams of featured article-ness, so any help in moving in that direction would be greatly appreciated! <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 02:21, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It still seems a bit sketchy. I'd like to see more info about problems: new tank syndrome, breaking-in aquaria, ammonia/nitrate conversion, how biological filters work, pH buffering, aquarium cleaning, mulm, stocking (fish per m<sup>3</sup>) etc. It should introduce aquarium concepts and issues, not just provide an overview of different types. A diagram of a home aquarium would be very useful. And lots more photos: this is the perfect venue for beautiful aquarium images.

<li>I'd suggest two areas for change. First is under the "Aquarium Design" paragraph, in the "Filtration System:" bullet. I would replace "nitrates" with "nitrogenous wastes" (like ammonia and nitrite). The biological filtration provided by the vast majority of commercially available filters do little or nothing to reduce nitrates. This is pretty clearly indicated in the "Nitrogen Cycle" section.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of the "Nitrogen Cycle" section (para. 2)...based on the literature available (such as <a href="http://www.marineland.com/science/nspira.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.marineland.com/science/nspira.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/258" class="external text" title="http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/258" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://biology.kenyon.edu/Microbial_Biorealm/bacteria/nitrospira/Nitrospira.htm" class="external text" title="http://biology.kenyon.edu/Microbial_Biorealm/bacteria/nitrospira/Nitrospira.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>), it appears that Nitrobacter has been replaced by Nitrospira as the key player in the reduction of nitrites.</dd>

<dd>I think the lead would benefit from a little more along the lines of "an aquarium can vary in size from a small household goldfish bowl to a massive structure which holds xxxxx billion gallons of water, etc..." and "use can vary from hobby and educational to scientific experimental applications etc..." Obviously the preceding isn't the text to use, but such would round out the lead a bit better IMHO. <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 03:42, Dec 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting article. I quite like it! Issues I'd like to see resolved, though, before it becomes FA status are as follows:
<ul>
<li>The lead section needs expanding, especially for an article of this size. My suggestion is to <i>very</i> briefly summarise pertinent top level sections and add another paragraph to it. For instance, a few sentences on the history of the aquarium would be good, then a few sentences on the info you have in "Modern Aquaria", then stuff on Aquarium ecology would be nice.</li>
<li>There are too many bullet points in the article. I would suggest converting many of them to prose.</li>
<li>Are the sections organised well? For instance, I initially thought the section "Modern Aquaria" should go into the history part. Put then I realised that it's dealing with facts about aquariums. I think the page needs a bit of reorganisation, but I don't know enough about the subject matter to help here.</li>
<li>I have added <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Aquarium_2a13.html" title="Sydney Aquarium">Sydney Aquarium</a> to the list of aquariums.</li>
<li>Sources: surely you used more than one source? There must be aquarium books about if there are several million enthusiasts. Also, when you <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cite_your_sources.html" title="Cite your sources">cite your sources</a> try to use the Wikipedia format.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So this is interesting and seems be well researched. I can see a lot of time and effort has gone into it! But I think it still needs a bit more work. I think this will most definitely get there though. It might even get to the main page. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:54, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TBSDY, I've tried to address all of your points. I would like to invite all you Wikipedian aquarists out there to please contribute some pictures of your tanks! Also, I've put down a few references, but I'd appreciate help from others contributing works they've found helpful, as I know there are tons of books out there on the topic. I'd appreciate another look at the remodelling work I've done to see if the text can be fixed up some more.

<dd>You flatter me&#160;:) I've done my best to craft the lead section into three not-overly-long paragraphs, added a couple pictures from other wiki articles I linked to, and made some other very minor edits to the text. I greatly appreciate all your help. Is there anything else that needs cleaning up before moving to FAC? I hope that once it's there we can get some pictures of people's home aquaria contributed, and perhaps an illustration of the <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen_cycle.html" title="Nitrogen cycle">nitrogen cycle</a> (the one from that article isn't appropriate), or a schematic diagram of a home aquarium.

<p>Yet another rule of the thumb used by aquarist for dealing with biological loading and to create a self sustaining ecosystem in an aquarium is the cubic principle. This is also a rule of the thumb, like the 1 gallon per-inch rule of the thumb (generally used). However neither of them has been empirically validated, (which is why they are <a href="../../../h/e/u/Heuristic.html" title="Heuristic">rule of thumb</a>). And hence maybe both could be mentioned instead of just one.</p>
<p><i>The cubic principle</i>:</p>
<p>The minimum <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallon.html" title="Gallon">gallons</a> of water for a fish in a home aquarium is the cube of the fish in inches. Thus if the fish is x <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inch.html" title="Inch">inches</a>, then the total number of gallons needed for the fish is x <sup>3</sup> gallons of water. Eg: for a 5 inches fish, the minimum number of gallons for the fish is 5 <sup>3</sup> = 5x5x5 = 125 gallons.</p>
<p>The minimum distribution of water for a single fish is x <sup>2</sup>. Thus if there are 125 gallons of water in a home aquarium or fish tank, then the number of 5 inches fish that can be put in the fish tank is x<sup>3</sup>/x <sup>2</sup> = 125/25 = 5 fishes. Similarly the number of 4 inches fishes that could be put in the same tank would be 125/16 = 7 fishes, or one could put combination of 2 five inches fishes and four 4 inches fishes.</p>
<p>The minimum length of the tank for a fish is 1 feet for every inch, so the minimum length for a 1 inch fish is 1 feet, while for a 5 inches fish is 5 feet. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_klein_03ef.html" title="User:Robin klein">Robin klein</a> 20:32, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

Robin, This is a general article on aquaria, and I believe that it is not appropriate to discuss several rules of thumb on this subtopic. In this case, the most common (which is thoroughly obvious by checking reference websites and books) suffices, as it is merely an illustration of the broad topic of biological loading. If you'd like to include your rule somehwere, I'd suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>finding a reference to substantiate it (otherwise we don't know that it's not <i>your personal</i> rule of thumb that you invented, which is both non-notable and original research... two reasons not to include anywhere on wp);</li>
<li>starting a new article to discuss it in, with a link from the <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarium.html" title="Aquarium">aquarium</a> article, so that it can be discussed in appropriate length without becoming overly large and detracting from the main article; and</li>
<li>figuring out a better way to describe it... the current language is very confusing and probably misleading.</li>

<p>Thinking this through based on air-water gas exchange and fish requirements, fish flesh (weight or volume) should be proportional to the surface area of the tank. You can tweak that a bit based on fish activity, plants, and I believe pH. You can greatly increase the fish if you have a cold-water aquarium (cold water holds oxygen better) or air-breathing fish like the <a href="../../../s/i/a/Siamese_fighting_fish.html" title="Siamese fighting fish">Siamese fighting fish</a> and <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf_gourami.html" title="Dwarf gourami">dwarf gourami</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 07:27, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ugh, you want me to do legwork and find a style guide that covers this!?!?!?&#160;;) Heh, I just figured that we should mention at the top that there are two plural forms (as we do) but then pick one and stick with it throughout the article body. The flip-flopping back and forth is sort of irritating. Actually, the only place "aquariums" seems to be used is in the link section at the moment. Maybe I should just Be Bold and get rid of them.

<dd>I think the external links sections should be removed altogether from the site. Although some of the links currently posted are quite good, many are sub-standard and a few are simply commercial link farms. Wikipedia has an excellent Google pagerank on this page, so it's quite valuable to tropical fish websites to be in the Wikipedia list, but it's too complex to try to rate them all. Through my own two tropical fish sites (which aren’t in the listings), I'm aware of 32 information sites, 11 fish profile sites, 39 online stores, 27 forums and 85 tropical fish clubs. You can easily find the best ones by searching for “tropical fish” on search engines, so there’s no need for Wikipedia to provide this service.Tim
