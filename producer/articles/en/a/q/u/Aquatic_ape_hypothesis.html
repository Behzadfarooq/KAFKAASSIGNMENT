	    <p>The <b>aquatic ape hypothesis</b> (sometimes called the <b>aquatic ape theory</b>) proposes that the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_evolution.html" title="Human evolution">ancestors of humans</a> went through one or more periods of time living in a semi-aquatic setting and that this history accounts for many of the characteristics of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a> in the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_%28genus%29.html" title="Homo (genus)">Homo</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genus.html" title="Genus">genus</a> that are not seen in other <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate.html" title="Primate">primates</a>, such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a> or <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla.html" title="Gorilla">gorillas</a>. The hypothesis, often referred to simply as AAT, has been poorly received in mainstream <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleoanthropology.html" title="Paleoanthropology">paleoanthropology</a> (but see the textbook of Campbell and Reece 2006, pp. 848-849 for a positive reception of the AAT).</p>
<p>AAT states that human ancestors evolved in warm and wet environments and gathered much of their food from shallow sea-, lake- or riverside environments through beach-combing, wading and diving for foods such as coconuts, bird's eggs, turtles, shell- and crayfish, part of reeds, papyrus and other aquatic plants.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> There are interpretations which propose fresh-water habitats (Ellis 1993), variations in the timescale (Verhaegen et al. 2002) and the proposed degree of selection arising from moving through water. The most popular formulation involves a semi-aquatic episode coinciding with the <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliocene.html" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>-<a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleistocene.html" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> littoral diaspora of the <i>Homo</i> genus along the East-African <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rift_Valley_8981.html" title="Rift Valley">Rift Valley</a> lakes and the African and Indian Ocean coasts.</p>
<p>A fairly broad definition of the aquatic ape theory is given by Kuliukas <a href="http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/AAHDefined.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/AAHDefined.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (AAH):</i> <i>The hypothesis that water has acted as an agent of selection in the evolution of humans more than it has in the evolution of our ape cousins. And that, as a result, many of the major physical differences between humans and the other apes may be explained, to a large extent, as adaptations to moving (wading, swimming and/or diving) better through various aquatic media and from greater feeding on resources that might be procured from such habitats.</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Prior to 546 B.C., the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milesians_%28Greek%29_17b6.html" title="Milesians (Greek)">Milesian</a> philosopher <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a> proposed that mankind had sprung from an aquatic species of animal. He thought that the extended infancy of humans could not have originally permitted survival as a land-based species. This idea was based on elemental forces of mutation as opposed to evolution.</p>
<p>The history of the modern orgin of the AAT is poorly known. For instance, some researches believe that the first "aquatic hypothesis" was originally suggested 1972 by Elaine Morgan, most are sure that this idea was proposed 1960 by Alister Hardy, and few insiders believe that the first author was the German pathologist Max Westenhöfer (1871-1957), who published his "Aquatile Hypothese"<a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> in his main work <i>The Road to Man</i> (<i>Der Eigenweg des Menschen</i>). However, Westenhöfer's idea was already proposed as early as 1923, as Nicole Bender-Oser showed in a in depth medical thesis about Westenhöfer's life and work (Bender-Oser 2004).</p>
<p>The idea of a decisive aquatic phase in hominid evolution became more well-known in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> when proposed in academic circles by the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_biology.html" title="Marine biology">marine biologist</a> <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Alister_Hardy_54ee.html" title="Sir Alister Hardy">Sir Alister Hardy</a>. Hardy had had the idea privately since about <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, independently of Westenhöfer. The early television playwright and later <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminist</a> writer <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaine_Morgan_%28writer%29_7f80.html" title="Elaine Morgan (writer)">Elaine Morgan</a> developed and promoted it, publishing in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> her first book on the subject, <i>The Descent of Woman</i>, and later other books, including <i>The Aquatic Ape</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>), <i>The Scars of Evolution</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>), <i>The Descent of the Child</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>), and <i>The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>). Other proponents of this theory are Marc Verhaegen, Renato Bender and Nicole Bender-Oser. An important aspect of the reception of the AAT concerns the fact that Bender-Oser's pro AAT was aknowledged with a faculty price by the Medical Faculty of the University of Bern in 2004. This is seen as an important positive reception of the AAT from the academic side.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Nakedness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nakedness</span></h3>
<p>Humans are the only <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate.html" title="Primate">primate</a> species in which, over most of the body, <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a> is so fine and sparse as to reveal the skin under it into adulthood. Baby <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a> have thinner hair and visible skin but as they reach adulthood after a year or two (as opposed to more than ten for humans) their fur becomes much thicker. Furthermore, human hair is broadly aligned in such a way as to match fluid flow lines while swimming or sweating. Environments known to give rise to naked <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">mammals</a> are tropical (in some larger-sized mammals such as <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephants</a> — which are themselves descended from aquatic ancestors — and some <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinoceros.html" title="Rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> species), aquatic (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale.html" title="Whale">whales</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphin.html" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walrus.html" title="Walrus">walrus</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/g/Dugong.html" title="Dugong">dugongs</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">manatees</a>), semi-aquatic or littoral (<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippopotamus.html" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babirusa.html" title="Babirusa">babirusas</a>), and subterranean (<a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_mole_rat.html" title="Naked mole rat">naked mole rat</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Bipedalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bipedalism</span></h3>
<p>There exist very few <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipedal.html" title="Bipedal">bipedal</a> mammals, and humans are the only ones which adopt a full-time, fully-upright posture with a vertical <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebral_column.html" title="Vertebral column">vertebral column</a>. Gorillas, chimpanzees and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear.html" title="Bear">bears</a> are able to walk on two legs when they have a particular reason. This can be seen when chimps are feeding on grasses in a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayou.html" title="Bayou">bayou</a>. They often stand on two legs and wade through the water with their upper bodies out of the water. They do this with relative ease, but always revert to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadruped.html" title="Quadruped">quadrupedalism</a> as their basic means of locomotion. Some prosimians such as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indri.html" title="Indri">indris</a> skip sideways on two legs when on the ground, because their adaptations to leaping through trees make ground-based quadrupedalism difficult. <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">Kangaroos</a> and hopping <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodent.html" title="Rodent">rodent</a> species use a bipedal form of locomotion with bent knees and bent hips in rest. Even <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">birds</a>, with exceptions such as (semi-aquatic) <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin.html" title="Penguin">penguins</a> which have vertical vertebral columns, walk bipedally but with a horizontal vertebral column. Creatures such as <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squirrel.html" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meerkat.html" title="Meerkat">meerkats</a> often adopt an upright posture when stationary, but do not walk or run bipedally.</p>
<p>Although the posture improves the ability to carry objects and use <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool.html" title="Tool">tools</a> while <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walking.html" title="Walking">walking</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running.html" title="Running">running</a>, bipedalism and upright posture are believed to come at a significant cost, from <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back.html" title="Back">back</a> and <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knee.html" title="Knee">knee</a> problems, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin_splints.html" title="Shin splints">shin splints</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varicose_vein.html" title="Varicose vein">varicose veins</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemorrhoid.html" title="Hemorrhoid">hemorrhoids</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernia.html" title="Hernia">hernias</a>, and problems with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a>.</p>
<p>Aquatic ape theory proponents argue that as evolution works in small steps, it is hard to see how bipedalism could have evolved on the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savanna.html" title="Savanna">savannah</a>: the mass of the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torso.html" title="Torso">torso</a> makes it inherently unstable and inefficient for locomotion. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">Water</a>, however, supports the body, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proboscis_monkey.html" title="Proboscis monkey">proboscis monkeys</a> as well as lowland gorillas have been observed wading bipedally in mangrove or swamp forests. Baboons have also been observed to cross shallow water bipedally <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgiKWUHDFG0" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgiKWUHDFG0" rel="nofollow">(video)</a>.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that the one other animal known to have a pelvis adapted to bipedal walking was prehistoric <i><a href="../../../o/r/e/Oreopithecus_bambolii.html" title="Oreopithecus bambolii">Oreopithecus bambolii</a></i> (commonly known as the "swamp ape" owing to its flooded <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habitat_%28ecology%29.html" title="Habitat (ecology)">habitat</a>). Kuliukas in 2001 argues that the skeletal morphology of the early <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominan.html" title="Hominan">hominan</a> <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australopithecus_afarensis.html" title="Australopithecus afarensis">Australopithecus afarensis</a> is consistent with adaptation for wading in water. Kawamura in 1962 observed a troop of Japanese macaques developing bipedalism in water through cleaning sweet potatoes therein.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Breathing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Breathing</span></h3>
<p>Most land mammals have no conscious control over their breathing. The voluntary control humans have over their <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respiratory_system.html" title="Respiratory system">respiratory system</a> can be compared to that of (semi)aquatic mammals which inhale as much <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth%27s_atmosphere.html" title="Earth's atmosphere">air</a> as they need for a dive, then return to the surface for air. Morgan argued that this voluntary breathing capacity was one of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preadaptation.html" title="Preadaptation">preadaptations</a> to human voluntary speech.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Fat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fat</span></h3>

Mammals which <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernation.html" title="Hibernation">hibernate</a> have localised seasonal fat humps; but aquatic mammals retain fat (<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blubber.html" title="Blubber">blubber</a>) throughout the year. Human infants are especially fat compared with apes and most other fully terrestrial mammals. The human fatty layer (<a href="../../../p/a/n/Panniculus_adiposus.html" title="Panniculus adiposus">panniculus adiposus</a>) is also attached to the skin of the central body parts as is the case with most medium- or larger-sized (semi)aquatic mammals, rather than to the muscle as in almost all land mammals. Humans also lack the layer of cutaneous muscle (<a href="../../../p/a/n/Panniculus_carnosus.html" title="Panniculus carnosus">panniculus carnosus</a>) possessed by land mammals including non-human primates, which allows many land animals to twitch their skin, and which is not present in aquatic mammals.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Facial Structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Facial Structure</span></h3>
<p>Human facial structure is quite different from other apes, with thick eyebrow hair and downturned nostrils. The shape of the human nose, with nostrils running perpendicular to the rest of the face, prevents water from entering the nose while upright. Thick eyebrows allow water to flow from the top of the head away from the eyes upon surfacing, allowing for faster adjustment to vision through air. Human facial hair forces water to flow away from and around the nose and mouth to enable faster inhalation upon surfacing.</p>

<p>Sweating and tears are prevalent in humans but not in other primates.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Kidney morphology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kidney morphology</span></h3>
<p>Amongst primates, kidneys normally exhibiting lobulated, multipyramidal, medullas is a unique attribute of the human species. Although kidneys naturally multipyramidal in their medullary morphology are rare in terrestrial mammals, kidneys with lobulated medullas do occur in elephants, bears, rhinoceroses, bison, cattle, pigs, and the okapi. However, kidneys characterized with multipyramidal medullas are common in aquatic mammals and are nearly universal in marine mammals.</p>
<p>To avoid the deleterious effects of saline water dehydration, marine mammals have adaptively thickened the medullas of their kidneys – which enhances their ability to concentrate excretory salts in the urine. However, the lobulation of the kidney’s medullary region in marine mammals appears to be an adaptation to expand the surface area between the medulla and the enveloping outer cortex in order to increase the volume of marine dietary induced hypertonic plasma that can be immediately processed for the excretion of excess salts and nitrogenous waste.</p>
<p>A phylogenetic review of freshwater aquatic mammals suggest that most, if not all, nonmarine aquatic mammals inherited the medullary pyramids of their kidneys from ancestors who originally inhabited, or frequented, marine environments. So this suggest that most, if not all, aquatic mammals exhibiting kidneys with lobulated medullas are either marine adapted – or are descended from marine antecedents. Additionally, a phylogenetic review of nonhuman terrestrial mammals possessing kidneys with multipyramidal medullas suggest that bears, elephants and possibly rhinoceroses, also, inherited their lobulated medullas from semiaquatic marine ancestors.</p>
<p>The fact that several terrestrial mammalian species of semiaquatic marine ancestry exhibit kidneys with multipyramidal medullas, suggest that humans may have, also, inherited the lobulated medullas of their kidneys from coastal marine ancestors.</p>

<p>The traditional land-based explanation is that fur loss was for cooling - humans sweat more per unit surface area than other mammals, and proponents of this idea claim that it makes us particularly effective at remaining active during the heat of the day. A layer of hair would supposedly reduce the effectiveness of this. More recently, Pagel and Bodmer hypothesised the loss of human hair serves to reduce parasite load. In either case, humans can support hairlessness due to their own distinct advantages with shelter, clothing and fire; using these advantages enables humans to regulate their own temperature better than having a thick layer of fur: the thickness of fur is fixed, but one can remove clothing, move away from a fire, or leave a shelter. This is the same solution humans have for shaved sheep; they are given sheep blankets. Pagel and Bodmer claim "[o]ur hypothesis explains features of human hairlessness--such as the marked sex difference in body hair, and its retention in the pubic regions--that are not explained by other theories." <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2003.0041" class="external autonumber" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2003.0041" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Body hair helps protect against direct sun (shaved sheep overheat more easily) and extreme heat as well as cold. Human sweating is highly wasteful of water and salts, which is a distinct disadvantage on the savanna; and that exposed skin might not be essential for sweating to be effective (hair creates much more surface area for evaporation than skin). A prime example of this is the horse, which does sweat when hot, and yet is covered in hair. Indeed, most savanna animals have hair in part because it provides protection to skin from the heat and ultraviolet radiation of direct sunlight, not as important to semi-aquatic animals which are cooled and sheltered by water.</p>
<p>In addition, any such hypothesis has to explain the pattern of hair that we <i>do</i> have, and why women and children have less body hair than men.</p>
<p>On the first point, why should we have retained head hair if the purpose of a naked skin is to keep cool? On the side of aquatic ape theory, it may be noted that the top and the back of the head are the areas <i>least</i> in contact with water in the human pattern of swimming, and also the only areas covered with thick hair in both mature individuals and (some) infants.</p>
<p>On the second point, it is possible to suggest an aquatic scenario in which mature males spent more time near the shore, while mothers with babies stayed in deeper water out of reach of land predators. By contrast, it is difficult for the temperature regulation hypothesis to accommodate a case where females and infants were <i>more</i> active than males, and therefore more in need of sweat-cooling, in the heat of the day.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: Bipedalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bipedalism</span></h3>
<p>There are over a dozen land-based suggestions as to why the first hominids became bipedal: carrying behaviour, tool-making, and sentry behaviour, for example. Usually these are given as a continuation of ape bipedalism which is less adaptive.</p>
<p>The difficulty with this, according to aquatic ape proponents, is that they only apply for a small amount of time, unlike wading which could have happened frequently; when not engaged in these behaviours, the proto-hominids would simply have reverted to quadrupedalism. In waist deep water, apes have little choice but to move bipedally and do so, very predictably. This is unusual for mammals which typically continue to wade quadrupedally, or switch to swimming.</p>
<p>For apes to become bipedal they would need more of a curved spine, a basin-like pelvis, and the development of an arched foot with short toes. Apes are capable of walking upright but only for a short distance. Humans can walk long distances but cannot reach speeds on two legs that an ape can on four limbs.</p>
<p>Although, according to <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savanna_theory.html" title="Savanna theory">savanna hypothesis</a> long term bipedalism would be the preferred mode of locomotion for most activities as carrying things in a savanna would be very frequent. Also, an assumption of reverting to quadrupedalism assumes quadrupedalism was the previously preferred method of transportation (see <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html#Bipedalism_3" title="Aquatic ape hypothesis">Bipedalism Objections</a> hereinafter). While modern humans are not engaged in bipedal activities we do not revert to quadrupedalism, while in water humans are frequently not bipedal.</p>

<p>Fat is often believed to be important in developing and maintaining the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>, which is a very expensive organ in terms of energy requirements. This suggestion, as with body hair, requires an additional explanation for women and babies having a much higher proportion of body fat than men -- such as that babies need fat to aid high levels of post-natal brain growth not seen in other primates, and women need fat to aid in pregnancy and lactation.</p>
<p>The aquatic ape hypothesis accounts for the sex differences in fat (as with body hair) by suggesting that nursing mothers would have spent more time in water than adult males. Terrestrial models suggest that the difference is due to the need for it during pregnancy and lactation.</p>

The suggestion that aquatic mammals or semiaquatic mammals lose their hair is based on a small group of aquatic mammals that did, and typically larger aquatic mammals. Many large mammals have shorter, fine hair, regardless of their aquatic involvement. Most aquatic and semiaquatic species of mammals retain their hair. Even in water, hair is a good insulator. Beavers, otters, fur seals, polar bears have all retained their hair.</p>
<p>Many juvenile primates, such as chimps, have larger heads, less hair, and a greater ability to learn.

<p>It is true that the human penis is large relative to body size, though the bonobo penis is the largest of all primates (per Marvin Harris).

Humans' tendency to mate ventro-ventral does not necessarily imply aquatic adaptation.

In addition, humans are able to mate in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sex_positions.html" title="List of sex positions">a variety of positions</a>, including coitus more ferarum, but dolphins are <i>only</i> able to mate ventro-ventral due to the location of their reproductive organs.

This is, opponents claim, an <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_ignorance.html" title="Argument from ignorance">argument from ignorance</a>; simply because another explanation is not forthcoming does not mean that there is no other explanation. Comparing human morphology to that of other mammals requires one to ignore all the known ways humans are different from other mammals: full time bipedalism, use and control of fire, use of more advanced technology, large brains. Anthropology is finding explanations for these characteristics and typically they heavily relate to other unique characteristic of humans. Theories which not only explain the characteristics but have evidence to support the idea that they are the actual cause.</p>

<p>Although it has very little to do with the theory itself, many skeptics of the aquatic ape hypothesis attack the proponents of the hypothesis, rather than address the hypothesis itself. <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> attacks have been repeatedly launched against supporters of the theory. Much has been made of the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alister_Hardy_db21.html" title="Alister Hardy">Alister Hardy</a> pondered the role of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathy.html" title="Telepathy">telepathy</a> on evolution<a href="http://www.ehe.org/display/ehe-page.cfm?ID=19" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ehe.org/display/ehe-page.cfm?ID=19" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Also subject to ridicule have been lesser claims made by some proponents in non-scholarly works, such as a suggestion the mermaids are some kind of race memory of an aquatic stage<a href="http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/maquaticape.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/maquaticape.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Others have gone so far as to parody the theory, such as with the <a href="http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume7/v7i5/pliocene-pussy.html" class="external text" title="http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume7/v7i5/pliocene-pussy.html" rel="nofollow">Pliocene Pussy Cat Theory</a>, which suggests that early humans used cats to hunt for them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Edit section: The AAT Debate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The AAT Debate</span></h2>
<p>The aquatic ape hypothesis provokes fierce and often acrimonious contention. Skeptics criticize the lack of direct <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil.html" title="Fossil">fossil</a> evidence, and moreover the lack of any direct evidence of any kind; the sometimes amateurish way in which the theory is presented; and the occasional over-emphasis of tenuous arguments.</p>
<p>Proponents complain about a dismissive and superior attitude; attacks on methods and personalities rather than substance; an exaggeration of the degree of aquaticism being assumed; and the failure to provide land-based alternative hypotheses that survive the very criticisms leveled at AAT.</p>

The usual explanation was that human beings had become for a time swamp creatures, or water creatures. Because most mammals were hairy their coats of fur were necessary to help maintain their internal temperature. But water mammals, such as dolphins and whales had lost their hair in order to be streamlined. And people, too, had lost their hair." The aquatic ape theory is addressed as being the primary model for human evolution.</li>
