<p>Im not so convinced about the Mount Henry Peninsula section being made from a sub-section into its own section and the location being merged into the history section - it just doesnt seem to make sense to me.

<dd>Text needs considerable attention. I've done the Sport section and the things I notice include a lot of repetition, what I'd call "delayed punchline" (where you have to read the entire sentence to gather its meaning, and could potentially be misled until doing so), copious overlinking of common words and overbolding of the college's name wherever it appears. I don't know if other sections are as bad and I have a function to go to this evening, but if others (and especially the Aquinas editors) want to consider these points in reviewing the text of the article, I'd say feel free. Don't forget that compelling prose and logical flow are key GA/FA assessment criteria. If we work this correctly on the path to GA, it will greatly reduce the queries that can be raised at FA stage (and FA stage can be open public slather whereas GA is somewhat more collegial in nature). Oh, and a very quick glimpse at Junior, Middle and Senior School reveals a lot of unencyclopaedic content that could be trimmed (general criteria should be, if you can't prove it - or put it another way - if it is impossible to prove, it shouldn't be there.) Also, list or note form should be avoided *in* prose - if it's in the prose, it should be a full sentence. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 08:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Overlinking appears throughout the article, not just in the sports section. I think a more presise, and cut down version of the article will still be able to make the criteria of FA. As it is now, from my perspective, there is no possible way. Articles on the House System need not exist. Remembering that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia is an important point. Would you open an encyclopedia and read a whole article on the House System of a particular school? While an article on the school may be needed, articles with specific information on a certain part of the school may not be. For example: <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquinas_College%2C_Perth_Sport_e214.html" title="Aquinas College, Perth Sport">Aquinas College, Perth Sport</a> should not really have an article to itself, but should instead be merged to the main article. This is needed for all sub articles. If people want very detailed information about the school, and the small and presise article (that will, hopefully, exist in the near future) does not provide enough information, they can use the school's website, or contact the school directly. Its just something to think about. A small presise article is more likely to be useful than a many page novel about the school. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_K_819a.html" title="User:Ali K">Ali K</a> 11:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my view - the length of the article is good - it may have been a bit overdone with all of the junior middle and senior schools bullshit that was on there when you saw it last. But i have trimmed it back to where it should be. How is the Trinity article anything to be proud of - it is practically a start-class article. Aquinas college article offers all of the information required on the subject and a little bit more&#160;;) Im not sure exactly how to reply to your comment but - what should be taken off then? thanks <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 11:08, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right, after some work (<a href="../../../w/o/r/Wordpad.html" title="Wordpad">Wordpad</a> is grand), I've managed to cull almost all of the excessive links and bolding in the article, and made some other minor adjustments to pagination which were breaking the article in some (most?) browsers. Still a lot of work needed on content, but at least the article is workable now from an editing standpoint. The sections on the Junior, Middle and Senior Schools really should be about a single paragraph each, two at most. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 16:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another edit, another talk page note - I culled Junior School down to what I believe is an acceptable size. However, the result is now awkward and incomplete. It contains nothing about sport, for the only reason that the sport section in the original section could not be salvaged (it in effect had no content). I would encourage editors to add back something about sport, but keep it short and to the point, and specific to the junior section (as there is already other sections about sport in the article anyway). <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 16:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think breaking the junior, middle and senior school sections down into one instead of having 4 or 5 sections coming off each is a good idea. it makes the article less cluttered and easier to follow. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 16:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The shield actually starts the year before, with one (or two) event/s from the previous year (2006) contributing to the next (2007) shield, i cant remember which one (possibly house esteddford or academic points)...but thats basically it. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 14:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Image sizes is something to thing about. Per <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Images" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS#Images</a>, don't specify image sizes unless you have extreme aspect ratios or need to show detail in the thumb. Unspecified image sizes will default to 180pixels (this can be changed in users' preferences). The house shields is one which you could leave at (say) 300px because of the detail. All the others could go back to unspecified sizes IMHO. If you feel strongly that normal aspect images do need to be a bit bigger, I personally would never go more than about 250px and that would only be for an image which really needs prominence because of it having more important content.</p>
<p>I do like alternating left and right images, but if you start doing it you need to do it consistently - ie. don't go left, right, right, left.</p>
<p>These things are minor I know, but if you want to head towards FA status, reviewers will shoot you down with little things like that. The article is improving nicely. Good work. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 04:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63295294384"></span></p>

<p>From the peer review that has been archived, i have made a short list of all of the problems areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand the sections, each section should say more about it's subject, even if the information is repeated in the other articles.</li>
<li><s>work on researching and writing some articles on the relinks - Riverton Bridge, Paul Keaney (infamous paedophile/child abuser), Redmond Prendiville (youngest person ever to be ordained a catholic Archbishop anywhere in the world I believe), Matthew Gibney (spoke to Ned Kelly just before he was shot at the Glenrowan siege). Those three men are all interesting and notable characters and would add depth to the article IMO. They've been on my to-do list for a while and I'd be happy if someone got them off it for me&#160;;)</s></li>
<li>What is the fee structure and how does it compare with other Perth colleges? There's a suggestion for a useful new article: Perth private school fees. Thats an issue lots of people want to know.</li>
<li>What scholarships are on offer?</li>
<li>What capital works (ie. building projects) are planned or underway. Colleges always seem to have some big capex projects happening.</li>
<li>The opening paragraph(s) should be a brief summary of the article that says all the most important stuff about the school. How would you tell us about the school if you only had thirty seconds to speak?</li>
<li>History section is pretty thorough but could flow better. I have a bugbear about normal quotes being marked up was pullquotes. Parts of the history section belong in the location section (e.g. "much of the property is still thickly wooded"), <s>and the affiliations section has nothing to do with history.</s></li>
<li>Location should characterise where it is and what the site is like. It does that pretty well. But the article is about Aquinas, not the peninsula, not the river. Summary style isn't necessary and doesn't work here.</li>
<li>Finally, a few questions: What are its values - is it overtly religious? How much does it charge? Is it elite? elitist? How is it rated by the wider community? Is it considered one of the better private schools in WA? Is it thought of as a sporting school that also offers academic programs, or as an academic program that also had a strong sporting tradition? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/b/User_talk%7ESmbarnzy_6a65.html" title="User talk:Smbarnzy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smbarnzy_651f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smbarnzy">contribs</a>) 11:54, 4 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>"Initially at CBC Perth only day pupils were enrolled, but due to population growth in Western Australia during the gold rush period, pressure was put on the school to accept boarding students.[11]" - because i thought that the school originally was planned as a boarding school, which is why Brother Regis Hughes went around WA to collect funds to build the school for boarders?

<dl>
<dd>Question is this statement in the 2nd paragraph of the lead correctly stating the situation.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>In 1937, Christian Brothers College split; with boarders and some day boys going to the newly established Aquinas College,</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>also is this from <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College%2C_Perth_0872.html" title="Trinity College, Perth">Trinity College, Perth</a> correctly stating when it says.
<dl>
<dd><b>In 1938, St Patricks closed with boarders and some of the day students transferred to the newly established Aquinas College in Salter Point, along with some students from CBC.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Both statement indicate that AC was started in 37-38 and both article indicate that CBC continued at the St Georges Tce site until 62 until those students went to Trinity. What do the official school records say as to when the schools started. As I read both of these they indicate that CBC ceased to operate in 62, Trinity started in 62 and AC started in 37 with both having a historical association to CBC dating back to 1894. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnan</a><a href="../../../g/n/a/User_talk%7EGnangarra_4843.html" title="User talk:Gnangarra">garra</a> 12:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that it should be changed from Salter Point, Perth, Western Australia, Australia to Salter Point, Western Australia. It just looks pretty bad, that it has all of those little links and cramps up the infobox, if anyone has a problem with it then msg me <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Couldnt get it to work like that, so ive modified it to be Salter Point, WA, Australia - it looks a tad neater, if anyone can fix it, then please do. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:07, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember seeing it on a webpage the number of staff and threw it into the article (before i knew how to reference properly) and cant find the page again, it is pretty important and needs to be referenced - i remember getting it off a google search. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is lacking alot of flow, and it is written largely in sentences not in paragraphs.

<p>We need some images for the History section - something from CBC definately, and maybe something new that has been constructed.

<p>I think that the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Rice_Administration_Wing_7359.html" title="Edmund Rice Administration Wing">Edmund Rice Administration Wing</a> and the Aquinas College Perth Chapel deserve their own articles - they are largely notable within the community, for their architecture and historical significance <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:16, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This needs a massive re-write, alot of the sentences/paragraphs are poorly referenced, and just seem a bit silly. experienced editors required. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:16, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im not too good with English, but i feel that the article has alot of grammar errors, which has been discussed in the Peer Review taking place, and its a major problem if we are going to get this article to GA. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:16, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
