<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shake's Flavor</span></h2>
<p>Shake is described as a pistachio flavored milkshake. Is there any basis to this? If the only rationale is the color of his shake when it comes out of the straw, it could easily be another flavor like mint or something.

<p>Edit- Originally he was chocolate flavored but that was in the pilot. As far as I know his insides are green which is not the color of pistachio but lime or mint.</p>
<p>It varies from episode to episode. In the more recent ones, his insides are blood red.</p>
<p>We're talking about Shake. Do you REALLY want to know what he tastes like??? My guess is something not fir for human consumption --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 10:25, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oni, I really appreciate your efforts to trim down and help organize ATHF - it is slowly becoming less of a mess. However, I think the pop culture section is particularly important here. Half of ATHF's relevance is as a semi-underground show. It's absurdity gives it that "old people don't get it" quality which gives other pop cultural appearances almost an easter egg property. (i.e. it says more when young soprano is watching ATHF than if he were watching Friends. Plus, the 32K limit isn't a hard one. The key is a) is it easily readible and b) is it long because of meaningless info. I think a) increased organization and b) internal edits like the ones you made, are a better strategy than just cutting out a whole section. aww 18:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have noticed a trend which tends to lengthen this page over and over again...and I think the quality of what it adds is dubious at best: there's a tendency to overanalyze characters by applying quotes, as in 'A is generally true, but there was this one time when B was said, and then another episode where C happened'. Ultimately, at its extreme, this becomes 'State everything a character ever said and did, and point out the contradictions.' If an assertion is really that muddled, maybe it shouldn't be said at all, or should be approached as 'Recurring themes which come up with Meatwad are whether he has a brain and whether he has parents.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One point of ATHF is a degree of inconsistency of the characters, and this appears to be a (vain?) attempt to bring meaning to chaos which has little meaning. For example, yes, it's an open question whether Meatwad has parents, but the question has never been answered, and has almost purposely been given multiple answers by the writers. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 15:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Correction here</span></h2>
<p>This line seems misleading: <b>Both Plutonians are named after universities in Atlanta (Oglethorpe University and Emory University).</b> Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that they are both named after prominent figures in Georgia history, being John Emory and James Oglethorpe? This makes sense, of course, because ATHF was created and is produced in Atlanta. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinja_Joey_ad86.html" title="User:Ninja Joey">Ninja Joey</a> 08:23, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It could be argued that way, in the "if A=B and B=C then A=C" sense, but I sincerely doubt given the nature of the show that the characters were directly named after the historical figures. In a sense, it would be more misleading to assert the direct connection. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 10:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Plutonians *were* named after Atlanta universities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Carl's occupation</span></h2>
<p>I think in the Moonajuana episode, Carl mentions something about working in the styrofoam peanut manufacturing plant. Somebody want to confirm or deny that?</p>
<p>Carl says that he <i>worked</i> in a styrofoam peanut factory. A co- worker there converted a toilet into a bong and Carl says: 'that bathroom was so awesome in high school.' So one would have to assume that he no longer works there anymore. Also, Carl has stated in a previous episode that he works out of the house. Whether he truly has a job of any sort is debatable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Seperate Character Articles</span></h2>
<p>I am not well versed enough in wikipedia to do so myself, but seperate articles for Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and Carl should be created.</p>
<p>Another article should be created with all the ATHF villains and other various supporting characters. OR seperate articles for the recurring villains/characters (Mooninites, Plutonians, Dr. Weird and Steve, MC PeePants) - Illuminator of the Truth 16:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. This article is one of the worst I've seen for a popular TV show. The character sections are bloated and should be moved to seperate pages (or at least trimmed). At least 75% of the trivia mentioned is irrelevant to a proper understanding of the show. And the plot and character devices listed (from seemingly every episode!) don't belong here either. Why look for character/plot continuity in a show that constantly disregards it??? I'm frustrated&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 22:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand the bits that try to devise 'connections' between the episodes either. There are none. It's Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Sometimes Meatwad is dumb, sometimes he's smart. Sometimes Shake is nice, sometimes he's mean. Sometimes Frylock kills everyone. IT MAKES ALMOST NO ACTUAL SENSE, PEOPLE <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMGlosenger_94bf.html" title="User:MGlosenger">MGlosenger</a> 22:57, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to see separate pages for the 4 main characters, but the other recurring characters probably should be merged into <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_from_Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force_3d92.html" title="Minor characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force">Minor characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a>. It would make the size of this article go down drastically (at this time it's currently 46K, which is too big). -- <a href="../../../z/j/h/User%7EZJH_cfde.html" title="User:ZJH">ZJH</a> 03:52, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If I can make a suggestion, I don't believe breaking off articles for separate characters is going to solve the problem under discussion - the growing length of character sections discussion. In fact, I think it's going to <i>worsen</i> the bloat problem. Consider the following inside the 'Carl' section:</p>
<p><i>His devotion to the Giants recently surfaced in a Season 5 episode in which Bart Oates (former Giants center) is sent by "the machines" to kill actress Linda Hamilton. Bart tries Carl's patience and takes offense to the "Gnats" jersies that Carl had made by minorities in an illegal attempt to profit off Giants memorabilia.</i></p>
<p>If you look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force_episodes_e58d.html" title="List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force episodes">List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force episodes</a>, there are only brief summaries of episodes, most lasting no more than 3-4 lines. Shouldn't most episode <i>specific</i> material be going into that article, rather than into character summaries, leaving the character summaries to focus on trends that last more than one episode?</p>
<p>Also, I've said it before on this talk page, and I will again; trying to create a "fully explained" picture of a character inside a series that deliberately contradicts itself episode to episode is an uphill climb, and could even constitute 'original research' by Wikipedia standards if assertions aren't citable or verifiable across episodes.</p>
<p><i>Being made of ground meat, Meatwad is a shapeshifter. He can morph into an igloo, a hot dog, a star, and many other forms, although the hot dog and igloo are his two main shapes. He also has been shown to morph into a large thin square, usually in order to block someone from entering a certain area. On another occasion, he turned into a "meat bridge" for Master Shake. During his time as a circus attraction, he also came up with "Richard Nixon" and "Wayne Gretzky" forms, both of which in fact more closely resemble "Samurai Lincoln," a katana-wielding Abraham Lincoln. Along with his multiple forms, Meatwad can also form triangular arms.</i></p>
<p>...so, for an example, is a complete breakdown of every form Meatwad has ever been, one per sentence, really necessary in Meatwad's summary? I would vote for most material like this being moved to episode summaries. If THOSE summaries get huge, individual episodes can get their own articles, too, like <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a> has. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 04:44, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also think that Shake, Meatwad, Frylock, and Carl deserve their own pages; there's certainly enough material present to warrant the change. <a href="../../../c/1/k/User%7EC1k3_cb43.html" title="User:C1k3">C1k3</a> 06:22, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point I was trying to make above is that a good share of the "present material" doesn't, in my opinion, belong in the character sections at all. Once the articles are split away, it will probably be harder to do this cleanup because the material will be in multiple locations. I'm not saying the split shouldn't happen, but that a cleanup and reorganization is badly needed <i>before</i> the split. That would make the newly split articles shorter and more concise. I speak from experience saying that pulling material from split articles into a (different) single article is difficult and time consuming. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 20:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would also like to see the characters have their own pages because they are very complex. - penu1timate</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Trivia section may get yanked</span></h2>
<p>If you want to ensure that your edits stay in the article, it would be best if you put the information somewhere under an existing section, or made a new more specific section if it wouldn't fit anywhere.</p>
<p>By definition, trivia is unimportant, and Wikipedia is supposed to be a storehouse of important information. By calling your section 'Trivia' you are saying it's useless. Trivia sections are also inevitably just a big unsorted list of miscellaneous stuff.. again, non-encyclopedic.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Attempt to compact the 'Carl' section</span></h2>
<p>I've made an attempt to compact the 'Carl' section as a potential example for doing some of the others. I tried to use Wikipedia policy to guide me in doing this; please understand that I wasn't removing information with no rhyme or reason in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>If something in the article reads as speculation and can't be cited, it <b>is</b> speculation, and shouldn't be in the article according to Wikipedia standards. Examples: <i>Carl also has an unseen friend named Terry (apparently a mutual friend of Dr. Weird's)</i>. <i>Carl's hair in the flashback looks similar to the wig he bought from the clown society.</i> Please see <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">Wikipedia: Verifiability</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia: No original research</a>. Even if 'many' agree on a speculation, it is still a speculation. More examples: <i>However, in later episodes, Carl seems to have toned down his hostility towards the Aqua Teens and appears to be on better terms with them but still gets annoyed easily.</i> <i>While seemingly a goof, some could see it as (given the non-sensical and inane nature of the Ghost of Christmas Past's stories) a factual error...</i> These examples read as 'What somebody thinks', rather than 'a fact' that can be cited.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While this is a personal opinion, I don't believe citing every example of something that has ever happened in the series makes a given article better. <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFAN_8957.html" title="WP:FAN">Wikipedia: fancruft</a> has the following to say about this: <i>It is of course possible to write in great detail on fiction in a way that is factually accurate, espouses the neutral point of view and is not original research, but historically, encyclopedias do this only in the context of representing critical points of view (e.g. when engaged in literary criticism).</i> There were about eight different methods that Carl's house was described as destroyed in this article.

<p>To summarize: I made my best attempt to trim the 'Carl' section based on these policies.

<p>These guys are apparently being charged under <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/266-102a.5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/266-102a.5.htm" rel="nofollow">M.G.L. ch. 266 s. 102a.5</a>. The prosecutors going to need a lot of luck or a very friendly judge to avoid getting this thrown out. There's an unambiguous specific intent element to the crime they're charging these guys with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever possesses, transports, uses or places or causes another to knowingly or unknowingly possess, transport, use or place any hoax device or hoax substance <b>with the intent to cause anxiety, unrest, fear or personal discomfort</b> to any person or group of persons shall be punished by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Id.</u> (emphasis added) This is why the prosecutors are going through so many <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/01/boston.bombscare/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/01/boston.bombscare/index.html" rel="nofollow">contortions</a> to argue that the light-brites clearly looked bomb-like and anyone would have thought it was a bomb, etc. The reason they're doing this is that they need to show these guys were intentionally placing the devices to cause fear, unrest, personal discomfort, etc.; if the Commonwealth can't show this then it loses, because intent is a statutory requirement. It's not enough that these guys simply were trying to promote a movie or TV show or to create curiosity or "buzz" and that happened to make people panic and spend a lot of money. The judge apparently was (appropriately) <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/01/boston.bombscare/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/01/boston.bombscare/index.html" rel="nofollow">skeptical</a> that the prosecutors had evidence of intent. A reasonable prosecutor would realize pretty quickly that they don't have a case, but there's probably a lot of political pressure on this one and they're going to press it (wasting even more taxpayer money) or wait until the media attention dies down and then give these guys a very lenient plea bargain or simply drop the case entirely. If the judge (rightly) dismisses this before then the Commonwealth is going to have even more egg on its face.</p>

<dd>This is not a small misunderstanding, at least not according to the city officials in Boston, MA. A man has been arrested. Traffic in a major US city was paralyzed. Millions of dollars were spent on the response. It involves a giant corporation. It speaks to salient issues of contemporary advertising, terrorism, and culture of fear in a post-9.11 world.

<dd>I believe an early estimate was $500,000 spent on responding and temporarily closing down 2 bridges and an Interstate. Hardly traffic all across the city paralyzed. I agree that it's the biggest ATHF incident ever but it's a show that is relatively unknown anyway. Which is why the characters were mostly unrecognized by citizens. And I'm a fan!

<dl>
<dd>Have you ever been to boston? Believe me, the way that city is layed out, shutting down two bridges and an interstate for even a short time immediately causes a backup into the city from exit ramps, and since the city roads barely ever run parallel in grid formation like most cities, it spreads like a contagion. Say you pour some grease down your sink drain. If it clogs in the right place, and you flush your toilet, your bathtub is going to fill with icky-water. Not that this is extremely related to the notability (I have my answer below for that) but I do believe simply to answer that, shutting down one single bridge abruptly can cause backups throughout that entire city due to its inefficient road layout.--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador"><font color="midnightblue">Oni Ookami Alfador</font></a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 07:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since the Boston police is looking into holding Turner Broadcasting responsible somehow, and that there has been an arrest under a relatively new and untested (?) Boston law, this probably will be remembered for longer than a week. And this did receive a great deal of continuous coverage on the cable news channels, so it's a pretty notable event that could have long(er)-term ramifications.

<dd>This was definitely national news on 1/31, and the governor's intervention lends a special significance to the event.

First, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Boston_magnetic_light_scare_f80f.html" title="2007 Boston magnetic light scare">2007 Boston magnetic light scare</a> is not a good title for the event and it is not accurate (Aqua Teen Hunger Force promotional device bomb scare, or 2007 Boston bomb scare, or something without the term "magnetic light") Second, there should be a succinct summary of the event on this page, posting the full coverage on two pages is not efficient. ¯¯<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">--</a> 12:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name for bomb scare section</span></h2>
<p>The section name here should include the word advertising in the title to make clear who/what the source of the scare was, i.e. the inciting objects were not made by fans, or by the show itself, so it seems like that bit of extra specificity is important. I changed it to "Boston advertising bomb scare" but I admit it's a little strange sounding, it almost seems like there was a scare regarding an advertising bomb which is of course not the intended meaning. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_wiki_6483.html" title="User:Mike wiki">Mike wiki</a> 22:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The bomb scare in Boston was a result of advertising for the upcoming ATHF movie. This article leads the reader to assume that this was a television ratings ploy.</p>

<dd>I'm assuming you ask "is the show cancelled?" Of course not. First, Neither Turner, CN, nor AS has said any such thing.

<dd>Yeah, they were driving down the road and they spontaneously combusted. Or at least in one of them; I think there was more than one commercial that they played at the time. I think one had Meatwad dancing around and he lit on fire while Frylock and Shake just stared. :: <a href="../../../z/j/h/User%7EZJH_cfde.html" title="User:ZJH">ZJH</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../z/j/h/User_talk%7EZJH_7493.html" title="User talk:ZJH">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ZJH_7769.html" title="Special:Contributions/ZJH">C</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_ZJH_6ad0.html" title="Special:Emailuser/ZJH">E</a>)</sup> 23:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that the Boston incident has its own article and there's a chunk of repeated material here, that particular section should be trimmed down to a paragraph. I'll probably take a shot at trimming it down to a summation soonish, but in the interim I invite anyone who thinks that it needs multiple paragraphs in this article to go ahead and speak up. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 18:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not exactly what I had written down, but pretty close.
