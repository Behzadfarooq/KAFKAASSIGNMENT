<p>I added the Criticism section because I felt it was neccessary to report about the bad reviews screenings have been receiving. I cited all these and also added a few more "See Also"s. Should be all good&#160;:D Timekeeper 04:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Should the anonymous comments of reactions to an unfinished film really be given so much prominence in an encyclopedia? I'm not sure they can even be considered criticism given how lacking in critical theory they are. I think downgrading their mentions to something akin to "Reactions to early screenings have been unfavorable." would be much better than quoting an entire negative paragraph done by some unknown person that is highly subjective.71.230.163.26 18:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obviously the film, if it doesn't get well received like the critics have stated, then obviously more criticism will be released and the criticism currently in the article will be downgraded. But as of now as it is the only fanreaction we have to go upon, I vote we leave it. Timekeeper 02:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, at the time of my posting, the correct title HAD been "The Aqua Teen Hunger Force Movie Film for Theaters" but was apparently changed because the story over on Aqua Teen Central (love that site) was just posted on the 3rd. This means the guys over at William Street updated it since the Adult Swim title unveilment. Timekeeper 20:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, we need the title altered to "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters" (no "the") because that's the title according to the latest trailer and the film's logo. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Timekeeper (<a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETimekeeper_5937.html" title="User talk:Timekeeper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Timekeeper_5a2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Timekeeper">contribs</a>) 04:23, 27 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Sohuld it be noted that the title is very reminiscent of the Borat movie?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 21:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How is the title anything like Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan? There are exactly 0 words in common. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 22:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The title of Movie Film for Theaters seems to be somewhat broken English, like the title of the Borat Movie. the words are differnt, sure, but the construction is similar.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 00:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So broken English is automatically Borat now? As far as the gramatical construction, the ATHF movie is&#160;:noun noun preposition noun while Borat is&#160;:adjective noun preposition verb adjective noun preposition noun. At least Borat's movie title uses adjectives. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 00:15, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, why are you taking this so personally? I just made a simple observation, no need to take up arms against me, dude. Relax. But secondly, How many American movies use broken English in the title, in a way that makes reference to the fact that the subject is a film, especially so soon after borat's theatrical run, especially since the news came at a time when Borat was still in a few theaters, and preparing for a DVD release. I think it is entirely plausible that the title was at least influenced by the Borat title. I mean, you have to admit that there is a passing similarity.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 00:21, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I'm writing this because I see no similarity. Its only the "movie film" part that is broken English anyway. I'm just tired of people thinking that Borat is what makes the whole world go round now, broken English existed before he did (<a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakov_Smirnoff_7835.html" title="Yakov Smirnoff">Yakov Smirnoff</a>). <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 00:26, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that borat was the greatest movie ever made, which it isn't, but the titles are similar, as many other people have noticed. See the following websites:

<dd>Your comment also seems to convey that you are writing more out of an aggrivation of Borat fans, instead of a truly nonbiased viewpoint. You should not let your bias against the Borat fan community cloud your judgement. To do so is bad wikiqette, and is offputting to a lot of people.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 00:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you look through my contributions, you'll see I am one of the Borat fans that I supposively hate so much. Yes your third article states the similarity but the second only says its longwinded (hardly something that is exclusive to Borat) and the first only says its more precarious than it (just saying thats its a weird title). Either way, if it is based on Borat's title, why does it matter? <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 00:39, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's just a little noteworthy tidbit that the titles are similar, as a little trivia note. I never said that the title was base doff of Borat, just that it was similar, which is corroborated by all three articles. There is obviously no proof that the title was based off of it, but it does make sense to say that they are similar, as can be corroborated by research. again, though, you seem to be taking this slightly personally. It's okay to disagree, but why is it so personal to you?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 00:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's like saying that oranges are similar to Garfield the cat because they are both the same color... or that Cigarettes and Catalytic converters are the same because they start with the letter C. It's just dumb trivial nonsense that has no place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../z/j/h/User%7EZJH_cfde.html" title="User:ZJH">ZJH</a> 00:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>that comparison does not make sense. It is trivia, you are right there, but trivia is permitted on Wikipedia, and can be seen to some degree in nearly any movie page. But, speaking of Garfield, there is a similarity, as noted on that page, with an italian film which ahs been confirmed by Jim Davis to be unintentional. A close similarity, as noted, not just by fanboys, but websites devoted specifically to all movie releases, as the first two links are, signals that it is a noticeable remarkable similarity. Also, your use of the word fanboy violates WP:NPA, and you can be blocked for it.If you disagree so strongly, file an RfM about it, because you cannot just revert a citeable reference.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 00:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He wasn't calling you a fanboy but those forum opinions.

<dd>Well his words still seemed to violate WP:NPA, and his deletion of all references, including the non-forum ones, seems to say that he was targeting the remark towards me.

<dd>Isn't noting that sort of POV/original research? "Movie Film" isn't too broken. The title simply says that it is a film, it is a movie, it is being released in theater, and it is based off of <i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</i>. --<a href="../../../j/o/p/User%7EJopasopa_ea65.html" title="User:Jopasopa">Jopasopa</a> 01:17, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I cited external sources, so it is not original research, and the pov would be saying that the titles are the same, which I purposefully avoided. Saying that some people have noted a similarity, as corroborated by research, is not pov, as it does not say that they are right or wrong, just that they noted said similarity. I think it is easy to is the difference between these two statements, but the one I put forth, Some people not ea similarity, is not POV, and it is citeable, so it is not original research. Whether the similarity was intentional or not is a matter of debate, and would be easy to fall into OR, but that sentiment is not on the page in any place, and as such, is nto relevant to the discussion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 02:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But is it really important? It seems very trivial, not to mention somewhat opinionated, and does not help out with the purpose of the article especially since it is the information section, which contains probably the most important/significant information.

<p>Aside from length, there is no resemblance to Borat. The Aqua Teen title is playing with redundancy, not broken English. The ATHF joke is funny because a "movie" is a "film" and "for theaters" by definition; whereas "Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" is a play on the bad syntax common in non-native English speakers. Besides, the working title "Movie Film for Theaters" was announced at the boards at adultswim.com before Borat was even released. There is no similarity aside from length. I vote we remove the reference completely. --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 01:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cite your soruces for this claim, please. You need to prove that the title for this was released before Borat. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 12:06, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, test screenings for the movie were held as early as February of 2006, according to IMDB, so you will need to find a source that announces the title of the ATHF film from at least January of 2006 to use that argument.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a>

<dd>If you are asserting that Matt and Dave borrowed the idea for their movie title from Borat (simply because it's long and was released around the same time?) then you have the burden of proof here, not me. So cite your sources for this claim, please. Then read my original post again. My point was that there is <i>no similarity aside from length</i>--the jokes in the titles are otherwise completely different. --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 17:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not asserting that. Some people have said that they see a similarity, a claim which I did cite my sources for. You need to cite your sources for the claim that this title was announced before Borat's. It is very important that you do so, as it would completely win the argument in your favor. If you can prove ATHF's title came out first, which would be in at least January of 2006 or earlier, since Borat stuff was seen in February according to imdb.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 22:55, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I got your message, thanks. I checked the [as] forums for the original date, but couldn't get a page much older than 2007. (I don't know if the forum software archives old posts or if there's a better way to use the search engine--I couldn't figure it out.) Now, that doesn't mean the title "Movie Film for Theaters" wasn't in use before that--I know 100% that it was--but as to your January 2006 date, I have no idea. I didn't even realize Borat was out at that time. I should point out that even in my original post, I said "besides" before I mentioned the forums; I never intended that as my main argument. Let me be clearer about my position. This, for me, is the heart of the matter. My objection to mentioning Borat in the encyclopedia is two-fold: 1) the titles are only similar in their length--thus a comparison on any other basis is unwarranted; and 2) it implies that Matt and Dave borrowed their idea for a movie title from Borat, which seems both unoriginal and tremendously out of character. By the way, I appreciate the message you left and I apologize for being abrupt myself. I just think the Borat reference doesn't belong. --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 10:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I believe the new words added, ie no evidence as to whether or not it was intentional should relieve that argument. The reference merely says that some people have noticed a similarity, which you have agreed to. I would myself suggest do anything you can to find evidence for your other point, as it is the one argument that would completely disprove any argument I could make. I am inclined to believe you, as you have demonstrated a capability to cite sources, so I bet with a little work, you could easily win this debate. Unfortunately, without that evidence, anything more than a simple disagreement doesn't make sense.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGreenFaerae_48fa.html" title="User:TheGreenFaerae">TheGreenFaerae</a> 09:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Will the film really be rated R?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemasterofwiki_ecde.html" title="User:Themasterofwiki">Themasterofwiki</a> 15:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes. --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 01:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please provide proof. The show's creators both support the idea the film will be rated PG13. Timekeeper 02:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As you know, there's been no official announcement yet. But Sentroid91 (the owner of aquateencentral.com) has posted this on the [adultswim] message boards in at least one place. Also, the early reviews at aintitcool.com say there is uncensored swearing ('F' and 'S' words) in the film. <a href="http://boards.adultswim.com/adultswim/board/message?board.id=5&amp;message.id=1091145#M1091145" class="external free" title="http://boards.adultswim.com/adultswim/board/message?board.id=5&amp;message.id=1091145#M1091145" rel="nofollow">http://boards.adultswim.com/adultswim/board/message?board.id=5&amp;message.id=1091145#M1091145</a> --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 17:08, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I know that uncensored swearing doesn't automatically earn a film an 'R' rating. Until we hear something official, I think the page reads fine as is. But I trust Sentroid--he's privy to a lot of information I'm not, and his website is probably the most reliable place for Aqua Teen information online. Also, do you remember "Deleted Scenes"? LOL, if the movie is anything like the content they cut for that episode, it will receive an 'R' rating for sure&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurrayjames_f23b.html" title="User:Murrayjames">murrayjames</a> 17:40, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh sweet, thanks for providing the proof, I can full heartedly agree now because ATC is awesome so if Sentroid says it, it can practically be confirmed. I agree that uncensored language doesn't automatically confirm an R Rating although its possible. Timekeeper 20:49, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
