<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Minor" Characters</span></h2>
<p>My stubby sections on mothmonsterman and the cybernetic ghost oCP were deleted. both these characters appear many times throughout the series; i think they're worth a mention. The Plutonians haven't even really been on more than them. There are also many other characters of this level, like oog and the trees (many of which were in "Last One"). Maybe a seperate page for these "minor" characters, if we conclude there are too many? - <a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrukagina_64db.html" title="User:Urukagina">Urukagina</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin{1}?</span></h2>
<p>Has there ever been an origin of the ATHF revealed? I haven't seen all the episodes yet. I had assumed Dr. Weird created them at some point, especially considering the photo of Frylock with a younger Dr. Weird in Frylock's bedroom. Anyone know anything about this? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 20:25, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But remember: just because there's a photo of Frylock and Dr. Weird doesn't mean that Dr. Weird created them. It is quite a stretch to infer that from a photo of the two. All it shows is that they knew each other — maybe they still do! 134.114.59.41 03:38, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not officially. It's still speculation that Dr. Weird created them. I personally don't believe he did, though. As of yet, it would be inappropriate to say that he created them in the article, unless a disclaimer is put on it. <a href="../../../z/j/p/User%7EZJP_8c71.html" title="User:ZJP">ZJP</a> 05:19, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know recently I had a funny thought that Dr. Wierd and Frylock procreated to have Shake and Meatwad. Though I subscribe to the theory that they were created by Dr.Wierd theres still room for speculation. --<a href="../../../a/h/m/User%7EAhmed_Stephens_43ca.html" title="User:Ahmed Stephens">Ahmed Stephens</a> 22:20, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Frylock does have that picture of he and a young Dr. Weird in his room, which means that Frylock knows of Dr. Weird's existance. It is doubtful that they procreated, however, because I think Frylock's a virgin. Dr. Weird of course isn't, having had sex with a lawnmower. ~ <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResister_6a7e.html" title="User:Resister">Resister</a> 09:16, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, the origin is told in the ending credits and has been aired on [adult swim] during bumps in the past. They created the sequences involving Abraham Lincoln and the man on the moon for that purpose. Possibly due to the fact that they knew there was a plot inconsistency and that was the easiest way to get around it for the time being. - fansite staff member</p>
<p>Actually, the new Aqua Teen Hunger Force movie that may be released next year (2006) is supposed to explain their origins. More can be read about the movie at <a href="http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C93987%7C1%7C,00.html" class="external free" title="http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C93987%7C1%7C,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C93987%7C1%7C,00.html</a> - <a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKamasutra_0819.html" title="User:Kamasutra">Kamasutra</a> 08:22, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As an aside to that, before that news was ever announced (and the film is possibly heading toward a December release, rumoured to coincide with the next season of the show), the ending credit stills that were made by Ben Prisk were supposed to detail an origin because one was never initially written or devised at the time of the show's inception. - fansite staff member</p>
<p>When did they say the show takes place in Union, NJ? That's more <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Jersey_e792.html" title="North Jersey">North Jersey</a> than south.</p>
<p>As the original story was supposed to be Dr.Weird creating a monster which the ATHF as a force was suppose to defeat... Now the story as veered off and it makes no sense but it could be that Dr.Weird created him and put the jewel in his back which gives him lightning abilities but after finding him useless he tried to kill him and he went to the asylum. The series was suppose to portray him trying to defeat frylock and the ATHF. - Fan</p>

<p>There seems to be a conflict regarding the proper spelling of MC P[ee] Pants. I changed it to MC P Pants after seeing it that way on the website, but it's been changed back so I did some more, er, research.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the adultswim.com ATHF site, it is spelled "MC P Pants" on the episode guide and in the description of that episode.</li>
<li>During the episode, however, it is spelled "MC Pee Pants" on the poster on Meatwad's wall, and on his CD covers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was Pee, I had changed it to P a while back, now it's back to Pee. Which should it be? <a href="../../../t/r/b/User%7ETrbleClef_9ee5.html" title="User:TrbleClef">TrbleClef</a> 08:13, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <i>episode</i> is named "MC P Pants." The <i>rapper</i> is named "MC Pee Pants." Probably so TV Guide wouldn't have to print the word "pee." <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakeRocketGoNow_0913.html" title="User:MakeRocketGoNow">MakeRocketGoNow</a> 16:45, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps an explanation of why being named after Universities in Atlanta is ironic would be in order? It just kind of dangles there as is...</p>
<p>I assume its because the AHTF guys are likely based in the Atlanta area...I'm not positive about that.</p>
<p>I doubt its truly ironic. The surrounding colleges in the area were admittedly sources of inspiration for their names but there is no real irony behind it all. Merely a prime example of possibly being strapped for name ideas and using resources that are close at hand in order to inspire ideas. - fansite staff member</p>
<dl>
<dd>I originally wrote that, and I figured at the time that having two of the dumbest characters on the show named after universities (especially fairly prestigious ones like Emory) was pretty ironic. It may well have been nothing (the ATHF creators <b>are</b> good at being random), but it seemed like a good fit at the time. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Cremeans_dd31.html" title="User:Lee Cremeans">-lee</a> 17:04, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I edited the entry to explain this, but it reverted back to original form (I admit, I don't know how the editing works). The characters are named after production assistant/editor John Brestan (who went to Emory) and his brother Matt (who went to Oglethorpe). The writers never met Matt, but they had an exaggerated version of his character based on several outlandish stories.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confirmation?</span></h2>
<p>Can someone confirm the statement that ATHF already had a pilot produced <i>before</i> the Baffler Meal episode of Space Ghost was produced? The paragraph makes no sense. ATHF had a pilot, and after ATHF became popular, SG:C2C produced the Baffler Meal episode, and THEN after that episode aired, a full series of ATHF was produced. I don't get it. How could ATHF become popular as its own show <i>before</i> its first season was even made? It also doesn't follow other stories of the history (which are all pretty unofficial as well).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know the full story, but it's my understanding that the Baffler Meal episode was written as an idea for a Space Ghost show, but initially rejected and therefore not actually produced until after ATHF became a separate show. You're right that that paragraph could use some clarification. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka"></a>—<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka">Triskaideka</a> 15:48, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If that's true, I would think the episode would have been made such that the Baffler Meal characters on Space Ghost would have been closer to their ATHF characters on their own show, but they're not (except perhaps Meatwad). They don't look, act or sound like their ATHF versions. (Baffler Meal Shake sounds more like Ignignokt!) I dunno, the stated version of events just doesn't pass the smell test. Especially considering we're talking about two shows made by the same production company (Williams Street)! Now, I could believe that the episode <b>was</b> <i>produced</i>, but not <i><b>aired</b></i>, before ATHF became a series. That would make quite a bit more sense. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">KeithTyler</a> 17:15, Oct 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Truth is, the Space Ghost episode existed in rough formats, as was told in the second volume DVD commentary. The "Baffler Meal" episode was initially the pitch for the show but since Space Ghost: Coast to Coast had come to a halt at that time (as it was prone to doing, due to rises and falls in ratings throughout its tenure on the network), the greenlight was given for a rough pilot episode of the actual Aqua Teen Hunger Force show instead. It is most noticeable by ways of the constant changes, not just in the "Baffler Meal" episode but through much of the first season of Aqua Teen Hunger Force as well.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Meatwad's Age</span></h2>
<p>Is Meatwad a child? There's no mention of it in the article (just that he is "dumb as hell") but there are many references throughout the show to him being a child, as much as a piece of meat can be a child (such as Frylock suggesting he's "too young" to do some things.) This is also supported by the fact that he's not a full fast food item-- presumably he is a preliminary state of a hamburger.</p>
<p>However, I don't have any specific quotes or proof so I'm not going to edit it into the article. Still, I think it bears mention because someone not familiar with the show would get the impression he's a slow adult from this article. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichie_3ecc.html" title="User:Nichie">nichie</a> 02:35, May 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Trying to pin down whether Meatwad is a child or not is pretty much impossible, since the show has no sense of continuity whatsoever. At best, he's less mature than either Shake or Frylock, which is saying something. But in "Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary" he says his age is 56. So who knows? --<a href="../../../m/r/c/User%7EMrCheshire_2f87.html" title="User:MrCheshire">MrCheshire</a></p>
<p>Edit- He actually says he's 55 on that episode. On the robositter episode he says that he cannot get a job because that would be a violation of child labor laws meaning he isn't allowed to work more than 20 hours a week because he is under the age of 18. There is no real solid proof of how old he is, maybe the only semi proof would be the number of candles on his cake on Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary.</p>
<p>I propose that he is underage in human years (ie. he is a youth for his 'species', or has existed for less than 18 years) and 55 is 'sentient foodstuff years' (ie. his under-18 age translates to 55, or he has existed for 55 years which is a youthful sentient foodstuff.) <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAKismet_8a06.html" title="User:AKismet">AKismet</a> 17:55, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, clearly two users are going into a silent editing war, regardless of whether they are interconnected to the sites that keep shuffling in the list.</p>
<p>I remember coming to this article about three months ago and the only fansite in the links list was Aqua Teen Central. I come around here now and I see Aqua Teen Adventures seemingly put in the light of promotion vanity alongside the other fansite.</p>
<p>So, there should be some consensus as to whether either site (both, one or none at all) belong there since their inclusions seem as if the owners are hungry for hits to their site and it is sickening to see such displays like that in an encyclopedic article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We don't need fansites being promoted here. It's just some kids hungry for hits like you said. If they keep insisting on promoting their own work then we should seek to ban them.

<dl>
<dd>That is a fair assessment, especially given that both sites seem to turn up in Google searches and at least one claims to have over a million hits, so they obviously draw in hits on their own without the promotion here. They are notable in terms of related content and information, even though they seemingly share similar content, but there is no way to properly include either one without someone affliated with the sites in any way trying to put them in a promotional light and that detracts heavily from the article itself.</dd>

<p>The line is and <i>Ice on my fingers and my toes and I'm a Taurus</i>, not <i>Ice on my fingers and my toes and my toys</i>. [as] ran a promo several months ago with an older white man saying the lyrics with a dancer in the background.

<p>I can't find an authoritative source for these lyrics. In addition to the above contributor's, I've seen plausible alternatives such as <i>want a drink, I'll bring it to ya</i> <i>Meatwad you up next work it out now</i> Are the lyrics actually spelled out somewhere by the writers or producers, or are we all just pulling our interpretations out of thin air? As you may have discovered, listening to the theme song dozens of times in a row only makes things more confusing. As an aside, doesn't this stuff belong on Wikisource?

<dd>I'd say the closest thing to an authoritative source right now is the DVD subtitles. I don't feel like checking them all right now, but I know Volume Four has them for the intro. Despite two spelling errors (mike/mic &amp; homeys/homies), the lyrics listed in the article are consistent with the subtitles aside from minor discrepancies such as spelling out the number "one". However, while the subtitles should generally be authoritative enough, they aren't even fully consistent between episodes. The differences are minor though such as capitalization of "Zula". The ones listed in the article seem accurate enough to me, so I won't bother. It is really too minor to worry about. --<a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKamasutra_0819.html" title="User:Kamasutra">Kamasutra</a> 06:23, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, I wouldn't consider either version of mike/mic or homeys/homies to be a "spelling error", since both are hip-hop slang, which really has no central authoritative body that decides what spelling is "correct" for such terms. Yes, we all know that "mic" is short for "microphone", but it's pronounced like "mike" and sometimes gets spelled "mike", and this spelling was even used in song titles on a few rap albums in the mid 80s. As for homeys/homies, the term is a shortform of homeboy and/or homegirl, which in itself is slang. I would think it would be rather difficult to claim one single "correct" spelling for a shortform of a slang term. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 13:43, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is obviously going nowhere. This is a typical discrepancy between a television show's fans who can't agree on something so simple and trite. Let's not turn into Trekkies, please. We all know that the internet and especially Wikipedia are loaded with misinformation.</dd>
<dd>I personally believe the line is "...and all my toys" NOT "...and I'm a Taurus". I would swear by this just based on listening to Schoolly D; it's not that difficult. He says toys. One of Meatwad's trademarks are his toys! Nowhere is it mentioned in the show that Meatwad's astrological sign is Taurus. He's driving in his car, but I bet it's not a Ford Taurus. It simply makes more sense to have ice (meaning "bling") on his fingers, ice on his toes, and ice on his toys, as he has put flash on his toys.</dd>
<dd>Even though I believe it is toys not taurus, I do not ignore the relevant evidence either. Yes, the promo had him saying "and I'm a Taurus". Yes, many websites say it's "and I'm a Taurus". Yes, the singer of the band on Disc 1 of Vol. 2 says "and I'm a Taurus". If all these sources are the definative word, then by all means the line is "and I'm a Taurus". They are not, however. Until we hear from Matt Maiellaro, Dave Willis, Mike Lazzo, Jay Edwards, Keith Crofford, or Schoolly D... it's just not certifiable. I tried looking through the scripts, but I can't find any written words for the intro song.</dd>
<dd>Vol. 1, Vol. 2, and Vol. 3 do not provide DVD captions for the intro song. However, if you turn on Closed Captioning on your television it will display all spoken words, including the intro lyrics. The captioning is provided by Warner Bros. Vol. 4 does provide its own DVD captions for the intro song, and does not provide Closed Captions.</dd>
<dd>So far, there is insufficient evidence to rule one way or the other. For example:</dd>
<dd>-Vol. 1, the Closed Captions for every episode say "and I'm a Taurus".</dd>
<dd>-Vol. 2, the Closed Captions for Episodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12 say "and I'm a Taurus." But Episodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 say "and all my toys."</dd>
<dd>-Vol. 3, the Closed Captions for Episodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 say "and I'm a Taurus." But Episode 3 says "and all my toys." Episode 10 has no intro music. The reasoning behind Episode 3 being the only one with "toys" might be due to when the episode was written vs. when it was actually aired; i.e. it should be grouped with Vol. 2 episodes that say toys, but it was aired later, and thus put on the next available volume, even though it was written earlier.</dd>
<dd>-Vol. 4, the DVD Subtitles for all Episodes say "and I'm a Taurus".</dd>
<dd>Things get lost in translation. We all have professional audio CDs that contain lyric booklets. These professionally made, legally released lyrics are reprinted with permission. And a lot of the time, the lyrics in these booklets are not what the artist is saying. And yet, the lyrics are straight from the horse's mouth. That still doesn't make them right just because it's printed in official form (such as the "Old Guy" promo where he says Taurus, rather than what Schoolly D might have said.</dd>
<dd>Since this appears to be such an "important" issue, I will post what I have found concerning the discrepancy in lyrics per episode on the article page for ATHF. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilhelm_Screamer_17e0.html" title="User:Wilhelm Screamer">Wilhelm Screamer</a> 16:10, 16 February 2006 (PST)</dd>

<p>Some have made the suggestion that the ATHF represent the three-part consciousness of Sigmund Freud: Ego, Superego, and Id. This was in the article at some point, but was removed. I think rightly so. While it may be an interesting discussion, within the context of Freudian theory I just don't think it works. Web accounts even as to which element of consciousness each character represents. No way could it be justified enough to claim that it was somehow intended. If someone has knowledge of the creators' intent, which would be interesting but not definitive, or would like to lay out a theory, we should hear it. Otherwise it's rather distracting and pointless.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Frylock's Powers</span></h2>
<p>According to the article, "Frylock possesses several supernatural powers (whether these are inate, or derived from some external source, has never been explained)." But further down it references a New Year's party segment. I remember that at one point at the party he tells one of the other characters that the jewel on his back is the source of them. Does anyone else remember anything about that or have clips of it? Fio Vaya 05:05, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Edit- The source of his powers is his gem sort of. This is only conjecture but on "The Visible Frylok" poster Frylok has there are "ray tubes" on the top of his head which are thought to draw in either solar or some form of cosmic ray into the gem to convert the energy for use in his powers.</p>

<p>Was the episode where Ignignokt enlarges his middle finger so people from earth can see it from the episode where The Mooninites use this magic belt to do stuff do the characters such as give Frylock double vision and infect Carl? I think the end had Ignignokt doing this.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, his finger was lengthened because he was "doing it as hard as he [could]". Not really a super power in any way. --Gribby 22:00, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reasons why Cybernetic Ghost is not to be mentioned here.</span></h2>
<p>First off, the Collective episode with <i>Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday</i> is not to be included in an episode count when comparing the recurrence of characters. Nearly every "villian" who had been present in one episode previous to that episode was featured. Also, the turkitron episode should probably not count either. While a simmilar character, who may even be the same depending on how one interprets the Thanksgiving episode, he is not explicitly the same character, and is under a different identity and name. Someone mentioned 3 episodes in their edit summary. Unless I am missing something that brings it down to one. Even if I am, two.--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 20:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I remember, that character appeared in a) the original Cybernetic Ghost episode, b) "The Last One" (Monday Tuesday Wednesday ...), c) the latest 'movie preview' episode. He appears to be a recurring character, at least as much as MC Pee Pants/Sir Loin/Little Brittle who has appeared in only one more episode than Cybernetic Ghost. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/0/User_talk%7EBk0_24c3.html" title="User talk:Bk0">Talk</a>) 00:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Like I said, its pointless to even consider the "The Last One" in anyone's episode counts, as it contains virtually every minor character that had been seen up to that point. Also, while he may occur almost as frequently, he is not as influential or notable. MC Peepants has popped up in various references in online communities including adult swim itself. That being said, while it would seem to me to be fine the way it is, if anything, it would be better to migrate MCP to the minor characters article then to bring Cybernetic Ghost up. --<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 20:48, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still don't see any objective evidence to support your claim that this character isn't as "influential or notable". Vague 'online communities' are irrelevant and I haven't seen any lists of references by Adult Swim.

<dd>If we remove the Cybernetic Ghost from the character listings, we may as well hastily remove MCP, the Plutonians, and the Mooninites since they do not appear in every episode of ATHF. He still maintains some significance as the others do.--71.29.27.23 16:15, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say 'serious editing'. The section amounts to almost complete episode summaries, or, one could say, 'Everything they've ever said and done', most of which isn't noteworthy to a section discussing 'Other characters in a show'. I reduced the section on 'Steve' by about 2/3rds simply by removing lengthy, repetitive discussion of "what he's done", leaving "who he is". <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 13:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Attributes all characters share or running joke?</span></h2>
<p>I was BOLD and added the following paragrap under the title of characters</p>
<p>"Characters</p>
<p>One of the reoccuring jokes in ATHF is that the non human characters have no idea what sort of species the other belong to, shown in several episodes. For example, In the Video episode, frylock has difficulty describing what Master shake is, in the J word episode, car says "so there's going to be one more of you animals around eh?" and the moonanites refer to the plutonians as "farm animals""</p>

<p>I think where it was was fine, except that it's not really a recurring joke. The Mooninites and Carl are simply insulting those they don't like, and Frylock was simply stumped. Also, please edit closely and watch for typos with new entries. aww 20:55, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess not, but have they ever known what sort of species each other actually were? Despite being close friends, they do not understand what each other are, and I think it adds to the humour of the show. some examples would be in the Gee whizz episode, the one where frylock is trying to get meatwad into a "better" church, as well as the ones I mentioned above. I'd rather not start a rever war, and keep this place for peaceful discussion (edit&#160;: There also needs to be a running jokes/ trivia section added,like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons#Recurring_jokes" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons#Recurring_jokes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons#Recurring_jokes</a> ) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackpotDen_9dba.html" title="User:JackpotDen">Jackpot Den</a> 14:07, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">DVD Box Set Four hidden feature</span></h2>
<p>This is hardly worth mentioning, but since I've yet to see anyone reference this anywhere, there's an Easter egg on Vol. 4, on the first DVD. Going into the Language menu, then select continue. It brings up a screen with website information, and a brief legal statement (all characters copyright and such). On a computer, click the "e" on the second occurrence of "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" (written in green) and it brings up a 70 second clip of a repeating sound bite and motion, mostly blacked out, that appears to be Carl having sex with a hooker on his couch. Using a standard DVD player remote the option can be reached by pushing the left arrow twice, highlighting the "e." I'm leaving it up to someone else as to whether or not this is worth including in the Wiki article.Worloq 09:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
