<dd>To any admin considering this - this is nonsense and just gameplaying - for someone who's edit style was different why was the first move to add himself to the spongebob wikiproject - a project that had about 7 sockpuppets of forrest on it.

<dd>Let me ask three questions. 1 - How/What would you contribute to Wikipedia if you were unblocked? 2 - You reported several of ForestH2's alternative accounts: how did you know about them? And 3 - Have you ever edited Wikipedia under another username? I'll be watching for your reply. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:47, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me elaborate. 1 - I would contribute to the politican articles (Senate, House of Represntives, Presidents etc.) though I would not keep my contributions to that. I would keep them varied as in <a href="../../../g/r/f/WP%7EGRFA_5f5a.html" title="WP:GRFA">WP:GRFA</a> so I can some day become an admin. I don't know what else I'd do besides politican articles, perhaps airlines, September 11, 2001 articles, etc. I am not sure what you mean about how I would contribute to Wikipedia....By editing of course. We may have the same grammer style as we are both native speakers of Swedish. 2 - My brother told me about Wikipedia and all of his socks. I read over the rules after I registered for an account, and saw socks were not allowed. O I did not Report alternative accounts. I just went and reported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77077396" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77077396" rel="nofollow">reported</a> Forestbot which was his <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">bot</a>. Of course I am his brother so he did tell me some of his accounts. And 3 - No, After Forest told me about Wikipedia it sounded interesting so I decided to create a username. One other thing, I wish to tell you some of the sockpuppets you have not blocked yet. His socks you have not blocked are:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanM_df87.html" title="User:VanM">VanM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, he knows <a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFoxearth_62c1.html" title="User:Foxearth">Foxearth's</a> password, so it might be worth dropping Foxearth a note, that his account could be hijacked. He had a list of them on microsoft. If you do unblock me, unblock my IP. I'll tell you if Forest ever comes back. I can be honest also and won't lie. One other thing, do you wish to know the names of the socks on other Wikimedia projects? He has tons. If someone sees this, it might be worth dropping Mangojuice a note, that I have replied. I'll be back on around 00:00 (UTC), October 4th. Since I am his brother, I won't work on the Signpost because I don't think Ral315 would be happy about that. I do share an interest with him with SpongeBob, but I am not as interested as him. Please reply ASAP.</p>

<dd>Okay, that all satisfies me. It should go without saying, but be careful that your brother can't use your account. The unfortunate thing is, if you edit from the same IP address, you will probably get autoblocked fairly often, so we may have some more autoblock issues to work out. Happy editing! I have your page on my watchlist now (and thought I did before) so if you have any trouble editing leave a note and I'll come see what I can do. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest you watch me editing; and if I'm editing related articles that Forest did or anything like that re-block me. You may also wish to block <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanM_df87.html" title="User:VanM">VanM</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFoxearth_62c1.html" title="User:Foxearth">Foxearth</a> until you have sorted out the password thing. Yes, I am autoblocked and we need to work that thing out. I have no idea how to change my IP.....Well, what I can do, is you can unblock my IP: and then I can edit. If I'm taking a break, or something like that I'll let you know, so you can block it so Forest doesn't return. That's one suggestion - I don't have any others at the momment. You can unblock 72.134.40.171 my IP.....If you have a good one great. I'm sure admins may re-block my IP if you block it because they will be supsicious..........<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquafish_f9d6.html" title="User:Aquafish"><font color="aqua">Aqua</font></a><a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquafish_f9d6.html" title="User:Aquafish"><font color="green">fish</font></a> <small><a href="../../../a/q/u/User_talk%7EAquafish_8aa9.html" title="User talk:Aquafish"><font color="purple">talk</font></a> 22:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I unblocked and reblocked the IP with the "block anonymous editing only" option. This way, only previously established accounts (that aren't, themselves, blocked) can be used. This should allow you to edit but not allow Forest to. If editing doesn't work right away give it 24 hours just in case. Don't worry about us monitoring you: I appreciate you helping us be careful, though. I don't want to block anyone else on the basis that their password <i>might</i> be exposed, but if you want you could watch and inform me if something suspicious starts happening. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 00:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
