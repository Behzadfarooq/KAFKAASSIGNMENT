<p>I don't think it's correct to definite Aqua as a Danish-Norwegian band. The band was founded in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> and all the members lives in Denmark. That makes it a Danish band! The only relation to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> is that one of the members is born in Norway, if that makes Aqua Danish-Norwegian, then <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> would be a Zanzibarian-English band, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a> would be an American-Danish band and <a href="../../../a/b/b/ABBA_de88.html" title="ABBA">ABBA</a> would be a Swedish-Norwegian band.

<p>There was question about a bonus track on Aquarium called, "Tarzan and Jane".

Tarzan and Jane is on the CD: FanTastic. Toy-box wasn't as popular and FanTastic was released after Aquarium in 1999.</p>

<p>There seems to be some wrong facts and some things that should be expanded on in the following text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although Aqua formed as a group called Joyspeed in 1994, their history together dates back to 1989, and the recording of the soundtrack for a little-known Danish film called Frække Frida. At the time René was working in Norway as a club DJ, and Søren and Claus were both starting out as producers. The three were brought in to make part of the soundtrack for the film, and after getting along well, decided that they wanted to work together again on a future project.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It says so that their history dates back to 1989 with the recording of the soundtrack for <a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A6/Fr%C3%A6kke_Frida_a550.html" title="Frække Frida">Frække Frida</a>. If you click on the link it says that this film was released at the end of the 1980s. First of all the film was called <b>Frække Frida og de frygtløse spioner</b> and released in 1994 (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124622/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124622/" rel="nofollow">IMDb</a>). According to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/lleonardpler/new031.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/lleonardpler/new031.htm" rel="nofollow">Aquarama</a> it wasn't "the three" who were brought in. Søren and Claus won a contest and won the right to produce the soundtrack. Rene was then used as a singer on the soundtrack. My question is what happened in 1989. My guess is that it was the year that Søren and Claus met and started writing songs. It could be relevant how they met and where. When did they meet Rene? Was is during the recording of the soundtrack, which must have been around 1993.</p>
<p>I'm going to correct the facts for the Frække Frida movie, but I can't change the other thing due to lack of sources. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaitch_8373.html" title="User:Maitch">Maitch</a> 17:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dustin4528354 has been vandliazing the article with sections like Rene Dif's favorite video game and saying he likes playing video games with 50 Cent. Then, in the article where it describes Toy-Box's cartoonish videos and serious videos like Aqua, after the cartoony video copying was written, and the serious copying was written, Dustin4528354 put: Then again they have ones like the "sailor song" and "superstar" they are sweet! &lt;3</p>
<p>It's good someone wants to help with Wikipedia, just don't put false facts, and help keep the article clean, and true.</p>
