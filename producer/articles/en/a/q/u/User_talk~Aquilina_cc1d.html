<p>Hi! Thanks for the comments, any feedback is always welcome. Iâ€™ve unchecked <i>minor edit</i> as the default setting, it was put on deliberately as I considered that most of my initial edits were very minor - but Iâ€™ve got into it a bit more since then and never really thought about it. Iâ€™ve found <a href="../../../m/i/n/Help%7EMinor_edit_e212.html" title="Help:Minor edit">Help:Minor edit</a> and, hey, certainly donâ€™t want to be accused of "poor etiquette".

<p>That IP is shared, and therefore different people use it. Indeed the most recent edits (as of now) do not appear to be vandalism). Past warnings might have been directed at different users, and therefore can't be used as a basis for a block. The best thing to do in future would be to quickly move through the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}} through to {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} templates and then report to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> for a fast response from an admin. You might find <a href="../../../c/u/v/WP%7ECUV_7c27.html" title="WP:CUV">cleaning up vandalism</a> useful. Hope that makes sense, feel free to ask my any further questions on <a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPetros471_6357.html" title="User talk:Petros471">my talk page</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:12, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aquilina, thanks for your hard work and clarifications on the Oldham, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crompton_House_22b6.html" title="Crompton House">Crompton House</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> pages. I notice it is not the first time you have aided with regards to this matter, and it is very much appreciated!</p>
<p>I try to keep Wikipedia as best as possible, and whilst I endeavoured to keep a calm and prudent approach, it is most frustrating when stubborn (and always unregistered!) editors have an agenda and alter people's hard work!... as I'm sure you are all too aware!</p>
<p>However, many many thanks for your level-headed contributions and much needed mediation in the edit war I had! Thank you also for pointing out some Wiki formatting etiquette that was not quite aware of, <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 13:36, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> page still remains under fire from vandals (or more likely - vandal using an additional IP address). Is there anything I, we or anyone else can do to stop this. I've requested help also on my talk page. Sorry to bother you with such a trivial but factual problem. Thanks again. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 00:57, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>With regard to your message, and continued support, thank very much in helping halt the unknown vandal! You may have noticed I've actually <b>blocked</b> many of his IP addresses, but no doubt he will return again soon with his stubborn Lancastrian ways! I also noted you had traced and thankfully reverted many of his edits also to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royton.html" title="Royton">Royton</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadderton.html" title="Chadderton">Chadderton</a>, and even <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> pages, so thanks also for that, I certianly appreciate that for one!</p>
<p>Also I requested protection for the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> page, but sadly it was not granted - they said we just had to keep reverting any vandalism he causes which I thought was a little unfair and will be very time consuming on our behalf if he persists.</p>
<p>I was indeed changing some of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> page so that there would be new links to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crompton_Hall_a899.html" title="Crompton Hall">Crompton Hall</a> - a little known alternate manor to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crompton_House_22b6.html" title="Crompton House">Crompton House</a> and a page I am currently writing. Thanks for letting me know about possibly accidently removing those links, I'll try pop them back in again shortly.</p>
<p>I can't stress enough how much I appreciate your help! Any need for further contact, or need mediation/collaboration, then please feel free to message me! Thanks <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 22:33, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a quick message to say I'm striving to get my beloved <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham_Riots_d844.html" title="Oldham Riots">Oldham Riots</a> articles up to the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">Wikipedia:Good articles</a> criteria, which it seems is harder than I thought!</dd>
<dd>I thought I'd let you know about this, and maybe you can take a quick look at some of the small, but positive changes.</dd>
<dd>Hope everythings going well, <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 10:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments on <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELancsalot_ec67.html" title="User talk:Lancsalot">User_talk:Lancsalot</a> - a dispute blew up out of nowhere!!! <i>Our Old Mutual Friend</i> was the source of this disagreement (this guy still watches the 3 individual pages that concern him (one of which is a big bust model (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Marsh_%28model%29_cfee.html" title="Michelle Marsh (model)">Michelle Marsh (model)</a>) EVERY day and night!!). The guy still persues a vendetta against me and was rallying support with slanderous propaganda!</p>
<p>On a more serious note, thanks for your input - I think it defused a nasty (but somewhat petty) situation for all involved. You have my full support should you require it at a later date. Thanks again, it is much appreciated,</p>

<p>Hi, thanks again for your help on the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> talk page - however your input in combination with mine, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteb16_cdfa.html" title="User:Peteb16">User:Peteb16s</a> and others is still leading to a fruitless confrontation. Is there <b>anything</b> we can do to stop this? - perhaps ask for an admin just to leave a comment on the talk page or something along those lines? It'd just stop the nonsense once and for all! - hope you have a possible solution in mind and everything else is going well. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 19:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aquilina, I see that we are now currently being accused of being known vandals and Oldham centralists. I am really dismayed by Wikipedia, I have forwarded our mutual friend's details to the 3RR report page, but an administrator considered my warning as enough to deter him!!!!</p>
<p>Is there anything further we can do (you seem somewhat more knowledgable about Wiki protocal) regarding this member. The guy in question is a real jerk saying he's been a member for years and is a doctor of science. I'm totally opposed to the guy. I am really inclined to leave this website for good if there is no other option!</p>

<p>You're welcome. I have to say I feel slightly uncomfortable at reverting something that <i>might</i> be a valid edit â€” as I know nothing about figures for Scandanavian (or indeed other) countries. However, based on the fact that anonymous changes in figures are always suspicious, and that this IP editor was refusing to provide sources, I thought it would be more dangerous to leave the edits in place. I have the same dilemma with <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salem_witch_trials.html" title="Salem witch trials">Salem witch trials</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institut_Le_Rosey_402c.html" title="Institut Le Rosey">Institut Le Rosey</a>. In one of those articles, anonymous editors keep adding names of people who were accused, and in the other, they keep adding names of former students; and I often find myself looking doubtfully at these edits, wondering are they hoaxes and should I revert.

<p>Hi, thanks for the message. Yes I'm very much still around! Just taking a small break, firstly because I've bought a new property, but also I thought I might be adding to the problem rather than cooling it regarding the Lancastrian vandal!... I'm hoping the guy in question has become bored of the site having not been given any attention!</p>
<p>I'm very much in favour of expanding the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham.html" title="Oldham">Oldham</a> district articles, (I'd be interested to know how many there actually are!) I was also thinking about proposing a History of Oldham article or maybe sub-section, as the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> page has some fantastic history in its content whereas the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham.html" title="Oldham">Oldham</a> page does not.</p>
<p>I also think the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> pages, if not all of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Oldham_5afa.html" title="Metropolitan Borough of Oldham">Metropolitan Borough of Oldham</a> affliiated pages need some photographs. I'll see what I can do - might wait until summer for visual impact!?</p>
<p>With regard to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glodwick.html" title="Glodwick">Glodwick</a>, I'm not too familiar with the area, but I suspect it is at risk from alot of vandalism for obvious reasons. I added some (impartial) content some time ago, I hope it still remains!</p>
<p>Thanks for the message, please let me know if there's anything else I need know about, I'll get back into editing asap! Thanks again, <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 15:12, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I think that I am beginning to come to the same conclusion about Stringops and 80.255 not being actual sockpuppets, although I await conclusion of the investigation. Those two accounts look like definite meatpuppets though, especially 80.255. <i>I disagree that this is not important</i>: 80.255 has totally distorted many Talk page discussions/votes, and acted as wing-man to Owain in his frequent edit warring.

<p>Hi Aquilina, how are you? Just writing to thank you (again!) for the speedy mediation with regards to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royton.html" title="Royton">Royton</a> page and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a>. I suspected the dispute was going to be like that of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> article (and even suspected the same member behind it!), but it appears this would not be the case and you halted the bias (he admits to being a BNP affliate on the Royton talk page)... so, thanks!</p>
<p>I'm just messaging to let you know that following that minor incident, I've decided to write an incredibly difficult, taboo and controvertial article named the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham_Riots_d844.html" title="Oldham Riots">Oldham Riots</a> (or The Oldham Riots not sure which is the correct format to use!). The <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> website thankfully still has considerable coverage of the event and I'm using a lot of references for my article from it (as well as other sources hopefully) so there can be as slim a chance as possible of a future dispute/edit war.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could take a look so far, either just for blessing purposes or perhaps even for a collaboration? It's currently avaliable in my <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbox.html" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jhamez84/Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jhamez84/Sandbox" rel="nofollow">| here</a> (I'm not sure if you can access this). I realise it's a touchy subject, and also you may be too busy so no problems if you are uninterested.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thanks again for your support, hope everything is well. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 17:24, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, once again (I hope I am not becoming a nuisance of any sort to you!?), just messaging you to firstly bring your attention the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_and_Crompton_f0a3.html" title="Shaw and Crompton">Shaw and Crompton</a> page. A seemingly new member has made some fantastic contributions to the article including a stunning panoramic photograph! The page is well worth a look and I've wrote the the contributor to personally thank him/her.</dd>
<dd>With regard to this article I was wondering if you think it is now OK to drop the disputed content tag from the article as well as the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crompton_House_22b6.html" title="Crompton House">Crompton House</a> page given that the edit war/vandalism has very much stopped?</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, I've added a little more to the <i>forthcoming</i> article of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham_Riots_d844.html" title="Oldham Riots">Oldham Riots</a>, again found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jhamez84/Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jhamez84/Sandbox" rel="nofollow">here</a> in my sandbox.

<p>I noticed you rolled back my changes to certain towns where I had labelled them as being in the Manchester Urban Area. You claimed that such an area did not exist. This area is actually defined by the Office for National Statistics. <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=12733" class="external free" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=12733" rel="nofollow">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=12733</a></p>
<p>Please ensure you research more thoroughly before editing in future.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still stand by my edits; most of the points I left on your talk page are still valid:
<ol>
<li>the places labelled as being in the "Manchester Urban Area" <i>were</i> chosen arbitrarily - it would be best to label all of them, or none of them. (The map given isn't particularly precise either; a set of written boundaries woud be best)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>this sort of labelling is best discussed at a larger forum first</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Further to this, is you carefully check the <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_ua_ew_part8.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_ua_ew_part8.pdf" rel="nofollow">specific source relating to Northern England</a>, this area is called the <i>Greater</i> Manchester Urban Area. As I'm sure you are aware, there is a world of difference between Manchester and Greater Manchester. More importantly, labelling an urban area in Greater Manchester as being in the Greater Manchester Urban Area is fairly redundant - so I feel even a comprehensive, accurately labelled, agreed and cited version of the reverted labels would still not be particularly useful. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aquilina_93cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aquilina"><font color="gray"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">A</span></font></a><strong class="selflink"><font color="teal"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">q</span></font></strong><a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina"><font color="gray"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">uilina</span></font></a> 18:58, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aquilina</p>
<p>Good to hear from you.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that you don't understand the true nature of the links I added.</p>
<ul>
<li>WikiVille is not and never will be a commerical site.</li>
<li>Neither is it my site.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.wikiville.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.wikiville.org.uk" rel="nofollow">WikiVille</a> is an embryonic and quite unique Wiki which endeavours to enable school aged people around the world the opportunity to share their view of where they live from their perspective. Therefore when young people write about their home towns it makes sense that in order to enable their work to develop it is linked to from a more 'neutral voice' persepective. It may also add interest to WikiPedia users to hear the non-'brochure' version of life in the location that they are researching.</p>
<p>I hope that this makes a little more sense, given the added context.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

<p><b>Postscript</b> I appreciate that the Wikipedia editorial team are up their ears in this plus the 'day-job' but any advice/support for the WikiVille project is welcomed in the spirit of collaboration.</p>

<dd>--Thanks for the feedback... the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham.html" title="Oldham">Oldham</a> article has been very warmly recieved... It's great to hear you're returning to the "editing community" on a fuller time basis too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to the article, I see you've added some great contributions to the history and stubbed sections.... I notice you've moved the picture to the right of the page.... However the infobox, contents and the picture together seem to have an awkward relationship; pushing each other away from one another and leaving wide open white space. This is certainly the case on my (IE 6) browser. Is there anything we can do to fix this?- Perhaps moving the photograph into another section? I suspect it's a formatting bug of some sort...</dd>

<p>Hi again, Just a quick message to say thanks for your support on the Trad counties talk page:- I think it's an excellent suggestion (even if I say so myself), to rename this article to become the <i>"Historic counties of England"</i>.</p>
<p>The discussion is a little dormant, so I've messaged <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">User:Owain</a> and a few others for some more input, given that the subject seems more charged, emotive and contested than that of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a>!</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm having a couple of minor problems with <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELancsalot_6485.html" title="User:Lancsalot">User:Lancsalot</a>. I'm not sure if you noticed the efforts I made this evening to the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton.html" title="Bolton">Bolton</a> article which were reverted, but I've also faced simillar and uncalled for targetting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Westhoughton&amp;diff=62258413&amp;oldid=62258047" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Westhoughton&amp;diff=62258413&amp;oldid=62258047" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>Should</i> this behaviour intensify, and should it be required, and as I know you have a very respected and authorititive stance on Wikipedia, could you advise him, inline with say <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a>?-My efforts seem to be having little effect.</p>
<p>Finally, an editor has made a slightly unusual enhancement to the main photograph in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham.html" title="Oldham">Oldham</a> article. I'm not keen in the slightest, and think it makes Oldham look like an alien city (!) but wondered what your thoughts on this were?</p>
<p>Hope you can get back to me, and hope all is well. Take care, and many thanks <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 22:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aquilina, I am not sure where else to say this, but I genuinely appreciate your edits and helpful comments re my contributions to the page on the Constitutional status of Cornwall. As someone new to the wiki world, I can see that it is a syntax minefield but will hopefully learn fast enough to prevent others doing the proper formatting for me.

<p>Hi Aquilina, Many thanks for you welcoming message. I'm afraid I've been desperately ill in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_life.html" title="Real life">real life</a>, but have been fortunate enough to overcome my affliction (albiet from loosing the entire season of summer 2006).</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for dealing with the other Lake District one. I'll tidy up some more of the "stridingedge" links that I've found today I hope. However it raises a point. From your edit comment there would almost be a green light for general walking photo links to be placed say in fell walking. When reviewing these areas (&amp; I find myself doing it more and more!) I usually think one link is quite nice, two - well - then you find pages with 4, 6 or whatever well meaning photo links! Leaving one will peeve the others, leaving them all peeves me! I would appreciate another editor's views.

<dd>Equally belatedly! (been tied up with some links "discussions"). My non displaying note might read "Please bear in mind that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a directory. It may be that one or two links will add something to a page however they must only be placed on the relevant page and will always be subject to review by wikipedians". I'd already started on it and may well toss it at the spam project before using but views more than welcome.

<p>Hello, This is the reason... Keeping Heated Issues in one area: editors use different accounts in talk pages to avoid conflicts about a particular area of interest turning into conflicts based upon user identity and personal attacks elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some users had started to dogmatically, zealously and systematically revert all of my edits relating to counties etc. without any debate. I think this was on the basis that they had previously disagreed with one particular point, decided I must be taking an alternative philosophical position to theirs and that I must be 'opposed'. A lot of the edits I made were in the hope that a consensus would emerge.</p>
<p>Also, in my defence, I have not used any of the accounts to duplicate votes or to back up opinions voiced in discussions.</p>
<p>If I am not blocked any future edits relating to counties, or coming close to the counties subject will be made under the Bailrigg account. <a href="../../../b/a/i/User%7EBailrigg_cc86.html" title="User:Bailrigg">Bailrigg</a> 18:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aquilina, does this satisfy you as an adequate explanation? The quoted section seems to bear little or no resemblance to Bailrigg's sockpuppet's activities, which consisted of making edits on <b>one single topic</b> under a variety of aliases. The text there is to deal with the case that an editor on one topic did not wish other people to know they knew about another topic as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, personally, I find accusations of "dogmatic reverts" really quite hard to stomach from someone who was making edits like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rutland&amp;diff=76321169&amp;oldid=76198390" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rutland&amp;diff=76321169&amp;oldid=76198390" rel="nofollow">this</a>, having clearly just been going through my contributions list and reverting anything I did without checking. When I revert, I always check. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 22:08, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bailrigg (an sockpuppets of)'s edits were all reverted on the basis of their individual content. i.e. I checked the diffs for every one I reverted. His range of sockpuppets have been used for no other purpose than to obscure bad-faith and disruptive editing. They should all be blocked for this reason. Mrsteviec 06:14, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm... I don't agree with your interpretation of the rules here, Bailrigg - <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> allows, as you say, role accounts for multiple <i>issues</i>, but your accounts are for a single <i>issue</i>/<i>edit type</i>, just for multiple <i>counties</i>. I appreciate that you have not stacked votes, and your promise that county-related edits will come from the single Bailrigg account is good. However, I think it would be in the rights of an admin to block your non-Bailrigg accounts (Wenslet et al.) as you don't have use for them any more. You will find it a lot easier to gain the community's faith in your editing if you have the other accounts blocked, and start proposing ideas for discsussion on talk pages before enacting them. Take a look at <a href="../../../u/k/w/WP%7EUKWNB_43b5.html" title="WP:UKWNB">WP:UKWNB</a>, and if you would like alterations to the naming conventions, try the talk pages of <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> too. This is a really well-discussed topic, so it's worthwhile to immerse yourself in the debate before making lots of edits; the articles will still be there tomorrow...

<p>Thank you for your notes regarding recent link updates to Dover. I am very new to editing on Wikipedia, although I have often used it for reference in the past. The review process is obviously invaluable in helping maintain a good quality reference base.</p>
<p>I must assure you no misrepresentation was intended with these links. I still believe them to be valid, relevant and valuable additions to the Dover entry. After your feedback, I have re-assessed these entries against similar material in Wikipedia and am left feeling that their exclusion was perhaps a little premature.</p>
<p>Please review my further research / comments below and hopefully you will agree to re-instate these listings.</p>
<ul>

<p>1) <b>Dover Business Directory</b> â€“ there are many examples of other town business directories in external links e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkestone" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkestone" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkestone</a> - refer to thebestof <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford%2C_Kent" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford%2C_Kent" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford%2C_Kent</a> - refer to ashfordlocal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittingbourne" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittingbourne" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittingbourne</a> - refer to thebestof Perhaps these should not be there also? On the other hand it does provide information about local business. It has been a number of years since Dover-web raised any charges against these business, so does not really qualify as a commercial listing. In fact, the listing have remained on the site to provide a service to the local community.</p>
<p>2) <b>Dover Forum</b> â€“ this is a longstanding active community discussing issues around Dover, such as the proposed Dover open prison. Very relevant to people who want to know about Dovers current day issues. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moseley_Neighbourhood_Forum" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moseley_Neighbourhood_Forum" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moseley_Neighbourhood_Forum</a> - Mosely Forum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astley%2C_Greater_Manchester" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astley%2C_Greater_Manchester" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astley%2C_Greater_Manchester</a> - Astley Forum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymchurch" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymchurch" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymchurch</a> - Dymchurch Forum</p>
<p>3) <b>Dover Local History</b> A very large number of good quality pages around the history of Dover includingâ€¦ Dover Timeline, Dover castle, White Cliffs, Underground Dover â€“ 100+ interesting pages on this subject alone, There are literally hundreds of examples of these kind of pages all through Wikipedia. Non-commercial and well researched material.</p>
<p><b>Please Note.</b> I have no personal or commercial interest in this site â€“ I just think it has some good quality local sources of information.</p>
