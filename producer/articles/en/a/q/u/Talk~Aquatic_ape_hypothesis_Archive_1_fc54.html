<p>Why is the word "theory" used for this page title? This idea is at best a well developed yet largely untested hypothesis and at worst a weak one. Unless there is a good objection otherwise I will move this page. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> Because a Hypothesis can be proven with a short experiment or series of controlled experiments. One can observe various aspects of geology and paleontology, but they are not testable in a way that makes hypothesis meaningful. If you'd like to call it a hypothesis, what test would you like to see? --Cambrian.</p>

<dd>You misunderstand NetEsq. I actually like the idea and think it has merit -- however it does have an ambiguous title as is. When something is scientific in nature and purports to be a theory one can automatically assume theory to mean scientific theory. Here in wikiland we have a specific definition of the term theory in the same way that we have a specific definition of the word <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a>. We tend to be consistent with our definition of that word and we should also be consistent in the use of the word <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<dd>NetEsq, I also happen to think that this is an interesting hypothesis and one which deserves attention. However, given, as mav says, we have certain particular definitions (which are not unalterable, it just helps to have some solid ground on which to stand) and <i>theory</i> is a key one, I do not believe this article deserves a theory tag just yet. It does not conform to the key precepts of <i>theory</i> and is at best at present <i>hypothesis</i>. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">user:sjc</a></dd>

<dd>Did I not read, somewhere authoritative in the wikipedia guidelines, that when there's a dispute in the name of an article like this, it's the more common and expected format which is to be used, not the more technical one? Since the aquatic ape premise is almost universally referred to as a theory, I would guess that this is the name it should therefore receive, even though it (like the plains ape theory of bipedalism) is, indeed, a hypothesis.</dd>

<p>I think there may be a misconception on the difference between a theory and a hypothesis, and there is certainly quibbling over the "correct" usage and the actual usage. In every day life, the use of the word theory is commonly abused, e.g. "conspiracy theories" are always hypotheses, yet we still call them theories. A theory is a statement or set of statements, proposing to explain a law of nature and using theories one may test many different hypotheses. Hypotheses are proposed explanations for observations, in this case Sir Hardy's hypothesis proposes to explain the observation that humans are the only primate with fat attached to their skin (is this true???)</p>
<p>Thus, the article is correctly termed Aquatic Ape Hypothesis, though in actuality may be discussed as the Aquatic Ape Theory. An educational 'fix' would be to create a redirect page from Aquatic Ape Theory to Aquatic Ape Hypothesis, allowing all to find what they are looking for. The redirect should be to Aquatic Ape Hypothesis, because in a non-technical, merely literal sense, Hardy has proposed a hypothesis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it would seem ludicrous to create a redirect page from "Conspiracy Theories" to "Conspiracy Hypotheses", so why should we in this case? If those who care most about the hypothesis prefer "Aquatic Ape Theory" in order to grant the idea more weight in their minds, it seems petty to enforce the alternative.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Science &amp; Fairness</span></h2>
<p>From the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If we're going to represent the sum total of "human knowledge"--of what we believe we know, essentially--then we must concede that we will be describing views repugnant to us without asserting that they are false. . . . The task before us is not to describe disputes fairly, <b>on some bogus view of fairness</b> that would have us describe pseudoscience as if were on a par with science; rather, the task is to represent the majority (scientific) view as the majority view and the minority (sometimes pseudoscientific) view as the minority view, and, moreover, to explain how scientists have received pseudoscientific theories. . . .</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a minority of Wikipedians who feel so strongly about this problem, however, that they believe Wikipedia should adopt a "scientific point of view" rather than a "neutral point of view." What these people have failed to establish, however, is that there is really a need for such a policy, <b>given that</b> the scientists' view of pseudoscience can be clearly, fully, and fairly explained to those who might be misled by pseudoscience.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The NPOV policy statement later goes on to address the specific problem of discussing the topic of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_evolution.html" title="Theory of evolution">theory of evolution</a> from a scientific point of view:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There are virtually no topics that could not proceed without making some assumptions that someone would find controversial. This is true not only in evolutionary biology, but also philosophy, history, physics, etc.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In sum, the editorial decision to change the title of a Wikipedia article from one which uses the word <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a> to one which uses the word <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothesis.html" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> in an attempt to reflect the scientific point of view is a clear violation of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. The proper way to address such concerns is in the body of the article itself, as I pointed out earlier. If you disagree with the NPOV policy, and wish to <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">ignore it</a>, then go right ahead, but do not attempt to speak on behalf of Wikipedians such as myself who believe in the NPOV's correctness.--<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>NPOV vs POV isn't really the point (as I've already said my POV is that I like the idea). The point is that the common use of the word "theory" is nothing more than a dictionary defintion but in the context of an encyclopedia the word "theory" means "scientific theory" so any use of that word must consider this context (otherwise ambiguity is the result). See "Be precise when necessary" of of our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<dd>As I stated earlier, what I see here is a conflict between <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and what often passes for the Scientific Point of View (SPOV). That is why I cited the relevant sections of the NPOV in re the problems one encounters when attempting to conform Wikipedia to the SPOV. And, once again, I disagree with your unfounded and unsupported assertions about the nature of theories and hypotheses in re scientific inquiry. To wit: It is often argued by <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientists</a>, that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_evolution.html" title="Theory of evolution">theory of evolution</a> is not falsifiable, and (therefore) is not scientific. This view can be attributed to the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_philosophy.html" title="Scientific philosophy">philosophy of science</a> of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>, which is not at all universally accepted. Rather, according to the scientific philosophy of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Kuhn_2da8.html" title="Thomas Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a>, you can't even compare when one theory is better than another scientifically. Underlying all of this is the problem of conceptual bias, an intractable problem one encounters when dealing with scientists, not unlike the problem which <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropologists.html" title="Anthropologists">anthropologists</a> encounter with <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentrism.html" title="Ethnocentrism">ethnocentrism</a> among their <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informant.html" title="Informant">informants</a>.</dd>

<dd>When <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> first posited the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_evolution.html" title="Theory of evolution">theory of evolution</a>, he attempted to present it as a Newtonian science like <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. This backfired when his mentor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Whewell_dab9.html" title="William Whewell">William Whewell</a> dismissed his theory as unscientific. Whewell's conceptual bias is not unlike the conceptual bias that you have demonstrated toward the semantic conception of theories, i.e. what you might refer to as the "Scientific Point of View." However, the nature of science, theories, and hypotheses is still the subject of considerable debate, as set forth above.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tears &amp; Sweat 2</span></h2>
<p>I had never heard of this theory until today's debate, and I am very curious what it has to say on one point. Our body fluids are much less saline than sea-water, but much more saline than fresh water. Living in either hypoosmotic or hyperosmotic conditions is a severe environmental stress. The aquatic adaptations of various mammals to the two environments are different and in some cases totally opposite. In which environment are humans purported to have evolved according to the Aquatic Ape Theory? --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Karl Juhnke</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The idea as I understand it (and this may be the weaker view) is that early humans spent a large amount of their time in and around water -- which included inland seas, lakes, rivers and also coastal environments. This does make sense from a caloric intake stance -- human babies need a lot of calories in a very consistent supply in order for their brains to develop properly. The savannas have severe seasonal differences in the amount, quality and regularity in food supplies - and yet we are fertile (and interested) in the opposite sex year-round (well most of us are). In aquatic evrions, however, the food supply is far more apt to be constant and plentiful. Of course we may have simply used tools such as spears and crude boats instead of actually spending so much time in the water but since the end of the last glacial maximum ~13,000 years ago all previous coastlines and nearly all of these early human settlements are now under a 100 or so meters of water -- thus it is <i>very</i> difficult to test this interesting hypothesis in order to elevate it into a theory. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Opps! I forgot to answer your physiology question. This simple answer is this; if this idea does hold water (needless pun, I know) then the time in which these adaptations took place would probably not have been long enough to change our base physiology too much. Therefore the salinity of our body fluids would be pretty much the same as other primates (which it is). And there is also the issue that under many forms of this hypothesis humans lived in both aquatic and marine environments (as stated above). The idea of tears and excess sweating is used by some to suggest that these human body functions are a way to get rid of excess salt (however I think this argument is a bit weak). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, then the tears and sweat theory would mean we lived in saltwater. Freshwater vertebrates don't have trouble with excess salt because they can always drink; on the contrary, they have a need to retain dissolved ions while eliminating the water. Only marine vertebrates benefit from effecient salt excretion. However, I agree with you that the argument is weak, because our salt-excretion capabilities do not enable us to have a net gain of water from drinking ocean water. It costs us more water to eliminate the salt than we get from drinking saltwater, no mattter whether we cry, sweat, or urinate. The adaptive salty tears of, say, marine turtles and birds are very concentrated, i.e. they eliminate lots of salt for a little water. If we were a marine species we ought to be able to do that too. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Karl Juhnke</a></dd>

<dd>This is a good objection to the form of AAH (there are several) that argues for a singular, coastal 'phase'.

<dd>That's one of the problems with calling this a theory - I've rarely heard of a time period in which this took place. And when I have it has been from people who know little about this (like me) guessing. However I've never read any books on the subject as you have (it's just something one of my biology professors mentioned as an unsubstantiated and highly flawed yet interesting idea during a lecture on human evolution). Most vague ideas about the time period that this may have occurred are within the last 3 million years. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<dd><i>A long, long time to wait for an answer to the query about dates (but then I've only just discovered Wikipedia - and what's 22 months compared with 3 million years?&#160;:-) ) I have understood the AAT/AAH scenario to be the event that led to the separation of hominid evolution from that of chimpanzees (humans' closest ape relative). This figures if you consider the suggestion that the semi-aquatic lifestyle was what led to full-time bipedalism; the earliest bipedal human ancestors can be identified by their remains - so this puts the putative aquatic period as between 5 and 8 million years ago. --<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETiffer_e04a.html" title="User:Tiffer">Tiffer</a> 21:14, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>The biggest problem with the AAH is that it's never really been unambiguously defined. The definition here on Wikipedia is probably accurate in that it reflects most people's idea of what it is, but it's interesting that there is no citation to back it up. Hardy (1960) described his ideas, sure, but it was very tentative - a request for comments, really. It was written in 1960 when there was a huge gap in the fossil record. A gap that has long since closed. Morgan's books followed in Hardy's footsteps and she deliberately avoided being too definitive about what it actually was. Therefore people have been left to interpret it in whatever way they want. People that have understood it to mean some kind of 'primate seal' or 'merman' phase, understandably, have sneered at the thought. People who have understood it to be proposing that human ancestors merely swam a lot more in the past can't see what all the fuss is about.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is why the timescale question is difficult to resolve. Hardy proposed a singular, distinct 'full-on' littoral phase between 10 and 2 Mya. It was a reasonable guess, considering the fossil evidence available to him at the time, but it's clearly wrong. Morgan followed that basic idea but when La Lumiere suggested Danakil as a possible locoation she got a little more specific and suggested that the flooding and dessication of that inland sea corresponded to the dates. (Apparently the flooding occurred around 4ma and the dessication happenned very recently ca 80ka.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>People should understand, however, that these ideas on timescale do not make or break the AAH. It could be that human ancestors lived in fresh water wetlands (gallery forest floodplains, swamps, marshes, laes etc). This would completely destroy the argument that the fossil evidence contradicts the AAH. (This notion is based purely on the idea that it backs a marine coastal phase. Actually the fresh-water version is strongly supported by the fossil evidence as thousands of individual hominins have been found in fresh water depositional substrates but zero chimp or gorilla fosills have.)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Teleological</span></h2>
<p>It struck me, in reading <i>The Descent of Woman</i>, that there's a very teleological view of natural selection; Elaine Morgan frequently makes statements along the lines of "humankind needed X, and evolution provided it." I wanted to add a mention of this to the article as an argument against the AAH, but I'm not sure if this teleological viewpoint is that book's, Morgan's, or the hypothesis's. If it's only Morgan who thinks that way, never mind -- especially if she herself was ultimately disabused of the notion. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">Calieber</a> 20:31, Oct 28, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had to look up 'teleological' in the dictionary after reading the above. It's not clear to me why this should be an objection; if I understand natural selection correctly, it's that individuals who possess features better suited to the environment come to dominate within a population; and these favourable features tend to spread throughout the population as a result. IOW, the environment creates evolutionary pressures, and evolution 'responds' by promoting characteristics that provide for a need. What other way is there of viewing natural selection? --<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETiffer_e04a.html" title="User:Tiffer">Tiffer</a> 22:33, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Objections included on page</span></h2>
<p>I've just become aware of Wikipedia and as AAT/AAH is an interest of mine I had to find out what has been said about it. While I think there is a fair summary here, at least of some the main themes of AAT, it seems rather odd to me that it should be interspersed with arguments for non-aquatic evolution.</p>
<p>Firstly, is this really necessary to satisfy NPOV? I don't see atheist objections or Muslim teaching being floated on the pages for Christianity. Surely it should be sufficient that the AAH themes are presented dispassionately, making it clear that they are a minority opinion (the 2nd paragraph does this), and allowing the reader to make a judgement for himself or herself.</p>
<p>Secondly, in my opinion the non-aquatic arguments themselves run counter to the principle of NPOV. The language is confrontational and subjective ("Sceptics counter ...", "... highly flawed ..."); and contentious assertions are stated as fact in more than one place ("... particularly effective at remaining active during the heat of the day", "... kangaroos ... use their upright state ..." - kangaroos are not upright at all, but balanced body and tail over the hind legs in a way quite unlike the human situation). The article reads like 2 different people having an argument.</p>
<p>Can I suggest (if it is felt necessary to include them) that the land-based evolution arguments be moved to a paragraph headed "Objections to AAH" or similar, that the confrontational language be removed, and that the points of contention be re-worded to indicate that they are an alternative opinion rather than fact?</p>

<li>&lt;Grin&gt; - actually I've spent a lot of time on an online debate on AAT/AAH, and become sensitised to what sort of arguments cut any ice. As for "theory" v. "hypothesis" I note that someone (not me) has now moved the name back to "theory". For myself, I'm quite comfortable with "hypothesis" which I don't consider pejorative, and seems to be more accurate scientifically. --<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETiffer_e04a.html" title="User:Tiffer">Tiffer</a> 19:45, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you are still watching: There is a difference between <i>science</i> and <i>religion</i>. (Withing rather wide limits) you may believe into anything, but there narrow limits of what can be considered a scientific theory. So, if the <i>Aquatic Ape theory/hypothesis</i> should be handled as a religion, we can concentrate on the belief and the believers, but if it should be handled as scientific theory, some context about its current standings and reputation in science is needed.</p>

<p>I agree, the current format is a bit uncomfortable. On the other hand, I'm surprised at how much objectivity the article has managed to settle upon, considering the religious fanaticism displayed (outside Wikipedia) on <i>both</i> sides. Some of the establishment dismissals of AAH arguments are rube goldberg, reverse-engineered refute-at-all-costs responses, but some AAH advocates cling adamantly to even the weakest, most unlikely claims. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 20:34, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, the acrimony associated with the debate is really quite startling, sometimes. The question why some find the idea so threatening is a mystery, but when someone is ideologically committed to "defeating" a heresy, it can be an effective strategy to turn any discussion into something unpleasant, so as to discourage the idea from being considered. --<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETiffer_e04a.html" title="User:Tiffer">Tiffer</a> 19:45, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for "weak and unlikely claims", I have to confess to committing that tactical error in my early debating with sceptics. But look at it this way: were AAT to be generally accepted, then a number of mysterious physical features unique to humans could be made to make sense, when they don't make sense if you cling to a terrestrial story of evolution. It is these aquatic explanations which seem "weak and unlikely" to the sceptic, because you have to be convinced by AAT generally before you can give them credence. Think about it. --<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETiffer_e04a.html" title="User:Tiffer">Tiffer</a> 19:45, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I started to do some editing on this page; I've only before made changes to links. I'm afraid much of what seems to be objectivity in this entry is simply no one making informed changes on a number of errors. For instance, a quick look reveals that the info about the diving relex is wrong, the "10 times as much fat" bit is wrong (a common error which could be an honest misreading of reserch although it's been corrected online so often I'm not sure it's unwitting); the false "bipedalism is inefficient" idea; false info about cutaneous muscle; false info about DHA and LNA (the fatty acids that are involved in the discussion about "Omega-3" oils); false, and long discredited, info about tears and sweat; false info about mating positions; incomplete info about webbing between fingers; false info about hairless mammals; false info about the larynx. It really seems a bit much to correct it all, and I'm afraid, given my long experience with this subject, any changes toward a more accurate page may well be shortlived. (Just as I note that Tiffer has several times added an editorial comment to my outside link -- something I, for instancxe, did not do when I added back several pro-AAT links which had been removed in late Jan (apparently due to someone's sloppy edit).</p>
<p>Besides the number of things that need correcting, I have a problem with how to do these changes. The problem is that these statements and false info are often made and repeated by proponents of the AAT/H and I think this should be pointed out, yet -- again from my long experience with this subject -- this would probably be taken as being harsh or improper. But it seems to me that pointing out that proponents often make false claims is valid. But doing so tends to make for convoluted sentences, or the need to completely rewrite entire paragraphs and sections. I'll have to think about how best to do this. - Jim Moore 17 April 2005</p>
<p>Jim - please excuse my modifying your external link again. You are right that some external links got deleted apparently by mistake by another contributor.

<p>It's rather friendly towards theory, presenting in "Grundprobleme von Hominisations-Hypothesen" general problems of theories of hominisation and just barely transports that it is a minority view.

<p>Just a note: In the "breathing" paragraph it is said the diving reflex is unique to humans and marine mammals. The Wikipedia "Mammalian Diving Reflex" page notes that the reflex is present in all mammals, not only marine mammals and humans. There should be no contradictions within Wikipedia; Who knows the truth regarding this and could fix the contradiction? --Guest writer, 23:00 (GMT+2), 25.3.2005 .</p>
<p>The other Wiki page has the correct information. The diving reflex is present in all animals which have been tested -- it's apparently an ancestral holdover in all vertebrates, for instance. And it has been known to be so for more than 50 years, well before any published accounts of the AAT. - Jim Moore 16 April 2005</p>

<p>Isn't it worth finding an alternative phrase to use instead of naked or hairless, seeing as humans have just as much hair as other primates, but it is much shorter and thinner. -samaraphile 27 March 2005</p>
<p>I really don't see any need for other words, here. In the strictest sense, humans are not <i>hairless</i> (although I don't agree that we have "just as much" body hair, or anything like it); but we are <i>naked</i>, in the sense that our skin is exposed over almost all the body (apart from a few unusual individuals). I have seen this point made ad nauseam in the AAT/AAH 'debate', AFAICS in order to take up time and avoid discussion of one of the main unexplained differences between apes and humans. The main protagonist even posted an image file of his own wispy chest in order to "prove" the point! Needless to say, he regarded this as an "argument" against AAT.</p>

<p>The reason that it's good to have an accurate description of the differences between body hair in apes and humans is that using inaccurate descriptions, such as "hairless", are guaranteed to lead to inaccurate conclusions about how and why this change occurred.

I notice that such editorialising does not go on with pro-AAT sites in this article. - Jim Moore 16 April 2005</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Omitted evidence?</span></h2>
<p>I can't remember where I heard/read it (which is a pity, because that means I can't add it to the page), but <i>somewhere</i> I heard/read that additional evidence in favor of the AAH is the relatively high water content of human urine and feces. Other savannah animals apparently have much more concentrated urine and much drier feces than humans do, because they need to retain water. If humans were once aquatic, that would explain why we could survive excreting so much water in our waste. Has anyone else heard this? Can anyone provide a source so it can be added? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub>comhrá</sub></a> 23:12, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
