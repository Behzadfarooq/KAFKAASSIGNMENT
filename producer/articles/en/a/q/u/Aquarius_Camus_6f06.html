<div class="floatleft"><span><a href="../../../a/q/u/Image%7EAquarius_camus1.png_670a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/0/02/Aquarius_camus1.png" alt="" width="314" height="235" longdesc="../../../a/q/u/Image%7EAquarius_camus1.png_670a.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>Although he was one of the Gold Saints of Sanctuary, Camus spent most of his time living in the tundra of Eastern Siberia. During his years there, he trained a child named <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraken_Isaac_4e83.html" title="Kraken Isaac">Isaac</a> as his student. Some time later, he took another student, <a href="../../../c/y/g/Cygnus_Hyoga_33f9.html" title="Cygnus Hyoga">Hyoga</a>.</p>
<p>When Hyoga first arrived in Siberia, he asked him why he wanted to become a Saint. Hyoga replied that once he becomes more powerful, he could salvage his mother, who was buried deep under the frozen seas of Siberia, within a sunken ship. Camus told him that he would eventually doom himself if he was fighting for such a reason. He pointed out to the icebergs far away, and told Hyoga that he must be as tough and emotionless as the eternal frozen icebergs of Siberia, only then will he become a strong fighter. Through his training, Hyoga had always respected Camus as a fatherly figure.</p>
<p>When Camus was away on business at Sanctuary, Hyoga managed to break the ice over his mother's ship, and dived down to find her. His training partner, Issac, knowing that there are extremely strong currents under the frozen seas of Siberia, was shocked at this, and went down to save him. He managed to save Hyoga, but lost an eye in the process, and was dragged to the depths of the ocean, where he later became one of Poseidon's Marina Shogun, <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraken_Isaac_4e83.html" title="Kraken Isaac">Kraken Isaac</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, Hyoga completed his training with Camus, and earned the right to become the Cygnus Saint. However, his Cloth was not given to him until one day, when an order was sent to him from Sanctuary, ordering him to go to Japan and assassinate Saori Kiddo and the other Bronze Saints, but he eventually became their friend after witnessing <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Seiya_2a2c.html" title="Pegasus Seiya">Pegasus Seiya</a>'s efforts to save <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Shiryu_b1f1.html" title="Dragon Shiryu">Dragon Shiryu</a> from a mortal wound.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarius_Camus_6f06.html" title="Edit section: Battling his student in Sanctuary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battling his student in Sanctuary</span></h2>
<p>After the <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_Saga_b686.html" title="Gemini Saga">Pope</a> had summoned all Gold Saints to return to Sanctuary, Camus returned to Greece as the Aquarius Gold Saint. However, before he left, he sank the sunken ship with Hyoga's mother to the deepest trench of the Siberian seas, and left a message to Hyoga, telling him to meet him in Sanctuary. Hyoga was shocked upon return.</p>
<p>When Hyoga fought the Gemini Saint (just a shadow manipulated by the Pope) in the Gemini Temple, he was struck by his Another Dimension attack, and when he awoke he was warped to the Libra Temple. He saw his master there, and demanded to know why he sank his mother's ship to the deeps. Camus replied that Hyoga's attachment to his mother is his weakness, and he sank the the ship so he could not go down to see his mother anymore. His emotions and his feelings of love for his mother clouded his cosmos to achieve the awakening of the Seventh Sense - a crucial requirement to engage the Gold Saints in a fair battle. However, Hyoga's heart was filled with hatred and love towards the loss of his mother - the one being who inspired him to be a Saint.</p>
<p>Enraged, the two fought, but Hyoga was no match for his master's overwhelming cosmos and mastery of ice. Saddened by the loss of his mother, overwhelmed by his feelings - the Cygnus Saint sinks down to his knees, weeping over his current condition. Sensing that Hyoga is in no condition to battle against the Gold Saint - Aquarius Camus decides to finish off his pupil using the "Aurora Execution", his most powerful attack. Hyoga is beaten, but before leaving - Camus decides to freeze his body using the Ice Coffin technique, a coffin which was said that no Gold Saint could break or destroy. Weeping over the tragic result of this battle - Camus prays for forgiveness for having done this, but it was for the best. The Cygnus Saint would have been no match for the other equally powerful Gold Saints.</p>
<p>When Hyoga was freed from the Freezing Coffin by Shiryu wielding the weapons of the Libra Cloth, he faced his next opponent in Sanctuary: <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_Milo_a855.html" title="Scorpio Milo">Scorpio Milo</a>. Hyoga was on the losing side of the battle, completely overpowered by his Scarlet Needle attack. Milo told him that Camus froze him into the coffin because he did not want Hyoga to die, and that he would awaken in many 100 years. Milo then tells Hyoga to leave, and he would not kill him - in respect he had for the Aquarius Saint, for it was his wishes in the end - that Hyoga be spared. Hyoga, thinking back on his training with Camus, told Milo that he would fight strong like his master taught him. He reflected back on the sacrifices that his friends made for him and Athena, and he could not give up. Milo then told Camus, who was witnessing this battle from the Aquarius temple, that he would not show any quarter to Hyoga, as acknowledgement to him being a true warrior and proof of being a worthy Saint. After Hyoga managed to defeat Milo, he healed him from the wounds Hyoga took from his Scarlet Needles and let him pass the Scorpio Temple.</p>
<p>Hyoga finally arrived at the Aquarius Temple to face his master again in battle. Camus told him that he was wrong to have tried to freeze him, and would not show any mercy to him this time. Hyoga was still easily beaten by Camus, up to the point where Camus used an attack so powerful that it froze his Bronze Cloth, completely shattering it. However, Hyoga managed to awaken his 7th sense, and hit Camus back with an attack, that froze the left side of his shoulder armour. He instantly noticed that Hyoga had frozen part of his Gold Cloth. Camus comments that Hyoga's powers of ice has the potential to reach absolute zero, while he himself could not reach. But he would not be defeated by any techniques used by Hyoga, because he was the one who taught him all he knew. Much to his surprise, Hyoga mimicked his Aurora Execution technique, and was ready to use it on him. Camus, shocked to see this, also readies his ultimate technique which makes the best use of his freezing power. He mocks the bronze saint that he will let him use this technique as a last recourse before he dies. Both, Camus and Hyoga release the Aurora Execution - instantly freezing the house of Aquarius, and surroundings. So powerful was the impact of this technique - that it starts that snow starts falling around Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Standing frozen - both master and pupil, Camus commented that he was pleased that Hyoga was able to reach such a level of power, he was glad that he awoke his Seventh sense, because he battled believing in himself, Athena, and his friends. Camus wished that he could let Hyoga continue his path to truth and justice, but lamented that he didn't have the power to do so. Having his whole body frozen, the Aquarius Saint fell to the floor, dying a content death. Hyoga cried upon his master's death, realising that in the end, his master guided him to reach the Absolute Zero and eventually to his learning in awakening his Seventh sense at the cost of his life. Camus was a true teacher who thought him everything he knew, at the price of his own life. Before he falls down, mortally wounded - He thanks Camus for all that he has done.</p>
<p>Later on, in the Holy War against <a href="../../../p/o/s/Poseidon.html" title="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> - Camus' spirit remained in the Aquarius Gold Cloth, which came to protect Hyoga in the confrontation against Poseidon, similar to how the Sagittarius Cloth was guided by Aiolos to help Seiya. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Mu_85a3.html" title="Aries Mu">Aries Mu</a> commented on how Camus, like Aiolos - has always watched over his pupil and the bronze saints - and thanked him for representing the Gold Saints in the battle against the Sea God.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarius_Camus_6f06.html" title="Edit section: Hades arc">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hades arc</span></h2>
<p>Camus was resurrected from the dead by Hades, and, lead by Shion (The former Grand Pope of Sanctuary - who was killed by Saga), attacked Sanctuary under the name of Hades together with <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_Saga_b686.html" title="Gemini Saga">Gemini Saga</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capricorn_Shura_f445.html" title="Capricorn Shura">Capricorn Shura</a>. The trio fought through Aries Mu and defeated him, and managed to make it as far as the Cancer Temple before being attacked by <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Shaka_e1f0.html" title="Virgo Shaka">Virgo Shaka</a>'s illusion. In the end, Shaka managed to warp them away.</p>
<p>Despite being ordered to send former Gold Saints to attack Sanctuary, one of the leaders of the Spectres, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (One of the 3 judges of Death in Hades' realm), was heavily suspicious of their nature, and dispatched Spectres after them, to supervise them in case they fail or betray them. Should this happen, they are to eliminate both Shion's group and all the Gold Saints in Sanctuary. Rhadamanthys's suspicions were proven correct, and the former Gold Saints killed several of the Spectres which followed them (Kube, Ox and Mils), disguising themselves as them, and using their Spectres's armour as a disguise. Upon reaching the Virgo Temple, the trio attack Shaka and injure him. Shaka then realizes that they are the former Gold Saints in disguise. Shaka kills all the remaining Spectres, and welcomes them to the inner part of the Virgo Temple. Shaka, deciding that this will be his place of death - attacks Saga's trio with his Tembu Horin attack, stripping them of their 5 senses. During which, he reminds Saga's trio of the forbidden technique: Athena's Exclamation. The trio hesitates, at such shocking revelation - but they are losing their senses fast and are becoming close to death. Although doubtful whether to go to such extremes, Saga, Shura and Camus eventually used this technique to kill Shaka (though he was already aware of the 8th sense: Arayashiki to enter the world of death, while having his will to live intact). They were shocked and saddened that they actually ended up killing Shaka with this technique because despite the front they put up, they were still on Athena's side.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/i/Aries_Mu_85a3.html" title="Aries Mu">Aries Mu</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Aiolia_785c.html" title="Leo Aiolia">Leo Aiolia</a>, and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpio_Milo_a855.html" title="Scorpio Milo">Scorpio Milo</a>, arriving at Virgo temple, were shocked at this. Despite the fact that Saga's trio were still stripped of their 5 senses and "almost no different that the dead," they attacked them. However, the trio used another Athena's Exclamation attack on them. To counter this, Mu, Aioria and Milo charged up their own Athena's Exclamation attack and used it against them. The collision of two Athena Exclamations was eventually redirected by Dragon Shiryu (in the anime, by a combined effort all 4 Bronze Saints). Athena, hearing this and realising their true plan, summoned both parties to here, where she eventually killed herself with Saga's golden dagger (and entering the world of the dead with Arayashiki).</p>
<p>Returning to Hades' castle with Athena's blood, Saga's trio claim that they have successfully assassinated Athena. However, they quickly attacked Pandora and tried to hold her as hostage, demanding her to take them to see Hades, whom they plan to kill. Camus uses his power to freeze one of Pandora's spectres who intended to interfere. However, Pandora reminds them that their resurrected bodies were a gift from Hades, and would only last for 12 hours, and raising a curtain, revealing that it was already beginning to be daytime. The trio fell onto the floor, powerless. Before disintegrating to dust once more, the Bronze Saints enter Hades' castle, and Hyoga was able to see his master once more before his death.</p>
<p>Camus reminded Hyoga, that he was still a true Saint to Athena - and proved to Hyoga, that even despite the gift of temporary life, would not make him change side to fight along side Hades. In this sad moment, Camus - together with Saga, and Shura - disintegrate back into dust, the dying Gold Saints who even after death, continued their duty towards Athena only entrusted the bronze saint one last thing: Protect the goddess Athena and defeat Hades.</p>

<p>The Hades arc continued in Hades' realm - the realm of the death. This chapter chronicled the ongoing battle of the Bronze saints and the last Gold Saints who survived the first Hades arc. At the climax of the second part of the Hades arc - Camus joined the other Gold Saints in the final gathering at the Wailing Wall, and with their combined powers, managed to destroy it and open a path to Elysion. After this, his spirit and cosmos vanished - leaving his Aquarius Gold Cloth floating among the other Gold Cloths.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarius_Camus_6f06.html" title="Edit section: Notes and Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Notes and Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Crystal Saint was an anime-only (and thus non-canon) character, who replaced Aquarius Camus as Hyoga's (and Isaac's) master. The Crystal Saint himself was trained by Aquarius Camus, and was at Silver Saint level in terms of power. He was eventually manipulated by the Pope's mind control to kill Hyoga, and Hyoga had no choice but to kill him. Because having an alternate master for Hyoga made his confrontation with Camus somewhat less dramatic, the Crystal Saint was generally not a very popular character amongst fans of Saint Seiya</li>
<li>Aquarius Camus had always wanted Hyoga to become a cold warrior who would fight strong with no mercy for his opponent, yet when he fought Hyoga, he was unable to do so in the end.</li>
<li>Camus commented that his Freezing Coffin attack could not be broken, even with the combined power of 12 Gold Saints. This statement is questionable, because an attack from the combined power of the 12 Gold Saints was powerful enough to destroy the wailing wall, while in an earlier attempt, five Gold Saints using the Libra weapons were not successful in achieving this goal. And Dragon Shiryu was able to break the coffin using only the Libra sword.</li>
<li>It was Camus who mentioned the temperature at which Cloth's would break: -150Â°C for Bronze, -200Â°C for Silver, -273Â°C (Absolute Zero) for Gold. However, upon fighting Thanatos, God of Death, he commented that it would take a power several hundred times more powerful than Absolute Zero to freeze him, being a God.</li>
<li>After the battle against <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Shaka_e1f0.html" title="Virgo Shaka">Virgo Shaka</a>, Camus was the only one left with sense of hearing.</li>
<li>In the manga, Aquarius Camus' hair is red (as seen in volume 11), but in the anime it is blue.</li>
<li>In the Hades arc, when Camus is revived, he has lighter hair.</li>
