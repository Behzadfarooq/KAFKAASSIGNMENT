<p>In 2006, Antena 3's rival <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecinco.html" title="Telecinco">Telecinco</a> acquired a 15% share of Miramón Mendi, the company that produces the series. Miramón's contract with Antena 3 expired on June 2006 and was not renewed. The actor's contracts bind them to the producer company and not to the network. Rumours abounded during the summer, until on September 26 it was reported that, in November, Telecinco will start shooting the episodes of <i>Aquí no hay quien viva'</i>s sequel, with all the actors except (for now) Fernando Tejero. At the end of the fifth season, the inhabitants of Desengaño 21 were evacuated due to termites and they move to a new building in the Atocha street, with gives its name to the sequel, <i>Atocha 20</i>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

He is in his middle thirties and lives in the porter's lodge with his father, Mariano. He's not an ambitious man, he just wants to live without worries and have a steady girlfriend. Unluckily, he's in the wrong building for it. He's a gossip and he always has a comeback for everything. He was in <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> for a while, until he was kicked out. He's had three girlfriends so far: Rocío (a mailwoman with a young son whom he almost married), Belén (a complicated relationship where they have broken up and gotten together again several times) and Carmen (his college professor). His most known catchphrase, "un poquito de por favor" (a little bit of please), has quickly become an everyday use idiom around Spain. It's even been parodied in other shows, and not only in the own station's, Antena 3.</li>

He's separated from Emilio's mother and, since he has no place to live, he made himself one with his son. He has a lot of nerve, he's a womanizer without much luck and he's always after one money scheme or another. It won't be the first time Emilio has kicked him out, but he always takes him back. His <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_phrase.html" title="Catch phrase">catch phrase</a> is <i>ignorante de la vida</i>, criticizing the younger generation for being ignorant about life.

Her <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a> Valentin is the most important thing for her. Alongside her sister Marisa and her friend Concha, they're the source of all gossiping in the building. She's got a crush on Andrés. When Marisa's husband gets back they end up together to everyone's amazement. She is still waiting for her true love. At the first time it seemes that she is silly but in fact is very clever when she wants.</li>
<li><b>Maria Luisa <i>"Marisa"</i> Benito</b> (<i>Mariví Bilbao</i>) - Vicenta's older sister. After her husband Manolo left her, Vicenta took her in her home. She's the polar opposite of her sister, a harsh, ironic chain-smoker, "chinchón" (anisette)-drinking who always speaks her mind.

<li><b>Concha</b> (<i>Emma Penella</i>) - In the first season, she lived in flat 2-B with her son Armando and her grandson Dani. Afterwards, they moved out and she sold the flat to the Guerra family. But her son put her in a retirement house because the woman he moved in with didn't like her, which pissed her off. She went to live with her friends Vicenta and Marisa. She still had another flat in the building, which she rented to Belén without a contract. Recently, she decided to sell it, and Belén bought it using a plot that Concha didn't like one bit.</li>

Fernando has since returned and they're living together again. Recently, Mauri decided to write a book at Fernando's urging and his own lack of fullfilment with his career.

While in coma, Paloma appeared a few times on the show, but since Loles wasn't working with them due to the salary problem, her face was never shot, always being backwards or just the legs.
