The "Ghostface" killer.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cindy and her friends, Tiffany, Paige and Brenda as well as their boyfriends Alex, Zack, Bobby and Ray are more than talkative about the murders. During the following night, Cindy is attacked by Ghostface barely managing to survive by contacting the police, Cindy is taken into the Police station and her boyfriend Alex is accused of being the infamus attacker. Cindy is forced to stay at Tiffany's house until her father gets back from his buisiness trip in 4 or 5 days. Cindy is horrified to recieve a phone call from the killer obviously meaning it couldn't be Alex. Meanwhile during the same night, another of Cindy's classmates, Heather Cooper is murdered by Ghostface.</p>
<p>Alex is soon let out due to Heather's death and Cindy's phone call, obviously meaning that he couldn't be the killer. Cindy is in school the next day when she is attacked once again by Ghostface, in the girl's bathroom. Prior, to the attack school is closed and a nationwide curfew is set by the goverment until the issue is resolved. With everyone gone, Ghostface murders Principal Himbry. When the student, Sarah Daling comes back for her P.E bag she is also murdered along with her boyfriend, Terry Forest.</p>
<p>Due to Cindy's attack in the bathroom she is forced to go with two police officers along with anohter student attacked, Alyson McDaniel. However, the killer breaks into the car killing both police officers. Cindy and Alyson flee and hide in an abadoned medical centre inwhich Alyson is eventually murdered by Ghostface.</p>
<p>To celebrate schools being temporarily closed, Zack comes up with a plan to throw a small party at his house inwhich Cindy is not too sure on going until Tiffany and Paige pursaude her to. During the party, Gale and Officer Derek Myers go into the house and secretly put a video camera so she can see what they're up to in her van. After, Gale gets back into her van and watches to partying teens with Kenny.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the popularist girl in school, Karen Gilmore (who also seemingly bullies Cindy) is drowned in her garden pond by Ghostface, along with her dog, Roxy. At the party, Bobby recieves a phone call from his friends as they want picking up to come to the party. Paige (the only one who can drive there with a valid license) is forced to go pick them up. Paige heads for the car, opens her door with the car keys and accidentally drops the keys. The keys seemed to have dissapeared until they appear back in the spot where she left them a moment later. A confused Paige doesn't notice Ghostface has opened the car boot with them before putting them back in the same spot, and sneaked into the back seat. While Paige is still thinking over the matter, Ghostface lunges at her, and slits her throat.</p>
<p>The partygoers begin to watch a horror film, Ray and Brenda (who don't want to) go upstairs to make love. Ray who wants to some beer goes downstairs and enters the kitchen and closes the kitchen door so the partygoers don't annoy him. Suddenly there is a tap on the backyard door, seeming as it is in the kitchen. He opens it to be knocked to his feet by Ghostface. Ghostface picks up a metal ladel from the side and beats Ray to death with it, with the partygoers being so loud, they cannot hear his cries for help.</p>

Tiffany is stuck in the catflap on the automatic garage door.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ghostface sneakily makes his way upstairs without the partyers noticing. Brenda is on the phone to someone when Ghostface sneaks behind her and viciously strangles her to death with the telephone chord, Brenda doesn't even have a chance to evem see Ghostface.</p>
<p>With everyone complaining about no beer, Tiffany is forced to go down the garage to get some. While there she is also attacked by Ghostface, cutting her arm. Tiffany puts up a fight, slamming the refrigerator door in the killer's face and throwing numerous beer bottles at her attacker. She plans to escape through the cat flap located on the automatic <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_door.html" title="Garage door">garage door</a> only for her to get stuck half way, Ghostface presses the button to raise the door causing Tiffany to have her head crushed and neck broken by it.</p>
<p>Zack gets a phonecall and word gets out about the Principal's, Sarah Darling's and Terry Forest murder, making many people go to see his corpses just as Alex arrives on the scene. Cindy and Alex go upstairs to talk while Zack and Bobby continue to watch the horror movie. Realising Brenda and Ray still maybe having sex (although they are dead) Cindy and Alex go into a different bedroom. Alex and Cindy almost lose their virginity towards eachother but Ghostface arrives and kills Alex. Cindy manages to escape running into the room inwhich Ray and Brenda were meant to be having sex. Cindy discovers Brenda's, Ray's and Paige's murdered bodies while in there and she climbs through the window also discovering Tiffany's lifeless body hanging from the garage door.</p>
<p>Cindy rushes into Gale's newsvan, inwhich Gale has gone out leaving only Kenny inside. While inside she witnesses Ghostface murdering Bobby and Zack. Kenny goes outside to find Gale only to step outside and be killed by Ghostface. Cindy rushes out and is involved with a cat-and-mouse chase with the killer while Gale arrives back at her van to be stepping in blood, driving off to see Kenny's body splattered on the windscreen. Cindy locks herself into the blood-bathed house and Ghostface breaks in who finally reveals himself and the shocking truth is revealed, the killer is non-other than Derek Myers and explains to her why he is the serial killer. He suffered from a mental problem and when a bunch of teenagers stole his car one day, he vowed to get revenge on all the teenagers of Woodsboro and anyone related to them (which is why he killed the school principal) as well as anyone who stood in his way (such as Kenny).</p>
<p>Derek chases Cindy throughout the house until he loses her, and Cindy is pinned down by him and is about to stab her when an extremely banged up Gale shoots him. He raises up once again but it shot in the head powerfully, by Cindy killing him once and for all. Cindy is taken to custody and Gale gets one hell of a journalism story.</p>
