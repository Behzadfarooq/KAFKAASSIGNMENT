<p>"The total area occupied by Canadian salmon farms in British Columbia and the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick is about 8,900 acreas which is less than 0.01% of the coastal area where these sites are located." This quotation majorly underscores some of the fundamental underlying problems behind aquaculture. Granted, the farms themselves may be small in size, but their effects can be great.</p>
<p>"Wild Pacific and Atlantic salmon stocks have seen significant declines over the last several decades, before salmon farming operations started." This quotation suggests that aquaculture has fixed any issues of a declining fishery. This is not true, and this kind of inneuendo should not be found in a neutral article.</p>
<p>--INDEED, Aquaculture like any technology is a mixed blessing, it has caused as many problems as it has solved. Look below, and take the time to read the article by Kinsey.</p>
<p>While the article does explain some of the major problems with aquacultures in the final paragraph, it does little justice to the major problems facing the aquaculture industry. Escaped fish and water pollution are but some of the few problems that plague the industry; consequently, these problems deserve to be explored further within the Wiki.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, if the Wiki does go into more detail about the industry problems, it could force the discussion to look at the original scientific literature and would expose some of this literature as being anti-aquaculture "advocacy science". There are a lot of broad claims of problems that seem to evaporate on closer examination. 72.67.40.148 03:05, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have tried to clean up the critisms section. I can't provide any extra links at the moment but many of these have been previously reported on British TV, with proof. eg. they filmed 'dead areas' underneath the fish pens, salmon caught in the deep sea with serious parasite infection ( caught when they passed by the fish farms ) etcDavid J James 6 September 2006</p>

<p>What do you call a female fish filled with roe (or, how do you describe such a condition)? She isn't pregnant, since the eggs have not yet been impregnated ...

<p><b>Re:question for aquaculturalists</b></p>
<p>Hi there, I just stumbled across your question on talk:fish farming and talk:aquaculture. When full of eggs, female salmon are <i>gravid</i>. I don't know if anyone beat me to it, and if it's still any use to you now, but thought I'd leave you a note. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnilocra_a4d1.html" title="User:Anilocra">Anilocra</a> 21:37, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Question on names...</p>
<p>It seems like names of fish are often changed for marketing purposes, but I have a problem with the liberal use of "catfish" by many different fish. One in particular is basa from Vietnam. As I understand it, the two fish are not closely related. In the classification system used by scientists, U. S. farm-raised catfish differ from basa to the same degree as house cats differ from beef cattle within the grouping of mammals. It seems like they are simply trying to capitalize on the name with an imposter fish. I know in the U.S., the government had to ban use of the name "catfish" for basa and tra from Vietnam because of the confusion it caused among consumers. I don't mind renaming a fish for marketing purposes when it is a new name, but when you are calling one fish another fish that people are familiar with, I do have a problem.</p>
<p>Answer on names: The scientific class of fish called "catfish" includes basa along with channel catfish and many other species of catfish. It is not like the difference between cats and cows. The scientists still consider basa (closely related to or the same as some of the "catfish" you buy in pet shops for your aquarium) a catfish, but the political power of the US catfish industry has dictated that the scientific name is not valid and only US channel catfish or blue catfish/channel catfish hybrids are "catfish". Looking in my local asian market, basa is higher priced than channel cats -- so much for the law. Deweaver 03:18, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am hoping that someone could start a section on Open-Ocean Aquaculture (OOA). It has been called the future of fish farming.

<p>OCA is currently used to fatten up Tuna that are caught too young to sell in the eastern Mediterrean. IMHO if you cannot catch old enough Tuna to sell you are overfishing. In any case it does not remove one of the major problems&#160;: you are still feeding the farmed fish on caught wild fish. David J.James 6 September 2006.</p>

<dd>I've got a copy of "Seafarm: The Story of Aquaculture," and am considering doing a long paper on legal issues involving aquaculture, so I will probably work on this article soon. From what I understand so far, this is a technology that has existed in some form for many centuries and can/should become a major industry for the West, but which faces regulatory hurdles. --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKris_Schnee_d995.html" title="User:Kris Schnee">Kris Schnee</a> 17:53, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I went through the criticism section's references and have found several of the sites to be what I would consider an unreliable source of information. Using an animal rights site on a subject such as this is just as bad as using the corporate site of a fish farming company as a source. I am afraid to bother putting the time and effort into finding better sources for this information: such as scholarly or PUBLISHED sources. I will however do it if I can get some consensus on how many people agree with my opinion that an animal rights website is a biased source. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_g2_4448.html" title="User:James g2">James g2</a> 23:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I will add that I did find some of the criticism section to be very well sourced. My only problem is with the use of some "animal rights" sites that do not cite any studies or provide any evidence that what they are saying is true. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_g2_4448.html" title="User:James g2">James g2</a> 23:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Glad to see someone who checks references. The Env. NGO's (ENGO's) have a highly variable report quality and often misquote research papers. However, I found an very good report by WWF on Salmon Diets using a URL from a publication. The report did mention that fish meal is not required for salmon feed, just need the correct proteins and fatty acids. Some of the aquaculture criticism's do reference reports in respected journals, but I think a lot of these "good" publications have some metholodical problems but they are often buried deep in implicit assumptions.
