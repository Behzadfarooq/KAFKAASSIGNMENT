<dd>No deep reason.

<p>Umm, really? "Bridge of Brooklyn" sounds pretty foreign to me. So does "Bridge of London." English might theoretically go that way, but it doesn't often. "Aqueduct of Segovia" strikes me simply as a "gloss" from the Spanish, not a translation, and it doesn't strike me, as a native speaker of English, as having any resonance with actual usage. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 01:20, 18 February 2006 (UTC)blondlieut@aol.com (who takes the "Highway of Shirley" (also known as the Shirley Highway) across the Bridge of the 14th Street (also known as the 14th Street Bridge) into work every day, where I work at the Building of 1600 Massachusetts (also known as the 1600 Massachusetts Building ...I'll leave it to any other native speaker to tell me which of the "of" constructions actually sounds natural).</p>

<p>If you trace the link <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aqueduct.html" title="Aqueduct">aqueduct</a>, you'll be hard-pressed to find many (or any) other examples of aqueducts that do not follow the "X Aqueduct" naming pattern. The careful reader will note that I did not say that English never follows the "X of X" pattern, I said it does not often do so. The fact that my examples are from modern ones from my everyday life, and yours are unusual ones from places far away and (often) times along ago, wouldn't seem to indicate demonstrate that this is the more common or natural way English works. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 02:24, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, here's a funny thing. It's indeed listed under "Segovia Aqueduct" in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and not "Aqueduct of Segovia." www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066604?hook=633946 Is that a good enough reason to change it?

<dd>FWIW, the Google test gives "Segovia aqueduct" 713, "aqueduct of Segovia" 805. It really looks like both uses are equally common. First hit on the latter is UNESCO, which ought to carry about as much weight as <i>Britannica</i>.

<p>"… <i>convento jurídico</i> (which translates into 'judicial covenant') of <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clunia.html" title="Clunia">Clunia</a>." I don't think so. I had left the phrase untranslated because I wasn't sure of an English-language equivalent, but "convento" is not "covenant" (it can be "convent" or "monastery"). I believe that <i>convento jurídico</i> is a monastery with legal proprietorship of a territory, but I don't know an English term. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>yes, convento in this context is not a religious term. "provincial court," approximately. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 01:26, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ummm....About the "Convento" &lt;-&gt; "Covenant" translation, I also had my doubts... when I first translated it I used "convent", but I did some research and it turns out that the Spaniards used "Convento" as a referral to an arbitration of boundaries. It was, therefore, and agrement mediated by the Church, thus I decided to use the most similar-sounding word that reached that meaning, and went for "Covenant". Feel free to correct me on that if you find a better way to translate it.</li>

<dd>I like the term "Provincial Court", but it just loses the elegance of "Convento Jurídico", don't you think? I'll let you fellas decide.

<p>See the above link. Apparently, as it turns out, Roman Hispania had 14-some-odd jurisdictions; they were called conventus iuridici (the plural, at any rate), as, well, they didn't speak Spanish then, and in many of those same places now, of course, they still don't speak Spanish (or they speak it along with Basque, Catalan, Portuguese, etc.). So using the Spanish expression for a Roman Hispania idea seems a bit off, in English (make it makes sense in Spanish, where Hispanizing the Latin is a lot easier, and the cultural continuum between Roman Hispania and modern Spain, and thus between Latin and Spanish is, well ... continuous). At any rate, my first (pseudo)translation, provincial court, is only right in the sense that convento juridico can apply both to the jurisdiction of the court and the court itself. So this should probably be something like. ... "the area fell with the jurisdiction of the Roman provincial court (<i>conventus iuridici</i> [we'll have to find the singular], Spanish <i>convento jurídico</i>) located in Clunia. That way the term is explained without over-translating it (and over-translating here ... doesn't provide much explanation for what we're talking about).</p>
<p>Does that make sense?<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 03:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fine by me. Go with it. =D #Ianfe 02:59, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe <i>conventus iuridici</i> is a mix of singular noun and plural adjective. My Latin is weak, but I'd expect <i>conventus iuridicus</i> singular and <i>conventi iuridici</i> plural. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd say you're right. A google search of the term brings it up being used in precisely the way under discussion-- a Roman "conventus iuridicus;" see <a href="http://libro.uca.edu/stanislawski/Chap8.htm" class="external free" title="http://libro.uca.edu/stanislawski/Chap8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://libro.uca.edu/stanislawski/Chap8.htm</a></p>

<p>"conventus iuridici" is normal Latin. The word "conventus" belongs to the fourth declension, which ends in nominative -us, genitive -us, dative -ui, accusative -um, and ablative and -u. Cf. this guide: <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/caseusage/qt/Latin4thdecl.htm" class="external free" title="http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/caseusage/qt/Latin4thdecl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/caseusage/qt/Latin4thdecl.htm</a> "conventus iuridici" is nominative plural, meaning literally "meeting places for court." It refers to an institution of Roman provincial administration, whereby the center of a region's court system would be located in an important provincial city. It was there, in the conventus, that the governor dispensed justice. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.27.150.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.27.150.73_eba5.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.27.150.73">contribs</a>) 3 October 2006.</small></p>

<p>"Catholic Matron of the city": really "matron"? Despite its etymology, I thought a "patron saint" was a "patron saint" regardless of gender. In Spanish, the term is <i>patrona</i>. (And just a bit later, we refer to Saint Barbara as (patron saint of artillerymen). But I'm not Catholic.

<dd>I had my doubts about this term, too. Like you, I'm not Catholic so I hesitated in changing it.

<p>I think "Catholic Matron" is right, just weird in English (such that it might require rethinking about how to explain or present this). It seems to me that ... the Virgin Mary keeps reappearing to Catholics (she's sort of like the Buddha that way ... but I guess it's the same Mary though). So there's the Virgin of Guadalupe, whose a ... "matron" of a particular place, where Mary showed up in some particular guise. So this is ... Mary again, but with yet another name, visage, and complicated history. Seems to me patron saints (patron here I think means "pattern" or "model") are (supposedly, at least) real people (and with modern saints were really real people), but a Catholic Matron can be an apparition of sorts (not a person that comes back as the reincarnation of Mary ... I don't think there's a doctrine on the second coming of Mary .. but I could be wrong). But I'm just a dumb Protestant. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 01:33, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Frankly, "Catholic Matron" is a term I've heard often enough in English, and I went to a Catholic boarding school in Wisconsin (I'll admit, though, I was 12 at the time), but I guess it's as simple as going to your local Catholic church (if you currently live in a English-speaking country) and asking the Priest what the correct terminology is. # Ianfe 02:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... and no, there is no Catholic doctrine about the second coming of Mary. Hehehe # Ianfe 02:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hey, I wonder... does the term "patroness" exist? I don't think so, but if so it would be an excellent compromise.... Just checked "patroness" at thefreedictionary.com and it states "3. A patron saint. See Usage Note at -ess." (which then goes on to denote that "ess" refers to the term being applied to a female). I guess that's the word to use, then!. If nobody minds, I'll go ahead and change that. #Ianfe 02:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think female patron saints can be ... patron saints in English. There's a movement in English away from separate endings (waitress, stewardess); some are degrading (poetess), some are insulting (Jewess). So I wouldn't recommend it. This ... manifestation of Mary makes her the patron saint of the city, in English, I think. A google check reveals that any use of matron saint is .. jocular at best (and .. non-religious), and at the "Matron" in a religious context refers to ... St. Anne, who (despite no historic or biblical evidence) is construed by Catholics as the mother (hence matron) of Mary (and "matron saint" does not occur in New Advent, the Catholic Encyclopedia). I'm pretty sure, going back to the Virgin of Guadalupe model, that the Black Virgin (as she is known) is called a "patron saint" of the Americas (leaving aside that from a metaphysical perspective, she is not separate and apart from Mary herself (who is also a saint, St. Mary)-- the weirdness I cannot seem to get past in describing this, so bear with me). All that to say, "Catholic" in the translation seems unnecessary; this Virgin Mary of the Whatever-whatever is simply the (a) patron saint of the city.<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 03:41, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, I'm wrong (or at least half-way wrong). The Virgin of Guadalupe, an apparition of the "true Mother of God," is the "Patroness of the Americas." See below. But when it's more than an apparition, and it's and actual person (not just Mary reappearing), then it's patron saint (see the New Advent Encyclopedia on that). So St. Barbara is a ... patron saint (I made her the patron saint of artillery (as opposed to artillerymen) as the wikipedia article supports this, and it eliminates the sexism in the phrase (the wikipedia article on her also states that she is the patron saint of artillery gunners, but that seems not to follow as naturally in the text).</p>

<p>OOoooookay, maybe this is just too obvious, but perhaps something needs to be added to the "Legend" section regarding the manifest import of the story, which is to say the roll that it played in Christianizing the foundational story of the aqueduct, and thus of Segovia itself? I mean, if the the pagan Hercules had been founder of the city, and had sat a top the structure, very convenient indeed that a new story comes along, with a wonderful excuse to topple the image of a pagan deity and install the statute of a virgin and the Catholic saint, and the lads from the local Francoist military hotbed for decades got to hoot and holler under their beautific, shining faces on the patron saint for barbarism day. Lovely, and I'm sure quite a site. Or does the legend does kind of ... sit there, with no explication at all of the function it served in the cultural and religious transition of Segovia?<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 21:27, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I can't judge, to me they are the <i>Reyes Católicos</i>, no sense of how common in English. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:18, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's the first time I've seen them refered to as the Catholic Monarchs in an English text: They are usually named individually. Still, there is an article about them under "Catholic Monarchs" so if someone reading the article is in any doubt who they are, they can simply click on the link. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGringoInChile_38b7.html" title="User:GringoInChile">GringoInChile</a> 02:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh, yeah... I was surprised to find an article for Catholic Monarchs as well. When I first translated it I looked for "Catholic Kings" or something similar... then I retraced it to Felipe de Aragon and found out about the article... I'll check some History books and see if they're called that way in English outside Wikipedia. If not, we might suggest changing the title of "Monarchs" article? Ianfe 02:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yup, I checked and "Catholic Monarchs" is the correct English term. #Ianfe 02:27, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I remember in history class, in English, calling these folks the <i>Reyes Católicos</i>, untranslated. Seems to me people know the names Ferdinand and Isabelle; I'd used those names and link to "Catholic Monarchs" (which borders on being .. imcomprehensible, I'm afraid), using the Spanish term parenthetically.</p>

<p>A pretty major order in Spain. Do we have an article somewhere to link to? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:18, 17 February 2006 (UTC</p>
