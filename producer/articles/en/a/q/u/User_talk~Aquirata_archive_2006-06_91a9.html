<p>Hey -- I just want to say "Thanks" for your <i>stellar</i> work on the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> page, as well as your amusing ability to punch holes in the arguments of the 'skeptics' on the Astrology Talk Page. Frankly, I am quite awed by your level of verbal fluency along with your thoroughness in quashing their obvious close-mindedness (and hatred) towards all things Astrology. It may all be sophistry as one person put it, but I don't think so -- you really know your stuff. So...thanks for staying an open-minded thinker and best of luck to you in the future! --<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.13.html" title="User:205.188.116.13">205.188.116.13</a> 04:27, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please take some time to familurise yourself with wikipedia's verification policy. Inserting outlandish claims based solely on papers from flimsy sources is not policy, and they will be removed.

<p>I think that the major reason for there being no comments is that anyone familiar with the literature knows that the usage of the term "placebo" is in a terrible mess. I hope that my yet-to-be-finished piece <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_%28origins_of_technical_term%29.html" title="Placebo (origins of technical term)">Placebo (origins of technical term)</a> and the companion piece <a href="../../../u/s/e/Uses_of_the_term_placebo.html" title="Uses of the term placebo">Uses of the term placebo</a> will give you some sort of "feel" for the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback. I am about 60% through the task that I have set myself. Once it is completed, I think that you will better understand the way in which various sorts of terminological usage, driven by various theoretical positions have complicated things so much.</p>
<p>I am trying my hardest, based on a study of the lterature (a study which is helping me to identify a large number of terminology-induced problems) to identify where there is confusion, and to clarify how, when, where and why such confusion can be avoided.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for your further comments, once my work is eventually finished. (For example, in order to specifically clarify the issue of "placebo response" and "placebo reaction" I have been forced to set my project aside and write about <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._Morton_Jellinek_74fc.html" title="E.

<p>I took a long to time read the AfD (and believe me, there were so many comments that it took me quite a while). No other AfD closer wanted to put the time and effort into weighing those comments. I was a neutral party who has no vested interested either way in this article. My closing comments may have been, in your mind, somewhat brief, but they were a lot longer than a lot of other AfD closing comments. In any case, I won't change my mind about this because whatever arguments need to be presented were already presented in the AfD, unless you have new information that wasn't already presented in the AfD. If you have any new information to present that will likely result in the overturning of the result of this AfD, I suggest you read <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">Wikipedia:Undeletion policy</a> and the instructions in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> before arguing your case in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. If you do so, please let me know so I can look at whatever new information you present so I can also suggest an action (which may be to overturn the results of my AfD closure, depending on the new evidence that you present).

<p>I am taking a break from this discussion, but I see you moved the criticism to the talk page, so I added an NPOV flag, which I trust you will agree is useful.

<p>Thanks for your edits of the Bernard Haisch article.

<dd>No problem, Bernard. I do agree with your comment on the above sentence, too, and that's why I put the 'fact' tag on it in the first place.

<p>Err, it appears you are using null edits with edit comments as a method of communication. Please don't do this, it is very confusing, especially in recent cases where it has looked like you are reverting changes (especially due to popups' diff truncation). The appropriate place to put such comments is on the relevant talk page, or on my talk page if you need a faster response. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 13:37, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm always willing to talk. However, you are making reverts without coming to the Talk page first. This is in articles in which you had no recent involvement. So I would think the onus is on you to start talking first and edit later. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 13:41, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

There isn't very much to add, and I watch an ever increasing number of articles for issues like this, so I don't have time to enter into a lengthy debate first. If you want to revert something I do, revert it and talk about it on the talk page. Edit comments with null edits are not a good method of communication. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 13:49, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>It appears you're right and I am at fault - however, since Jefffire self-reverted himself shortly before I made the decision, I consider the situation over with. I would urge you both to stop editing the article page itself and concentrate on the talk page in a constructive manner, aiming to reach a version which confroms to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia's verifiability policy</a>.
