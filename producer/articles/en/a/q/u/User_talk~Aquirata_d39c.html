<p>I think the page should be unlocked. I believe the categories are the issue with the admins because the categories propogate through the servers. They can be difficult to remove. We've agreed on using both prototscience and pseudoscience categories. That's probably enough for the admins. It seems Chris wants to edit elsewhere on the page but can't. My thought is that we can continue the Talk after the page is unlocked.</p>
<p>I completely agree with your assessment that the mainstream scientists are not qualified to either test or publish the astrology claims. It is not a question of the astrology claims not passing scientific "muster", but a question of the mainstream scientists not passing astrological muster. Still, replication is not that difficult, because you just repeat someone elses experiment and see if it's falsified. I've a feeling that the mainstream scientists will go as long as they can calling astrology pseudoscience on the weight of their authority until the claims mount up and they cannot ignore replication tests any longer. I would like to think that time is now (Sat opp Nep, sq Jup), but it's a question of public education. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 00:48, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll add that I am concerned about unlocking the page with the falsifiable astrological claims removed. At least they're there now. I'd say that without them this article verges away from science as a method and towards the subject of accepting scientists and their irrational beliefs. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 01:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, those references to astro work are important. I agree to keep the page locked unless there's agreement to keep these references.

<li><b>Reliable sources</b> This has only a slight chance. The issue is not easily understood.</li>

<p>The reason I deleted that sentence--rather than completing it--is that it was (is) redundant. See the first paragraph of the "Theories and practices" section.

<dd>If fact what I said is that due to your pernicious editing habits, which have more than once resulted in major accidental deletions on the page, it is impossible to acertain the events.

<p>When I first jumped into Wikipedia a couple of weeks ago I added 2 external links, one to The Avalon School of Astrology under the Schools subheading, and one to a free chart service under the Tools subheading. The Avalon link is still there but the link to the free chart service was removed. I tried to follow the history list to see when it was removed and by whom but I can't seem to track this down. I would like to put it back but because there is a conflict of interest here in that the free chart service is on a commercial site and I am the founder of the company, I wanted to check with you and Chris Brennan about any concerns or problems with adding it before putting it there. The link I added was to to <a href="http://www.astrosoftware.com/freechart.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.astrosoftware.com/freechart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrosoftware.com/freechart.htm</a> directly underneath the Astrolabe Software link. Astrolabe is also a commercial enterprise and even their company name is featured in the link. The free chart service at Cosmic Patterns provides an alternative with some advantages and disadvantages to the astrolabe service (which I can discuss in detail). It seems to me that the link to the free chart service provided by Cosmic Patterns is on equal footing with the one from astrolabe so I wonder why the link I added was removed. Perhaps I am in error and in my clumsy first attempts at involvement with Widkipedia I did not properly add it. In any case, I thought I would get the opinion of you and Chris before attempting to add it back. Thanks, and thanks for all the good work you are doing for Wikipedia. I will write a note to Chris to read this note to you. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 10:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the explanation on Wikipedia spam guidelines. This does explain why the links I added were deleted. The intention of this link was not self-promotion but it is best for an addition like this to not be added by a person directly involved with the external link site. I had little understanding of the excellent Wikipedia guidelines when I was a newcomer.

<p>I don't know why more people don't move pages when they're in the wrong place (probably a lot of them don't realize it can be done by normal editors in many situations). I think in this situation it was impossible to move the article to the right title because of edits to the redirect; redirects can only be overwritten by a page move if the ONLY thing they've ever been is a redirect to the page that's moving on top of them. Make sense? I bet not... Cheers!

<dd>And I would add that I don't know how we would have come to agreement with your analysis of the list of participants. Essentially, you'd like to add Zeus (no problem) and ignore two of three people you've been recently revert warring with (Jefffire and Vorpal). That doesn't strike me as accomplishing much. As for your analysis of experts, it's irrelevant to "the encyclopedia anyone can edit" and I think it flawed insofar as you and Piper do not appear to be experts. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I missed this one, I've been putting in long hours at work &amp; don't have a lot of time left for web surfing. Maybe undelete in the future? <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 06:26, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Very sorry for the delay in responding. I was hoping to be closer to finishing the overall task in a much faster time.</p>
<p>I think that you are right and that it may well be that, once things have been "merged" the flaws will disappear and -- at least to a certain extent -- the material can be unmerged. However, it is also true that there are many serious problems arising from the fact that various authors (of journal articles, etc) are using terminology, etc. in a way that is not supported by the sources they cite.</p>
<p>For example, you will continuously find statements such as: "The placebo effect was first mentioned in 1955 by Henry K. Beecher, M.D.". Anyone who makes such a statement (a) has never read Beecher's paper (his paper is, in fact, an earnest plea for double-blind trials), (b) no knowledge of the usage of the expression "placebo effect" (which was only ever used in terms of saying smething like "we all know that, on many occasions, placebos bring considerable relief to patients" (and these references to "placebo effects" predate Beecher by maybe 10 years, and (c) totally ignore the fact that Beecher was speaking <b>very correctly</b> of "placebo responses", and never spoke of "placebo effects" (even his own, later, book on placebos does not contain a single mention of a "placebo effect"). Anyway, there are a lot of reasons why these sorts of things need to be dealt with all on the one page.</p>
<p>It is also becoming abundantly clear that there is an enormous amount of misinformation (and, as well, it seems that certain people are strongly pushing certain points of view (and, also, certain sorts of additional reference material).</p>
<p>As I get closer to the finish of the task, I will contact you once again. Best to you <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindsay658_d7de.html" title="User:Lindsay658">Lindsay658</a> 07:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am very interested in your comment that you have recently found a proof of astrology! This may not be directly relevant to Wikipedia and if not, perhaps you can e-mail me information about this. Over the past several years I have stepped up the pace of the development of research tools and I have applied them to demonstrate, for example, that Bradley's DJIA forecast does not work, but other formula may work - I am still working on this. I am using some analytical methods based on symmetry and harmonics that are showing hopeful signs of validating astrology and have produced spectacularly positive results in pilot studies. Anyway, increased research to sort out what works and may not work is the critical issue of our times, and if you have found a white crow, as G. Dean refers to such a breakthrough, I want to hear more about it!&#160;:-) I can also perhaps create AstroSignatures, etc. that might be helpful in the research. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 12:32, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
