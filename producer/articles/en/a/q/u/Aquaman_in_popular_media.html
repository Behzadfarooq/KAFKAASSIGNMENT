Aquaman with fellow <i>Super Friends</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>He was also a major character in the original season of the animated television series <i>Super Friends</i> (1973). <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Friends_75d8.html" title="Super Friends">Super Friends</a></i> is often credited with having exposed Aquaman to a much wider audience outside of the comic book community. In this series, Aquaman was shown to display superstrength and encyclopedic knowledge of oceanography and oceanology, in addition to his more familiar water-breathing power and aquatic telepathy.</p>
<p>However, the various successor series (<i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Challenge_of_the_Super_Friends_c033.html" title="Challenge of the Super Friends">Challenge of the Super Friends</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_World%27s_Greatest_Super_Friends_d585.html" title="The World's Greatest Super Friends">The World's Greatest Super Friends</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Super_Friends%7E_The_Legendary_Super_Powers_Show_f2cd.html" title="Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show">Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/a/l/The_Super_Powers_Team%7E_Galactic_Guardians_c967.html" title="The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians">The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians</a></i>) have been blamed for making Aquaman unpopular and even laughable alongside other heroes. They are accused of having portrayed him in an unflattering light, as they focused almost exclusively on his water-breathing and telepathic powers, thus reinforcing a weak image of the character.</p>
<p>During his <i>Super Friends</i> tenure, he was often paired with <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Woman_0ea1.html" title="Wonder Woman">Wonder Woman</a>, leading some fans to speculate on a possible romance between the Atlantean King and the Amazon Princess. When <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Morrison_1462.html" title="Grant Morrison">Grant Morrison</a> took the <i><a href="../../../j/l/a/JLA_2c9b.html" title="JLA">JLA</a></i> title, it was specified that both characters share a special friendship bond.</p>

<p>The character made an appearance in one episode of the 1990s animated television series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">Superman: The Animated Series</a></i>, where he was voiced by <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Ferrer_ca1d.html" title="Miguel Ferrer">Miguel Ferrer</a>. He was drawn in the "classic" Aquaman appearance as having an orange shirt, green gloves, green pants with green boots, a gold belt with gold "A" insignia belt buckle, short hair, and a clean-shaven face, but he had a fairly intense personality. In the episode, Aquaman, regarded as an urban legend, comes into conflict with <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a> when an undersea construction plan of Luthor's starts causing damage to Aquaman's home, Atlantis. He tries to stop the tests peacefully but his "peaceful" attempts to stop them are "met with violence and capture." <a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_Lane_5472.html" title="Lois Lane">Lois Lane</a> finds him a prisoner of LexCorp's institute, and she is in turn captured and taken to be killed with him, but Aquaman manages to escape with Lois and returns to stop the tests under the ocean. He almost attacks the surface world with his army, but <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> dissuades him from doing so. When Aquaman tries to leave peacefully, one of Luthor's men tries to shoot him in the back, unsuccessfully, and Aquaman's army in turn destroys Luthor's vessel. Aquaman advises Superman to make sure the "surface dwellers" show more respect to the oceans in the future before disappearing.</p>
<p>As seen in the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Beyond_1992.html" title="Batman Beyond">Batman Beyond</a></i> episodes "The Call: Part 1" (airdate November 11, 2000) and "The Call: Part 2" (airdate November 18, 2000), Aquaman's daughter <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquagirl.html#Other_Media" title="Aquagirl">Aquagirl</a> is a member of a future Justice League. During the episode, Terry McGinnis/Batman goes over profiles of the current Justice League members. According to Aquagirl's profile, Aquaman is currently missing.</p>
<p>Aquaman has guest-starred in several episodes of the animated television series <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_%28animated_series%29_2edc.html" title="Justice League (animated series)">Justice League</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i>, where he was voiced by <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Rummell_878c.html" title="Scott Rummell">Scott Rummell</a>. This version was based closely on the hot-headed anti-hero persona of the 1994 – 2001 <i>Aquaman</i> comic book series, with the <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a>-like appearance and hook, but some feel his animated appearances gave him even more depth than his Viking phase had given him. Here, he sacrificed his hand to save his infant son from being killed in a plot against his life by his evil brother Orm (Ocean Master). Though he was a founding member of the Justice League in the comic books, he was left out of the main line-up for the animated series in favor of the tomboyish <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkgirl_%28animated%29.html" title="Hawkgirl (animated)">Hawkgirl</a> so that the team could have another female character opposite Wonder Woman. While the <i>Justice League</i> series remains popular, a number of Aquaman fans were genuinely disappointed that their hero was not included as a regular character. According to the website <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_Without_Pity_8468.html" title="Television Without Pity">Television Without Pity</a>, producers created <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_Ray_%28Justice_League_Unlimited%29_13df.html" title="Devil Ray (Justice League Unlimited)">Devil Ray</a> and removed Aquaman and Black Manta from the series before the episode "To Another Shore" because the rights to Aquaman were no longer available.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/w/_/CW_Television_Network_d958.html" title="CW Television Network">CW Television Network</a> had announced a <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_action.html" title="Live action">live action</a> <i>Aquaman</i> television series called <i><a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquaman_%28TV_program%29_ff9f.html" title="Aquaman (TV program)">Mercy Reef</a></i> (or <i>Aquaman</i>), but on May 18, 2006, it was confirmed that CW did not pick up the show for the 2006/2007 schedule. Recent reports (beginning after the upfronts) say The CW is still considering <i>Aquaman</i> for midseason due to interest piqued by the leaked promotional trailer.

<p>A fictional Aquaman movie played a central role in the second season and part of the third season of the <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a> show <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Entourage_%28TV_series%29_3b6d.html" title="Entourage (TV series)">Entourage</a></i>.

In the episode "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Day_in_the_Valley_398f.html" title="One Day in the Valley">One Day in the Valley</a>", <i>Aquaman</i> premieres to much fanfare and opens with a three-day weekend record of just over <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>116 million (barely beating <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_%28film%29_2550.html" title="Spider-Man (film)">Spider-Man</a>'</i>s $114.8 million). HBO even took out a very realistic looking two-page ad in "Variety" magazine after the episode, promoting the show by saying Aquaman earned $116 million in its first three days. This appeared enough to fool <a href="../../../c/n/b/CNBC_aa11.html" title="CNBC">CNBC</a>, which reported that the three day weekend box office gross of <i><a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_2_bd14.html" title="Pirates of the Caribbean 2">Pirates of the Caribbean 2</a></i> had beaten the previous record of <i>Aquaman</i> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, but Joe Kernan later stated he was a watcher of <i>Entourage</i> and was completely aware that it was fake<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
