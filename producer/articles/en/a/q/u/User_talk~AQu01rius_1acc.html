<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>As a user looking to Adopt with the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_a79f.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User">Adopt-a-User</a> program, there has been some ongoing developments that we would like to bring to your attention, as well as request help with the backlog at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a>.</p>
<p>You should know that the way the adoption process works has changed slightly. To decrease workload at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a> on offering adoption please change the <b>{{Adoptme}}</b> template to <b>{{Adoptoffer}}</b> on the user's user page, and this will add the user to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_having_been_offered_adoption_5561.html" title="Category:Wikipedians having been offered adoption">Category:Wikipedians having been offered adoption</a>. Users that have already been offered adoption can always have a second or third offer, but by separating out those users that have not had an adoption offer yet, it is hoped that no one will go lacking. Once adoption is complete please use the templates found <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adoptee%27s_Area_Resources_af71.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adoptee's Area/Resources">here</a> on the Adoptee's and your user page.</p>

<li>Hey there (:O) ... we have an ongoing debate over <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Beijing_UFO_Research_Organization_3f10.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Beijing UFO Research Organization">here</a> on the status of an article. Now the thing I wanted to bring up was the editing and removal and well <b>forceful rhetoric stating the result of the debate</b> before it has even been decided. The one causing all this is <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a>. I have tried so hard to be loving and understanding during this debate, but now I dont know if what the user is doing is right or wrong. I dont know who to go to, so I figure I may ask someone who is very familiar with the wikipedia world and how this should be dealt with maybe? Not sure. Please help.

<p>Is this what you mean? Template:WikiProject Tibet banner? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 14:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please note though that <a href="../../../t/i/b/Portal%7ETibetan_Buddhism_8ef0.html" title="Portal:Tibetan Buddhism">Portal:Tibetan Buddhism</a> exists and all the categories for WikiProject Tibetan Buddhism most of which are empty. SHould this be moved to WikiProject Tibet? Plus I don't think <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylvain1972_f181.html" title="User:Sylvain1972">User:Sylvain1972</a> is aware of events. I don't know how many articles are related to Tibetan Buddhism but it can't be a huge number although I do see the idea of the project from a religious viewpoint. But I am quick to say that a major part of Wikiproject Tibet is religously entwined anyway. What shall we do? I don't want to offend people who started that project by moving their page but isn't it best under Wikiproject Tibet? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:16, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't create that banner though. However please could you make two adjustmnets to the CHina Tibet= yes template. About the This is maintained by the Tibet workgroup please can you change it to "This article is maintained by the WikiProject Tibet workgroup".</p>
<p>Also could you add the Potala image symbol of wiki project tibet before "This article" in the China template or put it in the place of the Chinese symbol in the margin?. Like the Chinese template has that image but a smaller image of the Potala it the Tibet work section <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 15:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think I have solved the conroversy between labelling pages like the Dalai Lama as chinese by keeping the Tibetan Buddhims template -CHanging it to Wikiproject Tibet:Tibetan Buddhism and adding the Category: WikiProject Tibet articles -this way it avoids the China tag but is still in the Category:Tibetan articles. This should avoid conflict I think! Tibetan buddhism is a useful way to avoid directly labelling figures such as the Dalai laam as under China - this might lead to some serious opposition!! <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 16:38, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most pages though should be tagged as Chinese|tibet=yes but ones which are less sensitive and more politically correct! <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 16:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have sorted it out now - I am keeping the Wikiproject Tibetan Buddhism as a sub order of WIkiProject Tibet - the template is useful for identifying buddhist articles from the tibet/china articles - going in both categries for more focus <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 18:36, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've recently seen some articles that have been expanded and now need to be reassessed. Would it be feasible to set up a parameter for this? Someone could set the parameter to "yes", the article could go into a or something, and then we would know where to go to find them.

I added two new sections: the Northern Dynasties and the Southern Dynasties; I hope you like the improvements!</p>

<p>Nevermind! I figured out what to do after reading the "help" link where the stub notice was located in the article. No longer a stub...</p>

<p>Thanks for your input! It was very valuable, since no one else has peer reviewed it at all! Lol. If you go back, you can see many changes to it already, including a new section on architecture (with a cool photo of the <a href="../../../l/i/u/Liuhe_Pagoda_b636.html" title="Liuhe Pagoda">Liuhe Pagoda</a>). It's going to take a while to revert all those references to the inline-citation type, but for featured-article status, I think it is worth my effort.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing. What was that about an infobox? I'm not quite sure what you're talking about. I'm still new here to wiki.</p>

<p>Hmm...I totally would use an infobox, but there's already that enormous box list of 'Chinese History' taking up all the space in the beginning of the article. I don't think there's a way to merge the two, and having both of them would look far too cluttered. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks, this article looks incredibly well-done and professional now with your tweeks and adjustments (I noticed you changed the 'notes' section to 'citations', good choice).</p>
<p>One little note of discrepancy though: you have the estimated population of the empire at 50 million, when I showed in the second paragraph of the lead that the empire's population was roughly 100 million, twice as big as the preceding Tang (and I cited my source as well, with Ebrey). Are we reading two different sources here? Or is this just the estimate for the Southern Song half of China? Should we break the population part into two sections? Northern Song and Southern Song? And if so, how many more people did the Southern Song have than the Jin Dynasty? I think it's easier just to include Jin and Southern Song into a one-estimate figure for the whole of China; 100 million people. Thoughts?</p>

<p>After students passed the often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily-demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, they did not always see eye to eye with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for their services. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.</p>
<p>Factional strife at court first became apparent during the 1040s AD, with a new state reform initiated by <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_Zhongyan_082d.html" title="Fan Zhongyan">Fan Zhongyan</a>. Fan was a capable military leader (with successful battles in his record against the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanguts.html" title="Tanguts">Tanguts</a> of Xi-Xia) but as a minister of state he was known as an idealist, once saying that a well-minded official should be one that was "first in worrying about the world's troubles and last in enjoying its pleasures".<sup id="_ref-ebrey_163_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey_163" title="">[1]</a></sup> When Fan rose to the seat of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor.html" title="Chancellor">Chancellor</a>, there was a growing opposition to him within the older and more conservative crowd. They disliked his pushing for reforms for the recruitment system, higher pay for minor local officials to discourage against corruption, and wider sponsorship programs to ensure that officials were drafted more on the basis of their intellect and character. However, his reforms were cancelled within a year's time (with Fan replaced as Chancellor), since many older officials who were halfway through their careers were not keen on making changes that could affect their comfortably-set positions.<sup id="_ref-ebrey_163_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey_163" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Is there some way to make it visible again? I hope this can be sorted out soon, because the article looks very bad at present because of this large random part missing.</p>
