<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>What is transitional justice? Before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future Burma, we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. It is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. The most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. Therefore, we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. It is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. We have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. It is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. For instance, U Kyi Maung, who is one of the members of the National League of Democracy (NLD), used to answer the question made by journalists, saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in Germany (8th August 1945) and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. It was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. As a result, it can lead to internecine circumstances.</p>
<p>In relation to the transitional justice in Burma, we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. First, in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when, where and how they happen. The investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. There can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. We can also get tangible information from the government files, mass graves and testimonies. For instance, we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the Burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies; who they were, how and when they were executed. It will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. We also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases.</p>
<p>Second, regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals, or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in Germany. Actually, what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. If we prosecute them, the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end, but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of Burma’s political progress. As a consequence, the civilians will be victims again. Furthermore, prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in Burma. It is not realistic. On the other hand, if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole, it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. They will not be satisfied with us in power, and we will lack credibility. In some cases, we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they, at the same time, are both perpetrators and victims (e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the SPDC). It is not always possible to regard them as criminals. Therefore, both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. It is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. Prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term.</p>
<p>Third, in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. As I already mentioned, by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses, they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. Then, they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. By not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics, we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past.</p>
<p>Fourth, reparation also creates the justice for those who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. For instance, in Germany the government compensated the victims for their losses and damages and rehabilitated those who were physically or psychologically affected. Furthermore, the government helped the victims resettle in Israel. In Burma, there are a lot of losses and damages under the military rule for over forty years. Furthermore, there is a huge gap between peoples owing to past discriminations. We are responsible for those cases in the transitional period. Therefore, we will have to introduce some programs to rehabilitate those who were physically or psychologically affected besides compensations, as well as affirmative action programs for those who were discriminated against for various reasons in the past.</p>
<p>Finally, commemoration is also one of mechanisms for transitional justice in Burma. Accordingly, there is supposed to build museums or monuments to mark the events and commemorate the ceremonies of those whose lives were lost in the past. It also reminds people not to let similar cases happen again in future, reminding people to not let them happen again. For instance, in Germany the government built the museums and monuments to mark the Holocaust and to educate people in order to avoid such similar events in future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Revenge is not always a good solution to the political problems. Nobody is supposed to endeavor to obtain a political power for revenge, but for the country and people as a whole. It is spontaneous that human beings retaliate against one another for their grievances. However, we are supposed to take the interest of the whole country into account rather than our personal feelings. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela invited the military generals, who sent him to jail in the past, to his presidential inauguration ceremony. We have no doubt that he did it for the sake of his country and people irrespective of his personal feelings. Therefore, rather than looking at one side, we have to consider the needs from both sides with a view to the interest of the whole country and a good relation in the long term. We believe that scrutinizing the needs of both sides can increase mutual good understanding and lead to national reconciliation in future. It is important to find out the truth and create justice between the victims and the perpetrators during the transitional period. Without knowing or telling the truth, it is impossible to forgive the crimes committed in the past. Therefore, there is supposed to tell or know the truth so that the justice or national reconciliation can be created in future Burma.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/n/User_talk%7EAungthiha_6f55.html" title="Edit section: The Similarities and Differences between Burma and North Korea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>The Similarities and Differences between Burma and North Korea</b></span></h2>
<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Both Burma and North Korea are ruled by notorious authoritarian governments, none of whom were elected by the people. The world regards these counties as the world’s worst dictators. The people from both countries seem to be living in a hell. They both deny fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of movement and so on.</p>
<p>Even though North Korea has a few Chinese and ethnic Japanese, it has no ethnic conflicts or civil war, but Burma has been facing ongoing civil war or ethnic conflicts for many years. North Korea has a nearly double size of army soldiers in comparison with about 450,000 soldiers in Burma, but the military spending in Burma is much more than North Korea is. For instance, in Burma 40 % of national budget goes to the military, but in North Korea about 14 % of national budget goes to the military. Both countries use child soldiers, but North Korea officially or openly uses child soldiers in the army compared to Burma.</p>
<p>Even though Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in both countries were appointed, both of them continue to deny access to the Special Rapporteurs on the human rights situation. Systematic, widespread and serious violations of human rights are ongoing in both countries. For instance, both countries have no freedom of press. The presses in both countries are allowed to report about notorious governments’ daily agendas. People in both countries are not allowed to listen to international media broadcasts. If found, they face severe punishments, but it is more severe in North Korea.</p>
<p>The opposition groups in Burma have many more opportunities to carry out political movement in comparison with North Korea. Even though North Korea has opposition groups (for instance- Chondoist Chongu Party and Social Democratic Party), they are all under the control of Korean Workers’ Party or KWP which is the party of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Therefore, we can say that North Korea has no opposition groups compared to Burma.</p>
<p>North Korea has half the population in comparison with Burma. Even though Burma has a great number of populations, it has appropriate living standards compared to North Korea. However, both countries mismanage the country’s economy. They nationalize private industries, factories and companies (But now Burma allows private business). As a result, people in both countries live in very extreme poverty, especially in North Korea a great number of people are still facing widespread hunger today, which is worse than Burma is. Moreover, Burma doesn’t mainly depend on international aids as North Korea does. International humanitarian organizations are not freely allowed to have access to the people in need by both North Korea and Burma.</p>
<p>The life expectancy in North Korea is also as nearly same as Burma is, due to lack of proper health care and economic conditions in both countries.</p>
<p>Both North Korea and Burma faces the problems of refugees and internally displaced persons owing to the government repression and (famine, especially in North Korea). Thailand mainly faces the problems of migrant workers and refugees from Burma. On the other hand, the problems of refugees and migrant workers from North Korea affect South Korea and China. Those who are repatriated are also badly-treated by both countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sanctions are imposed on both of the countries by the US. The sanction imposed on Burma focuses on the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and democratic change. Whereas, the purpose of sanction imposed on North Korea is for primarly nuclear weapons. Both of the countries are still facing serious sanctions by western countries as well as the US. Especially, the world gives more attention on North Korea for owning weapons of mass destruction and supporting terrorist activity.</p>
<p>Both North Korea and Burma also face allegations of producing and exporting illicit heroin and methamphetamine. In particular, international communities give more attention on Burma regarding its producing and exporting the world’s second largest opium after Afghanistan. Now North Korea is also becoming a major player in the global trafficking of heroin.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Why did genocide happen in Rwanda?</p>
<p>In Rwanda, there are Tutsi minority and majority Hutus with an unequal relationship between them. That was because, during the colony of Belgium in Rwanda, Belgium took advantage of ethnic diversity and favored Tutsi minority with the purpose of retaining their powers during their colony of Rwanda, and trying to influence the country as a whole, even after granting independence.</p>
<p>An enmity between Hutus and Tutsi deteriorated, which led to the most notorious genocide against Tutsi minority nationwide in Rwanda. At least 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus had been brutally massacred and some two million Hutus fled to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). Hutus extremists deliberately carried out the plan of elimination against Tutsi minority. Some Tutsi fled to the neighboring countries and formed Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) to retaliate against the Hutus, and they launched a military campaign to take over Rwanda.</p>
<p>The propaganda coming from Radio Broadcasts made the Hutus extremists enthusiastic in killing more and more Tutsi minority. It was very easy for Hutus to doubt the propaganda about the genocide due to lack of intelligence officers who could find out and stop the wrong message. The UN and the US also failed to block the radios from releasing it. Therefore, genocide against Tutsi became worse and worse.</p>
<p>Even though the United Nations didn’t have any mandate to intervene in internal conflicts, it had got a genocide convention. So, the UN had responsibility to deter the genocide in Rwanda from happening. In fact, United Nations could not do anything with the genocide. To make the situation worse, most of UN peacekeepers were withdrawn from Rwanda after the deaths of 10 Belgian soldiers. At that time, there were only 2,500 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda. The only aids workers and diplomats left behind. I think the genocide happened more seriously owing to the fact that there was a lack of United Nations’ responsibility.</p>
<p>Moreover, 1994 genocide in Rwanda could not be stopped by the world’s countries as well because they did not want to be involved in stopping the genocide in Rwanda after learning lessons from Somalia’s case which caused the deaths of thousands of peacekeepers there. These countries felt afraid to send their troops to Rwanda, especially the US. Some countries didn’t show their interests as they thought it was not severe case. They also did not believe that it was so bad.</p>
<p>All in all, Rwanda is very poor and there was nothing which could be attracted to other countries. If the genocide took place in rich countries, I think it could have been stopped on time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/n/User_talk%7EAungthiha_6f55.html" title="Edit section: Strategies for Burmese Political Change?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Strategies for Burmese Political Change?</b></span></h2>
<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Regarding strategies for Burmese political change, first let me start by saying that armed struggles are also essential for the democratic movement and taking place in fundamental way in democratic movements. Therefore, we have to recognize it rather than being condemned as violence. I believe that it can fulfill one of the major roles in the arena of politics to bring a democracy and ethnic equality to Burma. Even though it uses different method or way to reach its ultimate goal, it has a lot in common with other non-violent democratic groups- a common ground- democracy and ethnic equality. The violent means is no longer popular after 11 September 2001, but it is still in need for political change in Burma. Therefore, we need various political strategies- not only non-violent movement but also armed resistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in relation to non-violent democratic oppositions, we can see a great number of opposition groups which are scattering inside and outside Burma. The more opposition groups are increased, the more qualities are decreased, of course. It doesn’t mean that each group cannot be capable of changing political situation in Burma. They are performing each of their roles as much as they possibly can. The point is that it would be great if they can be combined into a strong one so as to carry out democratic movement effectively against the military regime.</p>
<p>Therefore, first we are supposed to fight selfishness among our opposition groups. That is because some of the opposition groups are very strong and have good financial status. Such strong organizations are supposed to assist weak organizations financially or something else. We have no doubt that such strong organizations alone are not able to be capable of changing political situation in Burma. They have to collaborate with one another regardless of race, color, religion, and weak or strong. To achieve the ultimate goal of democracy and ethnic equality, in addition to building unity and mutual understanding among the different opposition groups, it is also important to isolate political vision from personal perspectives.</p>
<p>Moreover, on these days, civil movement in Burma can be carried out by word of mouth. Practically, it is still impossible to do so. That is because the military regime, which has already experienced 1988 people uprising and learned the consequence of it, has prepared well never to let it happen again. The opposition groups and civil societies inside Burma are under tight control. There are neither political rights nor civil rights inside Burma. The longer the military regime rules the country, people feel more frightened, as well.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances, how can we organize an effective civil movement in Burma? That is, there is no other way but for negotiation between the military regime and opposition groups. However, the regime does not seem to let it happen easily for several reasons. If the dialogue takes place, the regime will continue to perpetuate the lack of democratic transition by demanding impossible things although they realize that it is extremely impossible to gain their demands, but little progress is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, the serious sanctions which are being imposed by the western countries as well as US really affect the military regime. It can weaken the companies or business owned by the military regime, which also weakens the military circles. We, however, have to think of how to prevent ordinary people from being affected negatively by the sanction. For instance, the consequences of withdrawal of some foreign companies or businesses from Burma on account of international pressures cause joblessness to those who have been working at those work sites. In this situation, the international NGOs and UN are supposed to provide humanitarian assistances or vocational training for the sake of those who are out of work as well as the poor. By offering these assistances, it also strengthens the civil societies that are crucial to change political situation in Burma.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/n/User_talk%7EAungthiha_6f55.html" title="Edit section: Negative Influence of Television on Society">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Negative Influence of Television on Society</b></span></h2>
<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Television plays a negative role not only in social and political life, but also in the everyday life of individuals. It is harmful to our society by showing more and more sex and violence, ignoring the quality of the programs for the sake of commercial benefit, and taking away the biggest part of our free time.</p>
<p>First, violence and sex shown on television bring about the higher rate of crimes and encourages unfriendly behavior in our society. Especially, this is an evident in the USA and other western countries. For instance, many criminals confess that their violent actions or attitudes to women were encouraged by TV. The rate of such crimes is constantly growing and more and more often they are committed, especially by teenagers. They are vulnerable to the violence and sex which are attributed to TV. Therefore, Television’s influence on the younger generation can affect the future of our society negatively. This is also becoming a great problem in our society today.</p>
<p>Second, on these days television is greatly used for commercial purposes. Advertisers or businesspeople try to convince their audience that the solution to a problem or the fulfillment of a desire can only be achieved through the purchase of a product. Actually, the audiences persuaded by advertisements become interested in it even though they do not exactly know the quality of a product. It really makes the audience blind rather than choosing a proper product by their own. In this way TV negatively affects the human mind by limiting the possibilities of conscious choice, and promotes the consumers in society.</p>
<p>Third, many people today spend the biggest part of their free time watching television. According to the statistics, the average American child watches TV 26 hours per week. It really reduces the quality of their real lives by limiting the variety of free time activities, negatively affecting family relations by reducing conversation. It can even have an impact on health by discouraging exercises. For instance, television takes time away from play and exercise activities. As a result, children who watch a lot of television are less physically fit and more likely to eat high fat and high energy foods and become over-weight.</p>
<p>In conclusion, television is negatively changing not only the life of individuals but also the whole society. Therefore, people today are not supposed to follow the persuasion of television so as to avoid further possible impact on the whole society and themselves.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Everybody knows the taste of sightseeing, which makes people fresh and easy-going when they are tired of something. I am also one of those who enjoy seeing a beautiful and innocent view. It really makes me fresh and helps me get wonderful ideas any time I have difficulties with my new ideas. I strongly believe that the wonderful view can portray one’s life that is insignificant or paltry to be better.</p>
<p>The view from my window is very beautiful beyond description. One can be unconscious unless he/she is familiar with this view. A small village, in which just about 100 villagers live, is surrounded by different sizes of mountains. The mountains are there as if a huge beautiful woman with flowers is falling asleep. It is really amazing that colorful birds, which are singing beautiful songs, are flying around the sleeping woman as though they are not keeping her awake. The blue sky also looks like an umbrella that is preventing the sleeping woman from the dangers such as rain or the ray of the sun.</p>
<p>Then, a small stream, which lasts between the mountains and the village, is running very slowly and quietly from North to South. It looks like a snake that is absolutely starving and fighting for its bare stomach. Sometimes, I hear a sound coming form the stream as if someone is speaking to someone, and sometimes, as if someone is walking quietly.</p>
<p>Moreover, at a distance from the village, there is an enormous forest that is full of wild animals. Sometimes, I see some wild animals such as deer, tigers, and even elephants come and drink water in the stream. It is absolutely fascinating whenever I witness a fight between the tiger and deer near the stream. Meanwhile, actually I offer a pity to the less strong animals that are food for strong animals.</p>
<p>The view of sunset is the most exciting of all. I feel as if it is giving us homework for night regarding one-day lesson whenever the sun sets behind the mountains. It never says “Good Bye” to those whom it gives light. Those who receive light are also forgetting to say “Thanks” to the sun due to an amazing view of the evening.</p>
<p>Now you can imagine how attractive and beautiful view from my window is. I would like to recommend my view whenever you have difficulties with making your decision. I believe the “View From My Window “can offer you some new ideas or advice to make your decision effectively.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>In the 1950s, Burma was the most educated country in the South East Asia region. Burma won even two awards from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for promoting literacy in the 1970s. Today Burma is one of the least educated countries in the world. Burma’s 1996 Basic education Law and 1973 Union of Burma Education Law established the country’s current educational structure. These laws stated that primary education would be for five years, from Kindergarten to around age nine. Children eligible and able to continue beyond primary school can attend four years of middle school and two years of high school. Students who score the highest marks in mathematics, science, engineering and medicine and wish to attend an institute of advanced learning are eligible to take the government entrance examination. It is estimated that only three percent of all students who finish their primary or secondary schooling will go on to some form of tertiary education, whether a university, technical or vocational institute.</p>
<p>All schools at different levels are using old textbooks that were introduced in the 1960s to promote the socialist military ideology, even though the curriculum is changed every three year. According to 2002 report on education by ABSFU, the state curriculum encourages military might and ethnic prejudice, instead of encouraging students towards a peaceful and multiethnic nation. Students have to do homework for 4 or 5 hours every night. There are also different teachers for each subject. Actually, the students have to take exams to pass into the next grate. The exams take place three times a year- first exam, second exam and final exam. In Burma, the CAP system is also used to pass into next grade. It means that the students get automatically next grade even unless they do pass the final examination. Extreme religious practices at state schools force all students to practice Buddhist every morning, especially at primary school level. Ethnic minority languages are not allowed to be studied at state schools.</p>
<p>In particular, in Burma the teachers are mostly women. Most of the teachers are qualified. According to the military education research department’s 2002 statistics, 60,843 primary school teachers and 49,920 middle school teachers have no teacher training. Teachers must work for five years at school before they receive any formal teacher training; therefore, two thirds of Burma’s primary school teachers have no teacher training. They are directly appointed by the regime due to extreme shortage of teachers. Low salaries force qualified teachers to quit teaching. This situation downgrades the level of education system.</p>
<p>In Burma, the classroom atmosphere is formal. Every student has to stand up when the teachers enter the classroom. The students are not allowed to talk each other in class, and male and female students are separated. They are not allowed to sit together in the same desks. The teachers always give a favor to those who are rich or close to them. The education situation in Burma worsens because of extreme corruption amongst the teachers. The education system focuses on only money rather than on quality. The teachers in Burma enjoy giving punishment to the students. Moreover, students are not encouraged to participate in discussions, to offer their own knowledge, critical thinking and experiences. The students just have to listen and answer questions asked by the teachers. They have to memorize what they learn from the class lecture, and speak it out in class in the next day. The teachers do not want any complaints from the students about bad teaching methods. The students in Burma have to wear uniforms every weekday. Otherwise, they have to give a fine. There are hardly any sport activities at schools.</p>
<p>Education at primary level in theory has been free both under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) and the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Under Burma’s second constitution, promulgated in 1974, Article 52 states that every citizen shall have the right to an education and that such education shall be compulsory. In reality, primary education in Burma fails to provide a basic education for many of its people and is costly. Parents are required to pay significant costs for textbooks, paper, pens, etc.., a yearly contribution to the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) fund, as well as other contributions for school improvement. Sending one’s children to school can therefore impose economic hardship for most families in Burma. A UNICEF survey conducted in 1995 found that 39% of school age children have never attended primary school. This same survey found that 26% of the parents said they could not afford the cost. Shortages of everything in the field of education have heavily contributed to the downgrading of education in Burma. The lack of facilities such as the number of schools and qualified teachers, and the severe lack of practical resources reflect an official attitude which attaches little importance to the value of education and, further, perceives knowledge as a dangerous tool in the hand of the people.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a terrible educational system in Burma is leading to the collapse and downgrading of the education standards in future. It is central to the ongoing military rule. The military regime is responsible for the lost generations of children and youth in Burma.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>The law should include a method of causing death painlessly to end suffering form severe pain. It really affects the society financially or socially. Therefore, doctors should assist patients in committing a suicide for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that when a patient is hopeless to recover. In this situation, the doctor should assist the patient, whose disease is incurable or who is suffering from sever pain, in committing a suicide. It is unquestionable that the doctor does not want the patient to suffer from severe pain. Furthermore, in committing a suicide the patient does it by himself. The doctor does not kill the patient directly, giving a choice to the patient to commit a suicide. For example, a soldier who is suffering from severe injuries in the battle field does not want to live with a severe pain any more because he knows that he will be dead soon. In that time, the medic has to fulfill his desire that he wants to be dead instantly even though he loves the soldier very much. Therefore, it is spontaneous that the doctor assists the patient in committing a suicide when he finds out that the patient is hopeless to recovery.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the patient should be allowed to commit a suicide to prevent a lot of money from being cost. In order that we do not waste our money on medication for a patient who is hopeless to get better, the doctor should assist the patient in committing a suicide. As we know, the high cost of medication really affects the remaining family in negative way. For example, in Burma a TB patient, who lived in a big house next to mine, requested his family to give him a medication to death, but his parents refused to do so because they loved their son very much. His parents also told him that he would cure him until he got better, and that they did not care about how much money they cost. Actually, they spent a lot of money that was earned by selling a car and other furniture on his son. Unfortunately, his son was dead. The family faced a lot of debt after their son’s death. It really brings about financial crisis in the family. Therefore, the doctor should assist the patient in committing a suicide so as to save money when the patient was found hopeless to recover.</p>
<p>On the whole, the doctor should assist the patients who are hopeless to recover in committing a suicide in order to relieve severe pain and to save money. Therefore, I think the law also should include it to be legal.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Most people enjoy traveling in their free time, so they choose to make an enjoyable trip to amazing and fascinating places. Hawaii and Alaska are amongst them. People like traveling to Hawaii more than to Alaska. Why do people like traveling to Hawaii more than Alaska?</p>
<p>In Hawaii there is a wide variety of excellent restaurants. We can order and eat whatever we want at the restaurants. Food is good in quality and cheap, which even the poor can afford food. In Alaska, however, the food is poor and expensive. Furthermore, there are beautiful Volcano National Park and Waimea Canyon in Hawaii, but there isn’t any beautiful Volcano National Park in Alaska. Especially, the travelers like going to Hawaii as they enjoy sightseeing in the park and sitting on the fresh and green grass with their sweethearts. They forget even their homes while they are in beautiful and attractive park with a variety of flowers.</p>
<p>Hotels in Hawaii are different from hotels in Alaska because hotels in Hawaii are more excellent and cheaper in comparison with hotels in Alaska. Hotels in Alaska are expensive, and their quality is generally poor. In Hawaii, there is also a wide range of excellent hotels, from luxury to budget priced. In hotels, rooms as well as beds are tidy, clean and full of fragrance.</p>
<p>Most people travel to Alaska by cruise ship, while most people fly to Hawaii by jumbo jet. In Hawaii tourists enjoy renting cars and going around the country because rental cars are cheap and convenient, but in Alaska it is impractical to rent a car because the distance is too great. In Hawaii the streets in the city are smooth and less crowded. Furthermore, the tourists also enjoy flying from one place to another.</p>
<p>The temperature is perfect in Alaska during the summer, but it is very hot in Hawaii in the summer. Furthermore, in Hawaii it is terribly humid in the summer; on the other hand, there is no humidity in Alaska during the summer. In Alaska it seldom rains during the summer; yet it often rains during the summer in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Oceans and rivers in Hawaii are clean and unpolluted just as in Alaska. Moreover, both states have no air pollution. That is why people like traveling to those countries to breathe fresh and clean air. Tourists like swimming in clean and unpolluted rivers as well.</p>
<p>Finally, the beaches in Hawaii are among the most beautiful in the world. Most of the travelers like to go to the beautiful beaches to swim and to take a sunbath. There are also a lot of beautiful and colorful birds flying over the ocean and rivers, and the evening beauty also attracts the tourists to keep staying in Hawaii, which is beyond description. In Alaska, however, there are the Chugach Mountains and Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North America, and the glaciers are awesome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both states have different attractions and views; on the other hand, Hawaii is one of the most attractive places in the world, and most people like traveling there in their free time with their family, friends and heart sweets to relax. On the whole, Hawaii is the best place for all of us if we have any plan to make an enjoyable trip in future compared to Alaska.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Welcome!!!</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>A. Attention Getter</b></p>
<p>-In the 1950s, Burma was the most educated country in the South East Asia region. Burma won even two awards from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for promoting literacy in the 1970s. Today Burma is one of the least educated countries in the world.</p>

<hr />
<p><br />
<b>1. Factors that bring about education crisis in Burma</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>I. Increased and Expensive Education Fees</b></p>
<p>In Burma, most of the people are living in extreme poverty, so they cannot afford to send their children to school as they have to pay:</p>
<p>- Cost for education facilities such as textbooks, paper, pens etc. - A yearly contribution to the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) fund. - Other contributions for school improvement. - Cost for private tuition classes - Cost for School uniforms - Various taxes</p>
<p>According to various studies by UNICEF, UNDP, and other NGOs, increased and expensive education fees in Burma is one of the major problems for children and their parents.</p>
<p>According to UNICEF’s 1995 survey,</p>
<ul>
<li>3 out of 10 children never even start a school</li>
<li>26% of parents cannot afford the cost of primary schooling for their children.</li>
<li>40% of school aged children have never attended primary school.</li>
<li>60% of those who do start school are unable to finish at the primary level</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly, these problems are faced in rural or conflict areas. According to a 2002 report released by Images Asia, “Of the 750,000 children drop out of primary school each year, 630,000 are students from rural or conflict areas.</p>
<p><br />
<b>II. Inadequate educational resources, facilities and schools</b></p>
<p>- According to the US Department of State, the military spending on education is less than 1% of its national budget (while military spending is 40 %.).</p>
<p>- In some places there is only one primary school for five villages. (UNICEF)</p>
<p>- According to Images Asia report, there are fewer than 1,600 high schools in the country.</p>
<p>- Very few schools compared to its population about 60 millions in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>- Most of these schools are overcrowded and lack basic materials for all the students. (Images Asia) However, schools run by the military regime have more funding, better facilities and good educational programs, in comparison with the schools in ethnic minority areas which have the least government support.</p>
<p>In some areas, students have to walk to school for many hours, or walk from a village to another. This situation makes students uncomfortable to continue their education in future.</p>
<p><br />
<b>III. Lack of Proper Teaching Methods, Curriculums, Ethnic Minority Rights, and Proper Religious Practice</b></p>
<p>- All schools at different levels are using old textbooks that were introduced in the 1960s to promote the socialist military ideology. (ABFSU- Burmese student organization)</p>
<p>- According to 2002 report on education by ABSFU, the state curriculum encourages military might and ethnic prejudice, instead of encouraging students towards a peaceful and multiethnic nation.</p>
<p>- Students are not encouraged to participate in discussions, to offer their own knowledge, critical thinking and experiences.</p>
<p>- Extreme religious practices at state schools, forcing all students to practice Buddhist every morning, especially at primary school level.</p>
<p>- Ethnic minority languages are not allowed to study at state schools.</p>
<p><br />
<b>IV. Lack of Qualified Teachers:</b></p>
<p>- According to the military education research department’s 2002 statistics, 60,843 primary school teachers and 49,920 middle school teachers have no teacher training.</p>
<p>- Teachers must work for five years at school before they receive any formal teacher training; therefore, two thirds of Burma’s primary school teachers have no teacher training. (UNICEF)</p>
<p>- They are directly appointed by the regime due to extreme shortage of teachers.</p>
<p>- Low salaries force qualified teachers to quit teaching. (Burma Project)</p>
<p>This situation downgrades the level of education system. Therefore, some students do not want to continue their education with unqualified teachers.</p>
<p><br />
<b>V. Hardship of School Teachers or Financial Crisis</b></p>
<p>According to former professor May Nyein who recently fled to Thailand due to general crises inside Burma,</p>
<p>- Today, an ordinary family (consisted of 5 family members) inside Burma needs at least 100,000 kyat per month to survive, probably need more money depending on how big your family is.</p>
<p>- High school teachers in Burma earn only 6,500- 8,000 Kyat per month, 5,000-6,500 Kyat for middle school teachers and 3,500 Kyat for primary school teacher. Some teachers earn on average 1,500 Kyat per month, which is not enough to survive.</p>
<p>This situation forces teachers to run private classes after school hours to get extra money. Teaching methods in private tuition classes are very different from ones in government school. For example, teachers leave out intentionally important information from the class lectures in order to persuade students to attend their private tuition classes if they want to pass the exam or get higher quality of education.</p>
<p>She also mentioned that high school students, who want to pass exams or get higher quality of education, have to pay 50,000 kyat per month for their tuition fees. It is impossible for poor students to afford the cost for the tuition classes. This situation makes them fail exams or leave the school or let them continue to study with lower quality of education at school.</p>
<p><br />
<b>VI. Discrimination and Restriction on Education:</b></p>
<p>- Colleges and universities run by military regime inside the country (See-Appendex-1) have much better quality of education than other regional schools do.</p>
<p>- A strict system of application to the military schools, which includes a mandatory recommendation from various government officials.</p>
<p>- The applicants must also promise not to involve in politics, and pledge to serve in the army.</p>
<p>- Restricting or denying access to education even at regional schools for those who have politically active family members. (For example, when the regime finds out that we are children of politicians or armed groups)</p>
<p>-The regime also favors or provides well those who are loyal to the army (e.g military-backed organization USDA) or their children over those who are able in academics.</p>
<p>For instance, they provide them with stipends, scholarships, and give them chances to go abroad. It is evidence that in July, 2005, 10 USDA members including students and teachers had a chance to go to Japan in terms of International Youth Development Exchange Program.</p>
<p><br />
<b>VII. Corruption in education:</b></p>
<p>-According to Transparency International, Burma is one of the five (now second?) countries that commit corruption.</p>
<p>- The education situation in Burma worsens because of extreme corruption.</p>
<p>- The education system focuses on only money rather than on quality.</p>
<p>For example, recently education minister U Than Aung, who is very closed to Gen.Than Shwe, was removed from his position. That is because there are 275 students who get distinctions (which means high marks) including 33 students who get distinction in all of subjects in only one high school (Dagon) in Rangoon, which has never happened before. We can imagine how much education officials make corruptions in education.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2. How is education crisis in Burma being dealt with?</b></p>
<p>- In some areas inside Burma, communities cooperate to build their own schools, and parents contribute to pay teachers a small salary or else provide them with basic food and accommodation.</p>
<p>- In border areas, some opposition groups established their own schools; however these schools almost always suffer from a lack of funding and other resources. (Images Asia)</p>
<p>- Dr Thein Lwin from Teacher Training for Burmese Teacher Program-(TTBTP) and other volunteers are carrying out teacher trainings for those who are from refugee camps and opposition controlled areas.</p>
<p>- NHEC performs teacher trainings for those who are from refugee camps and opposition groups. It is also carrying out a draft of proper Burmese curriculum for future Burma.</p>
<p>- UNICEF has been supporting assistance programs including basic education program to improve the lives of children, young people and women in Burma for many years, especially in conflict areas or poorest areas.</p>
<p><br />
<b>3. Recommendation &amp; Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>The education crisis in Burma is central to the military rule. The military regime is responsible for the lost generations of children and youth in Burma. Therefore, the international communities including us are supposed to redouble our efforts to bring democracy to the country Burma. Therefore, we should keep more pressure on military regime to:</p>
<p>- Allocate sufficient funds to education throughout the country, including towards schools in rural, ethnic areas.</p>
<p>-Increase teachers' salaries</p>
<p>-Address the issue of poor teaching, learning, and assessment methods through adequately funding and upgrading teacher-training colleges</p>
<p>-Eliminate corruption and discrimination in education</p>
<p>-Establish more schools, in particular in rural areas</p>
<p>We also need to promote education programs in the refugee camps and other opposition controlled areas as much as we can in order to crate pretty future Burma.</p>
<p>According to Aung San Suu Kyi "A good education system is necessary for the long-term development of a country and we all are responsible to work for the improvement of the education system."</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Opinion</li>
</ul>
<p>The aggressive policy of the US has made the situations of some of the world’s countries involved worse and worse. Some thoughts come to my mind in relation to whether the US is really willing to eliminate communism or terrorism or dictatorship, or nuclear weapons in the world. Whenever I think about it, it really gives me a headache. What I can say is that the involvement of the US in other countries is mainly based on its self-interest. (Indonesia? Good Kurds and bad Kurds from Turkey and Iraq?) The US policy is always changing depending on its benefits. The policy always favors the country which they thinks it is more beneficial for them compared to another one. Therefore, the US is supposed to reconsider such vicious policy based on its self-interest. It is unquestionable that the US is willing to engage more war rather than constructive approaches.</p>
<p>Among them, North Korea is also one of the countries affected by the US policy. North Korea, which feels alone among the world’s communities, has been thinking about its national security concern. That is why it has been producing nuclear weapons as much as they possibly can to protect its country from the attack by other countries, especially by the US. It may have never hesitated to carry out a war against the US if it is declared. It is clear that preparing nuclear weapons in the country is mainly central to the security threat by the US.</p>
<p>The six-way talks, which include North and South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the USA, are intended to persuade North Korea to discontinue producing nuclear weapons. In fact, North Korea cannot be persuaded to stop its nuclear weapons by this way. It is not a good solution for North Korea. In my opinion, it will never be successful even if the process is continuing, or it will take a long time.</p>
<p>The more the US forces North Korea to discontinue nuclear weapons, the more nuclear weapons will be produced in the country, which can make the world as a whole harmful. Therefore, the US is supposed to reconsider its current policy and use “Sunshine Policy” toward North Korea. For instance, the US ought to work out nuclear problem in North Korea through humanitarian assistance as well as infrastructures. The US also should use the policy of “Stick and Carrot” on North Korea, but the stick always shouldn’t be used. It is transparent that if the US shows the stick, North Korea will also do so. As a result, the situation will deteriorate besides the producing nuclear weapons will not end. The best way is to show the carrot to North Korea and persuade it steadily or slowly to enter a mould of the US as South Korea does.</p>
<p>All in all, even though the victory gained by using a violent means on a country is politically successful for a while, both sides can suffer the consequences of violence for a long time. For instance, in Iraq Sudden Hussein could be overthrown in a very short period, but both sides including innocent civilians inside the country are still undergoing the consequences of violence till today. Also, the circle of revenge will not end. The US should have leant this lesson.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>In my personal life, especially, I deal well with the different kinds of people coming from drifferent backgrounds, regardless of religions, races, color and so on. Actually, I do not discriminate against such people. All of us know, nobody is perfect ones but each person may have a good qualification. Therefore, people are very different from one another, different point of views, different thinking and different qualification or skills. If we all have the same qualifications, there would not have gaps between people in the world. All people in the world would have been the poor or the rich something like this. I never look down on those who are not the same like me. I help such people as much as possibly I can, not hoping feedbacks from them.</p>
<p>To be honest, I look at people as human beings, not looking at them discriminatelty- like Karen, Kaya, Kachin, Chin, Mon, Burman, Rakhing, Shan, and so on. If one of these ethnic people (Burman or Karen) makes mistakes, it will depend on him or her individually or personally, but not on races. I try to explain and advise those who discriminate against others so that they can acept my point of view. But I do not force them to accept mine. I do not feel angry with them unless they reject my point of view. They have rights to do so, as well. In particular, I suggest them by constructive means rather than blaming.</p>
<p>Especially, I always think about the words I plan to say to others at first- sould I say it or not. I am really afraid that my wo0rds will make someone angry. If mty words cause someone to be angry or paintful by accident, I feel really sorry for my mistakes. I never hesitate to apologize for mine. Meanwhile, I learn from the mistakes very carefully so that similar mistakes cannot occur again.</p>
<p>In regard with the relagion, I am a Buddhist but I believe in respective religions and respect them. I am not one of the religious extremists. When my friends who are Christians call me to go to the Churches, I come along with them. In addition, I try to get to know every religion. As a result, I become aware of the peace of religions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in my personal life, I see all people the same and do not deal with people discriminately. I believe in respective religions even though I am buddhist.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/n/User_talk%7EAungthiha_6f55.html" title="Edit section: Men and Women">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Men and Women</b></span></h2>
<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>1. Men are better drivers than women</p>
<p>Especially, I think it depends on traditions and assumption accepted in different countries. We cannot say exactly that men are better drivers than women. It is unquestionable that in some countries men are worse drivers than women.</p>
<p>For instance, in Burma according to the unfold tradition, women are limited and seen differently from men by their parents who really believe in ancient assumption. They may think driving cars is dangerous for women, and it is not their job, and women have to work inside the house. My understanding on this, I do not think women are given a good opportunity to do so in this situation. The parents may be concerned about their daughters who are not as strong enough as men. The law also does not ban women from driving cars. The most possible thing is, men have access to better driving cars than women because of above reasons. As a result, women become worse drivers than men in Burma.</p>
<p>2. Women are more faithful to their partners in a relationship</p>
<p>In this situation, I would like to mention some and all concerning above issue. Even though some women are more faithful to their partners in a relationship, some are more disloyal to their partners. Sometimes men are more faithful to their partners than women. It depends on individual. Especially, I have no reasons to refuse a point of view that women are more faithful to their partners. It may be true partly, but not for all.</p>
<p>In a marriage, a couple with some children, a woman may start to break the marriage, or a man may do so. Usually, as a women, she may think deeply about that whether she should do it or not, because, for example the bodies of women are usually changed after getting married or delivering babies, unlike men. She may think that another marriage cannot be joined because of lack of beauty. She may be also afraid of being left with the children by her husband who is selfish or inhuman, and so she may be concerned about her future with children to survive. Usually men may behave these similar ways on women. This is my opinion in this issue. I do not mean that men enjoy doing so, but just introducing the most possible things relation to this issue. But I would like to say the words "it is possible" that men are usually more disloyal to their partners in the relationship.</p>
<p>3. Girls are usually mature more quickly than boys</p>
<p>In this issue, some thoughts come into my mind. It might be true according to the above title, but some boys mature more quickly than girls. Some are mature more slowly than girls. In my opinion, it mainly depends on experiences each girl and boy had overcome in the past. Some might have grown up in places which consist of full of fears or those who treat others discriminately, which makes them less mature and makes them live separately from others. Some might have grown up in places with full of happiness, encouragement, and strong support from neighbors, which makes them more mature and give them more strength to cooperate with others. Therefore, rather than saying that girls are mature more quickly than boys, or boys are mature more slowly than girls. I think we'd better try to get to know experiences of each boy and girl has had in the past. At the same time, we need to find ways how to help next generations be mature more quickly.</p>
<p>4. Women are less efficient if they work in business because they are too emotional</p>
<p>Men and women may have different skills or qualifications. According to the different skills or qualifications that men and women have, we can see their different efficiency in each of their work. All of us know, in business some men are capable of doing some work, but some women are incapable of doing it. Sometimes, some work mainly depends on physical situation between men and women. Especially men are naturally stronger than women, which makes women less efficient in business.</p>
<p>It is not always easy to accept that "women are less efficient if they work in business because they are too emotional." Not only women but also men might be the same in this situation. Particularly, one problem is that we cannot see women's motion whether they are too emotional or not while they are working in business. In my point of view, I think it usually depends on individuals.</p>
<p>5. Men and women are born with exactly the same natural abilities</p>
<p>I disagree with this issue "Men and women are born with exactly the same natural abilities" because women have natural abilities that men cannot have, and men have different natural abilities that women cannot have. For instance, women can have pregnant and deliver babies. Women have breasts to feed their babies, but men do not. Especially women can create human beings, but it cannot be without men. This is also men's different natural abilities from women. Moreover, men are naturally stronger than women are. Sometimes, men can carry things that women cannot do as natural gives women very soft body. There are different abilities between men and women, which come together since each of then is born.</p>
<p>6. Women are taught by society and culture to be weaker than men</p>
<p>It is unquestionable that women are taught by society and culture to be weaker than men. Especially women have been studying the lessons taught by society and culture for centuries, some even until now. The women who are portrayed by society and culture find themselves inequality in comparison with men and feel they are weaker than men. According to society and culture, women must behave more politely than men. If women are badly-behaved, the society in which they live usually regards them as bad women or sex workers.</p>
<p>In Burma, men have access to higher education than women. The parents think men are more important than women, and men have to look after their families. Therefore, men need to have qualifications to do work for their families. Women need not to be educated any more. Women have to do the housework-as such cleaning, washing, cooking, and ironing. Women are not allowed to go outside alone. These come from unfolded society and culture, which is difficult to be changed very easily.</p>
<p>7. Laws limited women's power because nature gave women more power than men</p>
<p>I do not agree with that. Generally women have less power than men, the power that the nature gave to women may be to have pregnant and deliver babies, which is more than men. In fact, women have no power at all. In most countries, women are not only limited but also banned in involving in politics, social affairs and religions. It is obvious that women have power than men.</p>
<p>8. Men have difficulty expressing their emotions except when playing team sports; ex: their team scores a football goal</p>
<p>Men usually do not express or show their emotions to others except playing team sports. Especially, men keep their emotions or feelings in their mind even though they would like to express them to their friends or families. They do not want to let other people know their feelings or emotions. It is too difficult to explain why. On the other hand, women are too easy to express their emotions or feelings to others. If they want to cry or laugh, they just do it instantly, whoever is in front of them. Some men have no difficulty to express their emotions or feelings. But mostly men have difficulty to express their emotion or feelings, but when playing team sports.</p>
<p>9. If more women were in positions of power, there would be fewer wars in the world</p>
<p>I do not seem to accept it because it is depending on both of men and women being in positions of power. Both of men and women are human beings. Men or women, whoever, can create wars in the world. Especially both of them need to realize each of their positions. The huge wars used to take place in the past because of not only men but also women. In this situation, if fewer women were in positions of power, there could be more wars in the world. It is unquestionable that men usually create wars, and if more men are in positions of power, I am sure there would be more wars in the world.</p>
<p>10. Women take care of their appearance more than men do</p>
<p>Definitely, men take care of their appearance less than women do. Women love beauty. They are always satisfied with themselves unless they are ugly. Sometimes they want to cry if they do not own special beauty. They want an attention from men. Therefore, they spend more time sitting in front of the mirror and trying to increase their beauty very patiently. Sometimes even in the towns or markets women are looking at the mirror and thinking about the ways of styles that can be attractive to the opposite sex.</p>

<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Hitler is an absolute dictator of Germany and self-appointed commander of its military. During the World War 2 he conquered the largest part of Europe, Asia, and Africa by using a single armed force. As a result, 55 millions people, most of whom were Jews, died. This event made the world shake. It was unbelievable event for me.</p>
<p>Hitler was born in Austria on April 20, 1889. He did not pass even High School Grade. When he was young, his heart was very soft. But when he grew up, I found that his heart was rough enough. The hobbies that he had really got when he was young and the cruel action that was carried out when he became an adult polarized. Hitler used to serve in World War 1 as a corporal in 1914. He never advanced beyond the rank of corporal. It was absolutely amazing for me why he become the leader of Germany.</p>
<p>He joined the German's Workers party in 1919 after the war was ended, and he assumed his leadership. Then he changed its name to the National socialist German Workers Party (Nazis). Hitler increased the Nazis Party membership and conspired with local military units to seize control of Bavaria. He was arrested in 1923, and the Bavaria government gave nine months imprisonment for incitement to murder, attempted revolution and the robbing of a bank by his followers. His sentence was very lenient. When he was in jail, he also wrote a book about "My struggle". The book was very popular, and it also could make him popular amongst the German people.</p>
<p>He had very good ability at public-speaking. He was a powerful speaker. His speeches attracted German people to enter his design. He became the chancellor of Germany through an election of 1932. Hitler was accepted by the German nation as a whole by some reasons of his popular leadership in Nazis Party, the legacy of the first World War, economics and social circumstances, the terms of Versailles, the strategies of the Nazis Party, the impact of the Wall Street Crash, short-term Nazis propaganda in the context of social and economic distress and back-stairs political intrigue and ambition. Some important right-wing leaders, such as Goering, Himmler, jointed Hetler's party in different point of views.</p>
<p>Economic circumstance was also one of the factors for Hitler to come to power in the country German. After World War 1, Hitler faced a great economic crisis. Economic recovery in order to rearm was Hitler's priority.</p>
<p>Hitler began to carry out his policy on Jews into practice as soon as he became Chancellor in 1933. The policies created by Hitler were meaningless. For Jews, life in Nazi Germany was very different. Jewish synagogues were destroyed, and Jews were systematically excluded from every day life. The Jews had been denied citizenship, education, health, confiscation of their property and so on. The violence and forced deportation also became the main target on Jews. It was a heartless action to exterminate innocent Jews by accusing them of being communists and carriers of Bolshevism and the propaganda that the Jews had undermined thousand-year-old cultures, and their influence would bring about crime, corruption and chaos. But the propaganda was powerful and made German people infuriated with Jewish people, which led to extermination of Jews.</p>
<p>This propaganda was groundless. It was unquestionable that German people were influenced by groundless propaganda released by Nazis officials. For instance, the propaganda made by Himmler saying "if we don't do it to them, they will do it to us". It could persuade German people and his followers to enter his plan of eliminating Jews. That was why they believed and accepted the plan of extermination of Jews by Nazis. As a result, millions of innocent Jewish people lost their lives, and also their cultural heritages were destroyed by Nazis, owing to the propaganda.</p>
<p>This tragedy strongly warns us to identify very carefully the propaganda appearing in our societies or countries and to consider whether we should accept it or not. The propaganda can spread like a wild fire and can change the world as a whole.</p>
<p>In 1936, Hitler began his offensive to return glory and land to Germany by occupying the Rhineland, and 2 years later he invaded his native Austria and took over the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. When Hitler invaded the rest of Czech, he finally violated the Versailles Treaty without being able to claim that he was uniting German speaking people. This time the invading army was watched by a silent crowd, and Hitler was finally confirmed by both German and the rest of Europe as an imperialist.</p>
<p>When German troops entered Austria on 15 April 1938, the majority of Austria who had suffered as a result of the Versailles settlement welcomed German troops. Hitler wanted to reunite all German speaking people form Austria. The Jews in Austria were made scapegoats and given unpleasant tasks to humiliate them. This resulted in mass exodus of Jews from Austria, after the Strom Troopers had robbed most of their money from them.</p>
<p>Britain singed a Grand Alliance with Poland. In that time Hitler's hopes were gone. Therefore he then changed his policy and sent Ribbentrop to the USSR and signed a non-aggression agreement with the USSR which was ideological enemy of Hitler.</p>
<p>In 1939, he invaded Poland. In Poland the country was divided into four. Three regions were for Germany and one was for Russia. And then Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. This was the time that Second World War had begun. In 1940, Hitler occupied Scandinavia, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, the following year; he took over Greece and Yugoslavia. In 1941, he broke a non-aggression agreement with Russia and invaded Russia. At about the same time, after Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor, Hitler declared war on the United States.</p>
<p>Hitler realized that he did not have strength to sustain fronts against both the Soviet to the east and the Americans and other Allies to the west. He made the situation worse. However, he carried on to deploy trains, men, and supplies, in great demand at the front, to transport Jews and other undesirables, including political opponents, Gypsies, homosexuals, and the physically and mentally disabled, to the gas chambers and crematoriums. Hitler, 56, committed suicide on April 30, 1945.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/n/User_talk%7EAungthiha_6f55.html" title="Edit section: How To Solve Economic Crisis in Burma">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>How To Solve Economic Crisis in Burma</b></span></h2>
<p><i><b>By Aung Thiha</b></i></p>
<p>Economics is a study or a system of how human beings behave in financial matters, and of production and distribution of goods and services to the people in accordance with their needs and desires. The higher living standards amongst the people are chiefly subject to the better economics policy geographically relevant to entire country needs to be adopted, as well.</p>
<p>Nowadays, as far as we know, the main economics problems that our country is facing are unemployment, inflation, lack of economists and techniques. The military government cannot give enough jobs to its citizens. Moreover, the prices of commodities are terribly high. Even though economic sanctions have been imposed by western countries, especially USA targeting the military dictatorship, in reality only citizens have to suffer. There has been increasing poverty among the citizens. Withdrawing most foreign companies and investments from Burma also brings about the joblessness for the citizens. As a result, more and more Burmese people have been leaving their hometowns and working in neighboring countries- such as Thailand, India, and Indonesia and others.</p>
<p>The military government does not care about western economics sanction any more, because the military generals are working closely with neighboring countries by boosting border trades, especially with Thailand, India, China and Japan. SPDC doesn't try to solve any problems. They are just trying to retain their political power rather than changing economic policy in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>We think that a solution to these problems mainly depends on better economic management. In addition to this, economic development is related to the stability of politics in our country, as well. We cannot distinguish civil unrest and economic status. In the developed countries, there is no almost civil unrest and insurgency because of stable economy. People in those countries have higher living standard. All of us know, Burma is one of the poorest countries in the world even though there are lots of natural and human resources. Why? That is due to the mismanagement of economy by the Burmese military generals. Whenever an economic crisis occurs within the country, the military generals do not handle the problems properly; for instance 1987's demonetization of three currencies. Therefore, the symmetrical economic development of the country as a whole is chiefly central to the political stability, better economic management and social status within the country.</p>
<p>We are not good enough at solving economic problems. We are not economists at all, but some ideas come to our mind in regards with these problems. Firstly, free market economy system is the best one to tackle these problems. With this system, the military government ought to establish cooperative, private and national sectors. The state will have to intervene in some cases if necessary. For instance, according to market economy, if the company that exports agriculture products such as sesame, pigeon pea and so on will import Beer, cigarette and insecticide for farmers, the role of agriculture products will be declined instantly. In this case, the government has to ask the company to pay higher taxes for beer and cigarette which is harmful to the people and encourage this company to give more attention to provide agriculture facilities for the farmers. One of the important things is that the military generals should reduce its military expense as they are spending 40-50% of its national budgets on it.</p>
<p>Secondly, most of the businessmen like brokers collect and keep fundamental food supplies- such as cooking oil, rice or paddy in their warehouses with the hope of getting better prices from the consumers. As a result, the prices of commodity are rising up sharply. Though the rich can afford to purchase these fundamental food supplies at any prices what the brokers demand, it is impossible for the poor to buy these goods, of course. So, in this situation, the government needs to address these problems by selling these fundamental food supplies through cooperatives at cheaper prices. The government makes sure that they have saved adequate food supplies, as well. I think that this is the only way to prevent the rise of commodity prices from occurring and to reduce the tremendous gap between the poor and the rich in the country.</p>
<p>Finally, the government should invite and accept foreign investments, economists so as to gain not only economic techniques but also jobs for the country. Meanwhile, the role of industrialization has to be promoted not only in urban areas but also rural areas. If there is a development in urban areas alone, but lack of development in rural areas, the society can not be stable. Thus, the government ought to focus on the effort to perform an appropriate development in rural areas -for instance, establishing small factories and so on with the help of foreign assistances. Whereas, if the government relies on only foreign assistances, the economy of the country cannot be independent at all. Therefore, the government's economic development plan should also depend on domestic economic sectors or homemade products.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the symmetrical economic development of the country as a whole is chiefly central to the political stability, better economic management and social status within our country.</p>
