<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some issues</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I have a couple issues with the AWB. I know editors are supposed to be responsible for all their edits, but they often don’t check as carefully as they should, so maybe you could make tweaks to the engine to avoid some common problems?</p>
<p>First off, AWB tends to move {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELink_FA_7fbb.html" title="Template:Link FA">LinkFA</a>}} above the “other language” links. While that’s appropriate for most templates, the usage notes for {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELink_FA_7fbb.html" title="Template:Link FA">LinkFA</a>}} explicitly say it is to be inserted <i>after</i> the appropriate interlanguage link. Can you program AWB to ignore {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELink_FA_7fbb.html" title="Template:Link FA">LinkFA</a>}}?</p>
<p>That’s the big one. On a smaller, more personal level:<br />
I’ve taken to inserting two commented out notices, &lt;!--Categories--&gt; and &lt;!--Other languages--&gt;, to help with organization. Sort of like invisible section headers. The AWB automatically moves them, completely defeating their purpose. Can you get it to either ignore or delete them? That is to say, I would love for it to ignore them, but I also don’t have a problem with it deleting them, since at the moment it’s something of a personal conceit and I’m sure there are users who dislike the idea. So, ignore or delete, either way, it’s just annoying to have them moved and thereby messed up.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 20:30, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Concerning your second point, the comments, all AWB does is look for links of the form [[Category:...]] and [[xx:...]] where it has a predefined list of every language. It then alphabetizes (upon request) and puts them in the correct place, at the bottom. Since the commented sections do not meet these criteria, they are not moved by the AWB - rather, they are just left behind. It would be impossible to create a searcher that looks for all possible instances of such "header" comments and move them accordingly - all scripts would create lots of false positives. For example, on this page, it would move parts of your comment to the bottom thinking them headers. Hence, it is easiest just not to use such comments. Deleting, as said earlier, would also create too many false positives.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Going back to your first point, I just went to a random article on my watchlist, <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>. The very bottom is organized this way:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
{{featured article}}

[[Category:...]]

{{Link FA|xx}}

[[xx:...]]

<dd>I don't know why that article does not follow the usage notes; my guess is that the usage notes and common practice are at odds with each other, so I don't know what to do. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a> 21:02, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be possible to match comments like &lt;!--Categories--&gt; and &lt;!--Other languages--&gt; sometimes, but not every variation on phrasing. I'll look into it. As for the placement of the LinkFAs, when I wrote that I must have read somewhere that the way AWB does it is the proper way, and I can't actually find an article that does it any other way, so to change what is common practice would probably not be wise. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 21:09, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, at the moment I’m the only one who uses that, and there are no variations, just those two exact headings. Don’t worry about it too much, though, like I said, I’m( currently) the only on who uses it. I think it’s useful in terms of page composition and guiding new users, but while it <i>would</i> be quite nice to have it left alone by the AWB, it’s a pretty personal thing. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 21:21, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Ah, I see. It looked in the diffs like they were being moved up, rather than the language tags moved down, but I know diffs don’t quite reflect what was actually done. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 21:21, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I typed out some really long paragraph which, due to an edit conflict and me closing the window before noticing it, didn't get saved. Anyways, I said in brief that I've seen articles with lots of comments that break the categories into many sections, for example, &lt;!--career categories--&gt; and &lt;!--religious categories--&gt; on bios, and searching for &lt;!--.*?[Cc]ategor(y|ies).*?--&gt; would yield far too many false positives. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">save if it contains</span></h2>
<p>is it possible for you to add a feature under the first tab for 'skip if it contains...' that wouldn't stop on it but kept it on the list? maybe a 'save if it contains...'</p>
<p>the reason i ask is for a misspelling like 'occured', there are almost 400 articles listed. however, when reviewed only a minority actually contain the misspelling - people or another bot corrected them since google has chached it. thus most of the time i'm waiting for an article to actually pop up with the misspelling legitimately, and not correcting like i should be doing.</p>
<p>is it possible to do this? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 00:35, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Today I went though the misspelling 'offical'. There was a googled list of hundreds with AWB, but since google caches older versions of already corrected spellings (say i did this same check last week) most of it was bumpkis. I have a setting that will "skip if it doesn't contain 'offical'", which parses the list for me to correct (about an hour, depending). But if there was a "save if it contains 'offical'", then I could come back to the computer after it parses the list to have a <i>real</i> list to look at each spelling mistake, instead of having it mostly full of fodder. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 18:23, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What's annoying is that removing the extra line is clearly bad, because it makes it far harder to compare diffs, and doesn't make any difference at all to the way the article displays. I don't think AWB should be used to foist one person's preference on all articles it's used on, particularly when these changes have negative side-effects and no real positive effects, and I would really strongly urge you to revise AWB so that it doesn't do this. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:11, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like this feature removed as well:
<ul>
<li>It seems to contradict the advice given on the AutoWikiBrowser page under "Rules of use":
<dl>
<dd>Avoid making extremely minor edits such as adding or removing a single space or replacing an underscore in a template call with a space.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>It can cause history comparisons to show whole blocks of text as deleted and then re-inserted, which makes it difficult to check if any other change has been made to the text. This may not be relevant to the AWB edit, (if all it has done is house keeping), but it makes it difficult to check changes to a first paragraph with the automatic history diff either side of an AWB edit. (Thinks I: "diff" - how silly, I am using a UNIX term when trying to persuade a windows programmer of the merits of a RFC!).</li>
<li>Please see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28headings%29_90d7.html#Spaces" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)#Spaces</a> which sums up my view on this and I think for many editors as well:
<dl>
<dd>Spaces above and below headings are completely optional. Spaces between the == and the heading text are also optional (<code>==Heading==</code> vs <code>== Heading ==</code>). According to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>, these extra spaces will not affect the appearance of the heading in any way; the rendered page is identical. <i>Multiple</i> blank lines <i>will</i> add white space, however.</dd>
<dd>It is much like the issue of whether to use <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_archive_%28spaces_after_a_full_stop_period%29_a149.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style archive (spaces after a full stop/period)">one or two spaces after a full stop</a>. It only affects the appearance of the text in the edit box, so use whichever approach best facilitates editing for you.</dd>
<dd>Note that the <i>Start a new discussion</i> tab on a Talk: page (the "+" link) inserts a blank line before and after the heading, and spaces in between the == and the heading text. Some editors find this easier to read in the wikitext source code.</dd>

</ul>

<dd>Would you please elaborate on what the resolution is? I don't use AWB but I just ran into the same thing, i.e., an editor using AWB deleting all the spaces after headings. This renders huge chunks of text in red, so it took me a fair amount of time to compare the versions to see what else had been changed. Given that the MoS authorizes both styles, it seems counterproductive for AWB to facilitate such edits. (I'm one of those who prefer a space after the heading because, to my eye, it makes the editing easier.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 21:38, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Running AWB with a bot account AWB is not handling protected pages correctly, it gives an error when trying to load the code (as it should since the code is displayed differently on protected pages) but it keeps trying to reload the page after the restart delay so it infinite loops. For a solution for this I'd suggest giving it a limited number of retries when it cannot contact a page then automatically ignoring it or even better make that a user definable value such as if page cannot be found retry x times before ignoring. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 06:52, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit conflicts</span></h2>
<p>This seems pretty serious... AWB doesn't identify the article revision that it's editing, so what would usually result in an edit conflict results in an effective reversion of any edits made after AWB loaded the edit page. This really ought to be addressed, and if possible enable some way of handling the resulting conflict. Related to that, it would be nice if edits that fail due to loss of session data could be detected and resent. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:13, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AWB reacts to edit conflicts in exactly the same way as a normal browser, in other words, it is up to the mediawiki software to sort it out. At present, if there is a conflict, AWB will just ignore it and move on, there is no code to revert any changes, or indeed to try and save it again. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:01, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I loaded the page up in AWB, then added a line of text with Firefox. Then I added a different line to the loaded content in AWB and saved it; the save went ahead fine, losing what I added with AWB. The MediaWiki software didn't flag up an edit conflict, but that's presumably the fault of AWB. If it was working properly like a regular browser using the interface an edit conflict WOULD have been flagged. And it would still be nice (and fairly simple I'd expect) to respond to any errors that are flagged up. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 15:49, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a little issue; if you have a long list (which scrolls) and you select an entry a good way down and start the process, it works its way down to the bottom, then keeps doing the last remaining article on the list. When it takes the last article off the list, it leaves a white space, where, because it scrolls, it should scroll the whole list down and make the scrollbar boundaries shorter. When you manually move the scrollbar the whitespace disappears but it would be aesthetically better (and would show more articles) if it updated properly first time.

<p>Hey, thanks for fixing the unicode thing so fast. Now I have a minor feature request... when searching for terms in the article with the "find" button, it's generally helpful to have some context after the search term (for instance, I'm currently looking for articles that incorrectly use "it's". Naturally, I have to see what comes <i>after</i> "it's" to know if it's incorrect or not). When whatever you're searching for is at the end of the line, you have to manually scroll down to see what comes after. This gets tedious after a while. Is there any way it can be set to put the found term two or three lines up from the bottom? —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok">Chowbok</a> 18:52, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I want to use AWB. I don't have 500 edits. I have no desire to try to convince someone that I should get to use it anyway. It's Free Software, available now, that I want to try out and potentially transition to using. I probably wouldn't even use it long-term -- it is IE based, after all -- but I might. And I can't.

<p>I see the reasoning behind having the line "Using <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">AWB</a>" in the edit summaries but at least for bot edits if not for all edits there should be an option to not include that line since A) for bot edits it's uneeded and would be the equivalent of adding using pywikipedia or using perl to all bots that use those to make their edits.

I've been trying to think of legitimate reasons an article would have an external link to another en-WP article, and can't think of any.

<p>There are legitimate reasons why Wikipedia would need to cite itself using external links. Remember, Wikipedia content is often mirrored offsite, so if you are citing something specific on Wikipedia (and not just a see also) then you <b>have</b> to use the external link.

<dd>I have a similar request to this and also to the one in the section "Adding a tag to Talk pages" above. I would like AWB to be able to operate on the <i>articles</i> when it receives a list of talk pages, and to be able to edit the <i>talk pages</i> when it receives a list of articles. This might be achieved with the addition of an option to the right-click menu in the article list box? (Please don't lose the ability to be able to select a category in that list and add to the list further from it). Examples:
<ul>
<li>I would like to be able to navigate through <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_Beatles_0bd7.html" title="Category:The Beatles">Category:The Beatles</a> and subcategories and add WikiProject templates to the talk pages of the articles listed there</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProject_The_Beatles_articles_1f03.html" title="Category:WikiProject The Beatles articles">Category:WikiProject The Beatles articles</a> lists every article managed by the Project, but because membership comes from having a talk page template, the category contains <i>talk pages</i>. I'd like to be able to build a list of the attached articles from this category so I can perform an AWB run on them.</li>

<dd>I think these features are unnecessary, as they will make the software too complicated, particularly as they can both be achieved with small effort already. e.g. regex replace "^" with a template to insert the template at the start of the article, or replace "$" to put one at the end (^ and $ are represent the start and end of the string in regular expressions). To edit the talk pages of a list of articles, just do a find and replace on a list of articles in notepad, simply replace "[[" with "[[Talk:" for example. These may seem unsatisfactory, but work perfectly, save much of my time, waste little of yours and avoid much over-complication. thanks. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:22, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're the boss&#160;:-) but I don't think it would take much time to implement (half an hour? it's a simple invert, a regular expression, and a menu item) and being hidden away in a right click option means complexity isn't an issue. What you're advocating would require building the list in AWB, saving it, opening it in a text editor, running a regexp, and then what? Saving it to a sandbox and running AWB on that? (since there doesn't appear to be an option to import a list from a file). Multiply that by maybe hundreds of times and that's a lot of person hours which automation could save. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:27, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think what kingboyk is talking about is categories that are included in a template placed on the article. When the template is added to an article, every time is saved it dynamically applies that category as if it was in the text of the article. If you are doing a recategorization for articles that are in that category only through the use of the template then what you have to do is change the category on the template and then touch each article with the template on it to get it to dynamically fall into the new category. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 21:18, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Can I just check that we're not forbidding "making extremely minor edits such as adding or removing some white space or moving a stub tag" in <i>every</i> case, but rather doing these in the absence of any substantive change. In other words: if you're performing a task and these changes are done <i>alongside</i> the particular change you want to make, this is OK; if you make <i>no change other than these</i>, that's bad.

<dd>The fact is we have no real definition of bot. Autowikibrowser is coming dangerously close to one and shares the major issue of being able to magnify screwups hugely (which is probablly one of the biggest points of contention with bots). Also while afaict a diff is presented and users are supposed to check it they often do not do so properly. a "bot" with an inattentive human operator checking edits is just as bad as a bot with noone checking edits. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 17:08, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've said it before and I'll say it again; anyone causing more trouble than is reasonable (i.e. a very small amount) should not be allowed to use any kind of extra tool. Also to say "they often" do not check the diff is very mis-leading, as a lot of people have done an enourmaous amount of good work with various tools (including this one), the problem lies with a small number of people, who, like I said, should not be using any kind of tool. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 17:19, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand why people treat the AutoWikiBrowser any differently than other bots. The python class of bots are open source and <i>anyone</i> can download the code and run one - with the AWB, at least you have to be on an "approved" list. People say the AWB has to have the words "AWB" in the edit summary, but python doesn't. People say you have to check AWB edits but not python edits. The paranoia is, basically, caused by the fact that the AWB is seemingly more open than other bots even though it's not. That's the root of the problem. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a> 19:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fact is we don't really have any policies for handling tools like this. If the tools are based on a bot framework they tend to be registered as bots and held to the same standards as bots even if they aren't running fully automated (i belive up to and including banning unauthorised ones that cause trouble). But because autowikibrowsers authors insist its not a bot and the admins seem to have agreed its users don't seem to be being held to the standards of bot operators. Someone care to start drafting a policy for the treatment semiautomated editing tool users? <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 20:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand the logic behind these comments, the AWB authors (e.g. me) have not "insisted" on anything at all, I don't care what label the software is given, the note saying that AWB is not a bot is purely because without it people would assume it is a fully automatic bot like the pywiki. Also "the admins seem to have agreed its users don't seem to be being held to the standards of bot operators" is totally unfounded, as an admin I feel, as evidently do a lot of others, that people using software tools (AWB, popups, VandalProof etc.) have to at <i>least</i> keep to the standards generally accepted for normal editing and bot editting, if a user somehow feels they can ignore these standards they simply should not be allowed to use any extra tools. I'll add a note on the main page to spell this out. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 21:13, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In reply to Plugwash: you're wrong. As often, this is unfounded botophobia. Please assume good faith of those that are using AWB. Claiming that they are all sleeping while they click on save (and they have to do so for <i>every</i> article) is assuming bad faith. Please be also aware that some edits done with AWB are best done with AWB, because it gives more security than manual edits alone. And also even more security than command line tools alone, because you see each diff in an original browser window. This window and the contents it provides is only <i>created</i> by AWB and presented to the user. The only difference is that the process to create that diff view is semi-automated. BTW a diff is always presented per default (in contrast to manual editing, where you can click on save without a preview or diff). So each diff <u>must be confirmed</u> by the user. Please also note that if doing a series of similar edits the editor becomes normally quite experienced to these edits at hand. So it is natural that he can go faster compared to an editor using only a browser. The percentage of the net user interaction time spent on viewing diffs is much higher on AWB than with a POB (Plain Old Browser). You can see here the emerging of new technology. This is normal that some people are frightened by this. Unkown new stuff always scares people. If you have a problem with an AWB edit talk with the editor that has done it. She or he is responsible for it. Please be kind and try to understand the edit from a larger point of view. Not only from the perspective of your three or four featured articles. And also note that if the community rejects a series of edits, any user will be notified very promptly. There is no specific danger caused by AWB. To the contrary, I would say. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 20:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't edit the code on SourceForge unless you're flagged as a "developer". However, anybody can download the source code and compile it themselves on their own computer without "committing" it to SourceForge. You can then run it without being approved and without the edit summary. However, python bots are also open source, don't have an approved list, and don't put anything in the edit summary.

<p>Hi, i only started trying AWB carefully ...</p>
<p>I'm a Perl lover, so my favorite feature is of course regular expressions support.</p>
<p>I tried entering this in the "Find and replace/Set" dialog:</p>
<p>Find: &lt;br ?/?&gt;</p>
<p>Replace: &lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>I want to replace stuff such as &lt;br&gt; and &lt;br /&gt; with &lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>However, instead of &lt;br/&gt; it puts in &lt;br /&gt;. Where did that space come from? Exactly the same settings produce &lt;br/&gt; in version 2.3.0.0.</p>

<dd>I recognize categories are not supposed to have extraneous brackets and I doubt it happens that often so I see no problem with ignoring it. However, don't you already do some fixing of brackets on links? I wouldn't think it would be that hard to create a regex that catches extraneous brackets on categories. Of course, testing all the possible side affects would be the gotcha.&#160;:-) In terms of payback for time invested, it would be pretty low.
