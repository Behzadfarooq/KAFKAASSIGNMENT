<p>There is a broad array of <b>autism therapies</b>, but the <a href="../../../e/f/f/Efficacy.html" title="Efficacy">efficacy</a> of each varies dramatically from person to person. Progress toward development of medical and <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behavior.html" title="Behavior">behavior</a> modification remedies, for the more debilitating affects of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a>, has been hindered significantly by widespread disagreements over such things as the nature and causes of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> disorders, and by a relative paucity of efficacious therapies thus far recognized by medical authorities.</p>
<p>With advances in psychosocial and <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical.html" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmacological</a> interventions, the behavioral and <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive.html" title="Cognitive">cognitive</a> functioning of individuals affected by <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic.html" title="Autistic">autistic</a> disorders might improve. Intensive, sustained <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">special education</a> programs and <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behavior_therapy.html" title="Behavior therapy">behavior therapy</a> early in life might increase the ability of children with autism to acquire <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> and learning skills. In adults with autism, some studies have found beneficial effects of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antidepressant.html" title="Antidepressant">antidepressant</a> medications <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clomipramine.html" title="Clomipramine">clomipramine</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluoxetine.html" title="Fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a>, and the newer <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipsychotic.html" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> medications such as <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risperdal.html" title="Risperdal">Risperdal</a> and, more traditionally, the much older drug <a href="../../../h/a/l/Haloperidol.html" title="Haloperidol">haloperidol</a>, possibly due to the preponderance of co-morbid disorders in those with autism significantly adding to behavioural and functional challenges more than the autism itself.</p>
<p>In many cases, several medications will be tried unsuccessfully, and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palliative.html" title="Palliative">palliative</a> drug treatments may lose much of their effectiveness for mitigating symptoms later in life. Distinguishing between beneficial, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palliative.html" title="Palliative">palliative</a> and detrimental treatments is not always straightforward.</p>

<p>A treatment and education of children with autism came through the application of the principles and techniques of <b>Applied Behavior Analysis</b> (ABA). <a href="../../../o/2E/_/O._Ivar_Lovaas_3d3a.html" title="O. Ivar Lovaas">O. Ivar Lovaas</a>'s name is widely associated with ABA-based treatment, as he was one of the first <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychologist.html" title="Psychologist">psychologists</a> to demonstrate that children with autism could learn <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>, play, social, self-help, and academic skills. The ABA method is highly disputed by many autistics, and is regarded useless by many others.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>ABA'-based approaches—often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and ABA—are some of the best known and most widely used in the field, and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive and expressive language, play, social, and pre-academic, and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the "antecedent-behavior-consequence" (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, "No!"</i>(<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_Society_of_America_273e.html" title="Autism Society of America">Autism Society of America</a>, 2001).<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_aanaba"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_aanaba" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_aanaba" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></dd>

<p>Lovaas' ABA methods are widely regarded as the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, seems to be critical to achieving optimal outcomes. The New York State Department of Health worked with a multi-disciplinary panel of autism experts to publish Clinical Practice Guidelines for young children diagnosed with autism. The panel reviewed research on a variety of treatment methodologies and cited ABA as a critical element in any intervention program for young children with autism. That same year, in the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgeon_General_3531.html" title="Surgeon General">Surgeon General</a> of the United States’ first report on mental health, intensive ABA based treatment was cited as an effective intervention for children with autism.</p>
<p>ABA techniques based on <a href="../../../b/2E/_/B._F._Skinner_fc07.html" title="B. F. Skinner">B. F. Skinner</a>'s <i><a href="../../../v/e/r/Verbal_Behavior_4045.html" title="Verbal Behavior">Verbal Behavior</a></i> claim to have succeeded in helping nonverbal children start to talk, typically going from zero words to several dozen. By allowing children to express their needs, even rudimentary speech can alleviate frustration and <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantrum.html" title="Tantrum">tantrums</a>.</p>
<p>The scientific validity of Lovaas's methods has been questioned by many professionals, by parents, and by those diagnosed as autistics themselves. Lovaas's initial studies looked promising, but there are no <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_control.html" title="Scientific control">controlled</a> studies that compare the Lovaas approach against a control group not receiving ABA. Sallows and Graupner's 2005 study, which compared groups treated by professionals vs. parents, replicated the results of Lovaas, but found little difference in outcome between the groups. This study represents the most comprehensive and rigorous replication to date, and their findings nearly mirror Lovaas's.</p>
<p>Some people have made <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical_challenges_to_autism_treatment.html" title="Ethical challenges to autism treatment">ethical challenges to autism treatment</a> by pointing out that early ABA was based around the use of <a href="../../../a/v/e/Aversives.html" title="Aversives">aversives</a> and saying that these aversives can be confusing and/or painful.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_sentexaba"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_sentexaba" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_sentexaba" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span>. Aversives are not used in today's ABA therapy programs.</p>
<p>ABA has come into widespread use in the 1990s, and the demand is outstripping the supply of committed and experienced service providers. As a result, parents of children need to be extra vigilant in choosing appropriate treatments for their children; this is especially so with regard to choosing providers, who may be inexperienced, use questionable methods or even deceive parents about their competency with ABA or any other program. Such problems have led to horror stories from some parents.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_abahorror1"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_abahorror1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_abahorror1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_abahorror2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_abahorror2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html#endnote_abahorror2" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span></p>

<p><a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship_Development_Intervention_f3d3.html" title="Relationship Development Intervention">Relationship Development Intervention</a> (RDI) is a treatment program developed by Dr. Steven E. Gutstein. Whereas <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applied_Behavior_Analysis_fd48.html" title="Applied Behavior Analysis">ABA</a> and other typical interventions aim to teach specific skills that are seen as lacking, RDI focuses primarily on building a general "dynamic intelligence" believed to underlie the acquisition of social skills demonstrated in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> children. It also focuses on the building blocks of motivation by developing <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episodic_memory.html" title="Episodic memory">episodic memory</a> (seen as impaired in autism) and filling it with the child's own personal stories of competence and mastery. RDI emphasizes declarative (as opposed to imperative) communication, and aims for an appropriate balance of verbal and nonverbal communication.</p>
<p>Dr. Gutstein claims that 70% of his patients improved their <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_diagnostic_observational_schedule.html" title="Autism diagnostic observational schedule">ADOS</a> diagnostic category within 18 months and that a similar proportion are able to enter school without a shadow teacher or other personal assistant.

<p><i>The Self-Help Guide for Special Kids and Their Parents</i> proposes reducing stressful situations, and not forcing the autistic child to change into someone he or she is not. James Williams, one of the authors, is an autistic child who recounts much of his experiences through examples of possible problems encountered by parents of autistic children. Some recommendations made by Williams include not forcing the child into a mainstreamed schooling situation too early, adapting to problems caused by hypersensitivity, and allowing <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stimming.html" title="Stimming">stimming</a> as a means of dealing with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress_%28medicine%29.html" title="Stress (medicine)">Stress</a>. The book promotes the idea that certain symptoms exhibited by individuals with autism are normal human responses to stress, and blocking these responses removes the individual's ability to deal with this stress. The authors also stress the importance of a primary bond between autistic children and parents, and building social interest and learning from that bond, while criticizing <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applied_Behavioral_Analysis_e44f.html" title="Applied Behavioral Analysis">ABA</a> for turning parents and children into adversaries or pushing them into dominant and submissive roles.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html" title="Edit section: Biomedical interventions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biomedical interventions</span></h2>
<p>Many parents and medical professionals have reported improvements in the behavior of autistic children enrolled in special diets, detoxification therapies, and a range of treatments, collectively known as <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomedical_intervention_for_autism.html" title="Biomedical intervention for autism">biomedical intervention for autism</a>. In 1995, The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_Research_Institute_d8a5.html" title="Autism Research Institute">Autism Research Institute</a> brought together a group of about 30 physicians and scientists to share information and ideas toward defeating autism as quickly as possible. This became known as <a href="http://www.autismwebsite.com/ARI/dan/dan.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.autismwebsite.com/ARI/dan/dan.htm" rel="nofollow">Defeat Autism Now!</a>, which comprises a network of doctors whose goal is to educate parents and clinicians about biomedically-based research, appropriate testing and safe and effective interventions for autism.</p>
<p>Some of these claims are contested by other specialist doctors, who fear that the failure of conventional medicine to address parental concerns, and the meager resources committed to scientific research, has led to autism becoming a magnet for <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quacks.html" title="Quacks">quacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatans.html" title="Charlatans">charlatans</a>.</p>
<p>The premise for biomedical intervention is that certain neurological disorders including autism are caused by environmental shocks that compromise the gastrointestinal, immunological and neurological systems. Based on this premise, what is often diagnosed as autism or PDD is seen as a <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiology.html" title="Physiology">physiological</a> syndrome that can and should be treated as a physiological disorder.</p>
<p>This point of view is consistent with wider evidence that diet and nutrition can affect behavior generally, but there is no medical literature evidencing claims that autism can be fully cured. Many of the most prominent researchers and advocates of biomedical therapies in autism have autistic children of their own and have been driven by their own experience of seeing their own children improve to devote their time to helping others. These include Dr. <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Rimland_7e6c.html" title="Bernard Rimland">Bernard Rimland</a>, who is seen by many as the godfather of biological interventions in autism.</p>
<p>There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support biomedical intervention - most parents who try one or several therapies report some progress, and there are many anecdotal stories of children who have undergone these programs and become seemingly completely neurotypical, able to return to mainstream education, and/or made dramatic improvements in health and well-being. However, this evidence may be confounded by the dramatic improvements often seen in autistic children as they grow up, with or without such interventions. There are calls for more research including <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-blind.html" title="Double-blind">double-blind</a> studies to test the relative efficacy of the different treatment approaches, and the light they might shed on the nature of autism.</p>
<p>As an example, the use of high doses of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin_B6_7090.html" title="Vitamin B6">vitamin B6</a> with or without <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnesium.html" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> is gaining popularity among parents. Some studies do validate its effectiveness; including some <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-blind.html" title="Double-blind">double-blind</a> ones.<a href="http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/treatment/b6studies.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/treatment/b6studies.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> However, there appear to be some significant risks associated with high doses of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin_B6_7090.html" title="Vitamin B6">vitamin B6</a>, including <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peripheral_neuropathy.html" title="Peripheral neuropathy">peripheral neuropathy</a>. Some people argue that vitamin B6 only helps children in the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those with nutritional deficiencies, which can benefit from <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multivitamins.html" title="Multivitamins">multivitamins</a> in general; autistic children are notoriously fussy eaters.</li>

<p>Based on the speculation that <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metal poisoning</a> may trigger the symptoms of autism, particularly in small subsets of individuals who cannot excrete toxins effectively, some parents have turned to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> practitioners who provide <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detox.html" title="Detox">detoxification</a> treatments, via <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelation_therapy.html" title="Chelation therapy">chelation therapy</a>, as a treatment method. However, evidence to support this practice has been <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdote.html" title="Anecdote">anecdotal</a> and not rigorous.

<p>The benefits of drugs is widely disputed. While anti-seizure medication is indicated for some children with seizures, other parents are opposed to using psychopharmacology to treat their children. They point out that whilst a subset have been found to have co-morbid mood, anxiety and compulsive disorders, autistic people are not necessarily psychotic, anxious, depressed or bipolar. Many autistic people themselves are against the overprescription of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuroleptic.html" title="Neuroleptic">neuroleptic</a> drugs in autistic people to control behavior whilst some of those with co-morbid disorders have been relieved to have medication to manage these and some psychiatrists are just now beginning to explore minimal doses of medication for this group.

<p>Tinted Lenses were popularised by autistic author <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Williams_184e.html" title="Donna Williams">Donna Williams</a> in her book <a href="../../../l/i/k/Like_Colour_To_The_Blind_23cc.html" title="Like Colour To The Blind">Like Colour To The Blind</a> and went on to become widely used by people with autism for the visual perceptual disorder of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotopic_Sensitivity_Syndrome_e6b9.html" title="Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome">Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome</a>. Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome is asserted to underpin reading challenges and asserted to result in a visual fragmentation effect in which it is difficult to see a whole face or process objects or a room visually as a whole.</p>
<p>Developmental neurologists have noted that autistic children tend to be hyposensitive and/or hypersensitive to one or several sensory impressions, and that their gross and fine motor skills are usually impaired to varying degrees. These are symptoms consistent with <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensory_Integration_Dysfunction_99aa.html" title="Sensory Integration Dysfunction">Sensory Integration Dysfunction</a>.</p>
<p>Pediatric <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupational_therapy.html" title="Occupational therapy">occupational therapy</a> has proven successful in helping autistic children deal more effectively with sensory impressions, use their senses more productively, and become more aware of their bodies.</p>
<p>Auditory therapies include the Tomatis and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berard.html" title="Berard">Berard</a> schools and focus on training the child to use his/her sense of hearing more effectively. Visual therapy, pioneered by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melvin_Kaplan_607f.html" title="Melvin Kaplan">Melvin Kaplan</a> and others, employs <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prism.html" title="Prism">prism</a> lenses that distort the child's vision, forcing him/her to use his/her focal vision more productively.</p>

The use of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probiotic.html" title="Probiotic">probiotic</a> diets for children with autism has been reported to have improved the concentration and behavior of the study subjects so much that medical trials collapsed because parents refused to accept <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo.html" title="Placebo">placebos</a>. According to the researchers, the effectiveness of the treatment caused some of the parents involved in a blind trial to realize that their children were not taking a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo.html" title="Placebo">placebo</a>. The parents then refused to switch to the placebo as scheduled, resulting in the collapse of the trial. As a result, it was difficult for researchers to draw firm conclusions.

<p>Christopher Marsh, a 36-year-old American diagnosed with <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, who had pursued academic study of psychology, social psychology, and sociology to the Master's level, found certain courses of the social sciences extremely helpful in understanding the workings of the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> world.</p>
<p>Primarily, one graduate course in Social Psychology focused two thirds of its attention to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attribution_%28psychology%29.html" title="Attribution (psychology)">attribution (psychology)</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_resolution.html" title="Conflict resolution">conflict resolution</a>, how anyone could learn to prevent and manage interpersonal conflict. If a neurotypical observer does not know that a person has Asperger, he or she may attribute unwelcome behavior as willful misconduct, and may, for example, decide to take no further action after a job interview. Or on the other hand, after knowing about the person's disability and skills, might hire that person.</p>
<p>Also of great importance, <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Durkheim_64fd.html" title="Emile Durkheim">Emile Durkheim</a> and the Rules of Sociological Method described how society, the invisible force that controls most of human behavior, organizes people to punish <a href="../../../d/e/v/Deviant_behavior.html" title="Deviant behavior">deviant behavior</a> from small faux pas to immoral conduct and crime, and describes how <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a>, a condition of alienation not very different from Asperger syndrome, can cause one to have emotional disorders like <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">clinical depression</a> and even commit <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. Is it any accident that people with Asperger tend to receive negative treatment because of poorly coordinating an alien social world, have corresponding levels of depression, and sometimes commit suicide?</p>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate courses in sociological theory covered <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_interactionism.html" title="Symbolic interactionism">symbolic interactionism</a>, notably the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mind</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_%28sociology%29.html" title="Self (sociology)">self (sociology)</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">society</a> focus of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Herbert_Mead_1dad.html" title="George Herbert Mead">George Herbert Mead</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/v/Erving_Goffman_d3f4.html" title="Erving Goffman">Erving Goffman</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impression_management.html" title="Impression management">impression management</a> described in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life_5e59.html" title="The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life">The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</a>, and other theories of how neurotypicals might perceive Asperger and how all people try to act in a social setting. A student with Asperger would intimately understand how conscious human communication takes place, but would still need to consider that non-verbal communication constitutes most of human communication. The theories should consider it. He or she would also learn the minute details of how neurotypicals strategize their behavior to maximize gains from social interaction.</p>
<p>Further examination of the relevant theories could include a review of related present-day research studies, with a careful assessment of what does and does not constitute sound research.</p>
<p>College students with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> could benefit from two or three three-credit-hour courses in the above subjects to learn consciously about how society works, how neurotypicals manage in day-to-day life, and attempt to apply them for themselves. Indeed, many college students with Asperger, like Marsh, might be so overwhelmingly curious about the human (neurotypical) world ("other planet") that they will choose at least some electives from, if not a major in, the social sciences.</p>

<p>There is a view that autism is not a disorder, but a normal, healthy variation in neurological hard-wiring, and therefore does not need to be cured. This "anti-cure perspective" supports the model of autism that claims that autism is a fundamental part of who the autistic person is and that autism is something that cannot be separated from the person. A cure is seen as destroying the original personality of the individual and is perceived similar to attempts to "cure" homosexuality, therefore this perspective considers the disease classification insulting. In line with this belief an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_culture.html" title="Autistic culture">autistic culture</a> has begun to develop similar to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf_culture.html" title="Deaf culture">deaf culture</a>. This view is usually held by autistic people themselves (<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_rights_movement.html" title="Autism rights movement">Autism rights movement</a>), and is mostly criticized by parents of autistic children.</p>

<p>This view was put forward by autistic author <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Williams_184e.html" title="Donna Williams">Donna Williams</a> in her 9th book in the autism field, <i>The Jumbled Jigsaw</i> based on her work as an autism consultant working with over 600 people on the spectrum over 8 years. Here she presented a holistic model called <i>Autism as a fruit salad</i> model and demonstrated how the severity of someone's autism could be linked to their degree of <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-morbid.html" title="Co-morbid">co-morbid</a> communication, sensory-perceptual, gut/immune, neurological integration, mood, anxiety and compulsive disorders a person inherited or developed coupled with cognitive and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Learning_style.html" title="Learning style">learning style</a> differences and unusual personality trait collections. She suggested these challenges came about via different combinations of pathways including genetic inheritance, toxic exposure and clashing socio/sensory environments. She suggested that treatment and management, therefore, depended on mapping out which collection of co-morbid challenges were underpinning the <i>autistic presentation</i> for different individuals and addressing each with the most appropriate approaches to each individual underlying issue to maximise each person's potential. She also acknowledged that within this framework, individuals would exist for whom their greatest challenge would be cultural clashes between themselves and the neurotypical world.</p>

<p>There are approximately twelve research studies published each week on therapies for individuals with autism. A recent review article (Bodfish 2004) suggests that there are three major barriers in the transfer of this information from the laboratory to the child. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>treatment providers do not routinely turn to treatments that have been validated scientifically</li>
<li>a large minority of patients (actually parents of patients) resist therapies that have been scientifically validated</li>
<li>even scientifically validated therapies are not universally effective for all individuals with autism</li>
