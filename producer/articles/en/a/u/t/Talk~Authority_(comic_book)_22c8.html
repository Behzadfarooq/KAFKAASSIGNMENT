<p>I took the liberty of deleting the "her" out of "each Doctor was twice as powerful as his or her immediate predecessor". There are a couple of instances in the comic where we get to see the past doctors, and they are all males, plus the last issue of Authority Revolution pretty much establishes that it's an "all boys" club (IE: the party with the Jennies). By the way, boy isn't it nice that the Authority finally has a Doctor that isn't too stoned and/or scared to put his powers in good use? His way of dealing with the Rose Tatoo was plain awesome, and I wonder if she is really part of team now. We'll se in V4, I guess.</p>

<p>I don't think we really need two seperate articles. There's already a (very brief) section on Revolution in the main article, and I think the content from <a href="../../../r/e/v/The_Authority%7E_Revolution_bab9.html" title="The Authority: Revolution">The Authority: Revolution</a> will be more useful there. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 05:02, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure. I just thought it fit better outside of the main article since it was so informative. But if you feel that it would do just as well in the main article, then go right ahead.&#160;:) Solofire6 05:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The section is very complete and informative, but the rest of the series, with minis and crossovers and everything, is dealt with in the main article, so it's just easier to keep everything together. I'll put a redirect at the article you created, in case anyone goes looking for the book there.

<p>I do not know why the anonymous editor claims that the Fibonacci sequence does not apply to the level of The Doctor's power. Maybe because we do not know that the first two Doctors had equivalent power levels. Until and unless someone offers an explanation here, I am restoring the reference, using Golden ratio (which is more generally applicable) instead of Fibonacci number. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Dantas_e357.html" title="User:Luis Dantas">Luis Dantas</a> 18:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I'll explain. Say the first Doctor has power level = <b>1</b>. The second Doctor, who has the power level of all preceeding Doctors, has power level = <b>1</b> also. That is true. The third Doctor has power level = 1+1 = <b>2</b>. So far, this is the Fibonacci sequence. The difference is what comes next. The fourth Doctor has power level = 1+1+2 = <b>4</b>, and not 1+2 = 3 as the Fibonacci sequence would suggest. The fifth Doctor has power = 1+1+2+4 = 4+4 = 2*4 = <b>8</b>. The sixth = 1+1+2+4+8 = 2*8 = <b>16</b>. So, apart from the first two, each Doctor will have exactly twice the power level of the previous Doctor (assuming that power levels can be quantified in this way and that the information in the article is accurate). This is a geometric progression (and, incidentally, has nothing at all to do with the Golden Ratio). -- <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupermorff_0984.html" title="User:Supermorff">Supermorff</a> 19:58, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree. I don't know if anyone has changed them since you first suggested this in January, but when I came across the article today, I felt it looked pretty bad. I've just cleaned up the sections a bit. Hopefully they look a bit more streamlined.

<p>Currently, the article lists Jack Hawksmoor as the leader of the Authority. However, the Authority as led by Hawksmoor disbands in book one of Revolution, and when it reforms in Book Two, it's Jenny Quantum who brings everyone back together, and she certainly seems to take up a leadership position for the rest of that volume, and both Apollo and Midnighter comment on her being the leader of the team (Apollo on settling into a leadership role, and Midnighter on letting Rose Tattoo into "her" team). As I understand it, nothing has been published since then, so as of the end of Revolution Book Two, isn't the current leader of the Authority Jenny Quantum? <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReveilled_3c6d.html" title="User:Reveilled">Reveilled</a> 00:59, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took out the blurb about the authority being described as fascist because a) they weren't (they were dictators and authoritarians), and b) it was unsourced in any event. Wikipedia doesn't need another debate about what fascism is, but it's not anytime you become a dictator and kill people for disagreeing with you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.16.144.44 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.16.144.44_597b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.16.144.44">contribs</a>) 04:13, 20 June, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>Statements made within the material which is the subject matter of the article do not (as far as I'm aware) need to be sourced.

<dd>Yeah there has been a lot of things being moved around on the justification that it is per the Comics Project naming policy but really you only need to qualify it like this when there are naming conflicts and these moves have been rather a blanket thing without looking into the specifics of each case (or consulting). If <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Authority_1e31.html" title="The Authority">The Authority</a> redirects here then it should be under that name. So you have my vote for a move back (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 23:25, 12 October 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Well, it's more than just WikiProject Comics that has this policy. It's an official policy of Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NAME#Avoid_the_definite_article_.28.22the.22.29_and_the_indefinite_article_.28.22a.22.2F.22an.22.29_at_the_beginning_of_the_page_name" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NAME#Avoid_the_definite_article_.28.22the.22.29_and_the_indefinite_article_.28.22a.22.2F.22an.22.29_at_the_beginning_of_the_page_name" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> However, to my mind, this meets one of the exceptions to the rule. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28definite_and_indefinite_articles_at_beginning_of_name%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28definite_and_indefinite_articles_at_beginning_of_name%29" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> --GentlemanGhost 18:50, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is still pretty big. I was wondering about ways to improve things and it strikes me the story lines and publication history can be integrated. The publication history could easily be trimmed down - that entire last paragraph on Millar's post-Authority non-DC work just isn't needed here and would seem better on Millar's own entry. It could be summed up in a sentence. So have Volume 1 with sub-headers for the "eras" with an opening paragraph or two and then the storylines and so on with summaries kept to a couple of paragraphs unless really necessary (Reality Incorporated and The Eternal Return still seem too long). As it stands the information is oddly spread out with graphic novels under the publishing history and not storylines. Also can the Kev Saga be trimmed down and the bulk of the material moved to his entry?

<dd>Uck. I just finished splitting the Storylines and Publication History sections <i>apart</i> from each other. Quite frankly, even knowing most of the Authority publication history already, the article was immensely confusing when arranged like that. The in-universe story and the events in reality are two separate "stories" and I think they should be kept separate. Other articles do likewise, and it makes more sense to read the publication history in light of the storylines.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, whatever happens, the whole thing IS a lot shorter now I've gone to town on the Storylines section. Certainly it could be shortened further but I've tried to keep the synopses proportional in length to the number of issues - most arcs are 4 issues, but there are some one-shots and The Eternal Return is 12 issues, hence its length. In any case I am sure the Publication History could be likewise abbreviated and simplified. I am musing on whether or not to merge the One-Offs and Specials section in with either/both, to save more space still. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamSim_0ebf.html" title="User:SamSim">SamSim</a> 15:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
