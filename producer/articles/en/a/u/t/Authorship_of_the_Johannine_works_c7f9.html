<p>Scholars have debated the <b>authorship of the Johannine works</b> (<a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">Gospel of John</a>, the <a href="../../../1/_/j/1_John_7d5d.html" title="1 John">first</a>, <a href="../../../2/_/j/2_John_45d7.html" title="2 John">second</a>, and <a href="../../../3/_/j/3_John_2e58.html" title="3 John">third epistles of John</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelation_4ea8.html" title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>) since at least the 3rd century because of their content. The main topics of debate are whether these works were authored by the same person (or people) and secondly, the identity of the author.</p>
<p>In the ancient traditions, the books were all attributed to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Apostle_1f74.html" title="John the Apostle">John the Apostle</a>,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> the assume author of the Gospel of John. In the 6th century,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decretum_Gelasianum_63cc.html" title="Decretum Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a> named 2 John and 3 John as having a separate author, "John, a priest" (see <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Presbyter_d09e.html" title="John the Presbyter">John the Presbyter</a>). Since the rise of <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_criticism.html" title="Higher criticism">higher criticism</a>, it has been disputed whether John the Apostle authored any of these works.</p>
<p>Today the texts continue to be approached separately; viewpoints on the issue of authorship in each of the Johannine works range from affirming the authorship of the Apostle, to affirming the authorship of another author, called "John" for convenience, to theories of group authorship. Modern scholars are virtually unanimous that Revelation was written by a separate author, <i>c.</i> 95 with some parts possibly dating to <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero.html" title="Nero">Nero</a>'s reign in the early 60s.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Some scholars conclude that the other works may have been written by the same author or authors, but not by the Apostle John,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> while other scholars conclude the author of the epistles was a different author than the author of the gospel, although all four works probably originated from the same community.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The gospel and epistles traditionally and plausibly came from in Ephesus, <i>c.</i> 90-110, although some scholars argue for an origin in Syria.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the first two centuries of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, the <i><a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a></i> was the primary instrument for <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechism.html" title="Catechism">catechesis</a>. <i>John</i> was always considered the last to be written, traditionally given a date between 90 and 100, though modern scholars often suggest an even later date. Under the influence of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenaeus.html" title="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>' four-gospel "canon of truth", the <i>Gospel of John</i> became a cornerstone of <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptismal</a> catechesis in Rome. In the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicaea_a44c.html" title="First Council of Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, the Gospel was one of the major supports for the doctrine that the Father and the Son are one (an example of high <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>).</p>
<p>On the one hand, several Church fathers of the 2nd century never quoted <i>John</i>, and on the other, the earliest extant written commentary on any book of the New Testament was that written on <i>John</i> by Heracleon, a disciple of the gnostic <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentinius.html" title="Valentinius">Valentinus</a>. Texts of the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nag_Hammadi_library_4c79.html" title="Nag Hammadi library">Nag Hammadi library</a> show that many of the <i>Gospel of John'</i>s earliest readers responded to the text "in surprising and imaginative ways" (Pagels 2003 p 115 –117). <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Hippo_c35d.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> and <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_of_Alexandria_2501.html" title="Cyril of Alexandria">Cyril of Alexandria</a> all provided commentaries on the Johannine works, with those of Augustine being the most numerous. In the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, important mainstream commentaries were written by <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_of_Deutz_201d.html" title="Rupert of Deutz">Rupert of Deutz</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_b8c6.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>.</p>
<p>Though, most of the above is called into question due to <a href="../../../r/y/l/Rylands_Library_Papyrus_P52_8d2d.html" title="Rylands Library Papyrus P52">Rylands Library Papyrus P52</a> which possibly dates a section of the gospel of John to between 125 and 160, as well as by the recent work of Charles Hill's <a href="http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/HistoryofChristianity/EarlyChurch/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199291441" class="external text" title="http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/HistoryofChristianity/EarlyChurch/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199291441" rel="nofollow">The Johannine Corpus in the Early Church</a>. In this last, Charles Hill gives evidence that the Gospel of John was used between CE 90 and 130, and of the possible use of uniquely Johannine gospel material in several works which date from this period. These works and authors include <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius.html" title="Ignatius">Ignatius</a> (<i>c.</i> 107); <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polycarp.html" title="Polycarp">Polycarp</a> (<i>c.</i> 107); <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papias.html" title="Papias">Papias</a>’ elders (<i>c.</i> 110-120); and <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierapolis.html" title="Hierapolis">Hierapolis</a>' Exegesis of the Lord’s Oracles (<i>c.</i> 120-132). Hill assesses that many historical figures did indeed reference the Gospel of John. <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Martyr_42aa.html" title="Justin Martyr">Justin Martyr</a> (<i>c.</i> 100 to 165) also quoted from the <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Justin_Martyr.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.ntcanon.org/Justin_Martyr.shtml" rel="nofollow">gospel of John</a>, which would also support that the Gospel was indeed in existence by the beginning of the second century, and also that it was considered valid by these fathers of mainstream christianity.</p>

<p>The era of critical scholarship on the works opened with <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Gottlieb_Bretschneider_6083.html" title="Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider">K.G. Bretschneider</a>'s (b1776 - d 1848) 1820 work on the topic of Johannine authorship. Bretschneider called into question the apostolic authorship of the Gospel, and even stated on the basis of the author's unsteady grip on topography that the author could not have come from <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>. He argued that the meaning and nature of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> presented in the <i>Gospel of John</i> was very different from that in the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Gospels_5bc3.html" title="Synoptic Gospels">Synoptic Gospels</a>, and thus its author could not have been an eyewitness to the events. Bretschneider cited an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologetic</a> character in John, indicating a later date of composition.</p>
<p>Following from the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegel.html" title="Hegel">Hegel</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Christian_Baur_5147.html" title="Ferdinand Christian Baur">F.C. Baur</a> (born 1792 died 1860) negated any historical value for the Fourth Gospel. He stated that it was solely a work of synthesis of thesis-antithesis according to the Hegelian model—synthesis between the thesis of Judeo-Christianity (represented by Peter) and the antithesis of Gentile Christianity (represented by Paul). He also cited in the epistles a synthesis with the opposing dualist forces of <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a>. As such, he assigned a date of 170 to the Gospel.</p>

<p>Although the critical movement reached almost complete agreement about the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-source_hypothesis.html" title="Two-source hypothesis">two-source hypothesis</a> for the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Gospels_5bc3.html" title="Synoptic Gospels">Synoptic Gospels</a>, no agreement has been reached about the literary sources for the Johannine works. A perhaps typical example of a critical theory of the development of these was provided by <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Wellhausen_6f42.html" title="Julius Wellhausen">Julius Wellhausen</a> in 1908. He hypothesized a base document which was heavily modified by a later editor. He claimed to have been able to separate the base document from the editings, praising the base document, and condemning the later editor for his intrusion. Other critical scholars, such as E. Schwarz, listed dozens of <i>"apories"</i> or indications of rupture in the narratives and discourses.</p>
<p>Criticism in the early twentieth century centered on the idea of the <i><a href="../../../l/o/g/Logos.html" title="Logos">Logos</a></i> (<i>word</i>), which was perceived as a Hellenistic concept. Thus H. J. Holtzmann hypothesized a dependence of the work on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo_Judaeus_e0d0.html" title="Philo Judaeus">Philo Judaeus</a>; <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Schweitzer_70b0.html" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a> considered the work to be a Hellenized version of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Pauline</a> mysticism, while R.

<p><a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Bultmann_4f81.html" title="Rudolf Bultmann">Rudolf Bultmann</a> took a different approach to the work. He hypothesized a Gnostic origin (specifically <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandaeanism.html" title="Mandaeanism">Mandaeanism</a> which maintains that Jesus was a mšiha kdaba or "<a href="../../../f/a/l/False_prophet.html" title="False prophet">false prophet</a>," ) for the work. He noted similarities with the Pauline corpus, but attributed this to a common Hellenistic background. He claimed that the many contrasts in the Gospel, between light and darkness, truth and lies, above and below, and so on, show a tendency toward dualism, explained by the Gnostic roots of the work. Despite the Gnostic origin, Bultmann commended the author for several improvements over Gnosticism, such as the Judeo-Christian view of creation and the demythologizing of the role of the Redeemer. He saw the Gospel as an investigation into a <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> who was wholly Other and transcendent, seeing no place in the vision of the author for a Church or <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament.html" title="Sacrament">sacraments</a>.</p>
<p>Bultmann's analysis is still widely applied in <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German-speaking</a> countries, although with many corrections and discussions. Wide-ranging replies have been made to this analysis. Today, most Christian exegetes reject much of Bultmann's theory, but accept certain of his intuitions. For instance, J. Blank uses Bultmann in his discussion of the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Judgment_d203.html" title="Last Judgment">Last Judgment</a> and W. Thüsing uses him to discuss the elevation and glorification of Jesus.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English-speaking</a> world, Bultmann has had less impact. Instead, these scholars tended to continue in the investigation of the Hellenistic and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Platonistic</a> theories, generally returning to theories closer to the traditional interpretation. By way of example, G.H.C. McGregor (1928) and W.F. Howard (1943) belong to this group.</p>

<p>The discovery of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> in <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qumran.html" title="Qumran">Qumran</a> marked a change in Johannine scholarship. Several of the hymns, presumed to come from a community of <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, contained the same sort of plays between opposites – light and dark, truth and lies – which are themes within the Gospel. Thus the hypothesis that the Gospel relied on Gnosticism fell out of favor. Many suggested further that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> himself belonged to an Essene community, and if John the Apostle had previously been a disciple of the Baptist, he would have been affected by that teaching.</p>
<p>The resulting revolution in Johannine scholarship was termed the <i>new look</i> by J.A.T. Robinson, who coined the phrase in 1957 at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. According to Robinson, this new information rendered the question of authorship a relative one. He considered a group of disciples around the aging John the Apostle who wrote down his memories, mixing them with theological speculation, a model that had been proposed as far back as <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Renan_5482.html" title="Ernest Renan">Renan</a>'s <i>Vie de Jésus</i> ("Life of Jesus ", 1863). The work of such scholars brought the consensus back to a Palestinian origin for the text, rather than the Hellenistic origin favored by the critics of the previous decades.</p>
<p>In any case, the "Qumran fever" that was raised by the discovery of the Scrolls is gradually dying down, with theories of Gnostic influences in the Johannine works beginning to be proposed again, especially in Germany. Some recent views have seen the theology of Johannine works as directly opposing "Thomas Christians" (Riley 1995; Pagels 2003).</p>

This would account for the otherwise inexplicable knowledge of and access to the Temple which would not have been available to rough fishermen and followers of a disruptive rural preacher from the Gallilee, one who was being accused of heresy besides. And probably for the evanescent presence of the Beloved Disciple in the events of Jesus' Ministry. On this reading, the Gospel was written, perhaps by a student and follower of this Disciple in his last advanced years, perhaps at Patmos.</p>

<p>With the exception of Renan's <i>Vie de Jésus</i>, which praised the historical and geographical details present in the Gospel, virtually all critical scholars before the 20th century denied any historical value of the work, largely basing their conclusions on seven particular theses: first, that the tradition of authorship by John the Apostle was created <i>ex post facto</i> to support the book's authority; second, that the book does not proceed even indirectly from an eyewitness account; third, that the book was intended as an apologetic work, not a history; fourth, that the Synoptic tradition was used and adapted very freely by the author; fifth, that these deviations are not due to the application of other sources unknown to the authors of the Synoptic gospels; sixth, that the discourses in the Gospel express not Jesus's words, but those of the evangelist; and therefore, that the fourth Gospel has no value in supplementing the Synoptics.</p>
<p>In favor of the historical and eyewitness character of the Gospel, a few passages are pointed to. In the second chapter, when Jesus cleanses the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Temple_74d1.html" title="Second Temple">Temple</a>, the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> tell him that the Temple has been under construction for forty-six years. That construction had begun in 20 BC under <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great</a>, putting the cleansing of the Temple in AD 27, precisely when modern scholarship (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology_of_Jesus%27_birth_and_death_99cb.html" title="Chronology of Jesus' birth and death">Chronology of Jesus' birth and death</a>) places the beginning of Jesus's ministry. Similarly, John's chronology for the death of Jesus seems more realistic, because the Synoptic Gospels would have the trial before the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> occurring on the first day of the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover.html" title="Passover">Passover</a>, which was a day of rest. However, this could simply be due to the authors of the gospels having a clearer and more neutral account of events than would be held by someone present at the time. Schonfield agrees that the Gospel was the product of the Apostle's great age, but further identifies him as the Beloved Disciple of the Last Supper, and so believes that the Gospel is based on first hand witness, though decades later and perhaps through the assistance of a younger follower and writer, which may account for the mixture is Hebraicisma (from the Disciple) and Greek idiom (the assistant).</p>

Caiaphas continues, 'It is expedient that one man should die for the people, that the whole nation not perish' (11:48,50)".</p>

For instance, he cites relationships between Polycarp and a "John", but doesn't specify which John.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">Gospel of John</a></i> states explicitly in its text that it was written by the "<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved_c3ff.html" title="Disciple whom Jesus loved">disciple whom Jesus loved</a>", so that a great deal of effort has been put into determining who this person might be. Traditionally he is identified as John the Apostle, since otherwise, one of the most important apostles in the other Gospels would be entirely missing in the fourth gospel. However, critical scholars have suggested some other possibilities. Filson, Sanders, Vernard Eller <a href="http://www.hccentral.com/eller8/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hccentral.com/eller8/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_Steiner_01bc.html" title="Rudolph Steiner">Rudolph Steiner</a><a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GospJohn1906/19060219p01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GospJohn1906/19060219p01.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> suggest <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarus.html" title="Lazarus">Lazarus</a>, since John 11:31 and 36 specifically indicates that Jesus "loved" him, and it is perhaps also implied in the <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Gospel_of_Mark_0a23.html" title="Secret Gospel of Mark">Secret Gospel of Mark</a></i>. This would fit well with the author's interest in the Judean activity of Jesus. The idea that Lazarus was raised by Jesus from the dead might also explain why some expected the Beloved Disciple not to die (John 21:22-23). Parker suggested that this disciple might be <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_the_Evangelist_b86a.html" title="Mark the Evangelist">John Mark</a>; nonetheless, the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a> indicate that John Mark was very young and a late-comer as a disciple. J. Colson suggested that "John" was a priest in Jerusalem, explaining the alleged priestly mentality in the fourth gospel. R. Schnackenburg suggested that "John" was an otherwise unknown resident of Jerusalem who was in Jesus's circle of friends. The <i><a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Philip_3afc.html" title="Gospel of Philip">Gospel of Philip</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mary_8a7c.html" title="Gospel of Mary">Gospel of Mary</a></i> identify <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Magdalene_8dd9.html" title="Mary Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> as the disciple whom Jesus loved, a connection that has been analyzed by Esther de Boer (in Meyer 2004) and made notorious in the fictional <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a></i>. Finally, a few authors, such as Loisy and Bultmann and Hans-Martin Schenke, see "the Beloved Disciple" as a purely symbolic creation, an idealized pseudonym for the group of authors.</p>
<p>Many critical scholars<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> today conclude (with the tradition) that the "disciple whom Jesus loved" was intended to be understood as John the Apostle, though after the discovery of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Gospel_of_Mark_0a23.html" title="Secret Gospel of Mark">Secret Gospel of Mark</a> a few have considered that it refers to the youth found semi-naked with Jesus during his arrest, and also the youth found in the tomb (as the same person); however, there remains the question of whether this apostle was actually the author of the texts. Gnosticism scholar <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaine_Pagels_7e74.html" title="Elaine Pagels">Elaine Pagels</a> goes further and claims that the author himself was a Gnostic, citing cited similarities with the <i><a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Thomas_e2f4.html" title="Gospel of Thomas">Gospel of Thomas</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Philip_3afc.html" title="Gospel of Philip">Gospel of Philip</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> It is to be noted that the first commentary on the Gospel of John was written by a Gnostic<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, and the Gospel was popular among the Gnostics at least as early as among the "orthodox".</p>
<p>Various objections to John the Apostle's authorship have been raised. First of all, the <i>Gospel of John</i> is a highly intellectual account of Jesus' life, requiring a good level of education. More specifically, the author seems to be familiar with Rabbinic traditions of Biblical interpretation. The Synoptic Gospels, however, are united in identifying John as a fisherman, whom one would not picture as well-educated. Against this objection, might be noted that John was not a hired fisherman, but rather someone who could afford to own a boat<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, and may thus have had access to sufficient income to pay for teaching. However, the <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a></i> refers to John as "without learning" or "unlettered"<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>A second objection to John the Apostle's authorship is the importance that he gives to the traditions of Jerusalem<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, whereas we might expect a Galilean disciple of Jesus to focus (as the other Gospels do) on the Galilean activity of Jesus. The response usually given to this objection is that the knowledge of Jerusalem shown in the text is no more than a yearly pilgrim might pick up<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. John's interest in Jerusalem seems to be totally dependent on his interest in Jesus.</p>
<p>Finally, it is objected that the "disciple whom Jesus loved" is not mentioned before the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Supper_561f.html" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</a> (unless one includes chapter 11's reference to Lazarus in this way),<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> so that this disciple could not be presumed to have been an eyewitness to the earlier events of the Gospel. However, tradition has identified this disciple with the unnamed disciple of the first chapter, and at any rate, there is no reason to suppose that the final meal with the disciples was the first contact that this individual (or any other, for that matter) had with Jesus. The structure of the Gospel also partially explains the "disappearance" of the disciples from the center of the action. The first twelve chapters, the "Book of Signs", concerns Jesus's preaching and miracles among the Jewish people, while the relation of the Last Supper concentrates on his relation to the disciples in particular.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Brown_78be.html" title="Raymond E. Brown">Raymond E. Brown</a>, among others, posit a community of writers rather than a single individual that gave final form to the work.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>In particular, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_21.html" title="John 21">Chapter 21</a> is very different stylistically from the main body of the Gospel, and is thought to be a later addition (known as the <i>appendix</i>), and the last few verses of the chapter are yet again different, and thought to be an even later addition (known as the <i>appendix to the appendix</i>). Among many Christian scholars the view has evolved that there were multiple stages of development involving the disciples as well as the apostle; R.E. Brown (1970) distinguishes four stages of development: traditions connected directly with the apostle, partial editing by his disciples, synthesis by the apostle, and additions by a final editor. At the very least, it seems clear that in chapter 21 someone else speaks in the third person plural ("we"), ostensibly as the voice of a community that believes the testimony of this other person called the "beloved disciple" to be true.</p>

John the Apostle, if the principal author, would have been a remarkably old age for the time, when life expectancies were much shorter. On the other hand, if the apostle had actually lived to such an age, it would explain the tradition reported in John 21, that many believed that Jesus had said the apostle would not die (which may have lead to the legend of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prester_John_7689.html" title="Prester John">Prester John</a>). A date later than the early second century is excluded because <a href="../../../p/5/2/P52.html" title="P52">P52</a>, our earliest manuscript evidence of the Gospel, dates from before the middle of the second century. Even in the early church there was a doubt over its authenticity, and both <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcion.html" title="Marcion">Marcion</a> (heretical founder of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcionism.html" title="Marcionism">Marcionism</a>) and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celsus.html" title="Celsus">Celsus</a> (a pagan critical of Christianity in general) heavily criticized it as a clear forgery. The debate focused around not only its differences from the other Gospels, but also its teaching about the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraclete.html" title="Paraclete">Paraclete</a>, which was important in the early "charismatic" movement known as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a>.</p>

<p>The phraseology of the first letter of John is very similar to that of the fourth gospel, so that the question of authorship is often connected to the question of authorship of the gospel. There are several turns of phrase that occur only in the Gospel and First Epistle and nowhere else in the New Testament, such as "have a sin", "do the truth", "remain" in some mystical state (in the Father, in the Son, in my love), and so forth. Both works have a very <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> flavor to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> -- many sentences begin with "all" or with "and", use of "literary inclusion" (the repetition of a phrase to indicate that the material between the inclusions belongs together), minimal use of the Greek <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illative_case.html" title="Illative case">illative</a> particles. Both works have the same basic concepts that are being explored: the Word, the Only Begotten, the incarnation, the passing from death to life, the truth and lies, etc.</p>
<p>The book was not among those whose <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">canonicity</a> was in doubt, according to Eusebius; however, it is not included in an ancient Syrian canon. <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_of_Mopsuestia_d7ea.html" title="Theodore of Mopsuestia">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> also presented a negative opinion toward its canonicity. Outside of the Syrian world, however, the book has many early witnesses, and appears to have been widely accepted.</p>
<p>Given the similarity with the Gospel, most critical scholars assign the same authorship to the epistle that they assign to the Gospel. Most refer to a Johannine school from which the letter stemmed, possibly even from the hand of the apostle himself.</p>

<p>While tradition normally assigns the second and third epistles to John the Apostle, the fact that the author identifies himself as "the presbyter" (or "the priest") cast doubt on this assignment, even within the early Church. There are enough literary and theological similarities with the first epistle that these two are normally assumed to have stemmed from the same circle of theologians. Thus most scholars assume that some personality in the circle of disciples of John was the author of these books. The similarities between the two books make it unlikely that they have two separate authors. This hypothetical author is usually called "John the Presbyter" to distinguish him from the apostle.</p>
<p>Medieval legend, on the other hand, equated "John the Presbyter" with "John the Apostle", and since some read chapter 21 of the Gospel as indicating that John the Apostle never died, produced the story of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prester_John_7689.html" title="Prester John">Prester John</a>, who was said to be the apostle, still alive and writing in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<p>The most common reason for suspecting an author different from the apostle John is its radically different style whereas the Gosple Epistles are all stylistically consistent. Contemporary scholars<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> note that when Revelation and the Gospel refer to Jesus as "lamb" they use different Greek words, and they spell "Jerusalem" differently. There are differing motifs between the book and the Gospel: use of allegory, symbolism, and similar metaphors, such as "living water", "shepherd", "lamb", and "manna". The <i>Book of Revelation</i> does not go into several typically Johannine themes, such as light, darkness, truth, love, and "the world" in a negative sense. The <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">eschatology</a> of the two works are also very different.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Revelation is written in a specific genre of apocalyptic literature which differs from the style of the gospels and the epistles. To account for the differences, some scholars have suggested a secretary was used in some works, but not others to smooth out the Greek style used in his other books.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other motivations for doubts to an apostolic authorship are the author's lack of reference to knowing Jesus, as the apostle John did, and the belief that John died too early as a martyr between 64 and 70.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> However, the apostle John is widely accepted as the only apostle not a martyr, living into the 90s.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The estimated dates of Revelation indicate it was written during the life of the apostle John. According to early tradition of Irenaeus, Eusebius and Jerome, the writing of this book took place near the very end of Domitian's reign, around <a href="../../../9/5/_/95.html" title="95">95</a> or <a href="../../../9/6/_/96.html" title="96">96</a>. Others contend for an earlier date, <a href="../../../6/8/_/68.html" title="68">68</a> or <a href="../../../6/9/_/69.html" title="69">69</a>, in the reign of <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero.html" title="Nero">Nero</a> or shortly thereafter.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup> Because authorship was one of several considerations for canonization, several <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Fathers_d0f6.html" title="Church Fathers">Church Fathers</a> rejected Revelation.</p>
