<dd>Hey, I'm all for that. Let's stop with the massive rewrites and do some discussion and hard thinking about how we can reach a mutually acceptable compromise. We could establish a temporary compromise that gives each side about half of what it wants, and in the meantime we could all work on a /temp version of the article to hammer out something better. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:45, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why half? That would make sense if each side were equal in size. A better system weights each side by how many adherents it has. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 19:31, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And why do we adhere to different views? I suppose you know why I adhere to mine—if you don't, ask me and I'll explain—but I don't know why you adhere to yours. Could you explain your opinion, and then maybe we can understand each other better? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:53, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's reams and reams and reams of discussion about why people want this article to look differently to how you want it to look, Everyking. If you don't understand other people's opinions on this, it's not for a lack of trying on our part. It seems to me that in all likelihood, there is no 'mutually acceptable' compromise - you have, after all, continually reverted each and every change you didn't like. Would you be happy if no-one else touched this article ever again, and it was only edited by you? That seems to be what you want. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 20:42, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, certainly other people should edit the article. I haven't reverted each and every change I didn't like. Most of them, yes, I have reverted at some point or another if I thought they were harmful. But we should have a spirit of compromise here. I'm content to see some things removed; I can live with that. Why don't you do what I asked Dbenbenn to do above, and explain your stance? It would be helpful to talk not just about what is bad, but also about what is good, and what could be added. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:11, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You thought edits were harmful - no-one else did. You ignored the consensus, treated the article as your own, and reverted repeatedly and without any spirit of compromise. I asked above what you think the consensus is regarding this article, but you haven't answered. I have described my opinion at more than sufficient length already, as have others - please read and fully consider the talk page, the failed nomination for featured status, the votes for deletion on sub-articles, the talk pages for the sub-articles, and the RfC against you.<a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 22:11, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm floored. I thought some people wanted to remove maybe 25% of the content or something like that. But it turns out you want to remove 80-90%? Forgive me for saying so, but that is simply insane. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:36, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it insane? Half of the information on these pages is redundant -- I removed identical accounts of the SNL incident from three pages (leaving it on <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>, where I thought it belonged). The promotion/publicity stuff that used to be here was identical to the material in the sub-article -- it makes no sense to spin off a sub-article if you're still going to have a huge section on the main page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Everyking, you asked me whether it was everyone else or just you. I wish you'd listened to my answer, because I honestly do sympathize with your position, but please -- you're reminding me, at this point, of the juryman who never met eleven such obstinate fellows in his life.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Under the edit boxes, it says <b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</b> I think this is something you're going to have to keep in mind -- I know it must be frustrating, but at this point the consensus is against you and you're really going to have to roll with it. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadame_Sosostris_2e2c.html" title="User:Madame Sosostris">Madame Sosostris</a> 19:42, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>See, this is exactly what I was talking about. What on earth is the point of having three <i>long</i> articles on the singles if you're just going to dump the same information on the main page? <i>That's what the sub-articles are for.</i> At this point, you're making things unnecessarily complex and redundant. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadame_Sosostris_2e2c.html" title="User:Madame Sosostris">Madame Sosostris</a> 19:50, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consensus? There's a consensus to delete all the info on the "other songs"? A consensus to delete nearly all of the review info? A consensus to remove most of the about the album and making of the album info? No, I don't think there is. I think there is a broad consensus that the article should be trimmed somewhat. That does not mean there is consensus to reduce it to stub length. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:04, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree, Everyking. It appears to me that a great many people believe the shorter version of the article to be perfectly adequate; you seem to be the only one who truly supports the inclusion of all this information (including the redundant material).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also don't think it's necessary to exaggerate the situation. Nobody is reducing the article "to stub length." A stub is a few sentences long. The short version of this article is still larger than some articles on notable political figures, and we have more material on this one mid-range pop starlet than we do on people who have started wars and founded countries. She's notable, but she's not <i>this</i> notable. Just because the information exists does not mean it needs to exist on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadame_Sosostris_2e2c.html" title="User:Madame Sosostris">Madame Sosostris</a> 20:58, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think people just want the article to be a sensible size and not contain trivia of interest only to devoted fans. Trouble is, Everyking, you've obstructed so many well-intended edits and shown so little willingness to compromise that people get frustrated, and probably go too far in the other direction because it gets so tiresome watching sensible editing get vandalised again and again and again by someone who thinks the article is theirs only to protect and cherish. Still, if the two extremes of opinion are your version of the article and the most trimmed version, then a compromise might approximate to how it looked after my re-write. How does that sound? I still thought my version could be tightened up a lot more, people did more work on it but it only lasted a few hours before you reverted mine and all subsequent changes, once again completely flying in the face of consensus. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 21:10, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The information on the individual tracks must be the article. The fact that it's gone makes me feel like I could have a heart attack. Propose a concession I can make that will enable that to be restored. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:55, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One sentence per track sounds good, with links to the articles on the singles. I tried doing that earlier, but since I'm not a fan of Ashlee, I only had your version to work from, and you didn't include descriptive sentences for some of the tracks. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 06:12, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm seeing much higher quality edits in recent versions. The article is beginning to look more like something that could be featured. Thanks.

<dd>It's a cultural topic of niche significance. If edit warring here keeps you from edit warring over something more important, that's good. Ideally, though, you wouldn't edit war anywhere and would just respect the value of information. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:23, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You cannot accuse me of edit warring because I never, ever edit war, and I certainly have not come close to edit warring on this article. I could get rather angry about this, actually, but I won't make an issue out of it unless you repeat your false accusation. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:39, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Normally you're fairly moderate about it, although today it seems you've become more aggressive. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:40, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Before you continue along this line of argument, let me just point out that I have made precisely three edits to the article in the past week, whereas you have made six edits today alone. I demand that you cease your disgraceful and false accusations of edit warring. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:12, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I quote: <i>I'll step in here and revert an attempt to restore the old, longwinded stuff.</i> But OK, if you promise to never revert again, then I in turn will drop my accusation of edit warring. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:18, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why don't <b>you</b> promise to never revert again and meet the text as shown on every edit page, and as already pointed out to you: <b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</b> I don't know how the rest of us can make you understand this—this is <b>not</b> your article to unilaterally own. —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuropedia_a641.html" title="User:Neuropedia">Neuropedia</a> 23:42, 2005 Jan 16 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Here's an idea</span></h2>
<p>Not sure where else to put this. Would it be possible to merge/condense the articles for <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28song%29.html" title="Shadow (song)">Shadow (song)</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_%28song%29_b275.html" title="La La (song)">La La (song)</a>, and <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieces_of_Me_d709.html" title="Pieces of Me">Pieces of Me</a> into one article -- say, Autobiography singles? That strikes me as a decent sort of compromise -- obviously those articles aren't going to go away, but having one page would make things a bit less unwieldy here in the Ashlee Simpson Universe.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure its possible, but I don't see the reason for it. Those articles are fine as they are. No need to over-condense.

<p>If the article on the album is trimmed to a reasonable length I see no reason why we should not merge and redirect the singles. People wanting to know about Pieces of Me, for instance, would benefit somewhat from the added context of reading about it in the context of the album, and people wanting to know about the album's most notable tracks would not have to go off to look at the articles for the individual singles. Unless singles stand out so strongly that they probably deserve an article of their own (Good Vibrations, Purple Haze, Smells Like Teenage Spirit, etc) I favor covering them under the album--this applies especially to recent singles, in view of the decline of the single. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:05, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The album is what sold well in the US, but the singles (which in this case are more like EPs, but the labels are marketing them as singles) are what have sold well in other markets.

<dd><i>Autobiography</i> opens the album with retro instrumentation and dark chords, the lyrics evoking difficult times ("Got bruises on my heart") moderated with optimism ("Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually"). "<a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieces_of_Me_d709.html" title="Pieces of Me">Pieces of Me</a>" follows with a simple acoustic guitar accompaniment to a tale of happiness with an understanding lover, while gradually building into full pop instrumentation.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28song%29.html" title="Shadow (song)">Shadow</a>" is a slower, soul-tinged tune in which Simpson recounts playing a lesser role to her sister as a child, becoming free to pursue her own dreams as she grew older. A driving beat and bright guitar licks back "<a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_%28song%29_b275.html" title="La La (song)">La La</a>", a playful song filled with innuendo. The softer "Love Makes the World Go Around" describes the disappointment of an ending relationship, with "I guess promises are better left unsaid."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Better Off" is a song of ambivalence about a relationship. She describes insecurity ("don't want to lose what I've found"), but on balance she is "better off in every way". The slow rocker "Love Me for Me" is filled with contradictory feelings in a new relationship: "Stay here, get out." The synth-driven "Surrender" follows with Simpson consenting to a breakup. "Don't you know you're only wasting time", she sings; by stalling "you make your misery my company."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Unreachable" layers a plodding piano line and vintage Chamberlin sounds over regrets in rushing into a relationship. "Nothing New" conveys impatience with stagnation atop a steady beat and effect-layered guitars. The jangling "Give it all Away" is an encouragement to stand on one's own feet: "open your eyes and find yourself", Simpson urges. The album winds down with "Undiscovered", pondering what might have been in a lost pairing.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">making the album</span></h2>
<p>The three sentences now under "promotion and publicity" have little to do with promotion and publicity. They used to be part of the "making of the album" section, where they were appropriate. Also, some of the real promotion/publicity content will probably have to be merged back soon, for a reason that I presume is obvious. Can we please restore that section, along with some of the information it formerly contained? The making of any notable album is worth a summary. If acceptable, we can discuss what to restore here first if anyone disagrees with restoring the full old version of the section. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:23, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of the "making the album" section covered her making the album on her television show, which means it is in fact very strongly related to promotion and publicity. The making of her album should be discussed on the article for the television show...It probably doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✉</sup></a> 05:48, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, some of it did, but the most important parts didn't. What do you say we restore just the parts that don't mention the TV show? It wouldn't make much sense to talk about the making the album in the article about the TV show, except for those aspects that were actually seen on the show. There's a lot more we can say that we can derive from interviews and such, unrelated to the reality show. I think that's perfectly good information, but I don't mind trimming or reworking it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:59, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As iMeowbot has pointed out, orchestrated responses to questions about her music aren't really adding anything aside from insight into her publicists' head. Is there anything that is actually unusual or strange or notable about the making of the album? The only thing I can think of is mentioning that its progress was shown on her television program. That sort of fits right into the publicity section nicely as it is. Mind pasting what you had in mind here so it can be looked at and possibly written into something that flows nicely before it is inserted into the article? <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✉</sup></a> 06:07, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "unusual" parts aren't unique to this album. They are part of the John Shanks formula, and apply equally, for example, to similar Duff, Clarkson, Anastacia etc. tracks. The results can be impressive, but they should be discussed in the Shanks article, not so much here. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a></dd>

<dd>In a television interview on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Late_Show_with_Craig_Kilborn_2bf9.html" title="The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn">The Late Late Show</a> with <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Kilborn_c22d.html" title="Craig Kilborn">Craig Kilborn</a></i> in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2003.html" title="November 2003">November 2003</a>, Simpson said that she had been working on her album for about a year before that point, and that the process had been getting more serious for about three months. <a href="http://popdirt.com/article22714.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://popdirt.com/article22714.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Later, in a 2004 interview, Simpson said that at first <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record labels</a> would not meet with her. As she described it, "people would be like, 'Oh, she just wants to be like her sister'." For her part, Simpson said that she did not want to meet with Jessica's record label (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia</a>): "I wanted to be signed because of my <i>music</i>". She eventually signed with Geffen instead: "You find the people who believe in you—and it works."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">6</a></sup></small> At the beginning of <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i>, Simpson is shown signing the record deal (which also occurred about three months before November 2003, according to the <i>Late Late Show</i> interview).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simpson initially did not want to do the reality show, she has said, but was persuaded by her father and manager, Joe Simpson, when he said that they would make it about her album and the music: "...I thought that was kind of cool. You're actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">6</a></sup></small> She also wanted to distinguish herself from her sister by showing their differences, including their different musical styles and tastes. In episode one of the show, some of the early stages of songwriting are seen, and in episode two, Simpson records some early <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demos</a> of songs; she is seen having trouble singing one song, "Fly Away", which did not make it onto the album. (Other early songs that failed to make it onto the album, at least under the known titles, were mentioned in the November 2003 <i>Late Late Show</i> interview: "Sold Me Out" and "Hurt for You".) But Schur "wasn't feeling the demos", as she says, and he wanted her to work with other people; in episode three she meets with several of them: John Feldmann, <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Chambers_19c6.html" title="Guy Chambers">Guy Chambers</a>, and the producing team <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_%28music_producer%29_e968.html" title="The Matrix (music producer)">The Matrix</a>. Later in the same episode, she begins to work with John Shanks, who became the producer of her album.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The recording of the song "Surrender" features in this episode, as she works with Shanks; she says that it was written in only about two hours. Later, Simpson becomes upset when she thinks Schur wants the song to be more pop-sounding—she is told that Schur thinks she should sound "prettier", although at the same time she is told that it is "probably good" that Schur compared the song to the music of the band <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garbage_%28band%29.html" title="Garbage (band)">Garbage</a>. After she and her father discuss it with Schur, things are worked out; Schur also says that the song reminds him of the band <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hole_%28band%29.html" title="Hole (band)">Hole</a>, another rock band with a female vocalist—"it reminds me of Courtney Love on <i><a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_Skin_59dd.html" title="Celebrity Skin">Celebrity Skin</a></i>", he elaborates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The recording of "Pieces of Me" is included in episode four of <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i>; because this episode focuses on Simpson's relationship with Cabrera, the recording of the song ties in to her personal life. "Shadow" is introduced at the beginning of episode five, when she talks with John Shanks about the song and then begins singing it while Shanks plays guitar; this is followed by a montage of video clips from Simpson's childhood.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simpson has said of making the album: "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">2</a></sup></small> In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's <a href="../../../l/i/n/Liner_notes.html" title="Liner notes">liner notes</a>, Simpson includes <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benji_Madden_4e4e.html" title="Benji Madden">Benji</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Madden_2d60.html" title="Joel Madden">Joel Madden</a> of the band <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Charlotte_7c04.html" title="Good Charlotte">Good Charlotte</a>; she worked with them on a song that did not make it onto the album. <a href="http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/transcripts.asp?artist=1043" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/transcripts.asp?artist=1043" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simpson's photoshoot for the album's cover and liner notes booklet features at the beginning of episode seven of the show. Many of the pictures, such as the one used for the front cover of the album, show Simpson in a dark setting, with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a>-style writing scrawled on the wall behind her. In other pictures from this photoshoot, found inside the CD booklet, Simpson poses standing with a microphone in front of a white background. The album's photography is credited to Mark Liddell, and its design is credited to Soap Design Co.</dd>

<p>Much of that belongs in the article about the show, as I said before. Information about talk show appearances can be summarized if you insist on their inclusion, perhaps with one or two vital quotes included. I also don't think the photoshoot information is that vital to the article, particularly in concerns to this section. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✉</sup></a> 10:00, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, OK, I think it is, but I'll concede the point, at least for now. What if I could cut this section down to maybe 60% of the size it had been in the old version? Do you think that'd be enough? I don't really feel like trying to rewrite it now—it's extremely difficult for me to do rewrites when I believe all or nearly all of the information is good, because, I mean, how can I bear to cut any of it?—but I will try my hand at it at some point soon, if you'll at least give it consideration. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:03, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rewritten section</span></h2>
<p>Simpson signed with Geffen Records in 2003. In a 2004 interview, she said that at first, when she was seeking a recording contract, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record labels</a> would not meet with her. As she described it, "people would be like, 'Oh, she just wants to be like her sister'." For her part, Simpson said that she did not want to meet with Jessica's record label (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia</a>): "I wanted to be signed because of my <i>music</i>". She eventually signed with Geffen instead: "You find the people who believe in you—and it works."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">6</a></sup></small></p>
<p>Simpson initially did not want to do the reality show, she has said, but was persuaded by her father and manager, Joe Simpson, when he said that they would make it about her album and the music: "...I thought that was kind of cool. You're actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">6</a></sup></small> She also wanted to distinguish herself from her sister by showing their differences, including their different musical styles and tastes. In episode one of the show, some of the early stages of songwriting are seen, and she is seen working with Steve Fox and Stan Frazier. In episode two, she records some early <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demos</a> of songs; she is seen having trouble singing one song, "Fly Away", which did not make it onto the album. But Schur did not like the demos and wanted her to work with other people; in episode three she meets with several of them: John Feldmann, <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Chambers_19c6.html" title="Guy Chambers">Guy Chambers</a>, and the producing team <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_%28music_producer%29_e968.html" title="The Matrix (music producer)">The Matrix</a>. Later in the same episode, she begins to work with John Shanks, who became the producer of her album, and in episode four she is seen working with Kara DioGuardi as well, on "Pieces of Me".</p>
<p>Simpson has said of making the album: "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">2</a></sup></small> In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's <a href="../../../l/i/n/Liner_notes.html" title="Liner notes">liner notes</a>, Simpson includes <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benji_Madden_4e4e.html" title="Benji Madden">Benji</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Madden_2d60.html" title="Joel Madden">Joel Madden</a> of the band <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Charlotte_7c04.html" title="Good Charlotte">Good Charlotte</a>; she worked with them on a song that did not make it onto the album. <a href="http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/transcripts.asp?artist=1043" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/transcripts.asp?artist=1043" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Simpson's photoshoot for the album's cover and liner notes booklet features at the beginning of episode seven of the reality show. Many of the pictures, such as the one used for the front cover of the album, show Simpson in a dark setting, with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a>-style writing scrawled on the wall behind her. In other pictures from this photoshoot, found inside the CD booklet, Simpson poses standing with a microphone in front of a white background. The album's photography is credited to Mark Liddell, and its design is credited to Soap Design Co.</p>

<p>Meowbot, the Shadow video didn't premiere on Sept. 20; it premiered about a week earlier, but the table makes it seem like she was there for the premiere.

<dd>OK, much as I hate it, that was the vote. Apparently we can have articles on every Pokemon character but not an article on promotion for a multi-platinum album. Go figure. Well, I've made some revisions, hopefully they aren't controversial. I didn't get any objections to the "making" section, so I added that, and I made a few other changes which probably won't be a big deal. I didn't think we needed the Metacritic review, for example. I fixed the quote incorrectly attributed to Joe. I removed "Shadow (video)" from the promotion table, since she wasn't there to introduce it. Removed the second table from the sales section; that would probably be the most bold of the changes, but since we had a subarticle on sales which survived VfD, I believe the table should be there and the sales section here should be as succinct as possible. Fixed "Give it all away" --&gt; "Giving It All Away".</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I'd like us to consider adding back some of the critical assessments of the individual tracks.

<p>Why is there both a table of peak chart positions and a list of them in the text? Do we need a week by week table of US and Canada chart positions?

<dd>The remaining table gives an exhaustive week-by-week accounting of US and Canadian chart positions for no good reason, but at least it's small. The text deals with North American unit sales and chart positions in other countries, so it's not duplication. The week-by-week sales table should <i>not</i> be restored because it is misleading through omission. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 16:35, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I'll try to make a more sophisticated argument&#160;:) A list of TV appearances is really only of interest to hard core fans, and thus should not be in an encyclopaedia. Any really notable TV appearances should be mentioned, but we really don't need to know every time she's appeared on TV. The Who once packed a drum kit so full of explosives for a dramatic finale that it completely blew itself up, to the horror of the band. That made a very notable TV appearance. They appeared probably hundreds of other times, but it would not be encyclopaedic to have a list of them all because the vast majority were routine, non-notable TV appearances. I have appeared several times on a very notable UK TV program, but if anyone were to make a wikipedia entry for me with a list of my appearances, I'd be the first to VfD it&#160;:) TV appearance does not equal notable, and I think the table should be removed. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 19:28, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hold on a minute. Why were you on TV? Ashlee Simpson was on TV because she's a famous celebrity and musical artist known to many millions of people and has sold millions of albums. Her appearances on TV are notable simply by virtue of the fact that so many people have seen them and so many people care about them. If you've even got 10% of her importance, not only should you have an article, but I feel a bit humbled to be talking to you. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:39, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's all right - no need to kow tow, I'm very modest about it&#160;:) I am known to millions of people - I have been recognised in the street.

Are there any objections to doing this? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:04, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Depends on how they're written as well as the NPOViness and value of the quotes. Most of them last time round were positive, so you'd either have to include a negative quote to balance things out, or not add them at all to avoid lengthening a still crufty (IMO) article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:11, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lot of the quotes were simply descriptive, or Simpson taking about their meanings. Do you object to those? If I include a positive critical quote, then I will include a negative one to balance it. And vice versa. And I know you think information is cruft, John, you don't have to keep reiterating that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:55, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless they said it impeccably, I don't think the quotes (at least in full sentences) should be included. Instead you can summarise them, i.e. "Describing 'Unreachable', Simpson called it..." or "<i>Rolling Stone</i> described "La La" as..." And there's a difference between information and cruft. Information informs and enhances one's understanding. Data with no meaning attached or artificially extrapolated data is cruft (for example, there is no point in saying, i.e. "As a music album, all the songs on <i>Autobiography</i> contained chords" (not that that sort of blatant cruft is in the article). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:08, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But you have to agree that most people disagree with you on what enhances the reader's understanding and what's only of interest to hardcore fans. Why do you want to re-add information that's been taken out? It's been removed as part of the normal editing process, has it not? It sounds to me like you're trying to get everyone to endorse what is effectively a revert to your preferred version. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 14:18, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Most people don't disagree with me on that. It's just that I'm in the unfortunate position of having to defend the standard view of Wikipedia on a topic that apparently is not a popular one among Wikipedians. On more popular topics, deletionism like this would mean mass fury. Besides, even among deletionists here, there has not been any consensus on anything except that the old version of the article needed a bit of trimming. There was certainly no consensus to reduce it to stub length. That is why I'm going point-by-point, trying to see what people will agree to and what they will not. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:27, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is, I think it should be very clear by now that the consensus was strongly against your preferred version of the article, as well as your endless reversions of attempts to change it.

<p>Just been through the article again, removing what I saw as POV review-like descriptions of some songs, a few unnecessary phrases that were either duplicating what was elsewhere or were not really informative, and the tables of chart positions and TV appearances. Chart positions are adequately described in the text. The consensus seems to be that notable TV appearances can be included in the text. A table seems like overkill to me, and detracts from the look of the article. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 21:18, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is part of the reason for putting these things in tables, it more clearly illustrates the excess. For perspective, recent articles about the Tonight Show note that 22,000 guests appeared while Carson was hosting. It's an everyday occurrence for bands to make these guest appearances, not remarkable in the least. Own show? Yes. Starring in a special? Yes. Normal talk show? No, unless it generates a lot of press other than the label's and stations' own releases. Listing the <i>number</i> of other appearances would certainly be reasonable.</dd>
<dd>With all those shows listed, the article is a bad parody of the Cheech &amp; Chong "Sister Mary Elephant " sketch. "On the first day of my summer vacation, I woke up. Then I went downtown to look for a job. Then I hung out in front of the drug store. On the second day of my summer vacation, I woke up. Then I went downtown to look for a job.

<p>Just to note that Carnildo restored the opening sentence of the 'about the album' section, which reads <i>According to Simpson, the album is strongly autobiographical, with lyrics that were inspired by her feelings and experiences</i>. I removed it because the first part seems obvious - is it necessary to mention that an album called autobiography is strongly autobiographical? - and the second part is duplicating what's said in the third sentence of the para. I'm in favour of removing the sentence again - anyone else have opinions? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 13:39, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that an album called "Autobiography" doesn't need an explanation that it is autobiographical. If the title was a deliberate misnomer and it actually <i>isn't</i> autobiographical... now that would require an explanation. I'm in favour of removing the sentence as well. Another possible (but unnecessarily wordy) rewrite would be <i>According to Simpson, the album contains lyrics that were inspired by her feelings and experiences</i>. However, I think the same could be said of a lot of self-written lyrics. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:23, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Is there another way the data could be presented? The table on chart positions disrupts the flow of the article by its size, and as a solid block of text it would cause people's eyes to glaze over.

<dl>
<dd>I very strongly believe the table on chart positions should be included, although it should be converted to run vertically because it was starting to stretch out too long horizontally. The TV appearances, well, that can go in either prose or a table, I don't have a strong preference there. I'd be agreeable to converting it to prose and perhaps omitting a few of the less important appearances if most of the information was retained. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:49, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why do we need a week by week listing of chart positions? This is of interest only to hard core fans. Even for bands I am a hardcore fan of, I don't think an encyclopaedia should include this stuff. A couple of notable TV appearances mentioned in the text should suffice to give the idea that she made TV appearances to promote the album. This is an encyclopaedia, not an almanac. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:21, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My thoughts precisely. Whenever I borrow books from the municipal library on music, they never have more than the most major chart details (usually where and when it peaked, how long it stayed there, and how long the record stayed on the charts in general). We're a general enyclopedia. Data with no application or meaning to the article like this shouldn't be in it. You can't compare it to our mathematical or scientific articles, because the things there have application and meaning to the article, because they explain more. I don't understand at all how these data, whether in table or prose, have application or provide meaning to the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:18, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it's relevant, notable information. We're not a "general encyclopedia".

<dd>No, it is not. Such significance can be easily represented by where and when it peaked, how long it stayed there, and how long the record stayed on the charts in general, and a list of how many TV appearance Simpson made to promote the album, perhaps naming two or three of the most notable appearances. There is no need to list everyone of them. The point is lost in the mass of statistics. It is as <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherlock_Holmes_4282.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> once said — a man writing a letter hides his meaning in a cloud of words, while a man writing a telegram has to make his meaning clear through brevity.

They might even want to know where and when he consumed it, and whether it was in the company of others or by himself. Does this mean we should have a section in the Napoleon Bonaparte chronicling his gastronomic adventures? It would be ridiculous enough if we were to provide an exact count or even approximation of how many times he ate baguette, but would you want a section or even article devoted to the exploits of Napoleon's stomach? Now substitute Simpson promotional appearances for the mention of how many times Napoleon ate baguette, and substitute Ashlee Simpson for Napoleon's name. Get the picture? If we want to show Napoleon's devotion to French bakery, we could easily provide an approximation of how many times he consumed baguette. Similarly, if we want to show the promotion devoted to this album, we could easily provide the number of promotional appearances made and a paragraph or two about the most notable ones. We don't need a list of them, whether in prose or tabular form. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 04:23, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But those reviews really don't tell us much beyond what the other reviews give us. A couple of sample quotes add a lot to an album article, but paragraphs and paragraphs of review quotes don't make for enjoyable reading. I think your 'reinstatements' of information (i.e. reverts) are not helpful. If an editor cuts too much from the article, someone will restore it, but we all know that your vision of what the article should contain is very different to the consensus, so your requests to be allowed to restore information are not likely to meet with community approval, and if normal editing proceeds, you're likely to be making an awful lot of requests for information to be restored. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 22:53, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that Meowbot only deleted it because we at that time still had the subarticle (correct me if I'm wrong), and you deleted it apparently because you thought every country in the world should have a similar chart, reasoning which frankly seems spurious to me. So that really seems to leave only one objection. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:40, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The information is US-centric because outside a few English-speaking countries -- Australia, Canada, the UK and US -- this stuff really hasn't sold very well. There are (or were) some mentions of, erm, Norway and Switzerland, I think. The charting was brief and not high. Even those numbers don't tell us very much, since they're rather small markets, and not providing a good picture of sales for the rest of the continent. I know that there are fans scattered elsewhere, but when interviewed every last one has the same story: found out about the album through a foreign friend or by chance on the Internet, and no one locally has heard of it. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 06:16, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, it seems that you have learned nothing from your encounter with ArbCom. If there is general agreement that the table belongs in the article, you have no need to add it to the article because someone else will. If there isn't general agreement and you still think it's okay to disobey whatever conditions ArbCom has placed on you provided you want something bad enough, then you don't respect ArbCom's decisions. That being the case, at the very least you should not be editing these particular articles, and arguably you are unfit to hold sysop powers (which are in the end backed by and subject to ArbCom's final word). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:03, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look. The table contains a great deal of info. It represents a great deal of work. It enormously enhances the article. Will someone please restore it? There were initially three tables. I'm only asking for one to be restored now, the US/Canada week-by-week. I don't seem to be encountering much opposition, yet I can't restore it because there are people waiting to attack me for the slightest perceived infraction, no matter how weak the argument. Here we have a situation that is pretty absurd. I'm perfectly willing to accept a 24 hour block to have the table back in the article, because I feel it is that important, but I want to be sure that nobody is going to come along and revert me after I'm blocked. That would make it a completely wasted effort. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:32, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It may be that the only way to get anything decided on this article is to hold votes on each individual point.

<li>I like the idea of having a chart, as a matter of simplicity and convenience. If I want to see how the album did in its 10th week in Canada, I don't want to wade through six paragraphs to get to it. Conversely, I don't think we need text for data that's so much simpler in table form. Therefore, having a table is just common sense. However, the current table forces users to sidescroll, and sidescroll as we all know, is evil. So: we clip the table to 15 weeks so as to stop the sidescrolling, or else turn it vertical, and keep it. Possibly, we move it to someplace else in the article. Possibly, we add chart data for other countries. (They do exist!) [[User:Premeditated Chaos|User:Premeditated Chaos/Sig]] 23:37, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It looks like Option 3 has won out on Poll 1 for the time being. I think we should leave the polls open indefinitely so that any newcomers to the discussion can sway things if the feeling changes.

<p>I love the chart! Great idea, Carnildo! It lets you see at a glance how the sales changed over time, without having to parse all those numbers. One suggestion: could you remove the caption?

This paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ashlee worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks, receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. Sugar Ray drummer Stan Frazier was one of the co-writers of "Unreachable". (See the track listing.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>....already effectively says that Simpson was credited with all the co-writing, but it does so in kind of an indirect way. What do you say we reword it so as to make her credits a bit more clear? I also think the last sentence about Frazier is superfluous; the info made sense in the context of an old version of the sentence, but now it has been reduced to the point where it just kind of sticks out uselessly on its own. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:59, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point of the poll, allegedly, is to get consensus/approval/sense of the editors for a change. Your view lost, <s>7-nil</s> 10-nil, Jimmy, but now you're pretending it never happened. So you're clearly intending to ignore any results you don't like.

<dd>Simpson described the process of writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diary.html" title="Diary">diary</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd like to explain my reasons. First, it's an Ashlee Simpson album, so the default assumption is that she wrote the songs. Second, the phrase "is credited with" makes it sound like she didn't <i>really</i> write them, she just got the credit. If that's the case, it should be stated explicitly.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that "is credited with" is factually correct, whereas "wrote" is harder to verify. But that's just a technicality. Again, if there's any real issue about who wrote the songs, it should be written out. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 19:09, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I don't agree with the change. Many artists don't write their own songs. I'd leave that sentence the way it is: there's nothing wrong with it! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 02:17, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People <i>don't</i> take that for granted when it comes to music like this. That she was so involved in the songwriting is considered rather unusual. But obviously we can't verify if she <i>really</i> co-wrote them, at least to a substantial extent, or was just credited to create that appearance. The evidence of the reality show would suggest the former, but there are certainly people who hold the latter position. I had initially just stated "co-wrote", but later someone changed it to qualify it, and I accepted that as being necessary for NPOV. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:05, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not on a witchhunt. I haven't made any edits to the main article, and come to think of it, I've been pretty careful not to. What I've done is made comments. Now, <i>in my opinion</i>, it looks like you performed some edits which can be interpreted as reverting. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> performed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=9861935&amp;oldid=9859710" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=9861935&amp;oldid=9859710" rel="nofollow">edit</a> to the original text, and it appears as if you reversed at least some of this edit over the course of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=9863718&amp;oldid=9861935" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=9863718&amp;oldid=9861935" rel="nofollow">a few edits</a>. Now, according to the RfAr, whether this is a revert or not is at an admin's discretion. I'm not an admin. Therefore, I'll let another admin look at this and decide if it's a revert. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 20:30, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't because I'm not enough of an Ashlee Simpson expert. I remember that I suggested asking someone else for the table, and someone else suggested a couple of contributors to ask, but you restored the table before I could get around to asking them. That was much shorter than two or three days. I don't know about any other cases, but this was the first one I remember after your arbitration ruling, so I don't think I missed much. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 00:46, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>iMeowbot seems rather knowledgeable about Simpson, but I don't think Everyking trusts him. As I said before, Shard or Angel Tiger would be people Everyking could refer to; sadly, they don't seem very active. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:11, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She did have input into the content of the lyrics.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then that's good enough for me. While Everyking not trusting iMeowbot is a problem in terms of interpersonal relations, iMeowbot has two things that are important to this case: (1) Ashlee Simpson knowledge (2) No ban on reverting Ashlee Simpson articles. The revert ban means that Everyking has to work with people that he may not trust or like. The other alternative is to be banned for breaking an Arbcom ruling. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 12:20, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There really isn't a nice way to put this, so I'll need to be sort of blunt. Simply stated, you don't know what you are talking about. People do '<i>not</i> rely on those charts for anything substantial, they are published mainly for entertainment, like horoscopes, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN THE FACTS. Again, the real numbers are the UNIT SALES. RIAA awards are meaningful numbers. Billboard and similar chart positions are not. Imagine if casualties in Word War II were given in this format: On week three, Germany lost more lives than France, but on week four the French lost more people than Fiji. This is absolutely bogus because the magnitude of the differences is being completely ignored, and including tallies of that nature would be laughable. In an album article, doing so is equally laughable. If you want to include the actual sales data, GET THE ACTUAL SALES DATA from SoundScan. The numbers you are insisting on including are garbage. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 19:11, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The plain-line text was an early form of the table format. Recently there's been a shift towards the tables. But it doesn't really matter.

<dd>You claimed "every other article" has this chart: my sampling of 5 extraordinarily noteworthy album articles indicates they don't. I asked for specific examples to compare: you haven't provided them. Now, you claim there's some sort of shift from plain-text to tables (along with a strawman fallacy about what I allegedly want) to rationalize the fact I couldn't find what you claimed.</dd>
<dd>So please, put up or shut up. Find 10 examples of album articles that

<p>Point 2 has a majority and Point 3 has a clear consensus, so I suppose I will implement them soon, unless somebody else does it first.

<dd>Well, if you'd leave me alone or work cooperatively with me, a vastly better article would exist.

I think clipping my toenails would be better use of my time, because any time I'm going to write something, I have to think: "OK, wait a minute, be careful. You've got to make it 'Calton-proof' so he won't find something in it to attack you for." But then I do that and, without fail, you find something in it to attack me for no matter how careful I am. And we've got volumes worth of this stuff, insult after insult after sarcastic remark. But the alternative is that I just stop talking, and then the article stays perpetually in its presently stubbish state. So I keep talking, and the same old routine gets played out over and over again. So, Calton, and John and anyone else involved also, why don't we make a deal: no more insults, belittling remarks, bitter sarcasm/cynicism, etc., from either side.

<dd><i>Well, if you'd leave me alone...a vastly better article would exist.</i> Very telling. "Leaving you alone" was <i>precisely</i> what was going on before ArbCom stepped in -- except you got people to "leave you alone" by driving them off -- and vastly better articles did NOT result (not according to "some people", as you mischaracterize it, but by an over-whelming majority). And as for the rest of your paragraph, I dispute every single sentence in it as being, variously, misleading, hyperbolic, disingenuous, and occasionally outright false -- and, sadly, not out of character. So no, it's not "fair" -- especially since content discussion HAS been going on, with you leaping to self-serving conclusions, dodging simple questions, and hunting for loopholes. You want me to assume good faith -- demonstrate some. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 11:30, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Well, if you'd leave me alone or work cooperatively with me, a vastly better article would exist. One where a reader could be almost guaranteed to find whatever information he or she is looking for.</i> Debatable. It's a lot harder to find a fact you're looking for in four or five pages of meandering trivia than in two or three of facts people want to know. People aren't looking for an article on what others say about Autobiography or what Ashlee thinks of something or something about a music video that just happened to be for a song on Autobiography or mind-numbing extensive details of charting positions. They're looking for things someone would expect to be able to find out about Autobiography in an encyclopedia: who made it, what songs were on it, a brief description of the songs, a little bit about how the public and critics responded (not two pages worth of critics' quotes and statistics from which little can be inferred; Wikipedia is not home to source material), and maybe a little bit about how it was promoted (although I doubt few would be interested in reading more than three paragraphs on this).</dd>
<dd><i>Instead, a couple things have happened: I can't edit much anymore because a lot of that would require restoring text, and according to some people, that's a revert;</i> Restoring an article to an older revision with or without a few tweaks is a revert. Plain and simple. It's clear-cut. In addition, reverts are not an entitlement; refer to the arbitration case on the Darwin-Lincoln dispute (which oddly mirrors this one quite a bit). <i>and I'm bogged down in discussion here, fending off your bitter insults in particular, when I could be doing</i> something <i>constructive.</i> You made those polls. Voting should be accompanied by discussion; otherwise there is no point. If you were expecting people to just nod their heads and agree with you, well, sorry... <i>I think clipping my toenails would be better use of my time, because any time I'm going to write something, I have to think: "OK, wait a minute, be careful.

Whenever we ask you a hard question, you never fail to go off on some long diatribe about how annoying we are and WHY WON'T WE JUST LEAVE YOU ALONE. <i>But the alternative is that I just stop talking, and then the article stays perpetually in its presently stubbish state.

<p>It's not a proposal which can be made conditional on anything other than the other side's agreement. Either you agree not to insult and belittle anymore, or you don't. If you're going to impose some unrelated condition—I'll stop treating you that way <i>if</i>...—then there's no deal.</p>
<p>Certainly articles need to be accessible. This does not require throwing out information. I can write one or two very simple and accessible paragraphs summing up World War II, but they'd be almost worthless as an article. It's all a matter of organization. You have a good lead section. Then you have sections with headings, you have summary sentences within them, and you link to subarticles with further detail. Thus you satisfy people who are looking for all different levels of detail. Furthermore, I think it insults the reader to say, "You don't need to know about this." If I wrote a section called "Album design", nobody who didn't care about the album design would bother to read it, they'd just move on. But for somebody who was interested in that, we would become an invaluable resource on the subject of <i>Autobiography</i> album design.</p>
<p>You did not seem to understand what you were voting for, based on your comment. I requested that you clarify your vote, that's fair.

<dd><i>It's not a proposal which can be made conditional on anything other than the other side's agreement.</i> Then I suppose you'll continue dodging the hard questions. Fine by me. <i>Certainly articles need to be accessible. This does not require throwing out information.</i> Of course not, but recording data is a whole other issue. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not home to source data. Chart details are source data unless we use them to explain or clarify something. The World War II article doesn't have a table about casualties or drones on about how "X people killed were Germans, while Y people killed were Americans..." <b>Data and information are not the same</b>. I'm not arguing for articles that must be readable by all, but I'm arguing for articles that are informative and not masses of raw data readers are expected to piece together. <i>You did not seem to understand what you were voting for, based on your comment.</i> Possibly. <i>I requested that you clarify your vote, that's fair.</i> Most of us don't keep this page on our watchlists, let alone visit it everyday.

And no, I am not going to take every little thing to your talk page for your convenience. Either follow the talk page or accept not having input. Nothing is being done overnight. If you even check here once every few days you'll still have input. But if you rely on me to bring things to your attention on your own user talk, well, I guess you won't have input, then.

<dd>See for yourself. Aside from a few sentences, they don't bother giving more than one or two hard facts. They don't provide a complicated breakdown of casualties by nationality or side or anything like that. Why? Because most people don't need them. Maybe a summary, which is what I've been advocating, but certainly not every conceivable trivial data one could conceivably desire to know. <i>But if you rely on me to bring things to your attention on your own user talk, well, I guess you won't have input, then.</i> If you want to ignore others' opinions, asking them to clarify first would always be a good thing. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:21, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>An article on WWII <i>definitely should</i> mention casualties by nationality (possibly in a subarticle). That is <i>extremely important</i>. Our philosophical differences seem to be huge.

<dl>
<dd>There is a list of casualties article, but it takes a bit of digging to find, and is of dubious enyclopedic value. You see, the articles don't prize the data as much as you seem to prize charting data. Instead, they use the data to illustrate and explain. For example, they might note that the Americans suffered fewer civilian casualties because the war was not fought on American soil. Or they might demonstrate Stalin's willingness to sacrifice his soldiers by pointing to the enormous casualty figure for the Soviets. They would not blabber, "The Americans lost X soldiers and Y civilians, while the British lost U soldiers and V civilians. The Germans on the other hand suffered heavier casualties of W soldiers and Z civilians." That is exactly what you were doing when you argued for the inclusion of chart data whether in prose or tabular form. If you did something with the statistics, made them actionable as in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Wikipedia%7EInformative_0d4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Informative">Wikipedia:Informative</a>, there would be a case for including them, but you do nothing. You slap them on and act as if they inform the reader. They don't. They just add meaningless data. 08:19, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally, I would object to my votes being discarded. I stand by my opinion that the table is unnecessary. It's five numbers and five countries. The table, I agree with ambi, is not enormous, however it takes up more space that it needs to. If anything, ambi misunderstood the intentions of those who still want the information in the article, but just don't want the table. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 11:30, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>
