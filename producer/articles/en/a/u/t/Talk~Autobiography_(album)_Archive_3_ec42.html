<p>The following is an explanation of what all I did to the article. I tried my best to clean it up and make it more palatable. I truly believe my changes have been for the better here. Please try to look at them objectively before passing judgement. One thing that still needs work: The references. Many of the things I removed were attributed to sources but not actually cited. If you can re-add them with an actual cite (transcripts of interviews are great) then please do.</p>
<p><a name="Quotes" id="Quotes"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Quotes</span></h3>
<dl>
<dd>"...Basically, everything that I was going through in my life, ... I would go in the studio and write a song about it, and it was just kind of like ... a diary."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I removed this not only because it did nothing to add to the article (merely reinforces the line(s) before it) but also because I can find absoloutely no transcripts of it (for a credible cite). I did, however, keep the "reference" (though it isn't really one) in there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree, the quote adds value to the article. Reading it helps users. I trust Everyking, so no transcript is needed to verify her words. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:45, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Responding to a question from Charles Gibson on Good Morning America—"You're 19 years old; how can you have an autobiography at 19?"—Simpson said half-jokingly: "Yeah, you know, it's pretty dramatic being 19 years old; I mean, we have boyfriends, we get our hearts broken..." (July 19, 2004)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can't see what this really adds to the article or the paragraph it's in...again, it seems superfluous. Looked for a transcript to cite, but could once again find nothing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree. Once again, it adds value to the article. And again, I trust Everyking, so no transcipt is needed to verify her words. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:45, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"I wanted to have, like, that element of, you know, rock ... the cool thing about, you know, rock is just to be able to go in there and...be free, and just kind of do whatever you want", Simpson said in one interview (Total Request Live UK, September 15, 2004)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Removed, kept the "cite" (even though these aren't really cites because it's not linking to where they were taken from! someone please fix?).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article needs this quote. It's valuable interview information. A transciption of the interview would be nice to get the full effect of Simpson's words, but only showing a portion helps to zero in a specific point. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:45, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"It was one of those songs where every silly thing that was sexual that I could think of I put into the song."3 In an appearance on Total Request Live on November 18, Simpson said light-heartedly about the song that "you can take it how you wanna take it." Reactions to the song have been mixed; People magazine called it "insipid" in its review of the album.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Restated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In an appearance on <i>Total Request Live</i> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, Simpson said light-heartedly about the song that "you can take it how you wanna take it."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cite please.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, no offense, but your restatement isn't good. It lacks the nice flow of Everyking's version where Simpson's words are carefully adding value to the article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:45, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"I just hoped my album charted. I didn't expect it to be number one in the country! It was a huge shock."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simpson has said: "I think that it's an album that's, like, very true to my emotion; I think that, you know, people like to hear when somebody's being real, and you can, like, tell, if you listen to an album, if they're being real or not, you know, and I think that people have enjoyed that, and at the same time ... a lot of different ages can listen to it..." (Capital FM, London, September 15, 2004)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tried to summarize, but without a real cite...:\</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your summary sounds incomplete and like sparse without Simpson's full words. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:45, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding it being the third single, she said: "It's nice because, you know, "Pieces of Me" was, you know, an up and happy kind of song, and "Shadow" was more serious, and now I get to have fun and, you know, jump around and be crazy, so I feel like this song's probably the closest to my personality."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>although she is chronically late—"I am so late to every single meeting I go to!"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The first time I worked with John," she says during the show, "we wrote a song called "Surrender", and we did it in like two hours, something like that, and it was just so short, and like, a great song."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wading in again, my problem with the quotes - as alluded to in the post I made in the archive, above - is that Simpson almost certainly had no hand in writing the songs, and therefore she has nothing of substance to say about them. If we want to cut to the core of Simpson's music, we would need to find quotes from the songwriters, which are not forthcoming. Furthermore, these verbatim droves of 'like' and 'you know' are hard to read and reflect badly on Simpson; when news reporters quote politicians and businessmen they usually edit out of the 'ums' and 'ahs', and at the very least we need to do that here. Which leads to the further problem, which is what without the 'likes' and 'you knows', there wouldn't be much left. - <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 19:18, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Probably, removing the 'like' and 'you know' from the interviews can help, but the benefit of having those far outweight the costs. Without them, readers can't feel the true persona behind the album. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:45, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Reviews</span></h3>
<p>This was a toughie. I really have a hard time with any article that saturates itself with quotes; in an ideal world, the information should be summarized and then strongly cited. So that's what I tried to do...I removed most of the quotations, reworded the information and added cites so people could read it word-for-word if they so desired. I really think this is easier to read and doesn't make the article come across as a magazine article (something I've been taking issue with). But for records' sake, I'm copying all the quotes here (not necessarily in order):</p>

<dd>"a never-ending battle against adolescent insecurity."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>American Sweetheart</i> is tragic and blasted and pissed-off and pathetic and desperate and sad; <i>Autobiography</i> is all those things, plus it has Fruit Stripe bubblegrunge guitars and insanely chewy melodies and an ear-tickling production job." In addition, it praised Simpson's singing, stating: "...Simpson can pack so much contradictory emotion into a single line—a single word—that the music can barely contain it." <sup><small><a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_%28album%29.html#References" title="Autobiography (album)">2</a></small></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, in its review of the album, said that <i>Autobiography</i> "is a thoroughly calculated package, aiming for the same audience that embraces Avril Lavigne and Pink."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <i>Village Voice</i> review described the song as "a compact masterpiece of wrist-pumping <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Jett_ea34.html" title="Joan Jett">Joan Jett</a> rock candy".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reactions to the song have been mixed; <i>People</i> magazine called it "insipid" in its review of the album.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I really want to keep this in the article but I can't find a cite! So I just removed it for now.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>People</i> magazine said that Simpson "succumbs to cliché" on this song.</dd>
</dl>
<p>See above.</p>
<dl>
<dd>described by <i>People</i> magazine as a "bubbly" song that "should have Hilary Duff worried".</dd>

<dd>was described by <i>People</i> magazine as "Joan Jett-esque", but in its review, <i>People</i> also said that Simpson "doesn't quite nail" the song's "tough rocker-chick pose".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, IGN, in its review of the album, called it a "slow-to-mid-tempo shuffle that actually features some poignant imagery", but "falls victim to the run-of-the-mill production and eventually simplistic lyrics."</dd>
</dl>
<p>There...Don't think I missed any.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it was a good idea to summarize and/or remove the above quotes. Your definition of an ideal world greatly differs from mine. In my ideal world, the information should be kept in the article. It creates a professional tone to the article, if you don't believe me...read the article out loud. It sounds like an informative article giving specific instances of the album's impact throughout the narrative. I don't see how some people, I won't mention names, can find the reading uncomfortable or cumbersome. Unless, english isn't their first language or something. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:53, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Album and charts success</span></h3>
<p>This was apparently the subject of a huge dispute. I think I've come to a compromise: I left in more information and was more specific about the small spike at week 12. The rest of it I condensed. I honestly don't think anybody needs a 17 week play-by-play of album sales and chart positions; I have yet to see this on any other article and it could even technically qualify for original research (since it was admitted that this information was recorded as it was released...not to mention there are no cites backing it up).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your compromise isn't satisfactory. Everyking's version displayed valuable statistics and data. A citation isn't necessary. Would you delete the number of people killed in World War II because every source has a different number? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShard_a366.html" title="User:Shard">Shard</a> 02:57, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I dispute that the week by week chart positions are valuable statistics and data. I would delete them all and simply state "Debuted at No 1. Went Platinum very quickly." The rest is pure fancruft. I mean I am a fan of certain bands and the only thing that interests me is the highest position that the CD reached, and even then I don't try and add this information to wikipedia, instead I summarise in some way all the chart postitions <i>worldwide</i> and ideally find a citation to support this. Also the week by week chart positions are <i>original research</i>. By all means publish the information somewhere else and then link to it for those that are interested. - <a href="../../../d/r/s/User%7EDrstuey_fc26.html" title="User:Drstuey">Drstuey</a> 06:11, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then why not do so in the other direction. Check each of the changes in turn, and describe why you have a problem with any of them you disagree with.

<dd>Popular opinion already does, and I took great pains to lay out my changes one by one for everybody to see here. The only major thing I did was remove/condense/re-cite the excessive quotes in the article- and I copied all of the quotes here for archives' sake. I agree wholeheartedly with Sannse: I have no problem with changes being made (you'll notice I encouraged them because the article was sorely lacking in cites) but I strongly disagree with all my work being immediately reverted just because. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">Reene (リニ)</a> 23:13, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't agree this was bulldozing. The large number of quotes really made this less comfortable to read and the information contained in the quotes can be better presented in another form. From what I see of the changes, Reene has been careful not to remove too much information. And she has given a lot of information in talk to explain her changes - that's valuble -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 23:17, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll also say that I think your last edit comment was unfair. The implication that Reene is not being civil or editing collaboratively with this edit is not on. She has made careful changes and explained them fully in talk - that's collaborative editing - reverting is not. I know that there is a lot of argument behind all this, and a lot of bad feeling has developed, but I think that this edit can be built on rather than discarded. What's happening again on this article is simply extening the bad feeling -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 23:22, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will happily discuss any of the changes, but they must be discussed one at a time. Sannse, I know you're a reasonable editor, but understand that Reene is not being reasonable, and that should be obvious to anyone reading this. You cannot reasonably expect me to have my article wrecked and have to deal with that all at once. My personal opinion is that Reene simply doesn't like Ashlee Simpson and has decided, by extension, that she doesn't like me either, and consequently she wants to get on my nerves. In which case she is succeeding brilliantly. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:23, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyking, I simply don't agree that Reene's edits are wrecking the article, to my eyes they are improving an already good piece of work. Although I do agree that personalities are beginning to be more the point of conflict here than the actual article itself. Perhaps it is time to back away from the article and try and sort out the conflict on a more personal level -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 23:36, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See, note the difference here: Sannse is at least saying that the article was good before as well, and isn't calling me a horrible person. I can talk all day long with someone who is willing to be reasonable like that. Do you understand why I might be hesitant to deal with someone who has repeatedly done the opposite, and who has caused me such a degree of stress? The least I can expect is to have the changes discussed one at a time. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:41, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Really, while there is certainly nothing wrong with citing sources, Everyking's version seems like one fine example of overdoing this. This is the Wikipedia, here we have articles. (And remember, too many quotes in a text will get you bad marks at school as well.) For quotes, we have Wikiquotes. So I clearly support the less-quotes-version.</p>
<p>Also, @Everyking, certainly you are not serious when requesting changes to be done "one by one", because you "can't deal with all this at once". Really, how long have you been here?

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "enabling her behaviour". I certainly have said that I think her edit is an improvement to the article, and I stand by that view. I also stand by my requests to <i>both</i> of you to be civil - which Reene replied to with an apology. My hope here was to try and defuse some of the obvious tension and hostility on both sides of the disputes (which I am aware spans several pages and involves several users). I trust in the good intent of all the participants, but I feel that things have simply got too heated for the argument to go anywhere right now. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 00:25, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm taking a break from this article/talk page as well as any related articles/talk pages for an undetermined amount of time (day or so at least).

<p>How long will this revert war last? Frankly, I find the trimmed down and summarized version more readable. I don't see how the 2 parties can discuss when they can't even agree on what terms to have the discussion. Should I request this for page protection to stop the edit war? or will both sides just work on separate versions in their user subpages and when the protection is lifted the war starts all over again?

All right, I've thought things over, gotten a little sleep, and now I have a new proposal to make. There were two quotes in the old version that I myself thought were questionable in their value—the GMA quote and the TRL UK quote. I would like to replace the TRL UK quote with a better one, if I can find one; we can either omit a quote in the place of the GMA quote or I'll try to find another one, or I can try to think of a way to develop the paragraph further without a quote. Can everyone agree on this, that we restore the old version, with these exceptions, and then continue discussion for the time being on these two points until they are resolved? I want to point everyone's attention to something I said yesterday, as well:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I think we should agree that any edit to the article that might be controversial should be discussed here on talk first, to see if there are any objections. I'll make that pledge myself, to describe any major changes I plan to implement here first and wait for others' reactions, and if others will make the same pledge, I think we really can get this up to featured quality and avoid a revert war and protection at the same time."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, compare that to what Reene has been doing here, in absolute defiance of the whole spirit of compromise that pervades what I wrote there. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:09, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Something else:
<dl>
<dd>"Many of the pictures, such as the one used for the front cover of the album, show Simpson in a dark setting, with graffiti-style writing scrawled on the wall behind her, and in two of the pictures used for the album, she is laying on a black couch: the one used for the back cover, a fairly close shot of Simpson's face as she is laying on her side, and the one used for the back of the CD booklet, in which she is shown smiling, laying on her back."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we can remove everything after "black couch"; it's a nice bit of detail, but not necessary, and I'm willing to discard it in a case like this.

<p>OK, I feel like I'm making progress! I removed two quotes, simplified the inline references as John advised me to do, removed the triviality about her album couch poses, and removed the Village Voice review from the table since it was already in the references. The table formatting looks a little funny now, but I imagine someone else can fix that easily enough. Of course, if anyone else did all this they'd be praised, but since my edits are cursed from on high I may be promptly reverted; we'll see. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:29, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK...well, my new article Autobiography album design got promptly VfDed, and I was using that as part of my plan to condense this article. So I don't know.

<dd>Well, it definitely looks better than before. If Reene's edits were merged with this, I think this would make for a strong article. I strongly dispute Shard's contention that every possible quote Simpson has made should be in the article, though.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>But Reene didn't add anything, she just deleted stuff. What do you want to merge? I tried to respect her fundamental point, which was that the article should be condensed, and I think I accomplished that. Certainly I don't believe all Ashlee quotes should be in an article, we have Wikiquote, just those pertinent to the subject that help inform the reader and add context. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:47, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>When Reene was deleting chart and sales data, I noticed she also deleted this—(the closest she came was with the release of the special edition of <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_This_Skin_5428.html" title="In This Skin">In This Skin</a></i> in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, which debuted at number two)—and I thought I'd explain why I've restored it. It provides context to Ashlee's stardom; it shows that Jessica had a major boost in popularity in the months before <i>Autobiography</i> was released. Moreover, this is something I frequently see mentioned, so certainly I figure Wikipedia ought to mention it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:19, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everyking, your latest revert read "is this what I get for spending all that time creating a compromise version?" Well, I'm wondering the exact same thing. Seemingly without even reading over or responding to any of the things I posted here in the spirit of compromise, understanding, and mediation, you reverted all of my edits, making decrees as though they were final and somehow spoke for everybody while accusing me of being "nothing more than a troll" and saying I was attempting to "destroy" everything you've done to the article. I don't think this attitude is a benefit to Wikipedia at all, and I'm sure you'll agree. In fact, all of these things have been quite hurtful to me as an editor and as a person. In the spirit of Mergism, I've re-added a snip of the text that was reverted, leaving the rest of your edits to the article alone. I do not believe what you claimed to be a "compromise" before was really a compromise at all- telling another editor, an equal, that they must do this or else is nothing short of an ultimatum and once again, that kind of attitude is harmful to the Wikipedia as a whole. Now, I think all of this has arisen from the fact that we're both defensive of our work and our opinions. That's fine, but in this case it's been taken too far. I'd like to once again ask that we <i>both</i> take a short break from all of the articles in question and come back when we've had time to cool off.

I don't want to see you banned, but if you keep reverting the article, sooner or later someone is bound to take notice and ban you. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 02:40, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because my reverts haven't been destructive. They've been restoring information. Same as if someone blanked the page and I reverted it thirty times. Of course I know about the 3RR rule enforcement, but I voted against it myself, so I take no blame for that, if it is indeed judged to have passed. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:44, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm certain your perception of the reverts is that you are justified. However, I once again ask you review the comments that have been left on this page concerning the section currently in question. Overwhelming opinion is that the truncated/cited version is generally more palatable and should be kept. Then I also ask that you read the paragraph I posted just above. I'm extending an olive branch here; it is entirely your choice as to whether or not you will take it or torch it. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">Reene (リニ)</a> 02:52, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why don't you take one of the many olive branches I've extended since this whole thing began? I refuse to accept that all of my compromises, from an editor who actually knows the subject and cares about it, are to be ignored and substituted for a "compromise" that would only do the article harm. That's unacceptable. And do you remember the time I suggested we start over on a new leaf and you responded with terse rudeness? Revert your edit, choose one thing you'd like to discuss, and from there we can proceed on a basis of civility. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:00, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that you are knowledgable and care deeply about the subject matter is a handicap here, something I am not sure you realize. And while I'm sure you perceive my changes as "harmful", "destructive", or "wrecking" the article, overwhelming consensus still says that they are actually an improvement on the article. I do not respond well to snideness, ultimatums, demands, or threats; this is no exception. I will not revert my edit. It is, after all, "one element" of my edit- and wasn't one of your proposed "compromises" that I choose "one element" of my total original edit while leaving the rest alone? That is what I have done. "Your" article is still for the most part yours. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">Reene (リニ)</a> 03:10, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it matters whether you voted for it or not, someone can still ban you for violating it. Whether you agree with Reene's changes or not, surely you can see they're not clear vandalism, and therefore can not be reverted more than three times without risking getting yourself banned. This dispute isn't worth getting banned over. Anyway, all I wanted to do is make sure you know that since the 3RR enforcement vote is over, reverting more than three times is taking a risk which I think is silly. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">Shane King</a> 05:33, Nov 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I meant a small portion. Something manageable. Reword one sentence, remove one quote. You can still do that. That's one compromise. Another compromise is to revert to my previous version, which was itself tailored as a compromise, and leave it at that. A third option is to revert to that version and then we can start to "think outside the box" about ways to work on the article without cutting out good quotes and factual info. Those are the three options on the table. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:28, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>None of those are compromises, not fair ones anyway. Coming to a compromise means coming to an acceptable <i>middle ground</i>, not "allowing" someone to make a very minor change so long as they promise not to touch the rest of it.</dd>
<dd>Those are NOT the three options on the table. What about the compromises I've offered?

<p>Reene, I don't hold a grudge against anybody. What do you say we agree to a compromise for the duration of protection? We ought to agree to merge our two versions together for the sake of fairness, so it's not one-sided. This would make it much easier to maintain goodwill as well.

<p>Reene, I don't mind what you want to say about me. People ought to speak their mind about me, good or bad. That's not a problem. So like I said, I don't hold a grudge. I'm just concerned about the article itself. There's no sense in depending solely on mediation, either, when we're both intelligent people who can hold a discussion as well as anybody, and there's certainly no sense in depending on arbitration—you know how they deal with disputes, blocks across the board. And it wouldn't benefit Wikipedia for either one of us to get blocked, would it? Anyone who reads my candidate statement can see my opinion on that. Nor would it resolve the issue in question. So let's rethink the compromise proposal above. I also want to point out that you have effectively lost the VfD debate on <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_6ab6.html" title="La La">La La</a>, if we count up the votes, which means that you can't merge that article into this one, so I'm unsure what you're still fighting for. Clarity on both sides is necessary for conflict resolution; we ought to know who stands for what. I think I've made my stance clear; what is yours? I will reiterate mine if you ask me to.</p>
<p>I want the full sales and chart data in the article, there's no doubt about that. But we can call a truce. I'll let you keep that data truncated, and I'll even let you leave out the Jessica Simpson <i>In This Skin</i> aside if you like. In return, I would like to have my version of the review section restored, because I think the most important thing for a reader is to get a fair summary of the album's critical reception, in case they are trying to decide whether or not to buy it. I'd also like us to agree that in the future we won't remove information without discussing it, and that I will be free to continue my normal work in improving the article without being in the middle of a revert war. I will be happy to keep talking here—and not reverting—until doomsday.

<dd>What part of "mediation" didn't you understand? Believe it or not, I was ready to jump on your first proposal for compromise yesterday before I discovered the nasty things you wrote in my journal. Now all bets are off, and it is your own doing. Gee, I wonder if that wasn't intentional?</dd>
<dd>By the way, VfD isn't about winning or losing, and I'm not the one that listed it in the first place. Stop the pettiness please. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">Reene (リニ)</a> 20:44, Dec 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, you missed the point about VfD; the point was that you originally started this whole mess because you wanted to merge the article here, and now you can't do that, because the community has rejected it. However, your attitude is clear, and if you don't want to continue discussion, that's your right. But understand that the article can't just stay protected forever because you refuse to discuss matters, and understand also that the community at large would not be likely to look favorably on such an attitude. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:29, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, the difference is that it is <i>my personal journal</i>. If I'd written something nasty about you on my namespace that would be a different matter entirely, but the simple fact is you chose to make an attempt at attacking me personally under the "veil" of anonymity (guess that didn't work out for you did it?) on my personal journal changes everything.</dd>
<dd>Also, I'd like to remind you that I was not only not the first one to take issue with the article but certainly not the only one that supported my stance. Whereas you have...one person. Versus how many. Who, exactly, is the community not looking kindly upon? Someone who has made good faith attempts at compromise or someone repeatedly throwing fits and doing their best impression of a brick wall?</dd>
<dd>And I said I'd wait for mediation. Go read up on what mediation is. I'm not refusing to discuss anything, rather, I'm trying to <i>force</i> you to discuss things in a more rational, civil manner, even if it takes a babysitter to do so. And with that this particular discussion ends. I will wait patiently for a mediator. I suggest you do the same. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">Reene (リニ)</a> 21:40, Dec 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Read above for my attempt to discuss things in a more civil and rational manner. Not that I haven't generally been civil and rational, but I'll grant that I've gotten more worked up than I should. I've apologized personally to Snowspinner for getting so angry on his talk page. However, I have never displayed anything even close to your level of absolute hostility and contempt. In fact, I don't have any problem with you at all aside from your particular stubborness regarding this article (well, that and the fact that I find the VfD excerpt on your user page to be an expression of incivility) and I think you seem like an intelligent person. In all honesty, I can't even begin to fathom such animosity on your part. I try to overlook it and move beyond it, and you see where it gets me? If mediation is to work, you still need to change your attitude to be at least marginally conciliatory, so this doesn't bode well. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:05, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also don't think this article should be protected if you're unwilling to discuss anything, so I'll consider asking for unprotection if this continues. I have much work left to do on it and I don't appreciate it being put on hold indefinitely like this. Moreover, the stress caused by all this has left me unmotivated to do research on improving various points in the article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:16, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have more information regarding chart and sales data I would like to add. <i>Autobiography</i> fell to 51 in its 17th week, but rose back to 50 in its 18th week, so it is at present still in the top fifty. As this is a factual matter of some importance, I will feel free to add it myself unless Reene voices an explicit objection. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:45, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been thinking about the radio interview which I cite twice in the article, because it's the only one of the awkward inline cites remaining. Would it be acceptable to cite a radio interview as a reference in the reference section? I'd think not, but I don't know. Maybe I could just integrate it into the text: "In an interview with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_FM_3b82.html" title="Capital FM">Capital FM</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>), Simpson said..." <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:35, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Noting that the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">three revert rule</a> can now be used as a basis for blocking anyone if they get out of control, I have unprotected the page. The reasonable discussion going on here suggests to me that hopefully such measures will not be necessary, though.</p>
<p>Apparently there is also the temp version, which I have not done anything with. In the end, whatever version ends up on this page, the temp page should be redirected to the article and/or moved out of the article namespace. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 17:19, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now that the article has been unprotected, I think it's a good time to start fresh. For my part, I want to apologize to Reene for calling her a troll and a vandal at various points, and for any kind of poor attitude I've displayed. She need not apologize for the nasty things she has said about me and to me; I have no problem with any of that, I am completely past it. I also want to apologize for rudely commenting in her journal; she need not apologize to me for the things she wrote that provoked those responses, which I shall not repeat here. I can forgive and forget. I hope the revised version I've added, with a fair amount of new info, will be acceptable to everyone, including Reene. Personally, I think this article is nearing featured quality. If Reene wants to summarize info, I will be happy to discuss how best to summarize it here on talk; if she wants to remove information, that might be OK as well, provided it can be convincingly argued that said information is trivial and non-notable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:43, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>she need not apologize to me for the things she wrote that provoked those responses</i>. Ah, blaming the victim, always a lovely start to an apology, and certainly demonstrates one's sincerity, too. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 08:16, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)
