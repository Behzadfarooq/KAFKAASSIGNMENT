<li>Invalid listing.

<li><b>Invalid Listing</b>. This image has graced IfD with it's presence perhaps 4 times in the last month or two, from overzalous deletionists and morally offended editors. As RickK observes, there was no consensus to delete. I remind everyone here that there are some explicit pictures at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> and many other places that might offend people in the improper context. What's more, a vandal can upload <i>any</i> picture to wikipedia, or even to any language of wikipedia and then do the old inter-inter-wiki linking trick. The image is not the problem - one stupid asshole vandalizing wikipedia is the problem. I suspect he or she is doing this exactly to elicit this response, since the picture alone did not garner the hysterically offended response that he or she assumed it would. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 00:19, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

I have no objection to this image used in the appropriate article, but it is doing more harm than good on Wikipedia because of vandalism. If we could have a software change which prevents a suitably tagged image from appearing inline or being redirected to, then I'd change my vote, assuming no copyright violation.

<li>Yes, votes always are a matter of opinion. If reuploaded, the image could be deleted immediately upon detection. There are far more offensive images that vandals could upload, I'm sure (and occasionally they do).

<li>Uh... couldn't a user still reupload it and vandalise with it if we vote to delete it? In fact, a user may upload any image of any "level of offensiveness" and vandalise with it.

<li>Well... that and to illustrate the article "auto-fellatio". The fact that you find auto-fellatio and images of it "shocking" it does not mean that the images can ONLY be shocking. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 22:54, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tell that to two newcomers <i>that I know of</i> who have been driven off this site upon being greeted by this image. Perhaps you can lecture to <i>them</i> how encyclpedic it is, since you seem so keep on responding to every "delete" vote. If you can find them, tell <i>them</i> that they're prudish, and shouldn't be shocked by such a "clearly informative" image. Quill, this image is not entirely informative: what does it really convey that one cannot figure from the text, and the illustartion. It's not an especially complicated concept that the article expresses. The image is unnecessary, and simply not worth the trouble it causes. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 14:43, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If I were a 14-year old boy who had read something disturbing or titillating about autofellatio, and decided to check out this resource that claimed to be a free collection of all human knowledge, I would be glad to find a picture that made clear just what that disturbing reference was talking about, cuz sometimes one .jpg is worth a kilobyte of text. If I were accessing the site through the Internet (which, by definition, I would be), I wouldn't be surfing WikiPedia for long dong porn. There are many better sites for that.

I think that the people who would look it up for the wrong reasons would go somewhere else.

This is a recognizable gay porn actor, so unless he posted it himself (which is unlikely), it has to be scanned from a porno mag or copped from a website. Just because it's not actually the same <i>image</i> as the one somebody found on the splash page of an autofellatio porn site doesn't mean it's not copyvio -- for one thing, <i>it's indisputably the same person</i>. The fact is that one can upload absolutely <i>anything</i> and <i>tag</i> it as GFDL; calling it so doesn't automatically make it true.

This was dumpedc on my user page and now sits on my hard disc which may be illegal here in Honduras.

<li>Message for Oldak Quill&#160;: You seem to forget this copyright problem. Furthermore pornography is completely illegal in some countries. Furthermore I think it completely discredits Wikipedia. When I saw that Wikipedia hosted porn images, I wondered seriously if I would contribute any more to a project like this. Does an encyclopaedia need an explicit photograph which can be totally illegal when the illustration can be largely sufficient? <b>What is the encyclopedic goal of this image, why is it better than the schema</b>? I would like to have a valid argument.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, when you say that we must click to see the image, vandalism proves the contrary. I think this image has been deliberately uploaded to become a redirection arrival. You will say that it's not a reason. In this case, I ask for developers to block any redirections leading to an image as well as redirections leading to another Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>I accept there is a copyright reason - and believe this is a valid reason to delete. What is not valid is allowing ones own views on what is "horrid" to delete - this is POV. What if the true biography of Kim Jung-Il is illegal in North Korea, should it be deleted? What if, in a dystopian future US, evolution was rendered illegal - should we delete these articles? Further, where does pornography become pornography - why is this intrinsically worse than a picture of an erect penis? Why does it "discredit Wikipedia"? If anything it shows that we consider NPOV an extremely important concept and do not allow prudish outlooks to influence our content. As I said, if it is a copyvio - delete it - but photographs are always far more informative and demonstrative than illustrations. What if someone "doubts the feasability" of this act? Yes, the image is currently being used to vandalise because it is in the limelight - so many users have it on their Contribution lists and it is in recent changes so often. The same occured when the penis and clitoris pictures were in the limelight - this soon died away. We should not bend to vandals and allow them to affect our content, this is imperative. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 12:05, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>RickK has a point (post of 05:26). I came here to vote "delete", because I think that the disservice this picture does to Wikipedia is currently bigger than the benefit. However, after reading the votes here I must say there is a <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> towards unreflected delete votes. This is natural and understandable – most of the people who object to the picture will be very motivated to cast their vote here without bothering to read the discussion. This alone is a reason to support RickK's demand. On top of that, there are some people who do read the discussion on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image_talk%7EAutofellatio.jpg_d8cf.html" title="Image talk:Autofellatio.jpg">Image_talk:Autofellatio.jpg</a> but still repeat the same, wrong arguments – such as "copyvio" (mostly reiterated by ClockworkSoul), stubbornly ignoring the counterarguments ("I would like to have a valid argument"). This sort of agitation makes me angry, and I feel it is my democratic duty to vote against it. I will think about it. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 07:23, 2005 Mar 23 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then I really wonder if there are here some other people who vote in order to be able to vandalize more and more on the other Wikipedias. I hope not.

<dd>No, I don't have many arguments. Copyvio and vandalism. But those who vote to keep this image don't have many arguments too. I make a summary&#160;:
<ul>
<li>It can have an encyclopedic potential (argument for keeping)</li>
<li>Vandalism is no reason for removing</li>
<li>Image has no licence and is probably illegal on this site</li>
<li>It's used as target for redirections</li>

<dd>We are not here to slander other users - if that user is a problem then prove it to the Arb Com. As long as he/she is an unblocked, innocent user they may vote where they wish. Wikipedia won't be classified as a pornographic site due to a handful of informative images which are used to demonstrate a concept. Again, this is allowing ones cultural values to interfere with content. Further, vandalism is only occuring due to its position in the limelight.

<li><b>Keep</b>. From the list above, it looks like two major reasons that people are voting <i>delete</i> (apart from those who give no reason at all) are that 1) the image is probably copyvio and 2) they don't like the fact that someone is redirecting talk pages to it. For the first, this isn't the place to discuss it. If the question were its copyright status, this would be listed on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>, but it isn't, so that really shouldn't be an issue here. For the second, its use in vandalism is <i>no reason</i> to delete an image — any image could be used in the same way, the issue is whether the image serves the article in which it is situated. If it weren't for <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a> I'd suggest redirecting everyone's user pages to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Image%7EFlower.jpg_6e14.html" title="Image:Flower.jpg">Image:Flower.jpg</a> and see if we can't get that deleted as well. For all we know it's a user who wants the image deleted doing the vandalism for precisely this reason. That alone should be enough to explain why that can't be a valid reason to delete. The real question: Is the article better off with the image (linked)? I say yes, so vote keep. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="grey">Talk</font></a> 09:22, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Further, we have never used "important social or cultural phenomena" as an inclusion criterion before.

<li>no. that comment is misguided, we are not talking about <i>concepts</i> people may find offensive. nobody wants to delete the autofellatio article, or (almost nobody) the autofellatio drawing. It is the image <i>itself</i> that is offensive, as a porn pic, not the concept of autofellatio. Otherwise, we can start uploading goatse, and rotten.com imagery. If this image is kept, I will insist that goatse grace <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">goatse.cx</a>, and give up on WP for being a porn host run by trolls. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small>

<li>I'm confused. I say the concept of sex isn't offensive, so I accept words and pictures relating to it. I don't find pornography offensive (or even readily definable). How then does your comment follow? The image is therefore offensive <i>to your mind</i>, but not to mine. You (in the impersonal sense, of course&#160;;-) ) are now discriminating against me on the basis of standards that differ between us. I see Wikipedia as inclusive, whereas by your argument it excludes some communities. To the extent that it is inclusive, the limiting definition has to be the laws of the hosting location. If it is not inclusive (and thus embracing the "systemic bias" thingy that I've seen mentioned) then it has to make positive exclusions as part of editiorial policy. I (very personally) don't see how the aims of Wikipedia can be sustained using the consensus model, and think that in the end <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimbo</a> will have to take on the formal role of Editor-in-Chief. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 11:58, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I didn't realize that I had to qualify my vote for avoiding it being discounted, is this part of IfD policy? Incidentally, I did read the discussion before voting. I do see and can appreciate the rationality behind Noisy's keep vote, but my position is that the image's cost far outweigh its benefits, and it isn't particularly important; there's no harm in being pragmatic on something which, content-wise, is that minor (and it isn't even remotely as notable as clitoris, so I refuse from the outset to entertain counterarguments along those lines). We're writing and editing an encyclopedia here, not conducting an experiment as to the limits of free speech. Especially for something that, to quote Silverback (whom I still disagree with, the topic is not unencyclopedic) is "not an important social or cultural phenomena or has a body scientific or historical literature behind it." So now I trust that my Delete vote counts. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 11:08, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia shouldn't be a testbed for "Freedom of Speech" issues (which is what contributors to this discussion seem to be addressing). From an encyclodeic point of view I don't consider that such a graphic image is necessary, a textual description and maybe the drawing should be enough (how else is it going to be done!). Even taking Freedom of Speech into account, that right needs to be balanced against potential harm. It doesn't offend me personally, but my main concern with regard to potential harm is the effect on children viewing this image (this possible harm is debatable, but is the risk worth taking for very little benefit). Also, is a parent going to restrict their children from viewing Wikipedia is they realise such content is available. The aim of Wikipedia is to provide access to all. For an academic defence of "Freedom of Speech", we jeopardise that real goal and risk harming others. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 13:55, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Doesn't meet (my personal) standards for suitable illustrations. The costs and risks outweights the gains and advantages with this picture. Not <i>every</i> photography of self-sucking would necessarily be unfit for Wikipedia, but we better be sure that it's a photographer and a model who agrees to the publication (on Wikipedia's terms), and it better doesn't look too much like a picture taken with the intent to get published in a pornographic magazine. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Magnus_89a1.html" title="User:Johan Magnus">Johan Magnus</a> 16:37, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Where is it stated that "consensus" is 80%? On other pages dealing with deletion, such as VfD, there is no fixed standard, and in theory any administrator who processes the vote decides. However, the normal practice is to consider 2/3 to be consensus. What is the rationale for giving such a strong presumption that an image should be kept that every "keep" counts for 4 "delete" votes? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a>
<ul>
<li>Consensus is, in fact, determined by many factors, and there is no fixed standard. However, I still say it's not clear whether there's a consensus to delete or not. 80% is often used as a rule of thumb. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> says <i>"In day-to-day Wikipedia practice, e.g. on VfD, consensus means something closer to supermajority, usually a four-fifths majority. In other polls, it has been defined as a 70% majority."</i> – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_sleuthing_a075.html" title="Wikipedia:Image sleuthing">sleuth</a>)</sup> 21:40, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> is not policy, and, in fact, it is wrong about the degree of consensus required to delete an article through VFD.

As I see it, the majority of objectors' problem with this image is its supposedly pornographic nature. I remind those people that any image of an erect adult penis is considered pornographic in some jurisdictions, yet Wikipedia contains just such an image. A drawing or illustration would not do that article justice, just as the drawing in the autofellatio article clearly is insufficient, judging by the voters here who have stated that they still believe autofellatio to be impossible. I think it's reasonable to have the image as a link rather than in the article on the off chance that someone who would be deeply shocked simply stumbles across it, but I don't think it's reasonable to remove the image totally. As for the claims that the image is inherently shocking, it's not reasonable to make such a claim at all. I'm not shocked by it, nor are many of the other users here, nor are most of the people I know. Any image is potentially shocking; that's not sufficient reason to remove them from Wikipedia, just as potentially shocking or even offensive content is not enough to remove an article. To those who are attempting to equate images of sexuality with those of violence I say that the two are not equivalent despite how many cultures represent them in that way. Indeed, in America parents seem quite happy to have their children watch graphic representations of sexualised violence, torture and murder but are shocked by the tamest expression of human sexuality (Janet Jackson's breast, anyone?). Images of humans engaging in sexual activity are common in encyclopaedias, medical texts, kids books, and even on TV. They belong on a website dedicated to human knowledge. As to whether this particular image is a copyvio, that has yet to be proved, making that argument irrelevant. And personally, I'm rather fond of it. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 18:32, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Answer. If you spoke of me when saying <i>judging by the voters here who have stated that they still believe autofellatio to be impossible</i>, which I believe, you would better read once more what I wrote here. I said that a skeptical man may keep skeptical even if he looks at the photo.<br />
I'm not saying that it's not possible, there are very talentuous contorsionists. I don't need this photo to be convinced that what the article says is right or wrong.<br />

<li>Comment to <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a>: If you like the image, and are not worried that it might be a copyvio or far too potentially dangerous a snubbing of existing laws and prohibitions, by all means <i>download</i> it, <i>post</i> it on your <i>own</i> site somewhere as an example of fabulously appealing art— even link to it from your user page— but don't ask that this entire project be burdened with catering to your individual tastes to the complete lack of consideration for those of nearly everyone else. It opens up opportunities for every close minded nitwit to characterize the entire set of projects as damnable by association, because of the insistence of a few people who are so dense that they can't seem to admit that anyone else should have any reason to be offended at all. There are many far more important freedoms to be fought for than that of the presently absurd one of having an image of someone performing autofellatio considered normal and standard fare for an encyclopedia. That world is <i>not</i> the world that exists.<br />
As I stated, I am against most forms of censorship imposed upon people and groups, and am no supporter of authoritarianism, but an individual or a group's prudent self censorship is nearly always a necessary portion of true wisdom. <i>Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness.</i> (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>). In most things I am quite libertarian, but it is within my liberty to join with most people here in declaring that the idea of posting of this image within the Wikimedia projects is entirely unnecessary, extremely detrimental, and nearly incredibly STUPID. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> 21:42, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is possible to have a discussion without resorting to calling people names, isn't it? At any rate, I suggest you try, since this discussion is convoluted enough as it is, without having it disintegrating into a SHOUTING match. As my post indicates, my personal opinion of the photo is not the basis for my vote to keep. The arguments that are being used here are essentially the same arguments that are used elsewhere on Wikipedia to justify attempts to remove articles on certain topics as well, most often those concerning sexuality, and they are flawed. My vote is to keep because images of human sexuality cannot be considered automatically offensive, and because they can be useful and can improve articles. <i>This</i> image is not even displayed in the article, but merely linked to it. If we are removing this image, then we should be removing <b>any</b> image that can be remotely construed as sexual, along with all related articles. After all, we don't want to offend anyone. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 00:38, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)

That leads to a result of 81.73% voting to delete. If the new users' votes had been counted, the percentage would have been 80.73%. Either way, this counts as a clear (if close) consensus to delete, even under the strictest definitions. Therefore I have deleted the image according to this consensus. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_sleuthing_a075.html" title="Wikipedia:Image sleuthing">sleuth</a>)</sup> 04:32, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>
