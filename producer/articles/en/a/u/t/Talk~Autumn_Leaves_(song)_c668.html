<p>There are problems with this article:</p>
<p>1) Was it really written in 1902, as is implied by its categorization? How come? The persons mentioned were born later. If it were written in 1902, who wrote it, and what exactly did Joseph Kosma do? An arrangement?</p>
<p>2) Is it legal to publish the lyrics? Aren't they copyrighted?</p>

<dd>If Johnny Mercer's English lyric had its copyright renewed, under the copyright laws of the day its original copyright expited 56 years after it was written (which means just about now). But the new copyright law extends copyright to 75 years after the author's death... so if this applies, at least Mercer's lyrics are still under copyright. -- <a href="../../../b/r/g/User%7EBRG_b05e.html" title="User:BRG">BRG</a> 15:28, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed the small section, <b>Selective list of recordings</b>, because it violates NPOV. Specifically, no criteria are given for these selections. Wikipedia can't endorse Keith Jarrett's version, for example, as "better" or "more significant" than another musician's. If the article is going to selectively identify particular recordings, then those choices need to be explained and cited.</p>
<p>Also, NPOV aside, the list is worthless. It doesn't specify whether it's referring to specific recordings. One entry reads, "1946 Yves Montand." Does that mean that Montand recorded the song in 1946, or simply that he sang it somewhere? (On stage? In a movie?) If the list were permitted by NPOV policy — which it isn't — it would have to cite specific recordings. For instance: <b>Keith Jarrett</b>, <i>Tokyo '96</i>, ECM Records ©1998. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECribcage_bfde.html" title="User:Cribcage">Cribcage</a> 20:44, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with this point of view. The article should be on the song, not on the various covers. The articles on the indivudal artists can to that if they want. An except might occur in the case of a really famous recording or a first recording, like Elvis Presley and "Heartbreak Hotel." <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 12:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why not list all 1200? Just do it in really small print. Or, barring that, list any that made the Billboard Hot 100, or garnered some other relatively high sales ranking, and point out that there are over 1200 covers. You can't list all the <i><a href="../../../y/e/s/Yesterday.html" title="Yesterday">Yesterday</a></i> covers either, but listing the Beatles' version and pointing out that there are hundreds of covers seems fair. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:36, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. The Beatles' version of Yesterday is definitive and original. Elvis' version of Heartbreak Hotel is definitive (was it the first? I think so.) Whose version of "The Autumn Leaves" is definitive? We list the originator, Yves Montand. Our List of jazz standards arbitrarily lists Yves Montand, Jo Stafford, Artie Shaw, Bing Crosby, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Roger Williams, Édith Piaf, Paul Weston, Mitch Miller, Jackie Gleason, Keith Jarrett, Vince Guaraldi Trio, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Paul Desmond, Ahmad Jamal. Really, though, <i>anyone</i> who does jazz standards does this song eventually; that's the whole point of doing standards. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Heartbreak Hotel was written for Elvis Presley to record. The Beatles wrote "Yesterday". According to one book I have (Furia), "Autumn Leaves" was a popular European instumental for which Johnny Mercer was hired to provide English lyrics. I don't know who first recorded the English version nor who made the English version popular. Now, as you say, it is an old jazz standard. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 15:49, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looks like <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Piaf_3705.html" title="Edith Piaf">Edith Piaf</a> did the the first version in English. Here's an interesting quote from a forum: <i>The melody of 'Autumn Leaves' was originally written as a ballet music for 'Le rendez-vous' for Roland Petit. The original stage design was done by Pablo Picasso. Moved by the music and the dance, the French film director Michael Carné' based his screenplay on 'Le rendez-vous': not without problems. Originally he tried to talk Marlene Dietrich into playing the lead role, which she refused. Another actor refused the role because of the fact that Marlene had refused. The composer Kosma, who had set the melody of the ballet into a chanson on the poem ' Feuilles mortes' (Dead leaves), insisted in using the sung version. The movie was a disaster, but the melody (hummed by Yves Montand) became an instant hit. History tells that the first recording was made by Cora Vaucair in 1948. Yves Montand followed the same year. In 1949, Juliette Greco made the first clip while singing the song (amidst autumn scenes of course). The first English version, which was translated by Johnny Mercer, was sung by Edith Piaf...</i><a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=autumn%20leaves" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=autumn%20leaves" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 15:56, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My Billboard Top 40 book says that <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Williams_%28pianist%29_1883.html" title="Roger Williams (pianist)">Roger Williams</a> had a number 1 hit with it for 4 weeks in 1955 (starting in late August, appropriately). It also reached number 35, later that same year, done by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Allen_%28comedian%29_6420.html" title="Steve Allen (comedian)">Steve Allen</a> along with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cates_f553.html" title="George Cates">George Cates</a> and his orchestra. I would say those are likely both instrumentals (piano, specifically). That was before the Top 40 became almost strictly rock-and-roll. Cates is better known for his work with <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Welk_4ff9.html" title="Lawrence Welk">Lawrence Welk</a>. I would argue that if any names are to be included, Williams should be in there due to having a major hit version. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:15, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Johnny Mercer didn't translate it as he did not know the French language and was not a translator. And he wasn't the kind of guy who would be willing to work over someone else's lyrics. Someone may have given him a translated version (it sounds like the quote above is saying that the melody was great but the French lyrics were awful) or (per Philip Furia book and Max Wilk book) he took the instumental (maybe knowing the general drift of the French lyrics) and wrote his own lyrics. Johnny Mercer was a master lyricist (even Alec Wilder acknowledges that). If Edith Piaf did the first English version (but didn't do one in French?) then it might have been because Mercer's lyrics were wonderfully superior. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 01:38, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>{unindent} P.S. If you read the section in the article about chord changes, giving Mercer's accompanying lyric, there is nothing in the French translation in the link above, that remotely resumbles the beauty of the lyric with that chord. And that's what Mercer did so well -- and why he prefered to have the melody first and then write the lyrics. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 01:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I heard something on XM the other day -- that Mercer worked with something like 150 different composers. That's pretty remarkable.

<dd>He couldn't read music -- he went by ear. On the melodies he did compose, he had to have someone else write the music and he could only say "yes" or "no" about the chord his helper would produce. He knew it if he heard it -- he had a good ear. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 02:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
