<p>In <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>, an autograph from famous gentry is regarded as an honour. The value of an item bearing a high official's autograph could rise incredibly. In imperial China, an autograph from an emperor was considered priceless but to sell such an item could be a criminal offense.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, asking a celebrity for their autograph was seen as a child's activity up to a few decades ago. The popularity of collecting autographs as a hobby came during the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. Many memorabilia dealers took notice, and what once was an innocent hobby lost that innocence as dealers and celebrities began to charge money for their signatures.</p>
<p>That practice varies from country to country and in some locales charging for autographs could be considered mercenary.</p>

<p>Many celebrities still enjoy signing autographs for free for fans, keeping it an interesting hobby. <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Duff_20dd.html" title="Hilary Duff">Hilary Duff</a> has publicly lashed out at other teen idol stars who avoid autograph collectors.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Carney_cae6.html" title="Art Carney">Art Carney</a> was another person who enjoyed signing autographs until his death in November of 2003.</p>
<p>Many people are not willing to distribute their signature—at least not for free. Sports personalities in this category include most <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> players, including the majority of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Dimaggio_d3ac.html" title="Joe Dimaggio">Joe Dimaggio</a>, and most notoriously, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bonds_ea55.html" title="Barry Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>. Other sports stars who try to avoid signing whenever possible are <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Russell_%28basketball%29_9be4.html" title="Bill Russell (basketball)">Bill Russell</a>, who does not sign at all in public and only sparingly at private signing sessions, and most <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> stars with huge contracts. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>, would not and could not sign for most of his career because people's safety was at risk due to frenzied attempts to get his signature, which is worth hundreds of dollars. Jordan has frequently signed at more peaceful events, such as golf tournaments. It is also difficult to get <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s autograph. A typical scenario is hundreds of fans in a crush waiting by Jackson's hotel, with Jackson signing five or ten autographs as he rushes to his vehicle.</p>

<p>Many dealers also would wait for hours for a celebrity to emerge from a location, present several photos for the celebrity to sign and then sell most of them. Some dealers would locate a celebrity's home address and write to them asking for autographs multiple times. The celebrities would grow tired of that and make it a point to sign only one autograph per person. Because of the many autographs a celebrity might sign over time, some check requests against a record of past requests. Boxer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Foreman_5062.html" title="George Foreman">George Foreman</a>, for instance, records the names and addresses in his personal computer of every person that writes him asking for an autograph, so that whenever he receives a letter, he will know if the person is a fan who admires him or merely a dealer who wants more of his autographs to sell.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autograph.html" title="Edit section: Autopen signatures">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Autopen signatures</span></h2>
<p>Since the early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> almost all American presidents have had an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopen.html" title="Autopen">autopen</a> or robot signature-signing machine sign their letters. The Signa-Signer can even write out in ink an authentically looking handwritten message that has been typed into the machine. One book detailing the use of this machine by President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> (1961-1963) is <i>The Robot That Helped to Make a President</i>. Photographs and books that collectors have mailed in for autographing have often been treated similarly.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, the practice of using an autopen has spread to U.S. Cabinet members and to U.S. Senators, who have a high volume of correspondence with constituents.</p>
<p>A photo signed by <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronaut.html" title="Astronaut">astronaut</a> <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Armstrong_5dd2.html" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> (c.1972) is an autopen signature; Armstrong declined to sign most of these items since 1980. Astronaut <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Shepard_19fc.html" title="Alan Shepard">Alan Shepard</a> acknowledged that <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> uses the autopen machine to sign the astronauts' voluminous correspondence. Many large corporations also use these machines for signing business letters. One might think that autopen signatures would constantly match one another. However, even autopen signatures will eventually change as the signature drum becomes worn and thereby alters the signature. Due to these professional imitations, one must be wary of buying presidential or astronaut signatures from unknown sellers.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2004.html" title="December 2004">December 2004</a> a controversy arose when it was revealed that the United States' <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_Defense_c859.html" title="Secretary of Defense">Secretary of Defense</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, was using an autopen to sign letters-of-condolence to families of American military members who had died during <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_II_eb0f.html" title="Gulf War II">Gulf War II</a>. Shortly thereafter, Rumsfeld announced that he would start to personally sign such letters.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autograph.html" title="Edit section: Forged autographs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Forged autographs</span></h2>
<p>Autograph collecting is an enthralling hobby to collectors, who enjoy assembling a series of historical documents, letters or objects that have been signed or autographed by a notable person as a way of capturing a piece of history.</p>
<p>Some collectors collect in a specialized field, such as gathering documents autographed by American presidents, <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winners, or baseball players who have hit over 500 home-runs during their career.</p>
<p>The hobby is fraught with documents, photographs and sports items that were signed by forgers seeking to profit by selling forged items to unwitting buyers. Sometimes just the signature that has been forged, other times the entire document has been doctored.</p>
<p>Forged autographs of nearly all famous personalities abound. Differentiating forged from authentic autographs is almost impossible for the amateur collector.</p>
<p>There are many forged autographs being sold through various internet auction firms, used book stores, and other secondhand markets. The neophyte collector must be cautious in these arenas.</p>
<p>One method commonly seen on <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a> is called "preprinting" by many sellers. The item is only a photocopy of an actual autographed photo, usually printed on glossy home photo paper. Since this is almost always disclosed to the buyer, some may not consider these actual forgeries.</p>
<p>Forgers go to great lengths to make their forgeries appear authentic. They use blank end papers from old books upon which to write their fake signatures in an attempt to match the paper of the era in which the personality lived. They have researched ink formulations of the era that they want to replicate. One book that explores the production of impressive fake manuscripts pertaining to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saints_f81e.html" title="Latter Day Saints">Mormons</a> is: <i>A Gathering of Saints</i> by Robert Lindsey.</p>
<p>One must know the era in which American presidents signed their documents. American presidents previously signed "land grants" until President <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> (c.1836) grew accustomed to the time-consuming task. Since then secretaries of the president have mimicked their master's signatures on these documents (known as "proxy" signatures). Virtually all <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_stars.html" title="Movie stars">movie stars</a> have their secretaries sign their letters and photographs for them. When President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was an actor during the 1940s, he had his mother sign his name to much of his <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_mail.html" title="Fan mail">fan mail</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> (1861-1865), the president of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</a> was <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>. Due to his extensive correspondence, Davis' wife frequently signed his name to his dictated letters. As she duplicated his signature so well, she usually placed a period after the signature so that he could discern her signatures from his own.</p>
<p>All of the Union and Confederate generals from the American Civil War have had their signatures forged. Many were faked during the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>, a period that included the fad of aging soldiers in collecting Civil War autographs. Most deceptions were of mere signatures on a small piece of paper, but extensively written letters were forged as well. Autograph collectors should be cautious of <i>clipped signatures</i>. The bogus autograph is glued onto an authentic steel-engraved portrait of the subject. Some steel engravings may have reprinted the autograph of the portrayed subject; this is known as a <i>facsimile autograph</i>, and to an uninformed buyer it may appear to be real.</p>

<p>Some personalities have used a rubber or steel hand-stamp to "sign" their documents. American President <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> (c.1866) did so during his tenure as a senator prior to assuming the presidency, since his right hand was injured in a train accident. This is why his autograph as President differs from previous autographs. President <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Harding_8748.html" title="Warren Harding">Warren Harding</a> frequently used a rubber stamp while he was a senator. Presidents <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> used them, along with President <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> (c.1916). England's King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> and Pennsylvania colony founder <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Penn_ff30.html" title="William Penn">William Penn</a> used a deceiving hand stamp.</p>
<p>Quality forgeries have been made for all of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>'s past rulers. The French nobles had their secretaires de main sign their documents. Many forgeries of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s (c.1800) war orders exist; he was so busy with battle concerns that he barely had enough time to sign promotion orders for generals, so his <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scribe.html" title="Scribe">scribes</a> applied his name to lesser documents.</p>
<p>All famous scientists, astronauts, arctic explorers, musicians, poets, and literary authors have had forgeries of their epistols and signatures produced<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. False signatures of the aviator <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> were clandestinely signed onto real 1930-era airmail envelopes bought at stamp shops and then re-sold to unwary buyers; the same has occurred with <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Earhart_2a46.html" title="Amelia Earhart">Amelia Earhart</a> and the Wright brothers. "Mickey Mouse" creator, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> (1955), had several of his cartoonists duplicate his artistic signature on replies to children seeking his autograph.</p>
<p>Texan paper currency was signed in ink by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Houston_9901.html" title="Sam Houston">Sam Houston</a>, though not handwritten by Houston himself.</p>
<p>An article in <i><a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian_Magazine_e160.html" title="Smithsonian Magazine">Smithsonian Magazine</a></i> explored the "melting timepieces" artwork of the Spanish painter <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a>. It quoted one of his secretaries as claiming that she signed the artist's signature to postcard depictions of his paintings.</p>
<p>Some deceivers cut pages from books that American President <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> (c.1970) signed on the blank flyleaf, typed his letter of resignation from the presidency on that signed page, and then sold the doctored item as if Nixon had personally signed a scarce copy of the historical document. The miscreant has changed the value of a lower-priced signed book quite easily to a much more lucrative item; changing a mere signature into a signed manuscript.</p>

<p>Many of the autographed documents allegedly signed by the German leaders of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> government have been forged. Spurious documents and postcards claiming to be signed by <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> are extant. Many were written on blank Nazi stationery that had been purloined by Allied soldiers from the desks in the Fuhrer's bunker in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. German Fieldmarshall <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Rommel_b47d.html" title="Erwin Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> has had many bogus signatures penned in his characteristic green pencil that he used (ink dried too quickly in the hot North African climate). Italian dictator <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benito_Mussolini_f411.html" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s signature has been forged on authentic documents actually signed by King <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emanuel.html" title="Emanuel">Emanuel</a>—this helps to make the phony Mussolini signature appear real, since it is on an otherwise genuine document.</p>
<p>Any serious autograph collector must be alert for the WWII blitzkrieging General Guderian autographed document: it may be signed by his son who became a German general <i>after</i> the war. The same confusion can exist in trying to differentiate between the signatures of the sons of Rommel and the American <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Nimitz_1b8b.html" title="Admiral Nimitz">Admiral Nimitz</a> (1945).</p>
<p>An individual's writing styles change throughout the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_development.html" title="Human development">lifespan of a person</a>; a signature of President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> (c. 1795) will be different from one when he was an 18-year-old land surveyor. After British Admiral Nelson lost his right arm at the Tenerife sea-battle in 1797, he switched to using his left hand. Forgers buy real <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_War_3268.html" title="Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a>-era documents and surreptitiously pen a famous patriot's name between other real signatures in a manuscript in hope of deceiving an unsuspecting buyer. Others will use tea or tobacco stains to brown or age their modern missives.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that over 80 percent of the autographed items of famous American sports players being sold over the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> are fakes. Baseball legend <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, for instance, has had his signature forged on old baseballs, then rubbed in dirt to make them appear to be from the 1930s.</p>
<p>Only long-established autographed dealers have the many years of research experience to determine the authenticity of autographs being sold in secondhand markets.</p>
