<p>This article needs a better non-technical description of how an autogyro works at the outset; I was perplexed as to how exactly an autogyro takes off, since its rotor is "driven solely by aerodynamic forces." Only after you read through many overly-technical phrases like "the rotor is declutched" and "The vertical component of the total aerodynamic reaction of the rotor (rotor thrust) is termed lift" do you begin to understand that, as far as I can tell, the engine spins the rotor to to create an airfoil,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only *before* takeoff.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 00:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This would be a good thing to mention in the intro.<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_7148.html" title="User:Wachholder0">Wachholder0</a> 14:30, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>which provides lift, and is later allowed to be "driven solely by aerodynamic forces." I know very little about aviation and I imagine the average reader doesn't either, so I think the article should try to avoid sounding like a technical manual.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's quite difficult to explain why the top rotor spins when in flight unless the reader knows about concepts like 'relative wind' and 'centers of lift' and so forth. Most people that know that stuff generally know about quite a bit of technical stuff. So it's unclear that most people would benefit from knowing how an autogyro works. The best I have been able to think up is that the top rotor acts like a glider wing, and increases in speed in the same way as a falling glider does.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 00:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am hesitant to rewrite it myself due to my gross and total ignorance of aviation, but will fearlessly do so if someone else doesn't. Thanks <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_7148.html" title="User:Wachholder0">Wachholder0</a> 23:18, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It depends who the audience for this article <i>should</i> be. If we set the bar very low on how much technical information we can assume then the article needs to be 3-4x bigger, but it isn't clear that most people want to know this stuff anyway.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 00:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The audience should be "general readership" who would need to reference an encyclopedia. I am not proposing rewriting the whole article, just the intro. Compare the intro for <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a>. Anyhoo, I could have rewritten the intro by now, which is what I propose to do in the next few days. <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_7148.html" title="User:Wachholder0">Wachholder0</a> 14:30, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says that the autogyro is less efficient and slower than a fixed-plane. Can you compare to a helicopter or a blimp. Maybe as fuel per load or fuel per kilometer.</p>

<p>It seems that this article was written by a autogyro buff; and extensive description of flight maneuver characteristics may not be the content of a true encyclopedia. It even gives advice to autogyro newbies, but this information is useless for the normal audience of wikipedia. It must be said too that parts of this article may have been copied from an autogyro manual. There is more interesting stuff out there on the web than that in this article.

<p>Yeah, it seems there are a lot of "defenses as to why it's not so popular" mixed throughout. But I wouldn't mind a general description of the physics involved... I can't picture how it would work! ---Ransom</p>
<p>You know how a helicopter works? Well basically the rotors of the helicopter are not only the reason why they move forward, but they act as wings, because the rotors are shaped like <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfoils.html" title="Airfoils">airfoils</a> too. Now an autogiro is basically the same as well, but in this case, the motor ain't hooked up to the rotor, but to a propeller, and the propeller moves the aircraft forward, causing the rotors to rotate. But when the rotors start to rotate at a high enough speed, they start generating their own lift. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllStarZ_ea0a.html" title="User:AllStarZ">AllStarZ</a> 04:36, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having just come across this article, I must agree with the comment above - there's a lot of subtle advocacy mixed in with the facts, many of the facts are prtobably over-detailed, and some particular models appear to be being promoted over others (perhaps with good reason, but the article needs to be made more neutral and revised for the lay-reader). <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 22:10, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To AllStarZ; The difference between lift in helicopters and autogyros is that helicopters mechanically "pull" air down through the blades, creating thrust and thus lift, and air in autogyros is (for want of a better term) "pushed" up through the blades creating lift (and drag) as it forces the blades to rotate. For autorotation to commence there has to be an initial movement of air up and across the blade.</p>

<p>Last time I checked out this article it didn't seem so bad, but since then it's got quite a bit worse! Wikipedia is not a flight manual; most of the "Warnings" section is superfluous, and certainly the extensive quotation from some regulations or other totally unnecessary. As if any prospective pilot would be looking here for instruction. This article should be about the autogyro as a concept, its history and notable designs, and even talk something about its flying characteristics, but it certainly should not be going extensively in how to (or how not to) fly one. I would be tempted to post a cleanup notice but I know how annoying they are, especially when posted by someone who hasn't contributed much - so instead I'm just posting this message and see what sort of discussion it leads to, if any. On another note, why did my Mad Max 2 wiki ref get removed? I'd have thought that was interesting, since it's one of only a very small handful of films where an autogyro is a key part of the plot. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 11:27, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have added bits in the warning section about "Pilot Induced Oscillation" and the advisability of being properly instructed, even for pilots familiar with other types. Much of the failure of the type to gain wider popularity may be the accidents (caused by improper handling) related to it. It may beg the question why there is a "Warnings" section in a reference source, but since it is there I used it to point out a major cause for crashes. I feel it is correct to indicate why the subject may not be more widely known to the public. To balance this, I have also added two of the major "good" characteristics of the autogyro - the fact it cannot be stalled whilst in autorotation and that it will autorotate even at zero forward airspeed - in the main body of the piece. This is, after all, why the craft was invented/created in the first place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As regards Mad Max 2, since the Wallis autogyro is forever mentioned in relation to On Her Majestys Secret Service why not MM2? The MM2 'gyro has more plot relevance and more screen time in a film that is possibly as well known (and as iconic) as the James Bond feature. It should be pointed out that neither of the aircraft were in fact capable of some of feats depicted; the Wallis weapons payload is pure wishful thinking (I believe they were balsa mockups), and the MM2 gyro is a single person payload craft (and as for landing it in the middle of a congested area with no roll....!) Whatever, I think you should stick it back in since it is most peoples introduction to the existance of these things. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 12:16, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, maybe the MM2 removal was just an accident - I'll stick it back in and see if it stays this time. (And yes, I thought that landing was pretty suspect!) I agree that the accidents are notable, but I don't agree that an extensive "warnings" section is the right way to acknowledge them - a brief summary of typical causes and links to e.g. <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_induced_oscillation.html" title="Pilot induced oscillation">pilot induced oscillation</a>, etc should suffice (PIO should have its own article if it doesn't already, since it happens in other aircraft too). And of course this should be balanced with the good characteristics that you mention. Perhaps a "Flying characteristics" section would be better, maybe divided into advantages and disadvantages compared with other aircraft types. The extensive FAA regulations should go altogether - they are just not appropriate, and in any case pertain only to the US. By the way, I took the liberty of indenting your comments - it makes a thread easier to follow - hope that's OK. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 12:33, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re indenting - no problem. I've only been contributing for a couple of weeks and am not familiar with layaouts and stuff. In this regard, I do not know how to alter/amend/delete/create headings etc. (this is my usual approach to new sites - jump in and start typing, hopefully learning on the way) so I just add to the existing order. If anyone wanted to re-arrange it, then fine. With regard to autogyro safety records, I do believe this to be a major reason for the lack of popularity since there are many other uneconomic and/or marginal use modes of transport that have prospered.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 19:13, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool - you'll soon pick it all up. Learn by doing. When you have an edit view of the page, you can pick up things like the syntax for headings quite easily - the double or triple equal signs surrounding the text do the trick there. I think you might be right about the popularity or otherwise being down to the accident record, though it's totally illogical since if people really cared about not having accidents they'd never drive! I'd quite like to build/fly a gyro - the simplicity and STOL performance appeal to me, but I AM a little put off by the power pushover stuff and whatnot, though no doubt good instruction is essential and once you have trained it's no big deal. That said, FINDING an instructor is another matter. Anyway, straying off the point - the point is the article needs a big sort out. Maybe I'll find the time to make a stab at it myself, though I hesitate to tread on the toes of other, more prolific contributors here. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 11:29, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been trying to resolve this, but as Wikipedia seems to be the source for the majority of Google results the incorrect (and they are, at this forward flying speed the craft is likely to be descending at a faster rate!) speeds. I found the archived FAI World Speed Record page, and it appears that they are the original source of the incorrect data. I note that Keech has set some new speed records in February of this year, but the FAI list them as currently unratified (and they are much more believable too, in the 170+ k/h range). Once they are ratified then I will make the necessary amendments. I am tempted to remove the incorrect ones completely, but I want to use this template - and I'm too much the newbie to know how to "revert" this layout if I deleted it.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have now put up Keech's latest speed record ratified by the FAI, the March 2005 500km closed curcuit attempt, and removed the previous set. This certainly seems a much more believable figure - I'm surprised nobody questioned a world record speed of appx. 10-12mph!. Keech has some record attempts of March this year still awaiting the FAI. These I will post when I get them. I think we should use FAI ratified records, since this is the internationally recognised aero records body.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 22:54, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>The <i>Little Nellie</i> reference is given as a specific example of the <i>Wallis</i> autogyro, not a as pop-culture reference in and of itself. If the <i>Mad Max 2</i> appearence used another autogyro design, then <i>perhaps</i> it would merit mention in that section. However, comic apprearences do not feature actual airframes, and are usually generic types, not specific models. In addtition, they usually don't pass the "notability" threshold. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 17:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen some Mad Max fansites, and there are references to the type/make of gyro. I will find it and re-enter the details (in due course).</dd>
<dd>I have had a look at the <b>guidelines</b> on that page; it is noted that films like <i>Top Gun</i> can be included because they are <i>canonial</i>; which makes me believe that MM2 qualifies. TG is about the desire to be best, and competition with colleagues, centred around Navy flying - I submit it could be about any military combat vehicle. In MM2 the autogyro is central to the plot, it is the vehicle of one of the major protagonists which refers to the individuality and non-conforminst attitude of the character. It performs tasks within the plot that no other vehicle could (even though it stretches the truth regarding capability) making it essential, and it appears in several scenes in throughout the film. Why this example cannot be used when the equally fantastical <i>Little Nellie</i> is often quoted, when it appears in only two consecutive scenes and is not central to the plot. Also, this more recent film is likely to be most peoples introduction to the fact of the existence of autogyro's.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, the timescale of the use of autogyros in popular fiction in the 1930's may be relevant as it indicates the period when the craft was familiar to the public. The advent of the helicopter resulted in the decline of the autogyro in popular culture as much as in the aviation world.</dd>
<dd>Those are my thoughts on the matter. I will get round to adding back the MM2 info, when I get the make/type details, <i>drekkly</i>. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the MM2 aircraft is the same type (Wallis) as <i>Little Nellie</i>, then I have no problem with MM2 replacing it as an example. However, I believe the LN reference was originally added (not by me) because it is more well-known, filmed much earlier, and piloted by the creator, Ken Wallis, in the film. But I am opposed to creating another list of pop-culture appearences, and they NEVER stay small. Everyone always thinks their faverite instance of an apperaence is notable, and should be there. So if that means we end up taking out the "Little Nellie" reference altogheter, then that's fine by me. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 21:20, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thing: I have added a {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}} tag to the <i>Little Nellie</i> section, as the info needs to have verifiable sources, as would the MM2 and 30's comics appearances. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 21:46, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fine. It is my understanding that the Wallis type autogyro is a development of a Bensen model, and the MM2 'gyro is also an obvious Bensen derived design. Would the fact that they are different makes/models (of different eras, also, perhaps) be sufficient to include both - in a brief manner, naturally? <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:53, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A couple of observations, if I might: after reading over this article, it seems that the biggest problem here is a serious lack of citations. I threw a couple of {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags in, but I would urge the folks that did the actual writing here to dig into their memories and cite the sources they used.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, if you're going to include cultural references, have a section near the end of the article for them. Sticking them into the history section isn't really appropriate, as film appearances in general, and these in particular, do not have a direct bearing on the history of the aircraft itself. Having seen neither MM2 nor the Bond film, I can't speak to the notability of the appearances of either, so instead I'd like to address the notability concept. The reason the F-14 is in <i>Top Gun</i> is used as an example is because the plane's appearance was indeed notable: it was widely discussed in the media, as was its direct effect on the Navy's recruiting numbers. The Huey's appearances in <i>Apocalypse Now</i> was also well-discussed in the media. So, in my mind, if an autogyro appearance in MM2 was noted in the media as being important to the film, and that can be cited, then by all means, throw it in. If the Bond film resulted in an increase in the popularity of the autogyro, and a flocking of buyers to the showrooms (tongue firmly planted in cheek), then sure, include that. Otherwise, let's focus these encyclopedia articles on the aircraft itself, and not turn it into just another fan-cruft strewn web page. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 22:11, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I commented when attempting to find the correct speed records for autogyro's, it appears that Wikipedia <b>is</b> the major reference point on the internet. It also appears that nearly every modern <i>reference book</i> is a POV pusher (which is itself a pun, since a major debate is which is the best position for the airscrew) for the type/manufacturer preferred by the author, or is even an inhouse publication by a maker. There appears to be a serious shortage of decent reference sources.</dd>
<dd>My understanding of the Top Gun effect is that spotty male youths believed that they were going to be instructed by Kelly McGinnis! Also (on a serious note) I recall there being some media attention given to the fact that the USN first gave and then retracted support for the film, I recall very little being said about about the Tomcat.</dd>
<dd>Re the Bond film, it did give birth to a spate of films using gyro's in the plots (and most were indeed flown by Cmdr. Wallis) and possibly spiked the interest of youths of the time, i.e. me! <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 22:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, then the proper recouse would be to not just document the plane's use the Bond film, but document that it led to other film use as well. That makes the film a watershed event. Manufacturer-authored books may be POV pushers, but they can also be valuable sources of factual data. The wise editor will filter the former and only include that latter. At least, though, it conforms the article to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, or at least more-so than it is now. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 22:58, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It seems that Goodwin is a bit like Wallis, but without the fanclub that runs his website, in that he built and flew the autogyro for the film.

<p>There is a mass of great information here but it seems to have accumulated bit by bit, making it hard (for me, a non-expert) to follow. One example is the position of the section on flight controls, v. near the beginning. A rewrite would be a massive job - is there a volunteer here with the knowledge, the expertise and the time? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETraceyR_959e.html" title="User:TraceyR">TraceyR</a> 23:56, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the end of the film <i>The Rocketeer</i>, I'm pretty sure that Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn) rescues the couple from the exploding zepplin using an autogyro. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBatty42_babe.html" title="User:RoyBatty42">RoyBatty42</a> 09:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
