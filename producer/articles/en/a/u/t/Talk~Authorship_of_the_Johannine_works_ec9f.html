	    <p>--- In that bullet-list about arguments for authorship, there is a lot of talk about "the book", even references to bible verse. However, the heading concerns the authorship of "the books", and it is not even clear what book the article author refers to. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintermann_08df.html" title="User:Vintermann">vintermann</a> ---</p>
<p>The dates given for the writings of John as well as his age at the time were greatly skewed toward the argument and left out a lot of fact. The age for the apostles was 17-26 (estimated of course, but more accurate than "in his twenties") and the writings are dated as having been written in the last years of the first century (The Catholic Encyclopedia being the most complete on this subject is my main source for dates, not theology, folks.) The age is still significant, but the placement of 102 as the minimum age for John when he wrote the Gospels is not based in any fact whatsoever. Of course, the piece itself is contrasting opinions on which neither on has a whole lot of basis in provable fact, but again, this way is more accurate. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">TheGrza</a> 05:18, Oct 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the first point on the truth of the Apostle John's claim to the authorship, the use of language seemed to have a POV, regardless of intention. I took it out of the parentheses and reworded slightly. Hope it's better. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">TheGrza</a> 05:23, Oct 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think, given the title, this article is about Authorship of the Gospel of John. I.e. "of John". Thus should only be "book".</dd>
<dd>I think also, given that the Catholic encyclopedia is the development of the views on truth of the Church which developed from the Early church, it is going to be POV about dates. It has a vested interest in the Gospel of John's date being plausibly connected to a still living Apostle. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 21:14, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If this article is to be exclusively about the gospel of John, the title should be, as it is now "Authorship of John". If the article is to be about the Johannine works, the title should be "Authorship of the Johannine works". In addition, the article should be split into sections more , e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Authorship of the Gospel of John"</li>
<li>"Authorship of Revelations (also called <i>The apocalypse of St. John the Divine</i>)" - (note that Divine merely means one who has had a revelation, and apocalypse is greek for revelation, and that this is the older title of the book, revelations being a nick name)</li>
<li>"Authorship of the Johannine letters"</li>
<li>etc.</li>

<p>The supposed illiteracy of John the Apostle comes from Acts 4:13 which says "When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus." (NIV) See B.W. Johnson's Commentary on John (not an unbiased source, but we're talking about Bible Scholars <a href="http://www.mun.ca/rels/hrollmann/restmov/texts/bjohnson/ntc3/NTC300F.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.mun.ca/rels/hrollmann/restmov/texts/bjohnson/ntc3/NTC300F.HTM" rel="nofollow">here</a>). There is nothing about illiteracy. Also, if you note the point immediately after the illiterate point, they are strikingly similar so I just merged the two. Hope this clear up the confusion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">TheGrza</a> 07:09, Nov 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>N.b. at the link you give, the author uses church father's witness to Justify the authorship. This is a highly POV thing to do. The church fathers were biased, and if Iranaeus forged the gospel of john, then one should be unsurprised that he, and his supporters after him, should attest to its genuinness. A point the author of the link fails to mention. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 08:03, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only point really to take from the piece I had you look at was the fact that the only evidence of his illiteracy was Acts 4:13 which mentions no illiteracy except in the DARBY translation and the Wycliffe New Testament versions of Acts 4:13. So nowhere in the Bible in 95% of the translations does it mention something about being "unlettered and plebeian." If you are going to say that the bible insinuated that John was illiterate, first of all, do it right and find where it mentions this and put that in the article.</p>
<p>As to your other point that lack of schooling infers illiteracy, that's highly POV and really has no basis in fact. There are a number of other issues that could promote literacy without expanding one's knowledge, or having someone be known as a smart guy. Including reading the Torah and the rest of the Tanakh. Which they, as Jews, devout Jews who most historical accounts suggest were with John the Baptist before Jesus came around. John the Baptist known for running a completely insane and rigourously devout colony of people that wouldn't be inhabited by those who didn't know the Torah and Tanakh. So to infer from one passage the literacy of this man and to not include where you get any information is clearly POV and also clearly uninformed. I'm reverting it back to it's original state which makes the point that John was no genius and that for him to have written it probably would need something on the scale of a large deity but that no, he wasn't illiterate.--[[User:TheGrza|The<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza">Grza</a>]] 18:37, Nov 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Greek text has ἀγράμματοι meaning "without learning", "unlettered", used in the Greek corpus in this sense in Xenophon and in the Greek Anthology. The fact that John was "known to the High Priest" could indicate a certain amount of contact there, so that he would have at least some education... If John lived as long as he is reputed to have lived, the possibility of gaining those skills remains open as well. <a href="../../../m/p/o/User%7EMpolo_8b72.html" title="User:Mpolo">Mpolo</a> 20:39, Nov 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed if he was <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prester_John_7689.html" title="Prester John">Prester John</a> he would be an amazingly good writer. But this is about the anti-John-did-the-gospel argument, which does quite frequently use the case that john was illiterate. If this article was about who <b>did</b> write the gospel of john then it would be fine to take into account the above. But this article is about the critical <b>argument</b> about John having written the gospel, and the argument against does frequently use the john-is-unable-to-write case. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 23:38, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would suggest that the difference between "without learning" and "unlettered" are pretty far apart. I don't think there is nearly enough evidence to suggest that the man was illiterate at any point, regardless of learning. And, I point out as well, that all but two of the translations take the "without learning" angle, even the non-secular and historical study bibles that are not translated by religous people but by linguists and historians for the sole purpose of studying this age, not this religion. If they all disagreed because they had manufactured the idea that John was a <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopard.html" title="Leopard">leopard</a> instead of a human being that would not merit inclusion. We should be including the points that have basis in fact, as all the others do. When it is argued that John could have learned to write by the time he hit old age, this is not a reason not to include the argument because that would belong in the "for" column. This is not that case. There is no evidence whatsoever to support this specific argument against. Also, we are not removing legitimate arguments against John having written the books, we are removing arguments with no basis in fact. Your reference to Genesis is a complete non sequiter. (I understand that you are referring to the article. I still maintain that it makes no sense at all in this context.) --[[User:TheGrza|The<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a>]] 00:47, Nov 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, that is an important point of view too (though rather odd). If they had manufactured the idea of John as a leopard, then that ought to be mentioned too, along with an explanation of their motives.

<dd>Anyway, exactly how many people could write back then? Why do you think that scribes existed as a profession? The point is that hardly anyone could write, and that doing so would make you instantly highly employable.

<p>Well, me and you will just have to disagree on the asinine leopard comment, but your point about scribes is a good one. However, literacy rates among the Jewish faithful were much higher and among the ultra-religious (and John was not just a fisherman, he had been a member of the Baptist collective with John the Baptist) it was very high. Many of the Gnostics actually came out of this tradition which is how THEY were able to write. --[[User:TheGrza|The<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a>]] 01:21, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My opinion, from reading the article, is that the article is a bit confused concerning authorship. Sometimes very strong statements are given that the historical apostle John is completely eliminated as a possible author. Then, at other times, the article gives positions iterating the possibility of John's involvement in authorship. Also, there doesn't seem to be a very coherent approach to discussing the issue, rather the treatment is more frenetic. As a result the reader is jolted into one position, then out of it, with nothing more than statements like "most scholars agree..." I think there is room for subtle improvement here. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 23:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>History of critical scholarship</b> "Many modern critics follow him in this late dating."</p>
<p><br />
<b>More recent criticism</b></p>
<p>"Many suggested further that John the Baptist himself belonged to an Essene community, and if John the Apostle had previously been a disciple of the Baptist, he would have been affected by that teaching."</p>
<p><b>Modern criticism</b></p>
<p>"Many critical scholars today conclude (with the tradition) that the "disciple whom Jesus loved" was intended to be understood as John the Apostle"</p>
<p>"Most scholars posit a community of writers rather than a single individual that gave final form to the work"</p>
<p>"Most scholars date the writing of the Gospel to the last four or five years of the first century"</p>
<p>"However, as noted above, a few choose a much later date, typically around the time of Irenaeus - circa 180AD."</p>
<p>"Consequently several scholars have proposed that the Gospel was deliberately written in the late second century to explicitly oppose those heresies"</p>
<p>"Some scholars have even proposed that Irenaeus himself, who had a similar writing style, theology, and knowledge of literary Greek, was the author"</p>
<p><b>First epistle</b></p>
<p>"Given the similarity with the Gospel, most critical scholars assign the same authorship to the epistle that they assign to the Gospel. Most refer to a Johannine school from which the letter stemmed, possibly even from the hand of the apostle himself."</p>
<p><b>Second and third epistles</b></p>
<p>Thus most scholars assume that some personality in the circle of disciples of John was the author of these books.</p>

<dd>No, actually you are just looking too much into it, the article is written that way for an easy reading, if the text would give sources every time a setence would come up then it would be 10 times as big as it is right now. If an article uses words like "some" or "most" is not because it lacks sources, its because the information must be simplified to fit an encyclopedic format.

<p>I've cut this because Charles Hill doesn't seem to be a notable scholar - see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Appropriate sources for wikipedia</a>, and doesn't seem to have affected the views of notable scholars. He just seems to be "some evangelical protestant seminary teacher" (that probably should make his bias clear as well). <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 21:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see how you can say that a book published by OUP is inappropriate for wikipedia. It's perhaps the premier academic press in the English-speaking world. There are also, at the link, favorable blurbs about his book from mainstream journals. On what basis do you claim, Clinkophonist, that Hill is only "some evangelical protestant seminary teacher"? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to add to this - having looked up <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Theological_Seminary_34b2.html" title="Reformed Theological Seminary">Reformed Theological Seminary</a>, it does seem to be a fairly dubious enterprise, with its support for Biblical inerrancy, and what not. That said, the book was still published by OUP, and that means it counts as a proper scholarly publication, whatever its author's biases may be. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:10, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my view, excluding an academic work simply because the author is a religious teacher itself may represent a bias, and also a kind of ad hominem. I know too little of the work in question to pass judgement, but its worth ought to be dependant on its ability to manifest rational arguments. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 22:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The identification of some of the texts with a "John the Priest" may be seen in Eusebius, long before the sixth century. And the slow acceptence of Revelation among the Eastern Fathers is enough to show some hesitency about identifying John the Apostle as author. The same may be said of one of the epistles. My point is, even with the ref to Harris, I think the info is wrong - an oversimplification. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, granted, but its something we might want to think about. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 15:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the 6th centruy bit is strange.

<dd>I do not agree with the redirect/merger. John of Patmos has been a motif in western art, and a religious figure for a number of Christian churches. Therefore, someone may be search of John of Patmos and be disappointed when they show up at a discussion on biblical authorship. I suggest that we restore the JoP article.
