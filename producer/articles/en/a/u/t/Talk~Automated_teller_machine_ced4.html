<dd>Yes, I agree. Nobody in the UK calls them ATMs, although this term is sometimes used where there is only enough space for a short abbreviation (Barclays bank statements used to use it). I'm inserting the more common term <b>cash machine</b> in the introduction. Also, I've never heard anyone use the term "teller". <a href="../../../n/f/h/User%7ENFH_d937.html" title="User:NFH">NFH</a> 22:54, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's funny — the term "teller" is in common use in the United States for a bank clerk. Both my regular dictionary (Merriam-Webster's) and my law dictionary (Black's) have a definition for teller. We've clearly stumbled across yet another difference between American and British English. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 05:08, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wood Green / Enfield Town - I've seen several sources that say it was in Enfield Town (on Church Street). I've walked past the plaque that marks the spot.

<p>Yes, it's definitely Enfield Town, not Wood Green. My apologies: I have a feeling that one of the earliest 2nd-generation cash dispensers was in Wood Green: I'll try to dig out a cite. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a></p>

Yes, it <i>is</i> often called an <b>ATM machine</b>, which, if you work it out, stands for "Automatic Teller Machine Machine". Not sure what to do with this factoid, I just find it interesting that people say it without ever stopping to think what they are <i>really</i> saying. (I used to say it myself until a friend pointed it out to me.) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p><i>Typically, if the number is entered incorrectly several times in a row, most ATMs will retain the card as a security precaution to prevent an unauthorised user from working out the PIN by pure guesswork.</i></p>
<p>The last 100-odd times I've had recourse to an ATM, I was required to merely swipe my card, rather than insert it into the machine. Is this peculiar to New York, to urban areas, to the US? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">Charles A. L.</a> 01:15, Feb 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my bailiwick "swipers" are used mainly by retailers, but "inserters" are used by banks and ATM's. <a href="../../../m/y/d/User%7EMydogategodshat_753f.html" title="User:Mydogategodshat">mydogategodshat</a> 04:40, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lately most lower-end, stand alone ATMs have been equipped with card swipe or "dip" readers. These keep costs down as they have no moving parts to break. However, there have been incidents of ATM customers jamming their cards into the receipt printer slot when confronted with a swipe reader, jamming the printer and costing the customer a card. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Schlosser42_bfe8.html" title="User:Brian Schlosser42">Brian Schlosser42</a></dd>

<dd>In the US, swipers are most common. In the UK though, merchants had both inserters and swipers but in many cases have the inserer more conviently located. And also note that while for the US, fast swiping is prefered by the readers, in the UK slow swiping is prefered by them. Basicaly, the UK merchants only use the swipers to read those cards without a chip (mostly older ones in the UK and virtually all American ones).</dd>

<p>I realize that this section deals with <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_ATMs_0987.html" title="Talking ATMs">Talking ATMs</a> designed to aid the blind that employ headphone jacks, but it implies that there were no "talking ATMs" in the US before 1999. Many annoying talking ATMs existed long prior to that, however, that speak instructions right out load over a speaker by default. (In the South, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publix.html" title="Publix">Publix</a> grocery stores still have ATMs that do this (Publix's "Presto" ATMs.)) Obviously these are different than ATMs with audible interface for the blind, but, they are certainly "talking ATMs." 70.145.102.253 04:03, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In Japan most cash machines are talking. A voice tells things such as "please insert the card or bank book", and the buttons on the panels are usually accompanied by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braille.html" title="Braille">Braille</a> script. The displays are usually touch-sensitive, but this function is useless if you can't see what's shown on the display. This article suggests that all talking cash machines feature headphones, but no talking cash machines that I have seen in Japan have headphones. (218.228.195.44 14:44, 5 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I agree. Whomever wrote that must have been a teenager. I clearly remember all the sensationalism in the American media about bank patrons being robbed at gunpoint at ATMs back in the early 1990s (which is why us Americans have so many drive-thru ATMs now).

<li><b>Neutral</b> Both are acceptable. The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Merriam-Webster and Random House Unabridged all list "automatic teller machine" as correct alternatives. Google has 573.000 to 396.000 hits for automated/automatic, respectively. It also seems to be a regional difference: If you search on Australian sites, it's only 815 to 24.400, so hardly anyone down under seems to use the "-ed" version. And in the UK neither expression is used. An "automatic teller" might not make sense, but read it as "automatic (teller machine)" and it does make sense. So there's no need for embarrassment whatsoever, and no need for a move. -- <a href="../../../h/0/0/User%7EH005_e797.html" title="User:H005">H005</a> 20:24, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, public reaction to proposed increases in fees was so strong that fees were removed altogether for using ATMs at banks, regardless of whether the user is a customer of that bank. However, each time a bank's customer uses a rival bank's ATM, the customer's bank has to pay a fee to the rival bank, which the customer's bank absorbs. As a result, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Direct_1394.html" title="First Direct">First Direct</a> wrote to its customers in December 2005 asking its customers wherever possible to use ATMs of <a href="../../../h/s/b/HSBC_Bank_%28Europe%29_bb5a.html" title="HSBC Bank (Europe)">HSBC</a>, its parent bank, in order to keep <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Direct_1394.html" title="First Direct">First Direct</a>'s costs down. There are a growing number of machines in locations such as garages, nightclubs and other venues which do charge. The fee is usually between <a href="../../../g/b/p/GBP_3add.html" title="GBP">£</a>1.50 and £2.00, but occasionally they have been known to charge up to £5 and in one central <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> club £10.

<p>Hi, I'd just like to point out that the things about the US also apply to Canada (or at least Ottawa). So many references to "US" can be changed to refer to "North America"; however, I recognize that this is still regional. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banks charge fees (usually $1.50-$2) to withdraw money if you are a customer of a different bank</li>
<li>Non-bank ATMs, which are prevalent in corner stores, grocery stores, take-out places, outdoor festivals, etc. also charge $2 per withdrawal</li>
<li>Non-bank ATMs (I believe) make up the bulk of ATM expansion (I recall reading an article about this, but haven't the foggiest idea where)</li>

<p>I'm watching a 1985 episode of <i><a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonlighting_%28TV_series%29_fb8c.html" title="Moonlighting (TV series)">Moonlighting</a></i>, in which a character stops at an ATM at <a href="../../../l/a/x/LAX_1656.html" title="LAX">LAX</a>. After he inserts his card, a telephone attached to the ATM rings; a customer service rep asks him for verifying information such as mother's maiden name, birthplace, etc., and then telling him that the card was cancelled. It looks like there are instructions on the ATM explaining that this will occur if there is a problem with the card.

<p>All Japanese cash machines are accompanied by a telephone for customer service. Possibly for this reason, Japanese cash machines don't operate 24 hours a day, but close during night and are often unavailable on Sundays and public holidays. (218.228.195.44 14:58, 5 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>"An ATM is also known, in English, as an Automat (Europe), Automated Banking Machine or Bank Machine (Canada), Bancomat (Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Italy, and Switzerland), Bankomat (Sweden and Poland), Cash Machine (UK), Cashpoint (New Zealand, UK), or Minibank (Norway)." -- In what sense is Bankomat an English-language term, if it's used in Sweden and Poland but not in English-speaking countries? Similarly Bancomat? The same question applies to Minibank (just because it's made up of English words doesn't mean it's an English word, rather than a Norwegian word created from English words!) and probably to Automat. --86.142.110.97 17:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For Bancomat, Bankomat, and Automat, I think the case is more that since English is not the dominant language in those locales, the local English speakers have adopted the dominant language's term for the device to English. The use of that term would be used in an English sentence without other local English speakers being uncertain as to what the original speaker was talking about, nor would it necessarily have to make sense to people outside that region. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perestroika.html" title="Perestroika">Perestroika</a> is an example of a Russian-language term that is accepted as a word in English in a similar fashion.

<p>Does anyone have concrete knowledge of the cash denominations that are commonly dispense in different countries?

<dl>
<dd>Depends on customer and historical preference, fraud rates of the various denominations, how the local currency is denominated, currency inflation rates, how much risk the ATM provider wants to take of leaving money in the vault, and insurance premiums charged for the money in the vault.

<p>Found this short about an ATM scam involving entering a code on the keypad which would fool the machine into handing out $20 bills as if they were $5 ones.

<p>The history section is dubious at best because it identifies the voucher based cash dispensing machine in London as the first ATM. The cash dispensers in London required pre-paid vouchers or plastic &amp; required the Bank customers using these machines to purchase more cards since the machines did not return the card after the transaction. The first ATM machine as we know them today was installed in 1969 at the Chemical Bank in New York and it was not until 1971 that a full service ATM (including deposits) was installed. The concept for the ATM machine (not the simple cash dispenser)was developed by James Goodfellow of Scotland in 1966. The paragraph should be rewritten so as to be fully accurate and giving credit to all those involved in developing the ATM.
