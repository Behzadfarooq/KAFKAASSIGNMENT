<dd>"As a rule of thumb, users with fewer than 500 edits in the article namespace will not be added to the list." You don't need 500 edits. In fact, when I consider whom to approve, I look at their edit count, their talk page, their block log, and their contributions. What the phrase means is that, if you have less than 500 edits, you haven't been on Wikipedia long enough for us to see how valuable your contributions are and whether you would misuse the software. It's easier to scan people before approving them than it is to scan every edit made using AWB and approve everyone by default.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self Links</span></h2>
<p>I Think Instead of Removing Self Links AWB should Make them Bold or leave them the way they are because they already are viewed as Bold. Some Templates to navigate pages have the page it is on in Bold because it is a link and removing the Wiki-link will just mess up the template so it will be harder to copy it to other pages.--<a href="../../../y/s/k/User%7EYskyflyer_5780.html" title="User:Yskyflyer">E-Bod</a> 23:29, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And this is why you should check every edit. AWB suggests some things you might want to change, but it can't possibly suggest right all of the time. Can you give me an example of a template designed for articles with a self-link? I'm not sure that they should exist - an 'edit' link to a template is useful, but I can't see a need to link to the template. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventyThree_f926.html" title="User:SeventyThree">SeventyThree</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESeventyThree_51bb.html" title="User talk:SeventyThree">Talk</a>)</sup> 10:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was referring to this box on <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s_fads_and_trends.html" title="1990s fads and trends">1990s fads and trends</a>. I did manually undo that part of the edit on AWB Before i saved it</p>
<p>I can remembered similar boxes on the bottom of any closely linked page But now that i come to look at them more closely only the one above was the only one that didn't use a template. <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retina.html#External_links" title="Retina">Retina#External_links</a> {{Retina}} {{Eye}}</p>

<p>I guess the Appropriate thing would be to make a template and that would fix the problem.</p>
<p>Why I mention this is that one mistake on a template that is made in the page and not on a template pate will get copied to relate articles and you have to go back by had to fix it. I guess</p>

<dd>For normal templates, editing a page which they are used on doesn't edit the template. The first example you gave is something which looks like a template, but really isn't.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Open Page in IE or Firefox</span></h2>
<p>It would be so cool if there was a button In AWB that let it open the page it is editing in your Default Browser (ex. a new tab in Firefox). This would be helpful for those pages, that you come across while going though the list AWB generates, that require more personal attention or you want to make sure you don’t miss anything AWB changed that just doesn’t make sense for that page. Let’s say you want to get to the page’s talk page or you want to fallow a link on the page because it looks like it could use a lot of disambiguating or you need to add some formatting from the browser toolbox.</p>
<p>Other features I would expect that aren’t here.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I use AWB I sometimes get the urge to click on the middle bar as if to drag it down to see more of the page only to find out it is unmovable</li>
<li>I try to highlighting parts of the preview page (up top) and hit copy only to remember that you can’t copy from the preview page</li>
<li>No Toolbox like the in the browser</li>

<dd>As far as the Firefox request, AWB has always worked that way. Right-clicking in the edit area brings up OPEN PAGE IN BROWSER which opens the page in your default browser (new tab in my own standard configuration) Let me know if it does not open a new tab and we can get your Firefox to do it that way.

<dd>I think in general though (and this also applies to manually done talk page postings) you should consider whether you have to have people on a spamlist and post it on their talk page or whether it's easier to just make a subpage of your userspace to update with the new info and have all interested users just add that to their watchlist since spam postings fill up talk pages and make them harder to read even if the person who's talk page it is requested the notice, and it is also considered better practice to avoid leaving bulk messages in general if at all possible. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 19:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My understanding (working from The Cambridge Guide to English Usage) is that it should really be "an RAF". Normally abbreviations which start with vowels and F,L,H,M,N,R,S and X are proceded by "an" whilst everything else gets "a". However, it you wrote it in full it would be "a Royal Air Force". The difference is due to the way the pronunciation of the single letters.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some requests...</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I've been trying this program for a while and it is wonderfull! I have some possibilities to improve it:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add an option, such that the program corrects when there are two capital letters at the begining of a word as a typing mistake. FOr example -&gt; For example.</li>
<li>When we don't choose case sensitive in the search and replace field, it would be good (ar at least that exist the option) to leave the capital letters as they were. So, if I look for "oficial -&gt; official" and it finds at the beginning of a sentence "Oficial", it should change to "Official" and not to "official". (if I put case sensitive, then it works but then I have to add to my list two entries: "oficial -&gt; official" and "Oficial -&gt; Official"... or even more, maybe the whole word is in capital letters: OFICIAL and if I put case sensitive it will not find it and if I put this intermedium-case sensitive I propose, it will change it leaving as it was...</li>
<li>(this one I don't know if it already exists): when you make the elements of a category, to see if an element is in this category and, at the same time, in a subcategory (and then delete the first category).</li>
<li>To see if an element is in a category, but not in another whose name is the name of the element (so, for example as if the article "music" were in "entertainment" but not in the category "music").</li>
<li>To list all the elements of not only a category but also of all its subcategories (if you want to make a change related to an specific field and not having to look for all the subcategories).</li>
<li>In the edit part (down-right), to add some of this buttons that there are here in the normal edit page such as the quick link to make internal links on the wiki (this one that when you press appears this: [[<font style="background:blue; color: white">Link title</font>]]. This is because if you see a page that has many links to add, you can go faster adding them.</li>
<li>Add an option such that if the article doesn't have the {{commons}} template, and in commons there is a page with the same title as the article we are editing, add the template {{commons|TitleOfTheArticle}}. The user should then of course verifiy that this page corresponds with the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now two maybe more difficult things...:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt the program for other browsers (with the log in) and also for other OS...</li>
<li>Simplify the log-in process for the other wikipedias: we first have to log-in to the english, and then log in again to the regional one if we want our contribuions not to be anonymus. This probably is still not possible because of this restriction list in which we have to appear to use the program, but maybe it could exist one list in each wikipedia and then the program should check the list in the one you want to work (and then there would be no more problems of contributions in another wiki because everyone would have the permission only in the wiki he/she works). By the way, now when I want to work with the wiki in my language firs I always have to make a search in the english one, and then I already can work with mine, but if I directly choose to work with mine, does'nt appear any message telling me that I have to log in. Simply starts looking to fill the list and never stops...</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, sorry for so many requests and english mistakes... I hope you find some of this suggestions interesting. By the way, to translate the program to the other wikipedias couldn't you ask help them (everyone makes his own work)? I don't know much about programming, so maybe this is stupid, but I think it would be less work for you and many people would collaborate with it...</p>
<p>Despite all my text, I want to thank your work because I really think this program is a great help for all of us. --<a href="../../../../ca/x/t/v/Usuari%7EXtv_dc43.html" class="extiw" title="ca:Usuari:Xtv">Xtv</a> - (<a href="../../../x/t/v/User_talk%7EXtv_7e5f.html" title="User talk:Xtv">my talk</a>) - (<a href="../../../../ca/x/t/v/Usuari_Discussi%C3%B3%7EXtv_5baa.html" class="extiw" title="ca:Usuari_Discussió:Xtv">que dius que què?</a>) 23:52, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Case sensitive appears to be broken</span></h2>
<p>The new version (2600) of AWB appears to have a non-functioning "Case sensitive" switch for regular expressions. I'm having problems obviously related to matching irrespective of the case specified in the regular expressions. This was not happening in the previous versions and I have not changed any settings since then. And yes, the "Case sensitive" box is checked. - <a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEmt147_6c59.html" title="User:Emt147">Emt147</a> <a href="../../../e/m/t/User_talk%7EEmt147_88d0.html" title="User talk:Emt147"><small><sup>Burninate!</sup></small></a> 00:50, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bunch of weird errors</span></h2>
<p>I just picked up AWB after not using it for a while so this all could be user error! I downloaded 2600 to make sure I had the latest. I noticed that [[image:smiley.png]] has a note asking that it be replaced with [[image:smiley.svg]] so I decided to see if I could do a few... So I tried to do a make list from what links here for the smiley.svg page. I got nothing from AWB. The page, being an image page, and being an image actually kept on commons, may have some special characteristics? It has a list of pages using the image, as do all image pages though. So I tried make from links on page and got nothing as well. So I made up a text file to import, selecting some pages from the list.</p>
<p>I have all options/cleanups/changes etc turned OFF except for one find and replace , which as you might expect is Find: "image:smiley.png" Replace "image:smiley.svg" case sensitive turned off, regexes turned off. I got some changed just fine, but am getting odd results for some articles. It's not always finding them. I can find them by hand in the right window though and change them by hand.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Querying category/stub order apparently used by AWB as default</span></h2>
<p>Hi,<br />
Taking my cue from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foxe_Peninsula&amp;curid=4471985&amp;diff=53499375&amp;oldid=44889133" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foxe_Peninsula&amp;curid=4471985&amp;diff=53499375&amp;oldid=44889133" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I'm wondering if this [categories then stubs] order is an AWB default...? &#160;If so, I'd ask for it to be reconsidered, as I think almost every page I've ever edited on Wikipedia places stubs <i>before</i> categories – a sensible convention, in my view, as this mimics the order in which they appear on an article page.</p>
<p>If this behaviour isn't an AWB default, my apologies for thinking it might be.<br />

<dd>Putting the stub first makes it so the stub category is the first listed, but categories are normally listed by importance. Plus it makes it less likely the stub will join on to the above text if it is placed at the very bottom, e.g. see <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamiya_Abed_Khadawi_0b53.html" title="Lamiya Abed Khadawi">Lamiya Abed Khadawi</a>, where the stub is apparently an external link. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:14, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stub templates often include code to add a page to a category - if the stub templates are placed earlier in the article than the normal group of categories, then wikipedia finds the stub-template-given categories first, so they appear at the start of the list. If the stub templates are placed after the main block of categories, then the stub-template-given categories are found last by wikipedia, so they show up last in the list of categories on the final page. People seem to prefer having the stub-categories after any other categories. I think that's the main point. I found it confusing at first - but this way gives a better article because the categories are in a better order. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventyThree_f926.html" title="User:SeventyThree">SeventyThree</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESeventyThree_51bb.html" title="User talk:SeventyThree">Talk</a>)</sup> 05:11, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is only actually a problem when interwiki links are added as well. I find the order categories + stub templates + interwiki links rather messy. I prefer to use the order: stub templates + categories + interwiki links. The code looks nicer that way, especially if the article already uses succession boxes or other templates. People often just add new stub templates to the bottom of the page without checking if a stub is already located further up. Because of the stub templates, I normally disable the "fix minor errors" feature. Apart from this, AWB is a very useful tool. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 07:42, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks to all for the above. Having just read it, however – and I think I'm now more awake! – it seems to me that there's no consensus for the order categories-then-stubs. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> links to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lamiya_Abed_Khadawi&amp;oldid=30208183" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lamiya_Abed_Khadawi&amp;oldid=30208183" rel="nofollow">this</a>, where the order is stubs-then-categories (albeit poorly spaced); and <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> states his preference as "stub templates + categories + interwiki links", i.e. stubs-then-categories(-then-interwiki). I'm puzzled by SeventyThree's observation that "People seem to prefer having the stub-categories after any other categories" as my experience of Wikipedia thus far overwhelmingly indicates the reverse; on those few occasions I have found stubs following categories, it's been on very stubby article pages that have poor/no formatting anyway. Whether editors place stubs above or below categories in a page's source, the software displays the categories at the bottom of the page, so it seems to make sense to me to mimic that ordering. (I suggest all this in lieu of <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:167">Bugzilla:167</a>, for which I and others have voted, but I guess the powers that be are kept so busy...)</p>
<p>...As an experiment, I've just examined the first five pages with stub/s offered by <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">Special:Randompage</a>: <a href="../../../s/t/j/Stjerneborg.html" title="Stjerneborg">Stjerneborg</a>; <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llan_Ffestiniog_264c.html" title="Llan Ffestiniog">Llan Ffestiniog</a>; <a href="../../../n/a/m/Naming_taboo.html" title="Naming taboo">Naming taboo</a>; <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kraus_68b5.html" title="Peter Kraus">Peter Kraus</a>; and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Television_and_Appliances_7ee5.html" title="Sun Television and Appliances">Sun Television and Appliances</a>. All have their {{<i>X</i>-stub}} entries placed above their [[Category:...]] entries. I'll try another five anon...<br />

<dd>Categories are normally sorted by importance, putting the stub first puts the least important category first. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 14:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Is there a consensus recorded somewhere that (a) stub categories are "least important" – but, more importantly, that (b) [[Category:...]] entries are better placed before {{<i>X</i>-stub}} entries?</li>
<li>Using <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">Special:Randompage</a> again, these were the first five stub articles it delivered: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hutson_f228.html" title="John Hutson">John Hutson</a> (quite long for a stub!); <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golian.html" title="Golian">Golian</a>; <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_Agreement_2d9e.html" title="Quebec Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a> (again quite long); <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Lotsof_6a1c.html" title="Howard Lotsof">Howard Lotsof</a>; and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Perlberg_c634.html" title="William Perlberg">William Perlberg</a>. Once again, all {{<i>X</i>-stub}} entries appeared before [[Category:...]] entries... As this stubs-then-categories order mimics the order that stub templates and the category list appear on a page, this seems a sensible norm – so I don't understand why AWB reverses it...?<br /></li>

I think AWB should still offer the option to switch on or off individual "Apply general fixes" options, so I'll suggest and try to encourage this development at sourceforge.net.

<p>Actually this is better done by hand if it it uses Different Quotes, However it if is the same quote over and over again you can move it to WikiQuote and then have AWB find "XXX" and replace with [[q:Page Name]].

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Posible new feature (or I'm missing somthing again)</span></h2>
<p>I just wondered if a new feature would be possible that would fit in with the request for a trial version asked about before. I have a list of 3500+ articles that I ran through AWB to look for a certain phrase, which wasn't there and was what I wanted to see. What I would like to see is a second option on AWB that when you choose it turns all editing capabilities off. From there you would have two other options. First you could run through your list, stop on each article and see what the results of your potential edits would be but you would be unable to save them. The second option would run through the list searching for a word or phrase. When it found the phrase AWB would not stop but continue on searching. However, it would not remove the particular article from the list. When it had finished you would have a list of articles containing that phrase (or if you preferred, not containing the phrase). This can of course be done manually with AWB but it requires that I sit and watch it to move onto the next article. The 3500+ list takes over 5 hours to process and it's perfect to do on a spare computer at work. The list I have is for airports and I want to update my <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_Airports_with_no_infobox_01_032d.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather/Airports with no infobox 01">User:CambridgeBayWeather/Airports with no infobox 01</a> lists. Of course one of the currently available bots may already be able to do this but looking through the list it's not clear if they do. or AWB can do it and I just didn't notice it.
