<p>The pornography industry's apparent failure to provide autocunnilingus imagery in its unending attempts to provide sexual novelty makes me skeptical of the existence of autocunnilingus until evidence is presented to demonstrate it. However, absence of proof is not proof of absence, and there's nothing in the laws of geometry to prevent this. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 22:21, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC) Data point: A PubMed search for "autofellatio" finds 3 articles for human autofellatio (and one for monkeys).

<dd>This is clearly sexist. The references to male acts simply reinforces the stereotypical male philosophy of judging women based on their physical characteristics. One can easily find photographs of contortionists in such positions as to make autocunnilingue possible (though typical photographs will show women wearing clothes). Also, an edited photograph will bear typical numerical noise at the edited parts. I you cannot find them, you can have a good presumption that the image is genuine. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 14:45, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So it's sexist to point out that men's genitals generally extend several inches further than women's? One might claim that the assertion that there are easily found photographs of contortionists in such positions as to make the act possible displays stereotypical female weak spatial analysis -- but that would clearly be sexist, as is talk of "the stereotypical male philosophy". -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 01:04, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These "straightfull" photos quite obviously do not illustrate women in a position to perform ac. In both cases, the woman's tongue would need to be over a foot long in order to reach her genitals.

<dd>Unfortunately, these are not convincing. The first image is too affected by foreshortening to judge. Consider your second image, <a href="http://www.retrospekt.net/retroalbum/bhaileathlacliath/bigimages/IMG_2828.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.retrospekt.net/retroalbum/bhaileathlacliath/bigimages/IMG_2828.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Now consider the remaining gap. Moving the head towards the pubis would result in the performer's chin hitting their chest. I have looked at a variety of images (see for example those at <a href="http://www.contortionhomepage.com/photolib.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.contortionhomepage.com/photolib.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) and none of these show any performer achieving a sufficient <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontbend.html" title="Frontbend">frontbend</a> ("frontbend" apparently being the technical term for the required contortion). -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 00:27, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

An examination in photoshop shows intentional bluring around the curve of the back, piecing together of background in that same region, cloning of pixels around the back, and a chopped straight line in the area of her back within the crook of her arm. I assume that two models were used - the body of the one on top removed and replaced with background, and a curve faked with the stamp and blur tools. Either way, it's not legit and I'm taking it out. <a href="http://www.erosblog.com/archives/00000543.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.erosblog.com/archives/00000543.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.erosblog.com/archives/00000543.htm</a> could be either way -- the angle is such that it's impossible to tell if it's been doctored.

<dd>I take umbrage with the statement "Probably the strongest evidence for the non-existence or extreme rarity of autocunnilingus is the failure of the pornography industry to produce images of autocunnilingus, as no non-faked images of this act have been documented." Both images and video of this act can be easily found, albeit not in maistream porn but in fetish porn as this is clearly a special interest. You need to look beyond your nose. I suggest you visit the usenet group alt.binaries.pictures.contortion.nude for additional research. While it is possible for one to argue that all the images are faked (much as people claimed that Linda Lovelace's performance in "Deep throat" was) It is clear that with the abundance of images that the above statement is not credible. --141.150.77.178 00:48, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say that this is a fake. First, that girl's torso looks way too long. Second, the spot where her back bends looks really blotchy and unnatural compared to the rest of her skin. Third, look at the spot to the right of her body--there's clearly a lot of editing going on there (presumably to hide that this was originally a picture of two girls). For example, the section of the bed (or whatever it is this girl is sitting on) below and slightly to the right of the girl's elbow is copied from a section immediately to the left--note that the reflection is the same, and the corner of the section to the left of the original section is visible in the copied section. --24.151.40.104</dd>

<dd>Hmmm yes you're right. One reasonable course of action (though I don't plan to expend the effort) would be to track down the woman in the picture and ask her to do it on video, as video (with good lighting, in colour) is much better proof of the possibility of the act. Even so, it looks pretty old so I'm betting she'd dead by now. Even if not, since flexibility decreases with the effects of aging, it's doubtful someone could retain the ability. Hopefully she trained future students, or other women contortionists have attempted the act. The difficult I think is that the only people you'd get actual proof from would be a combination of expert contortionist and an exhibitionist. This greatly limits the pool of people we can select from who might be able to do it, in finding proof. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 09:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The way some of you go on about this, it sounds like a kind of Holy Grail. I know it's possible, but I have no idea how many women do it, and I'm not sure I want to know. I had a very short relationship with a woman who claimed to be able to "eat herself out." Although she wouldn't give an unclothed demonstration, I did see her put her mouth so far between her (clothed) legs that there was absolutely no doubt in my mind about what she could do to herself. I get the idea that it's something that is really unappealing or unintuitive to most women. It seems that a lot more guys want to perform oral sex on themselves than women, but I'm no expert. In case you're wondering, having large breasts doesn't seem to indicate an inability to do this. The young lady I saw simulate this had large (maybe 36D?) breasts, but was tall and slender, maybe 5'8".</p>

<p>I don't understand why anyone would go to the time and trouble to fake a picture of this when there are clearly women who can do it, although I don't know how easy it is to find women who are willing to be photographed <i>in flagrante dilecto</i>. I also don't really see the erotic appeal. This is more bizarre than sexy. Surely there's someone who's been to a sideshow who can comment on this. BrianGCrawfordMA 01:44, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The argument is, if so many women can do it, it would have appeared in pornography, and no one has found any.

<dd>Actually, it states, as of June 8th, 2006, that men and women are likely equally <i>apt to be contortionists</i>. It says nothing of the general population, even noting that hypermobility is a genetic trait and not a learned skill, as opposed to just being able to stretch. For AC, I'm pretty sure you'd have to be hypermobile. I think that the perception that women are more flexible is just the result of what the arrangements of ligaments in the groin allow women to do more easily, namely splits. Here is the whole text:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Myth: Women are more apt to be contortionists than men.</b> — Pictures of contortionists throughout history and around the world, taken as a whole, show nearly equal numbers of males and females. Western contortionists in the late 19th century were mostly men, just as extreme flexibility in modern India is practiced mostly by men. Also, medical studies show that nearly equal numbers of hypermobile males and females are found when the trait runs in the family. Therefore, the fact that most contortionists in Western cultures today are female is simply a result of the current cultural preference.</li>

<dd>The joints of the spine permit greater movement towards the back than the front. It's not like there's a hinge in the middle of the spine that bends equally both ways; the joints of the spine are quite complex and permit a greater freedom of motion in some directions, and less in others. When you bend forward, the spinal bodies get closer together and block further movement in that direction rather quickly. When you bend backward, the spinal bodies get further apart, and so don't prevent movement. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:37, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I was quite careful to <i>not</i> rely solely on the opinion of one person, especially one person I knew only through a message board. However, since during this entire time nobody (I repeat, <i>nobody</i>) here has found a reliable link on their own, has it perhaps crossed your mind that the people who do research on the spine might know where to find it, documented and irrefutable? I'd like to read an excerpt from the article you refer to: "That is, any facts, opinions, interpretations, definitions, and arguments published by Wikipedia must already have been published by a reliable publication in relation to the topic of the article." So, do you actually thing such a huge part of basic anatomy as the <i>flexibility of the spine</i> has gone this long without being reliably documented in countless ways? Exactly. So, to return to what I said, we need to ask the people <i>who know.</i> Black Carrot 15:50, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say almost certainly. One tip-off is how much of her back is showing behind her thighs; she'd be 7 feet tall and mostly torso if she were real and unbended.

<dd>According to the <a href="../../../%C3%A6/n/i/%C3%86nima.html" title="Ænima">Ænima</a> page right here on Wikipedia, it's a woman. And considering how exceedingly rare mentions of even autofelatio are in the media, actual references to autocunnilingus are practically non-existent. For such an esoteric topic, I think a mention of its near-only pop culture appearance is pretty fascinating, if not specifically relevant.</dd>

<dd>I don't see any obvious Photoshop marks, but her legs look completely reversed. I suspect that's a couple doing it doggy-style, and her top from another picture (probably part of the same series) was photoshopped in. It's a good fake (if it's fake, I could be wrong), but her legs could only be in that position if she was on her knees. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Chaos_ba5a.html" title="User:Professor Chaos">Professor Chaos</a> 05:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
