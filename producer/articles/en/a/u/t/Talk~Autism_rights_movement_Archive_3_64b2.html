<h2><span class="mw-headline">References</span></h2>
<p>I spent some time this evening reading the article and making what I hoped to be stylistic improvements. There is a significant amount of "claims" in the article, but they are not referenced. Agreed that there are references to outside links, but wouldn't it be better when making a statement to link to the person or group that made the statement or claim?</p>
<p>The differentiation between adult autistics and child autistics is clear, but the tension between the needs of the two groups could be more dramatic by defining the needs of the children. I think the needs of the adults appears as the current focus.</p>
<p>Having a nephew who is autistic, I find much of the claims of this article to be incredulous. Further, I taught two autistic teenagers during my college days and there is a marked differentiation between an autistic possessing high function and those without. This articles attempts to claim autistics are simply part of the diverse fabric of humanity. I accept this claim because they are first are foremost human, but I reject the claim that there is nothing to "cure". Tell that to a child who has been brought into the light of communicaton with others. If an individual can not communicate with others, they can not interact. Without interaction there is no social structure in which to participate. Providing some hard facts on the difficulties faced by autistics would provide a much needed dose of reality to this article. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 07:28, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're assuming that learning to communicate is the same as getting "cured" of autism. That's clearly not the case. I don't think anyone's opposed to finding ways to teach autistics. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 01:44, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The controversy is not between autistic children and autistic adults, it is between people who believe the best thing for autistic people is a cure, and people who believe autism is fundamental to the identity. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 05:33, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In reply to the statement, "<i>This articles attempts to claim autistics are simply part of the diverse fabric of humanity,</i>" I don't think the article claims that autistics are simply part of the diverse fabric of humanity, what it claims is that there are autistic activists who see autistic people as a part of the diverse fabric of humanity. I think there is an important distiction between an article making a claim, and an article claiming that others have made a claim. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 23:33, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stormrider, there is no tension between adult and autistics who are children. Please Just because you find it incredulous it is your POV. Please try to NPOV. Have you seen www.gettingthetruthout.com &#160;?? There are low functioning non autistics. DO you need a cure because of that???? Alos if you want to be taken seriously use your real name JoeMele 21:26, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the contrary, I think Storm Rider's comments are RIGHT ON THE MONEY and they are basically the problems this article faces. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 21:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh and i had no problem with the edits except one. It is POV in the talk page JoeMele 22:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Joe, you reverted one of the style changes in the article; however, the way the sentence is worded is very clumsy and difficult to understand. Rather than revert could you please go back and attempt to reword the sentence rather than keep it as it is. I tried improve the sentence and I think I know what your objective is, but obviously wasn't successful. Please go and attempt more it more understandable. Also, the article's emphasis basically ignores the chanllenges of teaching autistic children. It is not POV to state the obvious and the organizations of autistic adults does not speak for the entire community, but they are voices among a choir of voices that all deserve to be heard. Do you really think this article presents the challenges autistic children encounter or the challenges their parents encounter to ensure they are provided the same rights as other children? I have no problems with the article other than it seems out of balance; I hardly view that as POV.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, use my real name to be taken seriously??? Joey, I know very few people on WIKI that use their real name as their moniker. I, nor anyone I know on WIKI, perceive the use of moniker's as a loss of credibility. That is a personal issue that you have and you will have to deal with it. BUT, if you want my real name it is Michael and on WIKI I am known as, <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 02:41, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Storm Rider, I note your concern that organizations of adult autistics dont speak for everyone is laughable. No one asks or tells this to NAAR or CAN or the hideoulsy name autism speaks where you have NTs and no autistics at all. This is about the challenges that both adults and children autistics face from a hostile NT world. JoeMele 04:01, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two wrongs do not make a right, Joe. Storm, I agree that we need sourcing and (quite a lot of) NPOV. Another good step would probably be to cleanup the external links, which are currently largely blogs and non notable pro/anti cure sites. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 06:22, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is such a great topic! My only objective is to attempt to make it a better article. I am not interested in taking sides; for me there are no sides and I don't find a right or wrong way to any position. On WIKI our objective is to present topics fairly in a balanced manner. You guys are obviously more invested in the topic than me, but from an outsider's my contention would still be that it is not balanced. Joe, I do not wish to offend you, but you might try to write the article from the "other" perspective. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 00:53, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fact it is not balanced is merely your POV and a few others. There is a movement on the Wiki to silence the autistic point of view so that only the curebies one exist.JoeMele 14:42, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stop the Tern-like conspiracy theories, Joe. Oh, and I partially retract my statement on the external links, after seeing some of the cleanup Ryan has done. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 22:23, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Joe, you obviously have an axe to grind and are very committed to your POV. Whether an article is balanced or not is not a POV. You freely admit that there are two points of view: cure vs. there is nothing to cure. What is being asked of you as an editor is to review the article and present the other side of the argument. If you only state your side and allow only your POV, the article is necessaraily POV and does not meet WIKI's standards.</dd>
<dd>I am new to your article and freely admit that I am not studied in the latest arguments of today's autistic conflicts, but I am an editor and know when an article is not balanced. Also, I am not a part of some wicked cabal that is trying to silence the "autistic" POV. As I read the article, it is clear that that is the main POV being made and it is the "cure" arguments that are sorely lacking. Winning on WIKI is not getting your own way, but achieving balanced articles that take all POV's into account. Don't take things personally, it is ceratainly not meant to be so.</dd>
<dd>Joe, you have not yet re-edited the last change we discussed above. The sentence is not easily understood as it is currently written, will you please take another look at it ant attempt to make it make sense. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 01:15, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article probably does lack balance. I don't see any indications this is because of edit wars or because someone has decided to delete contributions that try to balance the article. It's simply that this article is likely being worked on by persons on the spectrum only, so that would be expected. If parents against the movement are able to add info that's citable and notable, then it will be left in the article I'm sure. One thing most autistics are not is intellectually dishonest. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 23:22, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neurodivergent - I can tell you that it does lack balance somewhat most likely for the exact reason you stated (it is maintained by people on the spectrum) but it is an article that needs to be constructed from the POV of the autistic rights movement; so it is to be expected. One thing I found misleading:</dd>
<dd><i>Some parents of young children diagnosed autistic appear to be strongly against the movement's views, however.</i> This is not entirely true - basically ALL parents of autistic children also want rights, respect, tolerance, inclusion and acceptance for their children. Maybe that sentence can be reworded some how. I believe the autistic rights movement is somehow making parents feel as if parents are uncaring or that it is bad to medically treat their child. Example - possibly feeling that the Dawson/ABA case could threaten their child's chance at obtaining therapy, etc.</dd>

<dd>"Some parents" here refers to Kit Weintraub and Lenny Schafer (and I'm sure there are others who feel exactly the way they do). "Strongly" doesn't quite capture it really. But I see your point. It shouldn't give the idea that a good number of parents are against the rights of autistics. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:31, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think what I am trying to say is that this article is about the Autistic rights movement, so it has to be from their point of view, however the article has a harsh tone to it. I realize that some autistic people are embittered and that needs to be mentioned in the article, but someone who has no preconceived views on this topic would most likely read this article and come away feeling like the Autistic rights movement are angry / accusatory (please don't be offended). I agree that some parents are strongly against the movement but many are not - we don't want this article to offend them. I don't know how to explain it - but the impression I get from this article is that autistics do not like the <b>parents</b> of autistics and we need to fix that somehow. Some Wiki guidelines we should read over: <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#What_is_the_neutral_point_of_view.3F" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Writing Unbiasedly</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Making_necessary_assumptions" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Assumptions</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#There.27s_no_such_thing_as_objectivity" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Objectivity</a>. For example, the statement about parents has been changed to:</dd>
<dd><i>Some parents of young children diagnosed autistic appear to be strongly against the anti-cure and pro-neurodiversity perspectives in particular</i></dd>
<dd>and I think it would be more accurate to say:</dd>
<dd><i>Many autistics feel that parents of young autistic children are against the anti-cure and pro-neurodiversity perspectives.</i></dd>

I know that Temple Grandin has expressed views that autism can be something positive, and has expressed opposition to eliminating all aspects of autism, so Temple Grandin does have agreement with the base values of the movement. However, I don't recall her ever specifically identifying with the movement, so I don't know if it would be appropriate to list her or not. I don't know much about Donna Williams, but her name seems to come up a lot in discussions of autistic advocacy, but again, I don't know if she identifies as part of the movement or not. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 13:27, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article about Temple Grandin states, "Grandin is considered a philosophical leader of both the animal welfare and autism advocacy movements," with <i>autism advocacy</i> linking to the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_rights_movement.html" title="Autism rights movement">autism rights movement</a> article. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 13:36, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Donna Williams is mentioned in the History of ANI article, so I'd say yes. (I haven't gotten around to reading her books, however). Temple Grandin is, to some extent, an advocate of autistics. But her views are not necessarily pro-neurodiversity or anti-disorder. For example, she says drugs may be necessary. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 18:38, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think support of the use of drugs is necessarily anti-neurodiversity or pro-cure, since drugs are not a cure. I think it really depends on why Temple Grandin supports drugs and under what circumstances she supports them. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 02:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alleged insulting view of autism edit</span></h2>
<p>I am concerned with the edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_rights_movement&amp;diff=44583639&amp;oldid=44579618" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_rights_movement&amp;diff=44583639&amp;oldid=44579618" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> to the alleged insulting view of autism section. The edit moved a large amount of content to the caption of the ribbon. I think significant amounts of content is better in the text of the article and not as a caption. I think it really seems best to keep captions of images small. In addition, the edit changed "Autistics.Org has a button that reads "I am not a puzzle, I am a person" to "However, some autistics ... believe they are not a puzzle to be solved but a real person instead." The original version attributes the claim about autistics being people not puzzles to Autistics.Org and the edit attributes it to <i>some autistics</i>. I really think the original version is better because it attributes <i>who</i> is making a claim instead of simply saying that some people have made the claim. I also think the following removed statements should be added back into the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neurodiversity.Com has a page titled <i>Offended Yet? "Autistic" as an Insult and Insults Against Autistic Persons</i> <a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/offend.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.neurodiversity.com/offend.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which is a collection of websites that Neurodiversity.Com feels is insulting to autistic people.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/autistry/oddizms.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/autistry/oddizms.html" rel="nofollow">Oddizms</a> has created a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/autistry/mobiuslweb.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/autistry/mobiuslweb.jpg" rel="nofollow">rainbow moebius ring</a> to symbol autism awareness and replace the puzzle piece ribbon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The movement is largely Internet based so I think reporting what these websits have done is noteworthy enough for an article. I am open to rewording those statements if necessary. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 02:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you could do "some autistics such as those from autistics.org" etc. for the ribbon. Also, about the oddizms thing you really need to explain why their version is important and not "yet another replacement" of the ribbon in the first place - the key thing here is <i>importance</i>. Also, I think maybe we should use the "alternative" ribbon by oddisms instead if it really is the chosen replacement as it probably adds more to the article. Finally, I'm not sure the list of "insulting sites" is appropriate here as it is a bit of a hitlist of a partisian group.... if you do really want it in there it would be better as an aside ("the movement fights against an insulting.... , and websites such as those listed as neurodiversity.com[link].") I really think it is good as is, however (in relation to the insulting sites thing). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Just another star in the night</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 03:00, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not afraid of your perspective, Joe. I'm offended by your insistence on being listed as "notable" when in fact you're not. It would be bad enough if someone else had added your name to various pages, but it's YOU who keep adding it back. That's simply not the Wikipedia way. It's nothing personal, since I don't know you, and it certainly has nothing to do with your perspective. It's simply about Wikipedia guidelines (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) for determining notability. Leading a small, local protest or having a single phrase quoted in a newspaper article isn't sufficient; otherwise, hundreds of thousands of Americans alone, not to mention the imaginable numbers worldwide, would have their names on Wikipedia. And Joe, the supposed article about your software and your company from nearly five and a half years ago simply has no bearing on your noteworthiness with regard to the autism rights movement. Again, it's nothing personal but this simply isn't the place to stroke your ego. I'm truly sorry if you are offended, but it's "just business" in keeping Wikipedia moving forward. No offense is intended. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 04:00, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then what criteria are you using for singer or sinclair or baggs?? All very important peopl in the next civil rights movement. I suspect your motivation is the fear of aspergian identity and the anti-cure perspective than anything else. This is a fight that we must win our continued survial as a people depend on it.JoeMele 04:13, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your views on autism have NOTHING to do with my edits, Joe. You only came onto my radar when you added yourself to the Stony Brook page as a notable alum; quick research showed that you're not and consequently I removed your name from the list. My interest was piqued and I subsequently found you listed on this page as notable as well so, again, you were removed. It has nothing to do whatsoever with your activities ... in fact, it's the lack thereof that drove my edits. You may cast yourself as a freedom fighter for aspie rights, and that's wonderful and I wish you nothing but the best in your efforts, but the bottom line is that you don't meet the notability criteria for Wikipedia. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 04:26, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Joe, try not to take this personally. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notability standards</a> for living people require that people mentioned should be widely recognizable, be widely published, or had a major impact in their field. It is indeed an honor to have been praised by Newsday, but that's just not broad enough. Chin up, Joe: with the dedication and heart that you have, I have no doubt that you can have a major impact in time. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 04:54, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pages like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> provide guidelines for notability for a person to have their own article. The issue of Joe Mele's notability is to include him in the "Individuals" section, not to have his own article. Is the same criteria used for notability of a person's article the same as the criteria for being mentioned in another article? <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 12:41, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> provides Wikipedia's definition of notability. Joe doesn't meet those criteria and whether it is in an individual article on Joe himself or inclusion in a list of supposedly notable individuals in a larger article, he in no way, shape, or form meets any standards of notability for the purposes of Wikipedia. Joe was presented as notable on Wikipedia; by Wikipedia standards he is not notable. IMHO, of course. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 12:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
