<p>It seems to me this is quite lengthy for a treatment that has only rarely been used.. perhaps we could cut down the details and quotes a little and move them to their own article (then add a "for more details see...")? I didn't want to do this without discussing it first, given that this section has obviously been written with a lot of care.

<dd>Not a bad idea, but the content has repeatedly been removed from the new <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_salts.html" title="Gold salts">gold salts</a> article itself, with similar justifications. Given that gold salts have been a backwater of medical treatment for decades, apparently replaced for the most part by allopathic drugs such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methotrexate.html" title="Methotrexate">methotrexate</a>, it seems rather ridiculous that strident efforts are being made to downplay the current intrigue by removing content from the article where it belongs, despite the fact that the heyday for the use of gold salts for other purposes may have reached its zenith nearly a century ago. Trimming the reference in this article makes far more sense, given that a great deal of emphasis, upon a wide range of desperately needed interventions, have generated more interest, thus far, than gold salts. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:56, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>At first, the entire section was being removed, now there is an overly truncated 'effects on autism' section that has replaced the brief aside elsewhere in the article that previously was offered as a substitute. The current lead for the abbreviated section, where the name of a journalist, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Olmsted_79a3.html" title="Dan Olmsted">Dan Olmsted</a>, comes first, needs a rewrite that addresses the science first. It is good to see additional editors involved, in order to keep the focus on reaching a compromise on content, rather than constant distractions caused by wholesale deletions. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 08:05, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First off, let me apologise for commenting on something that has obviously been widely discussed elsewhere. It's a tricky one this, because while I can see this section's place over at <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_salts.html" title="Gold salts">Gold salts</a> I can also see it here, just not at the level of detail currently described. Please do not read too much into this, but I think it should be cut down here because whilst it may have potential as a treatment it is not currently being used on a regular basis as the others are, therefore should not be discussed as extensively. My other concern is that the section is dominated by quotes that the reader can clearly see for themselves if they go to the linked article. Anyway, this is my suggestion for the gold salt section in this article, obviously linked, properly edited and so forth.</dd>

<dd><i>Gold salts have been suggested as a treatment for individuals afflicted by autistic spectrum disorders, because mercury and gold interact in a way that could de-activate ongoing toxic effects of heavy metal poisoning, thought by some to be a major factor in the increase in autism rates in recent decades. Boyd Haley, a University of Kentucky professor and leading proponent of the mercury-autism theory, has suggested that it may reverse conditions attributed to mercury administration, as the gold molecules bond with the mercury molecules and in turn may detach the mercury from the enzyme it is attached to.</i></dd>

The treatment was given to the first child diagnosed with autism at the Campbell Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1947, and reports suggest that the childâ€™s symptoms improved significantly. The treatment is not in widespread use, but research continues into the effects of gold salts in animals bred to be susceptible to thimerosol, a mercury-based compound that was used in many vaccinations until recently.</i></dd>

<dd>(I have made you suggestion italic as to distingish it from ordinary comments.) The major problem with the piece as it is now (at the article), is that there is to much speculation, hypothesis etc, based on some anecdotal (yet important) information. So, I think it needs to reflect what we do know, and limits on the speculation. And the reporting should be factual. So, start with the anecdotal story, then move to the general idea (there is no need to discuss the whole mercury-vaccination-controversy), then current research and finally caution (Crucial to mention, you do not want tons of people demanding gold salt treatment because they have read something about it here!)....</dd>

<p>Gold salts have been used for some time by conventional doctors to reduce immune activity in Rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but the only differences here seem to be that nobody at all has yet suggested that Methotrexate might improve autism (has any autistic person had methotrexate I wonder?) whereas one case report suggests improvement in one patient after one gold salt. I think the definition of allopathic in regard of drugs may need a bit more work there. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 13:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well by the reasoning suggested by some of the contributors, of course <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methotrexate.html" title="Methotrexate">methotrexate</a> should be effective in improving autism given the undoubted efficacy of gold salts.

<p>A recent Australian study categorized early interventions as behavioral, developmental, combined, and a few other categories I can't remember now. Biomedical interventions seem to be only a small part of what is available so to merge these doesn't seem warranted. One example of these categories is at:<a href="http://www.autism-help.org/early-intervention-aspergers-autism.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.autism-help.org/early-intervention-aspergers-autism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.autism-help.org/early-intervention-aspergers-autism.htm</a> Quihn 07:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I discovered <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomedical_intervention_for_autism.html" title="Biomedical intervention for autism">Biomedical intervention for autism</a>. That article basically has the same information as the Biomedical intervention section in this article. A merge would be to prefer.</p>
<p>The question then arrises if the biomedical section of this article should be moved to the other article, or if the additional information in the other article should be brought here and the other article then would be changed to a redirect?</p>

<p>I am marking the "Non-coercive approaches" section of this article as having questionable neutrality. The section tries to shoot down each of the non-coercive approaches by saying that they "have been criticized", that it "gives false hope to parents", or both. This section sounds critical of each non-coercive approach mentioned within it.</p>
<p>Personally, I am appalled by the first sentence of the "Non-coercive approaches" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The autism rights movement has been criticized for promoting 'doing nothing' about autism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>What does this sentence have to do with non-coercive approaches?! Also, the sentence assumes that the reader knows the values of the autistic rights movement.</p>
<p>The "Non-coercive approaches" section should simply list and describe non-coercive approaches, and then state their pros and cons--without opinion or bias.

<p>I think the biomed section should be more clear on the fact that no double-blind studies exist on any of the treatments currently listed. This is important with something like autism, because it's a developmental delay, not a developmental halt. Perhaps it should list Secretin, with a discussion of existing double-blind studies, and claims about recovery rates prior to those studies. The section is also missing the Ketogenic diet, L-carnosine, and Omega-3 supplementation (the latter 2 do have one unreplicated double-blind study each). <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 23:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the Biomed section could be reduced to a synopsis of the biomed article and any additional information here transferred there.

Incidentally, the editor who added the paragraph wholesale really seems like a [[WP:sockpuppet|sockpuppet] for <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueaky2_0fd1.html" title="User:Squeaky2">User:Squeaky2</a>, apologies if I'm wrong. Anyway, I took out most of the rest of the paragraph, here's the gist and here's why: Previously, the research documenting the effectiveness of this approach had been little disseminated outside of academia and a handful of center based school programs.</p>

<dd>needs a citation</dd>

<p>The lead therapist of the children was <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Taylor_157b.html" title="Bridget Taylor">Bridget Taylor</a>, one of the country's most renowned ABA professionals.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This addition is questionable, and appears to be a way of avoiding the orphan tag on that page. I'd never heard of her before, and when I worked in ABA I'd never heard of her during my training. The whole page seems like a vanity addition to me too.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both children are considered to be <i>indistinguishable from their peers.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to see a citation for this, at least a reference to a page number in LMHYV.</dd>

<p>Though it does look like it has a ton of possible references, it's not a professional site. Looking at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, in the "Links normally to be avoided" section, #11 says no personal webpages, and though this is a fairly comprehensive site, it is still one guy's. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 16:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
