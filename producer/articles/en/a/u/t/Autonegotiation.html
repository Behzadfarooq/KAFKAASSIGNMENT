	    <p><b>Autonegotiation</b> (formerly <b>NWay</b>) is an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethernet.html" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> procedure by which two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, such as speed and duplex mode.

However, its implementation was optional, and a part of the specification was open to interpretation. The debatable portions of the autonegotiation specifications were eliminated by the 1998 version of IEEE 802.3. In 1999, the negotiation protocol was significantly extended by IEEE 802.3ab, which specified the protocol for <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigabit_Ethernet_f444.html" title="Gigabit Ethernet">Gigabit Ethernet</a>, making autonegotiation mandatory for Gigabit Ethernet operation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonegotiation.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Autonegotiation can be used by devices that are capable of different transmission rates (such as 10Mbit/sec and 100Mbit/sec), different <a href="../../../d/u/p/Duplex_%28telecommunications%29.html" title="Duplex (telecommunications)">duplex modes</a> (half duplex and full duplex) and/or different standards at the same speed (though in practice only one standard at each speed is widely supported). Every device declares its <i>technology abilities</i>, that is, its possible modes of operation. The two devices then choose the best possible mode of operation that are shared by the two devices, where higher speed (100Mbit/sec) is preferred over lower speed (10Mbit/sec), and full duplex is preferred over half duplex at the same speed.</p>
<p>Parallel detection is used when a device that is capable of autonegotiation is connected to one that is not. This happens if the other device does not support autonegotiation or autonegotiation is disabled via software. In this condition, the device that is capable of autonegotiation can determine the speed of the other device, and choose itself the same speed. This procedure cannot determine the presence of full duplex, so half duplex is always assumed. A <a href="../../../d/u/p/Duplex_mismatch.html" title="Duplex mismatch">duplex mismatch</a> will result if the other device is in full duplex mode, that is, one device is using full duplex while the other one is using half duplex. The typical effect of duplex mismatch is that the connection is working but at a very low speed.</p>
<p>The standard for <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000BASE-TX_40ba.html" title="1000BASE-TX">1000BASE-TX</a> requires autonegotiation to be always present and enabled. Other than speed and duplex mode, autonegotiation is used to communicate the port type (single port or multiport) and the master-slave parameters (whether it is manually configured or not, whether the device is master or slave if this is the case, and the master-slave seed bit otherwise).</p>

A sequence of normal link pulses, used by 10BASE-T devices to establish link integrity.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Autonegotiation is based on pulses similar to those used by <a href="../../../1/0/b/10BASE-T_5cf0.html" title="10BASE-T">10BASE-T</a> devices to detect the presence of a connection to another device. These pulses are sent by a device when it is not sending or receiving any data. They are unipolar positive-only electrical pulses of a duration of 100ns, generated at intervals of 16ms (with a tolerance of 8ms). These pulses were called <i>link integrity test</i> (LIT) pulses in the 10BASE-T terminology, and are referred to as <b>normal link pulses</b> (NLP) in the autonegotiation specification.</p>
<p>A device detects the failure of the link (which can be due either to a failure of the transmission medium or of the other device) if neither a packet nor one of the pulses are not received for 50-150ms. The presence of a valid link is signaled by the receipt of a valid packet or two consecutive link integrity test pulses. For this to work, devices send link integrity test pulses even when not receiving any.</p>

Three trains of fast link pulses, used by autonegotiating devices to declare their capabilities.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Autonegotiation uses similar pulses. These are still unipolar, positive-only, and of the duration of 100ns, but each one is replaced by a train of at most 33 pulses. Each such train is called a <b>fast link pulse</b> (FLP) burst. The time interval between the start of each burst is the same as the distance between normal link pulses, that is, 16ms with a tolerance of 8ms.</p>
<p>The fast link pulse burst is made as follows: there are 17 pulses at distance 125microsec (with tolerance of 14microsec). In the middle between each set of two consecutive pulses, another pulse may or may not be present. The presence of a pulse represents a logical 1, the absence a logical 0. As a result, every burst represents a logical word of 16 bits. This word is called a <b>link code word</b> (LCW). The 17 pulses are always present and are used as a clock, while the 16 pulses may or may not be present and represent the actual information that is transmitted. The bits of the link code word are numbered from 0 to 15, where bit 0 corresponds to the first possible pulse in time and bit 15 to the last.</p>

</div>
<p>A fast link pulse burst <i>is not</i> recognized as a valid normal link pulse. Therefore, a 10BASE-T device receiving it from an autonegotiation device will detect a failure of the link. A link with an autonegotiating device can however still be established via the <b>parallel device function</b>: the 10BASE-T device keeps sending normal link pulses or transmitting packets. The autonegotiation device, upon receiving them, switches to 10BASE-T half-duplex mode. A duplex mismatch results if the 10BASE-T device is operating in full-duplex mode.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonegotiation.html" title="Edit section: The base link code word">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The base link code word</span></h2>
<p>Every fast link pulse burst transmits a word of 16 bits known as a link code word. The first such word is known as a <i>base link code word</i>, and its bits are used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0-4: selector field: it indicates which standard is used between IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.9;</li>
<li>5-12: technology ability field: this is a sequence of bits that encode the possible modes of operations among the 100BASE-T and 10BASE-T modes;</li>
<li>13: remote fault: this is set to one when the device is detecting a link failure;</li>
<li>14: acknowledgment: the device sets this to one to indicate the correct reception of the base link code word from the other party; this is detected by the receiption of at least three identical base code words;</li>
<li>15: next page: this bit is used to indicate the intention of sending other other link code words after the base link code word;</li>
</ul>
<p>The technology ability field is composed of eight bits. For IEEE 802.3, these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>bit 0: device supports 10BASE-T</li>
<li>bit 1: device supports 10BASE-T in full duplex</li>
<li>bit 2: device supports 100BASE-TX</li>
<li>bit 3: device supports 100BASE-TX in full duplex</li>
<li>bit 4: device supports 100BASE-T4</li>
<li>bit 5: pause</li>
<li>bit 6: asymmetric pause for full duplex</li>
<li>bit 7: reserved</li>
</ul>
<p>The acknowledgement bit is used to signal the correct reception of the base code word. This corresponds to having received three identical copies of the base code word. Upon receiving these three identical copies, the device sends a link code word with the acknowledge bit set to one from six times to eight times.</p>
<p>The link code words are also called <i>pages</i>. The base link code word is therefore called a base page. The next page bit of the base page is 1 when the device intends to send other pages, which can be used to communicate other abilities. These additional pages are sent only if both devices have sent base pages with a next page bit set to 1. The additional pages are still encoded as link code words (using 17 clock pulses and up to 16 bit pulses).</p>
<p><a name="Message_and_unformatted_next_page" id="Message_and_unformatted_next_page"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonegotiation.html" title="Edit section: Message and unformatted next page">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Message and unformatted next page</span></h2>
<p>The base page (the base link code word) is sufficient for devices to advertise which ones among the 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-T4 modes they support. For Gigabit ethernet, two other pages are required. These pages are sent if both devices have sent base pages with a next page bit set to one.</p>
<p>The additional pages are of two kinds: <i>message pages</i> and <i>unformatted pages</i>. These pages are still 16-bit words encoded as pulses in the same way as the base page. Their first eleven bits are data, while their second-to-last bit indicates whether the page is a message page or an unformatted page. The last bit of each page indicates the presence of an additional page.</p>
<p>The 1000BASE-T supported modes and master-slave data (which is used to decide which of the two devices acts as the master, and which one acts as the slave) are sent using a single message page, followed by a single unformatted page. The message page contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>half duplex capability</li>
<li>whether the device is single port or multiport</li>
<li>whether master/slave is manually configured or not</li>
<li>whether the device is manually configured as master or slave</li>
</ul>
<p>The unformatted page contains a 10-bit word, called a master-slave seed value.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonegotiation.html" title="Edit section: Priority">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Priority</span></h2>
<p>Upon receipt of the technology abilities of the other device, both devices decide the best possible mode of operation supported by both devices. The priority among modes specified in the 2002 edition of 802.3 is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000BASE-T full duplex</li>
<li>1000BASE-T half duplex</li>
<li>100BASE-T2 full duplex</li>
<li>100BASE-TX full duplex</li>
<li>100BASE-T2 half duplex</li>
<li>100BASE-T4</li>
<li>100BASE-TX half duplex</li>
<li>10BASE-T full duplex</li>
<li>10BASE-T half duplex</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, among the modes that are supported by both devices, each device chooses the one that is the topmost in this list.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonegotiation.html" title="Edit section: Interoperability problems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interoperability problems</span></h2>
<p>The first version of the autonegotiation specification, IEEE 802.3u, was open to different interpretations. Although most manufacturers implemented this standard in one way, some others, including network giant <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisco.html" title="Cisco">Cisco</a>, implemented it in a different way. Autonegotiation between devices that implemented it differently failed. This led many network administrators to not depend on autonegotiation and instead manually set the speed and duplex mode of each network interface card. Even Cisco recommended its customers not to use autonegotiation. However, the use of manually set configuration often led to <a href="../../../d/u/p/Duplex_mismatch.html" title="Duplex mismatch">duplex mismatches</a>, in particular when two connected devices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>one manually set to half duplex and one manually set to full duplex</li>
<li>one set to autonegotiation and one manually set to full duplex</li>
</ul>
<p>Duplex mismatch problems are difficult to diagnose because the network is apparently working, and simple programs used for network tests such as <a href="../../../p/i/n/Ping.html" title="Ping">ping</a> report a valid connection; however, the network is much slower than expected.</p>
<p>The debatable portions of the autonegotiation specifications were eliminated by the 1998 release of 802.3. This was later followed by the release of IEEE 802.3ab in 1999. The new standard specified that Gigabit Ethernet over copper wiring requires autonegotiation. Currently, all network equipment manufacturers—including Cisco<a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat2970/12218se/2970scg/swint.htm#1080632" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat2970/12218se/2970scg/swint.htm#1080632" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>—recommend to use autonegotiation whenever possible.</p>

<p>A duplex mismatch occurs when two connected devices are configured in different duplex modes. This may happen for example if one is configured for autonegotiation while the other one has a fixed mode of operation that is full duplex (no autonegotiation). In such conditions, the autonegotiation device correctly detects the speed of operation, but is unable to correctly detect the duplex mode. As a result, it sets the correct speed but starts using the half duplex mode.</p>
<p>When a device is operating in full duplex while the other one operates in half duplex, the connection works at a very low speed if both devices attempt to send frames at the same time. This is because data can be sent in both directions at the same time in full duplex mode, but only in one direction at a time in half duplex mode. As a result, a full duplex device may transmit data while it is receiving. However, if the other device is working in half duplex, it does not expect to receive data (because it is currently sending); therefore, it senses a collision and attempts to resend the frame it was sending. Depending on timing the half duplex device may sense a late collision, which it will interpret as a hard error rather than a normal consequence of CSMA/CD and will not attempt to resend the frame. On the other hand, the full duplex device does not detect any collision and does not resend the frame, even if the other device has discarded it as corrupted by collision. Still, the full duplex device, not expecting incoming frames to be truncated by collision detection, will report Frame Check Sequence errors. This combination of <b>late</b> collisions reported at the half-duplex end and FCS errors reported by the full duplex end can be used as an indication that a duplex mismatch is present.</p>
<p>This packet loss happens when both devices are transmitting at the same time. This may happen even when the link is used, from the user's perspective, in one direction only. A <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmission_Control_Protocol_c142.html" title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</a> stream requires all packets sent to be acknowledged by the receiving device. As a result, even if actual data is sent in one direction only, collision may be generated with acknowledgement packets traveling in the other direction.</p>
