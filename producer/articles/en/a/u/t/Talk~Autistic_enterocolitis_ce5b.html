	    <p>Here for all to see is an example of the tragedy of autism. Here is an article claiming to be an encyclopedic entry on something called 'autistic enterocolitis' which has been written by somebody who does not even know what enterocolitis is. He wrote this as part of his wider campaign in Wikipedia to manufacture a narrative, drawn from anti-vaccine websites and fringe practitioners, intended to force into the public domain some kind of acceptance of ideas that have no backing whatsoever by more than a few dozen medically-qualifed persons in the whole world. It's a sad day for America that the historically poor attention given to developmental disorders has left the path open for such nakedly misleading material. 86.129.121.229 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.129.121.229.html" title="User talk:86.129.121.229">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.129.121.229_43d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.129.121.229">contribs</a>).</p>

<dd>86.129.121.229, I could not agree more. These articles are fuelled by the public obsession with controversial science, and the anti-vaccine material is particularly vicious.

Rather, Buie doesn't think that the colitis fould is specific to Autism. In my experience with the Autistic children they have microscopic colitis. In some sense that is a surprise, since atypical colitis tends to be a disease of <s>elderly</s> older individuals. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 21:20, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The IBD and autism was dropped because I did not see this referenced, and I do not see this as a mainstream opinion in Autistim practiotoners.

<p>This article is getting pretty badly POV. A little background on me. I treat autistic kids. I am a gastroenterologist. Wakefield has presented his data and no one agrees that the colitis needs to be identified as an entity different in the autistic patients. Even the people that are especially interested in Autism and the gut don't agree with him. I know Wakefield. He is an ernest man and has been a careful reearcher. I always learn something new when we have a chance to chat. However, he is probably wrong. That isn't bad. Lots of people in science end up being wrong. Even if he is wrong he has helped bring the colitis in these kids to greater attention. If it hadn't been for Andy I wouldn't have known to look for colitis in these kids. NOW - the encyclopedia is a place where data that has been corroborated is the criteria for a medical or scientific article. A journalist does not make that point. Several articles by the same author doesn't cut it either. The reason this is getting POV is that the criteria for inclusion are pretty lax by some of the editors here. Now I'm not going to go out of my way to trash Andy, but as an encyclopedia article it needs to be more conservative. When someone else publishes something we can always change it then. I agree with leaving out the M Phillips bits. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 15:27, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The following paragraph came to my <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> talk page, prompted by a note to Ombudsman talk page about how his edits on this article were going. I felt his edits were POV and needed to be neutral in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I wrote: re:Autistic enterocolitis: Please adopt a less slanted approach to this topic. There are entries that are being made by you that do not meet a reasonable standard of verifiability. I like Andy Wakefield and have injoyed a number of conversations with him, and I treat autistic kids, so I am not an anti-Autism individual. However, as an encyclopedia the topics should not be backed up by comments by reporters. They certainly should not have descriptions of proposed research in the field.

<dd>There are a number of problems with reliance solely upon peer reviewed research from the medical community. Perhaps you are already well aware that most research funding for medical studies comes from corporations, with little in the way of oversight from government agencies or watchdogs to ensure accountability. There is no tonic in sight for the rampant conflicts of interest that, increasingly, have plagued medical research in general and autism research in particular. As for <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Phillips_2720.html" title="Melanie Phillips">Melanie Phillips</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Olmsted_79a3.html" title="Dan Olmsted">Dan Olmsted</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kirby_4bb6.html" title="David Kirby">David Kirby</a>, et al, they play a particularly important role in the framing of public debate, which has otherwise largely sided with powerful pharmaceutical and medical industry interests. Brian Deer's denigration of all things <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wakefield_dda2.html" title="Andrew Wakefield">Wakefield</a> has been liberally referenced in several Wiki articles, seemingly for the same reason that he constantly makes slanted, snide personal attacks on Wakefield's integrity. The media has a great deal of influence upon public opinion and informed debate, and the ability of journalists to summarize and provide perspective on technical matters, which often far exceeds that of researchers, is of similar importance. Without such talents, the public (and readers of the Wiki) cannot become well informed. Given a choice between a perspective dominated by the insular, exclusive medical research monopoly and a robust, inclusive diversity of informed perspectives, which would you choose for the Wiki's readers? <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a></dd>

<dd>One of the goals of Wikipedia is to have a neutral point of view on these things. You do not, which is not really a problem. However, your writing is not a neutral point of view. Your belief that there is an "insular, exclusive medical research monopoly" seems a good expression of your POV. Whether the contrary perspectives are informed is arguable given the over 30 studies in the Cochrane collaboration. I would not have a panopoly of views of unknown sources thrown together in an encyclopedia entry. You also present a false dichotomy, that one must have one perspective or another. Claiming that one must choose between different two perspectives is evidence that your writing is not neutral in point of view. The thing to do here is to express who has opinions about this and why, including both perspectives. However, the perspecitves that are allowable are those that have at least been published. Wakefield makes that cut. Melanie Phillips does not. Brian Deer does not. I disagree with the idea that throwing a lot of bad ideas into wikipedia makes people better informed, especially when the poor data is not differentiated from the good data. What ought to be done is to describe why the term "Autistic enterocolytis" came into being, what supports the idea that it is real, what is evidence against it, and what the consensus of the scientific and medical community is. One does not need to try to convince others about it. The act of trying to convince makes the article POV and liable to deletion. Given an interest in verifiability on Wikipedia inclusion of a section on unverifiable claims is completely unsupportable. I am copying both of these paragraphs to the talk page on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a>.

<dd>The Cochrane study, as Phillips aptly notes, has been grossly misrepresented not only by the press, but by the spin it was given by the library itself. Like the dubious quality of some research published in several premier medical journals, the library has shot itself in the foot by misrepresenting its own meta-analysis. The insular nature of the medical industry is hardly a matter of dispute, as can easily be extrapolated from assessment of the fierce attacks upon even its own best and brightest who dare question orthodoxy. Alleging that a rhetorical question falsely presents a dichotomy comes off in the same attacking manner, as the question was framed specifically to edify you about how how attempts to discredit non-medical professionals can be perceived. Phillips' critiques also attempt to frame the discussion to provide essential context, and having asserted herself into the debate so visibly, she has been attacked sumarily. Providing content for the Wiki's readers representative of informed discussion does not infer a 'panoply' of redundant or ill-informed content should be tolerated, and framing the discussion in such a manner is ill-advised. This issue of corroboration really has more to do with suppression of research funding for needed studies than debate about appropriate applications of the Wiki's policies; more to the point are the issues surrounding the suggestion made by Wakefield, et al, (and subsequently retracted, under vicious political pressure, by ten of his co-authors), including the pointed and often unfair manner in which the relative lack of corroboration is portrayed. There is little doubt that GI disorders are uncommonly prevalent among those on the autistic spectrum, but that matter is generally ignored in the chorus of attacks citing a lack of corroboration. But since there has been so much harping upon the point, the debate over corroboration needs to be presented, and in a fair manner. A comparison between the prudent and thoughtful concerns about environmental trigers vis-a-vis the advice of the CDC and the medical establishment, to direct reserch funds elsewhere, underscores serious questions that have been raised about the insularity of the medical industry. The same can be said about the dubious retraction by Wakefield's co-authors, apparently due to nothing else besides immense political pressures (after six years, no less), unleashed against them for daring to question orthodoxy. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:50, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have clearly a lot of passion for this issue. However passion is not enough to qualify as encyclopedic content. I do not see the general suppression of the truth that you perceive. Your perception on suppression of research funding can not translate into putting the musings of various voices on the web as an authoritative source to be in an encyclopedia. If you have to have a soap box do it on a web page somewhere, but not as an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 05:19, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument against discussing the corroboration debate seems to be based upon circular reasoning, in that you assert the perspectives of non-medical professionals should be deleted simply because they are not authoritative, apparently because you sincerely seem to believe medical professionals have a far more legitimate claim to authority. Rather than bothering to defend such logical fallacies, including apparent expert worship, the most common response among the defenders of medical orthodoxy seen in the Wiki is the assumption of an offensive posture, rather than rational <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socratic_discourse.html" title="Socratic discourse">Socratic discourse</a>. You assert that you can't even perceive that suppression exists, while at the same time deleting content that doesn't coincide with your beliefs, thus underscoring the means by which the medical field has demonstrated its profound insularity. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merck.html" title="Merck">Merck</a>'s own study clearly showed <a href="../../../v/i/o/Vioxx.html" title="Vioxx">Vioxx</a> was more dangerous than naproxen overall and caused significantly more heart attacks, blood clots and strokes, and immediately proceeded to suppress the facts uncovered by its own scientists. Speculation, about reasons why medical professionals overwhelming tend to discount mass vaccination criticisms, often veers toward the likelihood that the vast majority of physicians actually do practice in good faith, but are too abhorred by the notion that they might be party to the massive rise in <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injury</a> afflictions. Like you, such doctors have their own reasons to disbelieve the extent of physiological damage that vaccines cause. The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> is only the most visible aspect of this <a href="../../../i/a/t/Iatrogenic.html" title="Iatrogenic">iatrogenic</a> nightmare, as many other severe complications thought to be triggered by vaccines have also risen in prevalence, ranging from <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanut_allergy.html" title="Peanut allergy">peanut allergy</a> fatalities. While it is doubtless that almost all physicians practice in good faith, their faith in the authority, wisdom and propriety of medical orthodoxy must be taken with a grain of salt.<a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124" class="external autonumber" title="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-abramson7jan07,0,1957242.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-abramson7jan07,0,1957242.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2006/01/14/decline_of_allopathic_medicine_will_cellular_health_ayurveda_form_new_paradigm.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2006/01/14/decline_of_allopathic_medicine_will_cellular_health_ayurveda_form_new_paradigm.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> While there may be a consensus among physicians who post to the Wiki to suppress content not in line with medical orthodoxy, that sentiment, clearly at odds with the Wiki's core mission, is merely an artifact of the medical field's insular culture. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 00:14, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A circular reasoning complaint goes both ways if reverts and deletions are the measure. However, the circular reasoning complaint is incorrect. The problem you are experiencing is peer review. You are finding that others disagree with you. The standard you have to meet to put something into wikipedia is accuracy and verifiability. Using assertions from individual websites does not rise to verifiability. You are correct that it takes time for research to come to conclusion. For someone who is dealing with Autism in some way this is quite difficult. However, there have been a number of treatments for various diseases that turned out not to work. Early experience in animal models for one anti-viral for Hepatitis B looked good, but then the first research trials showed deaths from treatment and it was dropped. I just did an edit on the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease.html" title="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> and had to change the status on Enteryx. The idea that the medical establishment suppresses new ideas is clearly wrong. The journals are full of new ideas. Most of the new ideas are wrong, but they are out there. There is huge incentive to come up with something groundbreaking. Look at the recent Nobel Prize in medicine. Warren and Marshall discovered H. pylori. Initially physicians were skeptical. Now the understanding of H. pylori is part of basic lectures in medical school. I was lucky to see myself giving some of the first lectures to second year medical students on H. pylori when teaching the GI section. The new ideas are fun. Andy Wakefield may have gotten entangled in the quest for finding a cause. If you talk to him he will tell you about the large number of Autistic patients you see. Since I have been working with the Pfeifer treatment center in Illinois I have seen how bad autism can be. However (there's that however) I don't put out the study results of those people since they are not yet replicated. The problem with Autistic Enterocolitis is that no other autism expert thinks that the colitis in autism is different from colitis in other patients. When papers come out about that then we put it in. right now readers deserve to know that no expert in Autism other than Wakefield think the colitis in Autism is a special type of colitis. Now, as to you name calling you need to stop. Please note that the term "expert worshiping" is currently not in wikipedia. I understand the concept, but it is not a field of separate study. This is also the case for "vaccine injury". As for myself, I am not deleting that which is against medical orthodoxy (whatever that is). I delete stuff which is not corroborated to the level appropriate to the article. So do this: advocate for your views on sites that are cutting edge. Describe the sorts of controversy that exists in the autism community and the anger that is out there in the Autism article, citing those sites as evidence of the anger and outrage. In autistic enterocolitis the article should be about that only, with the general autism issues moved to the autism article. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 15:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Citing Merck and Vioxx weakens your argument quite a lot, Ombudsman. You know why? Because - and this is important - they were CAUGHT.

<dd>I'm pretty relaxed about your comments. You asked about getting caught. There are loads of examples. I just picked one out of the hat and it is a pretty good one too. No one was caught over thioridazine or any of the others mentioned. Thioridazine was in use for 40 years or thereabouts. As for all the drugs mentioned - study going back over 17 years? Seems a little cavalier. People working in geriatrics knew about the heart problems caused by thioridazine - it was an open secret. 4% per annum developed tardive diskynesia - a solely iatrogenic condition caused by these drugs. In 25 years all long term patients over that period would have it, if they did not kill them first. The Invisible Anon 16:04, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's easy to say that something is a conspiracy, but it's hard to prove it. I believe that conspiracies exist, but I tend to assume that someone is innocent until they are proven guilty. Also, I trust the scientific community in general (in general!). The scientific method tends to work--since it relies on peer review and reproducing results, science tends to check itself. For this reason, I do not take what a newspaper article says for granted. The media has just as many conspiracies as medicine does.</dd>

<dd>I don't think this is POV clash. Problem with having it in is that as a dietary intervention any changes to dietary advice would have to be maintained here and in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> article. Next, it is not clear that the colitis in Autistics is different from other types of colitis. Wakefield treats the kids with a <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesalamine.html" title="Mesalamine">mesalamine</a> preparation as the main treatment. (Well, he had, let me eMail him and see what he says.) If autistic enterocolitis exists there are no studies that address diet as an intervention specific to autistic enterocolitis. Thus, putting diet advice here makes it look like the diet advice is specific to autistic enterocolitis, when such is not the case. And as mentioned above in the Whoa there paragraph (with no disagreement by <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a>) there is still no CONSENSUS on even the existence of autistic enterocolitis.

<dd>I am, in fact, skeptical of the existance of a specifically autistic form of enterocolitis. I am not skeptical of the claim that autistic individuals can suffer enterocolitis. (indeed, I would be unsurprised to find autistic individuals have an increased rate, simply due to unusual eating patterns or habits caused by a combination of the communication difficulties and sensory abnormalities found in some of us.) My question is this: Is the treatment Wakefield advocates unique to the "autistic" form of enterocolitis, or is it a form of treatment generally considered applicable to all enterocolitis? If it is the former, I think it belongs in this article, with a clear indication that it is performed only by Wakefield and co, and that it's not a generally recognized treatment. If it is the latter, I think the first paragraph of the dietary intervention is probably worth keeping (with slight modifications) - and a link added to the article on the generic form of the treatment. Either way, I do feel that given this page has any value whatsoever (Something I would, admittedly, question), there should probably be at least a mention of dietary intervention. <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a> 00:21, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anon is dancing again. The site pointed to does not speak of autistic enterocolitis as being different from dietary treatment of usual enterocolitis. I have an eMail in to Andy Wakefield to see if he has any new insights. He usually takes a day or two to get back to eMail. The latter of michaels suggestions then makes sense in his view. I still have trouble with even talking about treatment when the actual disorder is not yet confirmed by other groups as a meaningful distinction. I think that even having dietary treatment makes no real sense. If anything at all, it should just be treatment, say that there is nothing known about colitis in Autism needing treatment different from colitis in general, and point to the colitis article. When your treat autsitics with colitis they already are on the diet since they have autism. That gets to the point really that there is no data on safety or efficacy of diet on colitis in Autsim. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 05:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so you disagree with autistic enterocolitis as an objectively proven scientific fact. That is being dealt with elsewhere on this page. That is fine as it can be dealt with on the main page as two separate differing POVs. You will also say the term is not used in these descriptions. Are you then going to say that none of these cases have had their autistic and other GI problems assisted by diet? These are just sample case histories. How many more do you want? Got nothing like this in Chicago then? Are your Chicago kids recovering from autism on their diet? So even if you disagree that autistic enterocolitis exists, there are those who acknowledge it does and they provide evidence. They also provide evidence of the effect of diet on amelioration of symptoms and reversal of autism. So even if you disagree that this is autistic enterocolitis, that is a POV in the same way you say these people are presenting a POV.</dd>

Also, as a practitioner in the field you are now very clearly on notice of the effect of diet and if you fail to take account of it and act on it to the detriment of your patients, then you need to take that up with your PI insurers and make sure you have adequate cover in place.</dd>

<dd>Anon: You miss the point of the whole Autistic enterocolitis article. It is well known among us that treat Autism patients that they have a lot of colitis. The issue is whether colitis in autistics is a colitis so different in diagnosis or treatment from colitis in other patients that it requires recognition as a separate entity. Putting me on notice is a goofy statement. The patients I see are referred to me through the Pfeifer treatment center and are already on the diet. Of course, if the diet worked to cure colitis in those kids I wouldn't be finding it on biopsies I do during colonoscopy, then, would I? <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 22:29, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following 3 points were raised above and have not been challenged. 1) changes to dietary advice would have to be maintained here and in the Autism article. 2) it is not clear that the colitis in Autistics is different from other types of colitis. 3) there are no studies that address diet as an intervention specific to autistic enterocolitis, while it is a treatment in Autism. Because those points remain true the dietary section does not belong here. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 22:47, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yoooo Hoooo! We have data! This is the first time I have seen another investigator agree with calling this a specific entity. Actually, I have been hoping this would come up. The acceptance of IBD in the Autism patients has been low by most GI docs. Note, however, that in the reference from <i>BMJ</i> the two articles that supported the "not in doubt" statement were Wakefield's articles. I wouldn't say not in doubt, but at least now there is support for describing the beginning of acceptance in the medical community. see edits <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 17:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me see. Numerous peer reviewed papers by gastroenterologists (not just Wakefield) all acknowledging autistic enterocolitis exists and one paper by a member of the least successful branch of medicine, psychiatry and another by Jick and Kaye who are yet again operating in a field outwith their clinical expertise it would seem. No contest really. Got any papers by gastroenterologists to support your POV? If not, either restore the text or we find a way of representing accurately the clearly differing views in peer reviewed papers. The Invisible Anon 19:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Numerous peer reviewed" may be stretching the truth a little bit. Which peer reviewed papers are you referring to? A PubMed search of "autistic enterocolitis" shows only 19 references, the majority of which are authored by Andrew Wakefield. A reference by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Fombonne_743c.html" title="Eric Fombonne">Fombonne</a> and Cook in <i>Mol. Pscyh</i> 2003;8:133 again raises the point that autistic enterocolitis is a controversial entity. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 19:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fombonne is the psychiatrist I was referring to. You seem to overlook that Wakefield is only a contributor to many of the papers and the other authors are not exactly geeks - eg. Royal Free London. You note these papers are in the majority and you also overlook the paper from the Department of Medicine, Guy’s, King’s, St Thomas’ Medical School, London which states:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The presence of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia and colitis in autistic children, termed autistic "enterocolitis", with various gastrointestinal symptoms investigated a number of years after immunisation is not in doubt</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So unless you can come up with something useful, you need to reconcile the conflicting views of the majority of peer reviewed papers against your minority who are operating outside their fields. The Invisible Anon 19:52, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "is not in doubt" quotation in the <i>Gut</i> article is only one reference...this does not constitute "a majority" of peer-reviewed references...perhaps you could cite additional references? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 20:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear anon: My yoooo hooo was not meant badly. I am actually thrilled to see a paper with a reference. I am alos glad you porvided the link and that it was so easy to download. It is a good paper. It is from a group without wakefield as an author. It still is just one paper. There still are not a bunch of peer reviewed papers, as you state. But one is enough for me to get it into wikipedia. It should be qualified, though. I am still not convinced that the colitis in the Autistics is different from colitis I see in other patients. But as studies come along, and I know they will, the matter will be determined. I am glad you are thinking now about going to original papers. The comment about writing out of field is odd. Wakefield is a gastroenterologist. What was meant by the out of field comment? <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 22:27, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nothing taken badly. Glad to see you are entering into the spirit of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Just so you do not have to take my word for it, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> confirmed for you a few lines above "<i>A PubMed search of "autistic enterocolitis" shows ... 19 references ...</i>". So, not just the one reference. And if you check you will see it is not quite accurate to say as <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> does <i>the majority of which are authored by Andrew Wakefield</i>. I am sure you do not want to give anyone the impression he was the only author or that the lead and co-authors will sign their names to any piece of paper thrust in front of them? They are well qualified people from well known and respected establishments.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>So, where are your peer reviewed papers?</b>
<ul>
<li>You cite the psychiatrist Fombonne's paper on gastroenterology. Pretty versatile for a psych turning his hand to that. Do you think he might be any good at checking our pipework one weekend?</li>
<li>Then you cite Jick and Kaye, who 'pop up' all over.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I loved their paper telling the world that one of the SSRIs associated with a 3:1 suicide risk was just as safe as competition. I couldn't work out if they were trying to undermine the competitor products or trying to demonstrate that the drug was OK to continue prescribing. Then they list all the drug companies that pay them but say this or that paper was written in their spare time. Such enthusiam for their work. Water-skiing, watching the jets over the harbour with the kids or a paper on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors for no pay - a tough one that.</dd>
<dd>And their 2001 epid paper on UK autism incidence. Confidence interval? Is it 10:10,000 or 40:10,000? Hell, I don't know - lets cover them all. And another example of outstanding devotion to duty. Hmm, Sunday lunch with my wife and kids and a round of golf with my buddies with a few beers in the bar later? No I'm a Boston man, I don't care I won't be paid to do it, I will research the UK GPRD data on autism and do some great adjustments and regression analysis. That is much more fun. Heck, who cares if it is UK data and who can be bothered to work out what GPRD stands for anyhows.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Too bad their paper did not get into the Cochrane review. Pretty unlikely but had to check - they had so many other beauties. But not too disappointing, the review included a Fombonne. And hey, even they found it impossible to interpret. But was it maybe just all those long medical words?</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I'm being misinterpreted. It is worthwhile mentioning autistic enterocolitis as a potentially distinct entity. However, it needs to be appropriately prefaced that this is a <i>controversial</i> and not a well-established entity (like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). The point of mentioning the PubMed citations is that autistic enterocolitis is only mentioned in a few isolated papers. Nineteen is a small number as far as PubMed is concerned, and most of these citations relate back to the original Wakefield <i>Lancet</i> article and are not new, original research. Furthermore, I haven't seen this condition discussed in a review article in a mainstream medical journal.

<dd>I agree with Andrew. A mainstream acceptance of an idea will give at least hundreds to thousands of hits on a pub-med search of the term. A comparison with a rare disease such as Zollinger Ellison Syndrome might be a worthy comparison on whether a rare condition has a name accepted by mainstream sources. The term autistic enterocolitis has started to see some use but it is not yet clearly an entity seen to be other than colitis in patients with Autism. The proponderance of data argument is probably reasonable. When most reviews of autism recognize that colitis in Autism patients is a special, distinguishable type of colitis then it will be mainstream. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 23:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Vote To Retain</b> This is a vote for the name to be retained as it is. The term "autistic enterocolitis" is one in use. It is also in use in numerous peer reviewed papers (as established on this talk page). Further, a term used to describe existing physical conditions can never be an 'hypothesis'. The proposal to change the name is to something that is not in use and not recognised. The page can make the point as to general acceptability, and it is an accepted term for some, albeit others disagree. It is instructive to note that the Cochrane review relied on only one paper to claim there was no evidence of a link between vaccination and PPD/Disintegrative Disorders and only on four papers in relation to autism. Here we have several times those figures using "autistic enterocolotis". I am amazed the proposition was even put forward.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>retain</b>: The proposal would do little except put up obstacles to those who might otherwise find the article easily, and then there would have to be an explanation in the intro about the oddity of the article title. This proposal would result in something similar to the oddity that <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_police.html" title="Thought police">thought police</a> redirects to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_crime.html" title="Thought crime">thought crime</a>, despite the fact that the former garners four times the goofle hits of the latter. While Wakefield may have committed a thought crime by questioning the wisdom of the MMR vaccine, the term he coined seems apt and scientifically valid as a diagnosis. As someone noted, microscopic colitis is typically found in the elderly, not toddlers, underscoring the probability that the unique pathology of the condition is specific to many cases of autism. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 09:27, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep. I made the mocroscopic colitis comment. Ombudsman is incorrect that microscopic colitis is only in the elderly. It is a wider age range (unless you consider over 40 to be elderly&#160;;-). However, it will be a different colitis if the cell types differ, if the response is different, or if the etiology is ever ascertained. Just finding it in a different population does not change the understanding of the disease. I think the folks suggesting the name change want to see the discussion stay amicable. It was nice to see others giving thoughtful input. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 20:03, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Andrew it explains autistic enterocolitis. It is relevant here. Inadequate reasoning for deletion. You should not delete relevant material simply on the grounds in your POV it should be somewhere else. You did not mind the same information being here as a reference. You suddently objected when it was made easier to assimilate and was incorporated into the main text and it is not in keeping with your POV. Whereever anyone thinks it should be, it should certainly be here. The rest of the debate on this page makes that clear and this page is a very short one too. Suggest you restore the text without delay. This looks like a backwards step of justs reverting without discussion. The Invisible Anon 13:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am for including relevant material...it just seemed that his lecture was on the MMR vaccine and autism. There wasn't any mention of autistic enterocolitis in the paragraph. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 13:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have fixed that by making direct reference to autistic enterocolitis and if it is of any assistance deleted the reference to MMR vaccine. That part of the wording was inherited from the editor who originally inserted the reference. The association is not accepted, but the GI problems are becoming acknowledged.

<dd>Perhaps an external link or reference to his lecture is more appropriate. The lecture doesn't seem to be notable enough to merit a whole paragraph in this article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 19:17, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One would have thought: such is the confusion, over just, what Dr Wakefield has claimed, said, and not said, etc., is evidence enough, that a paragraph about the lecture in Pittsburgh is very much needed, to bring peoples attention to the opportunity that they can hear it straight from the <i>horses mouth</i> as it were. It may be too esoteric for say a general practitioner or a SHO to get a grip of yet, but it would -one could argue- be of interest to many others. Such direct source material as this video should therefore be given a higher profile than <u>just</u> an external link.--<a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspro_0ac7.html" title="User:Aspro">Aspro</a> 22:57, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A whole paragraph though still seems somewhat excessive. Should everyone of Wakefield's papers and lectures get a whole paragraph? A paragraph (or more) would be reasonable to describe e.g. Fitzgerald's <i>Great Gatsby,</i> but I don't think the same amount of attention needs to be given about a routine lecture a scientist would give. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 21:45, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A "whole paragraph" (and a very short one) is too much? For details of where people can find his own explanation direct from the man at the centre of one of the greatest medical controversies of modern time? Hmmm. Is that a point of view or is that a point of view? The Invisible Anon 22:22, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, for me, this is more of a stylistic issue, rather than a content issue. Perhaps the paragraph on Wakefield's lecture should be more of a subheading rather than its own heading. By what you describe, why not make it in <b>bold font, ALL CAPS,</b> so that all the readers can see it! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 23:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I also think that we would be justified in pointing out that this is still at the stage of a hypothesis and we should put that as a suffix to the title until more evidence has been forthcoming. Who knows, this may end up being referred to as phospholipid disorder affecting the cell wall and the viral components present -due simply a result of that disorder (this would help to explain the neurological effects as well).

<dd>Additionally, as a reminder, this dialogue started because Steve tried to make fun of me with "Yoooo Hoooo! We have data!"

It was shown (again in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Autistic_enterocolitis#About_time_the_anon_has_data.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Autistic_enterocolitis#About_time_the_anon_has_data.21" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>]) there are many more peer reviewed papers which accept there is autistic enterocolitis and by authors who are in a position to know other than Wakefield. In contrast only two papers were cited that oppose, and by authors whose specialities are far away from gastroenterology (psychiatry (other end of the anatomy) and a couple of weekend hobbyist epidemiologists).

<dd>Anon: You have made a statement that seems to reflect easily hurt feelings. If you want to argue in Wikipedia you need to be less sensitive. As explained above, having data is a reason to change views, and I was excited to see the data. Note that as soon as you presented data showing another group was using the term I immediately changed my position from "Not a concept accepted by anyone" to "a term starting to gain acceptance". See, just show data and you will get results. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 23:13, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steve, its a factual statement: "<i>Steve tried to make fun of me with "Yoooo Hoooo! We have data!</i>". Doesn't bother me that you tried to make fun of me and it backfired. Seems to bother you though. Commenting on its use suggests perhaps a tiny bit of oversensitivity on your part to criticism? Let's keep off the personal stuff shall we, as it can only lead to tears?

<dd>No, Anon, it's a violation of the assumption of good faith. The fact in the statement is this: "Steve said 'Yoooo Hoooo! We have data!'" The assumption about motivation that "Tried to make fun of me" contains cannot possibly be proven. <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a> 03:11, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Until the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> was considered a very rare condition, but it is diagnosed much more often nowadays, whether due to increased diagnostic vigilance by doctors, changes of diagnostic categories, or an actual increase in incidence. Estimates of the percentage of late-onset autism cases range from 20% to 80%, with the lower percentage reported by sources including the <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Medical_Journal_9f3e.html" title="British Medical Journal">British Medical Journal</a></i> as not having changed in recent years.<a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7334/393?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;author1=taylor%2C+b&amp;author2=miller%2C+e&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1131354836349_1244&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=1,2,3,4" class="external autonumber" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7334/393?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;author1=taylor%2C+b&amp;author2=miller%2C+e&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1131354836349_1244&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=1,2,3,4" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Wakefield, however, contends that a regressive syndrome "may reflect a subset of children with developmental disorders with distinct etiological and clinical features."<a href="http://www.mercola.com/2000/oct/8/autism_enterocolitis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mercola.com/2000/oct/8/autism_enterocolitis.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>"</p>
<p>The beginning of that seems to be a very long way in the background, and better left in the main article on autism. The relevance of late onset with this article's subject is not made there, and it isn't clear to me whether there is any.

<p>The section that lists papers that agree with or back up Wakefield needs to be balanced by the full list of papers and articles that criticise his work, or the section needs deleting. I assume that the latter is easiest, but that the former is the most useful. For now I have tagged the section with a NPOV tag. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 13:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These papers do not in fact agree with or back up Wakefield. They are just a ragbag of this and that.
