<p>Wesley, Raymond E. Brown in his <i>An Introduction to the New Testament</i> offers percentages of the "critical scholarship" who believe whether Paul wrote which Epistle. For the ones where there is serious doubt, here are Brown's numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Thessalonians -- "evenly divided"</li>
<li>Colossians -- 60%</li>
<li>Ephesians -- 70 to 80% (with Erasmus mentioned as one)</li>
<li>Titus -- 80 to 90%</li>
<li>1 Timothy -- 80 to 90%</li>
<li>2 Timothy -- 80 to 90%</li>
<li>Hebrews -- almost all scholars, with Origen &amp; Tertullian being 2 early sceptics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brown's book is an excellent guide to the issues (both textual &amp; of content) of the NT, &amp; should be consulted by everyone who wants to contribute to New Testament articles. Although he admits at the beginning of this book that he is a Catholic scholar (&amp; wrote extensively about the Johannine books before his death), he makes his own POV very clear, &amp; provides intelligent discussions of POVs opposing his. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:45, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>llywrch, thank you very much for the source. Can I assume that those percentages of "critical scholarship" that do <i>not</i> believe that Paul wrote the book in question? Also, I presume based on the fact that ranges are given, that these figures are not the result of an actual survey but rather Brown's general impression of what "critical scholarship" thinks. Is this a fair assessment? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 03:07, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wesley, I'm not sure I understand your question, so forgive me if I don't properly answer it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere in his book does Brown explain how he arrived at these numbers; I would assume, for lack of better evidence that it was based on his extensive reading of the secondary literature &amp; years of associating with other NT scholars. In other words, these numbers are not hard &amp; verifable, but provide a useful gauge of just how likely Paul wrote each one of these works. I find his numbers a better tool than the usual Wikipedia practice of either stating something along the lines of "a concensus", "many people believe", "some people believe", or "an articulate minority believe" -- plus we're quoting the opinion of an acknowledged expert, rather than an anonymous Wikipedian's unverifiable impression.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And these numbers only tell one piece of the story -- which is why I made the pitch to read his book. (And do -- I believe that it has something of value for every student of the NT, despite her/his beliefs.) Brown spends a chapter explaining the complex issue of authorship at the time these works were written: while admitting that it is possible that some of these works were not the direct work of Paul -- either by his hand or a scribe by dictation -- he emphasizes that they were very likely written by his own followers who wanted to preserve some of his ideas that had not been set down in writing. In other words, very much like the difference between a professor's own essay &amp; a student's paraphrase based on that professor's works. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:15, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, you answered my question. I agree that Brown's general impression is probably far more accurate than most based on his involvement in the given field, as you say. I'm sure it's a fine book, but I can't be sure when I'll get to it, as I'm already behind on my personal reading list.

<p>"When Marcion (the 2nd century founder of Marcionism, similar to gnosticism) listed the epistles by Paul, he did not mention the pastorals (1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus). The author of Ephesians itself draws on most of Paul's epistles in its style but seems to lack any reliance on 2 Thessalonians or the pastorals. For this reason, authorship of many of the epistles traditionally attributed to Paul have been in doubt for many centuries by critical scholars."</p>
<p>Wow. Marcion was opposed by many people. That doesn't even cop a mention. I'm marking this as totally disputed. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 05:01, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, he was opposed. <b>But</b>, he was the first person <b>ever</b> to list any New Testament canon. (Which is the significance of his list - i.e. the sentence is basically "When the first list of Canon was drawn up, it did not include the pastorals amongst it"). It was because of Marcion's list's existance that the others decided it necessary to draw up a canon. Marcion's list was first. B.t.w. His list only included the Pauline epistles, and the Gospel of Luke. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 18:16, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Chill out, man. If Marcion was the first to list them, this is a <i>fact</i>. No problem with facts, surely? It's not at all disputed if it's true.

<dd>No, actually he didn't. The next person missed out some others, but included certain epistles, and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepherd_of_Hermas_2425.html" title="Shepherd of Hermas">Shepherd of Hermas</a>. Later ones also added <a href="../../../1/_/c/1_Clement_eb58.html" title="1 Clement">1 Clement</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Barnabas_35d5.html" title="Epistle of Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a>, still later ones added <a href="../../../3/_/c/3_Corinthians_3152.html" title="3 Corinthians">3 Corinthians</a>. Shepherd of Hermas, and Barnabas, were held to be canon by the majority for absolutely ages (and discounted Revelations). It was only really sorted out into the exact set we have now at some time in the late 3rd/ early 4th century. I think the first time the actual canon used now was listed was at the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod_of_Laodicea_7c51.html" title="Synod of Laodicea">Synod of Laodicea</a> (or somewhere with a similar sounding name) at about this time. But since this is about the fact that it is suspicious that they weren't listed at the start of the 2nd century, or in fact even mentioned at all until the end of the second century (by Irenaeus, who is the first to mention the pastorals ever), I don't see how that is relevant. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesedreams_871c.html" title="User:Cheesedreams">CheeseDreams</a> 02:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The 27 books we have in the New Testament were first listed as a group by Athanasius in one of his pastoral letters in the mid fourth century. They were then agreed on in a series of synods, and yes I think the Syond of Laodicea was one of those, in the last half of the fourth century. I think it's fine to mention Marcion's canon, but it's also well worth noting that no one else paid much attention to it (besides the Marcionsites) and his list was controversial even then, and not just because of the pauline epistles. I'll do some checking into when the pastorals were first mentioned; do you happen to have a reference saying Irenaeus was the first, just to save me some time?

<p>This article, like <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_John_85d3.html" title="Authorship of John">Authorship of John</a>, is about textual criticism, and is fairly seperate to the main article on these epistles. This is also quite a large page, as is the Pauline epistles page, merging them would push the page quite high. Further, this page is linked from many textual criticism pages, it would be quite odd to be directed to a page discussing the content, in the same way as merging <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markan_priority.html" title="Markan priority">Markan priority</a> with <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mark_938f.html" title="Gospel of Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> would be really quite odd.

<p>Why is this page totally disputed? Try it yourself. Seperate the two sets of epistles (the 7 undisputed, vs. those that are not the 7 undisputed). Read one whole set, then read the other. It is really quite different.</p>

<p>You can check the epistles yourself if you want, the points made in the article are true. The language is different, the greek does have large differences, the theology and style does have large differences. The vast majority of most scholars do consider that Paul did not write the pastorals. Most do not think that Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 18:34, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How interesting that you are <i>still</i> making sweeping statements. There are many, many Christian Bible scholars who believe that Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians. So that proves your assertion false. Also, you haven't given me sources for your claims. Do you expect me to wade through all your books? If this was submitted as a college paper you'd fail.

<dd>Perhaps we could compromise by saying that most non Christian scholars believe that the evidence of <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textual_criticism.html" title="Textual criticism">textual criticism</a> indicates that Paul did not write some of these epistles? As for reading them for myself, it's easy to imagine that someone might adopt a different style when writing to a bishop or apostle, then when writing to a congregation; this alone would easily explain the pastorals. As for different phrasings, perhaps he dictated his letters and some scribes didn't write down his words precisely word for word, altering the style or grammar slightly. I'm no expert so I won't make these suggestions in the text, but let's at least agree that we are not likely to convince each other, and also agree for the sake of civility that the other person's beliefs about this are not completely without merit. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 13:20, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Not really, the Pastorals are particularly extreme in their differences. (This is somewhat obscured by translation though). It is as likely as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, with his standard and style of english, writing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Remains_of_the_Day_db4b.html" title="The Remains of the Day">The Remains of the Day</a>, with its. That's the level of difference in the pastorals. Which is basically the reason that virtually all scholars who do not let their religion get in the way of their objectivity are totally convinced that the pastorals are fakes. It is essentially easier to prove that George Bush wrote one of the most eloquent pieces of english ever written (the aforementioned book) than it is to show that Paul wrote the pastorals. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesedreams_871c.html" title="User:Cheesedreams">CheeseDreams</a> 02:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Let me say this a little bit differently. We need to agree that we subscribe to different theories about the authorship of the Pauline epistles, and more importantly, agree that scholars also disagree about their authorship. My favorite theory, your favorite theory, and whoever else's favorite theory need to be presented neutrally, and objectively. This is how NPOV works on wikipedia.

<dd>I agree, listing some opposing views will help the article. It would also be helpful to further qualify "majority of scholars" as to which scholars are really intended. You probably don't want to include every monk and priest among this group of scholars, for instance, even though many of them spend a great deal of time studying the Bible and related early texts. However, they don't all employ the tools of textual criticism. So how could we neutrally describe "most scholars" to indicate the scholars you do mean? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 13:20, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that this would be better merged with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Epistles_683b.html" title="Pauline Epistles">Pauline Epistles</a>. Firstly, this is a general article that has to do with authorship, however this should be covered in the main article! It should be merged. As it is, this piece is a gigantic POV piece by one author. The central thesis of the piece is that the epistles weren't written by Paul and that most if not all scholars agree with this. No attempt at giving an opposing POV has been written although there is plenty of it around, especially amongst Christian scholars.</p>
<p><i>It sounds like an interesting debate and it would be great if you could fill in the other side!</i></p>
<p>Cheesedreams uses phrases such as the following: "For this reason, authorship of many of the epistles traditionally attributed to Paul have been in doubt for many centuries by critical scholars. By the end of the 20th century, the majority of scholars had rejected all but 7 as genuinely by Paul (consequently these 7 are known as the undisputed epistles)." and also "The pastorals were subjected to the level of computer analysis used in criminal trials for similarity of authorship, and failed that analysis." I have removed these comments as they are unsubstantiated and POV.</p>
<p><i>You what? My understanding is that this is absolutely correct. Only seven of the epistles are considered to be undisputed. That doesn't mean that the others definitely weren't written by Paul, but that only these seven are accepted by all to have been. I'm no Biblical scholar but I do know that the provenance of much of the New Testament is contested. I know this is difficult ground for believing editors, but please, try to get it into perspective.</i></p>

<p>The 2/3rd argument has been removed also. There is no source for this, and it seems dubious at best. I have changed it to "Other arguments rely on the polemical content of the letter, certain concepts, and false-teacher arguments, not expressed by other Christian writers until the end of the first century, making an appearance in Colossians." You'll notice I've removed "However, such <i>before their time</i> issues can be explained by Paul being the source of these concepts, rather that merely a redistributer of them (although this can also be used to argue that Paul made them up himself, rather than reflecting the faith)." because this appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.

</dl>
<p>If an epistle is disputed, we should mention it in the section that talks about the epistle, we shouldn't be confirming or denying the status of the epistle as this statement in itself is disputed by many Christians.</p>
<p><i>I have to disagree. Saying something is "disputed" simply describes it as being under dispute. It doesn't make a judgement about whether it should be disputed etc. It distinguishes those epistles that are agreed by all to be written by Paul from those that are disputed; no more, no less. I think that if you were able to step back and look at that idea from a more neutral standpoint, you'd see that it's not as bad as you seem to think. I can fully understand your sensitivity though. I imagine the outrage of Moslems if it were suggested that some of the Koran was of disputed authorship. Trying to convince them that saying it's true that it's disputed is different from saying that it *should be* disputed would be a very difficult task.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It has been. Actually, many liberal Muslims are open to the idea. You see, Uhlman (not sure how to spell that), who collected together the Koran from the various different versions of it, and unified it (very very early on in its history), himself writes of passages no longer in the Koran. Uhlman (or whatever his name is) may have (intentionally or otherwise) not chosen all the true verses, or added others. For example, the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanic_Verses_6cf4.html" title="Satanic Verses">Satanic Verses</a>. Many liberal Muslims are not sure about the validity of all of this collation process, and wonder whether certain parts are dubious, though it happened earlier in its history, than did Christianity (within about 50 years), so has a greater chance of being accurate (as there is less time to produce myths/counter-myths and forgeries, as well as rival lists of texts). <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesedreams_871c.html" title="User:Cheesedreams">CheeseDreams</a> 02:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true. I'm a bit sensitive about this topic. I don't like being misrepresented. Noone does. That's why I've always tried to write from a NPOV on Islam, even though I <i>totally</i> disagree with it. I don't think I'm a POV pusher. But again, as I've said above, can we find sources <i>please</i>? And say who the parties who dispute these facts are? If only because I'd like to look up those references and verify them. Which I will most likely do. After all, that's one of the reasons why this place is meant to be so good: we treat each side fairly and from a neutral POV. Part of that process is that we must give a reference to those points of view!!!

<p>I notice quite a few claims have not been substantiated.

<p>I have moved the "(possibly forged)" because this is not substantiated and appears to be the view of the author. Again this is a POV statement. However, now the paragraph reads:</p>
<p>"The extensiveness of the development of the theology in the epistle compared to that of other epistles has led many scholars to the opinion that if it is genuine, then it must be very late. However, due to the apparant consideration of the letter as genuine by the author of the Ephesians, then most scholars think that if Colossians is forged, it is very early."</p>
<p>Again, no scholars are quoted and it is made out like this is an accepted fact, which it is not, especially amongst Christians.</p>

<p>Now we get to Ephesians. It says that "Ephesians bears a strong similarity to Colossians, to the extent that over 40 areas of the text can be identified in Colossians which Ephesians reproduces, expands upon them and adding." No attempt at telling us <i>any</i> of the 40 areas of text are identified! So marking this as dubious. However, the rest of the paragraph reads: "It is for this reason that almost all scholars think that Ephesians is an edited reworked reproduction of Colossians, though whether this is due to Paul seeking to emphasise particular meanings, or whether it is down to a forger trying to alter perception of Paul's teachings, is a matter of more dispute, about 2/3 of scholars choosing the latter." almost all scholars think that? great, what a POV sweeping statement. So I've also rephrased this to "many scholars", however this now means I've had to add a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a>. I also dispute the "about 2/3 of scholars choosing the latter." bit, so I've removed it. So now it reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>You should add it back, because they do. Removing it suggests a POV motive for suppressing the fact that most scholars (2:1 margin) consider it true, and instead implying that a number of them, which is sizable, do. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesedreams_871c.html" title="User:Cheesedreams">CheeseDreams</a> 02:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<p>"It is for this reason that many scholars think that Ephesians is an edited and reworked reproduction of Colossians, though whether this is due to Paul seeking to emphasise particular meanings, or whether it is down to a forger trying to alter perception of Paul's teachings, is a matter of more dispute."</p>
<p>Yet this is still not very good, because a) no scholars are mentioned (you expect me to take this on faith?!) b)no sources are given c) I have no way of verifying this information and how to rebutt it or provide an alternative POV. So this is totally POV still. So again, I've marked is as dubious.</p>
<p>"Many terms found in parts of the new testament which are considered to have been written after Paul's death are found within Ephesians, though not in other epistles, and for terms that are, the author makes a different choice of usage, for example linking <i>pistis</i> with <i>kurios</i> rather than just <i>christos</i>." I don't even know where to start with this paragraph. Firstly, you'll notice that I've removed the "disputed" bit. Its almost impossible for me to understand what is being said in this sentence because it's so convuluted! I've <i>attempted</i> a copyedit, but I don't know how well I've suceeded. Hint for CheeseDreams: Greek has a capital letter. So does New Testament. Part of my copy edit to the paragraph was to change it to "Such variations occur to the extent that many scholars think that, though Paul's authorship is not impossible, if Paul did write such a letter, someone else rewrote it." Funny however that no scholars are given and we're just expected to accept what is written here.</p>
<p>"One of the more noticable differences between Ephesians and other epistles is the distinct lack of any reference to an impending occurrance of the day of Christ. Also, the image of marriage as an heavenly union between the church and Christ contrasts noticably with 1 Corinthians' suggestion that marriage is to be avoided if possible."</p>
<p>No source. Original research.</p>
<p>"The general nature of the epistle itself, unlike those of the <i>undisputed</i>, is more a general homily, than anything directed at a particular community (such as the Ephesians themselves). To textual critics, such as Richard Heard, such variations are suspicious, in particular phrases such as <i>holy apostles</i> seeming completely out of place, except to a writer from a more developed church (such as that of the second century)."</p>
<p>And now we get to the absolutely beautiful bit. This bit kills me.</p>
<p>"2 Thessalonians is considered by scholars, such as Udo Schnelle &lt;!-- do we really have to put in "supported by X" it just looks sloppy and unreadable, it's in the bibliography --&gt;, to be significantly different in style to the <i>undisputed</i> epistles, being whole and narrow rather than a lively and abrupt discussion on a range of issues. Neither does 2 Thessalonians have significant open or deep questions unlike much of the remainder of Paul's writing, and, according to scholars, such as <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Loisy_6884.html" title="Alfred Loisy">Alfred Loisy</a>, seems to reflect knowledge of the synoptic gospels, which had not been written when Paul wrote his epistles. Further reason for scepticism, such as that of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Ehrman_bd94.html" title="Bart Ehrman">Bart Ehrman</a>{{nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, derives from the insistence of genuineness within it, and the strong condemnation of forgery at its start (a ploy commonly used in forged documents)."</p>
<p>We have two <b>comments</b> in the text (I notice not on talk!) "do we really have to put in "supported by X" it just looks sloppy and unreadable, it's in the bibliography" and "again, I object to "according to X" on grounds of poor style" Allow me to be the first to point out to you that all statements on Wikipedia must be qualified. Allow me to be the first to point out to you that we <b>loathe</b> <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_terms.html" title="Weasel terms">weasel terms</a>. So, yes! you need to include these in the text! And please don't discuss "style". So far I've noticed the poor style that this article has been written in. No wonder this article is so disputed! Sheesh.</p>
<p>Now, does <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Ehrman_bd94.html" title="Bart Ehrman">Bart Ehrman</a> argue that it is (a ploy commonly used in forged documents)? This isn't clear. Want to substantiate this further? Sounds dodgy, but if he says this then we should make it clear.</p>
<p>"Another issue often raised is that of context, for example, in the time of Paul, prayer usually treated God (<i>the Father</i>) as ultimate judge, rather than Jesus (as Christians nearer the end of the first century started to), which to scholars, such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Perrin_e129.html" title="Norman Perrin">Norman Perrin</a>, &lt;!-- this according to X thing just really looks ridiculous--&gt; suggests that 2 Thessalonians stating <i>may the Lord direct your hearts to ... the steadfastness of Christ</i> unlike 1 Thessalonians' <i>may establish your hearts unblamable ... before God and Father</i>, implies it having been written during times after Paul's death."</p>
<p>No, CheeseDreams, it doesn't look ridiculous. It's part of NPOV and a part of removing <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>. It stops disputes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It does look ridiculous, since "Some people, including X, believe" is redundant. I've rewritten these paragraphs to fix this; "X believes".

<dd>The interpretation of 1 Corinthians being completely against marriage is but one way to read it, considering the same book also vigorously defends the right of apostles to be married.

<dd>The standard interpretation of Paul amongst non-Christians is of a self-hating (possibly gay, Timothy being one of his boyfriends) prude, or, as someone expressed to me, <i>a self-loathing old queen</i>. This is precisely because Paul is seen by them as SO against marriage and SO pro celibacy. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesedreams_871c.html" title="User:Cheesedreams">CheeseDreams</a> 02:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.s. it should be noted that the standard intepretation by non-Christians is not that that the gnostics held - they explained the apparant loathing of the flesh as the gnostic ideal that the flesh is intrinsicly evil (being created by the devil), thus hatred of sexuality, and anything else like that.

<p>If Paul were completely against marriage, then surely he would have criticized Peter for being married, rather than defend his marriage? He certainly wasn't shy about criticizing Peter on other grounds, when he felt it was warranted. But really, if that's the standard interpretation among gay non-Christians, that's fine. As always, all I ask is that such interpretations be attributed appropriately rather than stated as fact. So, what would be the most appropriate attribution? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 23:29, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just want to chip in briefly here. The scholarly website <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com" class="external text" title="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com" rel="nofollow">Early Christian Writings</a> contains clear links to pages on the various Pauline letters, and discussion of their contents and possible authorship presented clearly and concisely, with numerous references to the scholars advocating the positions, and links to further offsite resources. It should hopefully be useful to those here complaining about the lack of citable sources for various agruments.</p>
<p>For example, the entry for Colossians not only mentions that it was Raymond Brown who supplied the 60% statistic discussed at the top of the page, but also mentions that it features on page 610 of his "An Introduction to the New Testament"--<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMockTurtle_4b67.html" title="User:MockTurtle">MockTurtle</a> 03:06, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe recent computer analysis of word frequency and patterns in the epistles has come to the conclusion that he only wrote the first 4 epistles, regarded as his major ones, plus probably Hebrews. The others are all by different authors, except the the 2 to Thessalonians are by the same author, as are the 2 to Timothy. This view at least deserves a mention. A very small number of theologians did already hold this view. PatGallacher</p>

<dd>Can you give details or substantiation? I'd be amazed if a statistical study claimed Hebrews and Galatians were by the same author.

<dd>One problem, as I see it, is how much should these issues be centralized? The question of the authorship of a single letter (e.g. Galatians) is a subset of the question of the authorship of the Pauline letters, which is a subset of the question of the authorship of all Biblical books, which is a subset of the question of the authorship of ancient documents in general. I wonder if the general principles should be under an article such as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphy.html" title="Pseudepigraphy">Pseudepigraphy</a> or <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writer.html" title="Writer">Writer</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgery.html" title="Forgery">Forgery</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authenticity.html" title="Authenticity">Authenticity</a>.

<dd>If not, then perhaps the reason most scholars accept the seven "undisputed" letters as being from Paul belongs on this page, and the individual pages for the seven letters should just point here when discussing authenticity? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a> 07:48, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Lawrence, I <i>really</i> like that material from the Galatians talk page as a starting point for the section in question in this article. I am sure it bears some smoothing and adding to, but in general it seems very knowledgable and clear, and it at least partially establishes the rationale behind authenticity.

<dd>As far as the long-term centrality discussion, I personally think that this is one of Wikipedia's toughest points. Being paper-free encourages depth, but it also creates these problems of locating information. I do like the solution posed in your final paragraph--perhaps a brief paragraph in each of the seven articles summarizing the case (and perhaps providing more detail about that particular letter...what details are most convincing, most in agreement with <i>Acts</i>, etc.) with a link to the section in this article. Ideally that would be our solution, I think. If that works for you, I'd encourage you to make it happen.

<dd>The title "<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_the_Pauline_epistles_ec4d.html" title="Authorship of the Pauline epistles">Authorship of the Pauline epistles</a>" suggests to me that the whole question is meant to be handled here, with specifics that concern only individual epistles handled at the various articles, under a <i>Main article at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_the_Pauline_epistles_ec4d.html" title="Authorship of the Pauline epistles">Authorship of the Pauline epistles</a></i> header. Those brief summarizing paragraphs Jwrosenzweig mentions could be here, as this is a trunk article on this question, and each of the individual articles have many other issues to address, on content, etc.. Some overlap is always desirable, so that thoughts may be complete. Surely a report on individual scholars' reasons for recognizing Paul's undisputed hand, even quoting them, makes a useful encyclopedic report. And the computer studies throw fresh light. But, as for the subsets of broader questions, my sense is constantly that the broadest questions just don't suit encyclopedia format. They need whole books, or they dissolve into airy generalities: that is, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a> will never be as satisfactory as <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merovingians.html" title="Merovingians">Merovingians</a>.

<p>It seems to me that in this article views aren't attributed nearly as much as they should be. As I understand it, besides the seven "undisputed" epistles, only Colossians and 2 Thessalonians have had any serious scholars in the last 70 years or so who support Pauline authorship. The Pastorals and Ephesians seem to be generally agreed to not be the work of Paul, in the same way that nobody really believes that Peter wrote the Gospels attributed to him, or that James brother of Jesus wrote the Epistle attributed to him. The article as it stands seems, like so many wikipedia articles on early Christian themes, to present the case as one between "skeptics" who don't accept much of anything, and conservative Christians who except the traditional attributions. If we're going to do this, each questionable Gospel ought to quote the specific scholars who argue specific points, rather than lengthy disquisitions. Material at earlychristianwitings.com would probably provide useful summariez, and so forth, of the various debates (they conclude that, besides the 7 undisputed gospels, only Colossians might plausibly be the work of Paul. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 05:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have a point there. I feel the problem lies in the black/white approach many Christians take towards the Bible: either a given work was written by its putative author, &amp; thus was created under divine inspiration &amp; is undeniably authoritative in what it says; or it was not written by that person, &amp; therefore has no more validity than the mutterings of a schizoprhenic homeless person. (Maybe this is a little overstated, but when people seriously claim that denying that the world was created in 6 days or that a Biblical Flood never occured means the rest of this work is therefore a lie, it is hard not to believe that many devout Christians think these are the only 2 choices available to them.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Raymond Brown (who is quoted in the article &amp; by me above) points out that it was the tradition for authors in the ancient world to publish their works under the name of their more famous (or authoritative) teachers, because they sincerely believed they were expounding their teacher's ideas &amp; opinions: for example, the Pastoral Epistles may not have been written by Paul, but they were written by people who knew him, &amp; thus at least some of the material comes from Paul. Of course, a view like this requires the student to think for her/himself, &amp; many students -- I believe out of a lack of confidence -- are unwilling to do so: thus the insistence that these works be labelled either authentic or forgeries. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:24, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for R Brown's argument, it could equally be said that it was written by people who didn't ever come within 1000 miles of Paul but who sincerely believed they were expounding his ideas (possibly due to schizophrenia, misplaced self-worth, or just plain old pious self-delusion), and consequently the Pastorals may not have been written by people who knew Paul, but by people who thought they did (or by people who deliberately lied). While R Brown's argument is interesting, its a bit of a damp squib - it doesn't really add anything; while it demonstrates that the epistles <i>might</i> have a connection to Paul even if not written by him directly, it also leaves wide open the possibility that they have none whatsoever.</p>
<p>More importantly, R Brown's argument doesn't address the substantial difference in theology between the Pastorals and the remainder; if someone else wrote it and it has noticeably different theology to the remainder, then occam's razor says that its more likely that it doesnt derive from the same writer as the rest, not even via people who knew him.</p>

<p><b>opening paragraph</b></p>
<p>"Nearly every modern scholar agrees that Paul was the author of the seven letters"</p>
<p>"but are disputed mainly by many scholars today"</p>
<p>"The authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews (which does not bear Paul's name) had been disputed in the early centuries of the church, and very few modern scholars (even conservatives) believe Paul to be its author"</p>
<p><b>Criteria used by scholars</b> "Scholars use a number of methods"</p>
<p>"However, scholars often disagree about how to weigh these criteria in a specific instance. For example, suppose two letters use similar vocabulary."</p>
<p><b>The undisputed epistles</b> "Almost every scholar, ancient and modern, conservative and liberal, attributes the following epistles to Paul:"</p>
<p>"Traditionally the Roman imprisonment was assumed, but recent scholars have suggested that Paul could have been briefly imprisoned during his time in Ephesus"</p>
<p>"Although Philemon has connections to Colossians, even those scholars who believe Colossians to be inauthentic accept that Philemon was written by Paul, because a forger would have had no motive to create this short, personal note with little theological import"</p>
<p><b>Colossians</b></p>
<p>"Some scholars consider that Colossians was not written by Paul. One group of arguments against Paul's authorship relate to differences in vocabulary and style."</p>
<p>"Other arguments rely on the polemical content of the letter, certain concepts, and false-teacher arguments, not expressed by other Christian writers until the end of the first century, making an appearance in Colossians."</p>
<p>"However, due to the apparent consideration of the letter as genuine by the author of the Ephesians, then those scholars who claim that if Colossians is forged, it is very early."</p>
<p>"Those who contest Paul's authorship claim that such parallels are merely due to a careful forger, deliberately introducing unnecessary additional greetings for the purpose of making the text appear more genuine. Scholars who advocate Paul's authorship point out that since Philemon was a personal letter, it is unlikely that it was as widely copied as Paul's more famous letters. So if a forger wanted Colossians to sound like Paul, argue supporters, why not include personal names from his more famous letters instead of names from a minor letter."</p>
<p><b>Recent arguments against Pauline Authorship</b></p>
<p>"More modern scholars point to a different author. Their arguments can be summarised into four main areas:"</p>
<p>"Strong evidence of the reliance on the authentic Pauline Epistle to the Colossians"</p>
<p>"Scholars know that Paul spent years in Ephesus building up the church there."</p>
<p><b>The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians</b> "Some scholars argue that it would be hypocritical for a pseudepigrapher to warn against forged letters (2:2),"</p>
<p><b>The Pastoral Epistles</b></p>
<p>"Beginning in the early 19th century, many German Biblical scholars began to question the traditional attribution of these letters to Paul".</p>
<p>"Some scholars claim that these offices could not have appeared during Paul's lifetime."</p>
<p>"Thus scholars of this view claim that the early church faced a serious threat from such teachers, as the prior epistles either supported or accepted their view, and thus the church fabricated the Pastoral Epistles to support their case."</p>
<p>"In the 19th century, Europe-based scholars claimed that the Pastoral Epistles must have been written in the late 2nd century. Today, scholars generally agree that these epistles were known by Polycarp and Ignatius of Antioch, and may have also been known by Clement of Rome."</p>
<p>"Regardless of the critical views of most scholars, conservatives"</p>
<p><b>Hebrews</b></p>
<p>"Most individuals, even strongly conservative and religious scholars, have rejected Pauline authorship of Hebrews"</p>

<p>I have attempted to rewrite the first section of the article and intro so as to include references and remove such words. Personally, I find the current state of the article embarrassing. Arguments were made with no reference at all, and sound almost whimsical. I hope this page gets its needed attention soon. I will try, but more and differing opinions are needed. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 14:32, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just read through the discussion page and wanted to express my appreciation for the efforts of the people involved to get to a high quality article. It seems to me that you have succeeded at least to some degree. This is a link to an article with a POV about the authorship that I enjoyed. If somebody felt there was some value they might consider adding it in as an external link. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/epistles.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/epistles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/epistles.html</a> I thought the Wikipedia article did a better job of covering most of the tobin's points though.

<p>The following has been deleted: "Regardless of the critical views of most scholars, conservatives continue to insist on the traditional view that the Pastoral Epistles were written by Paul." Is that not the essence of the conservative view, that the critical reading is dismissed in favor of the traditional attribution?

<p>The citation given is from a source that I do not believe meets the requirements of a "reliable source". To state that the citation covers "various scholars" seems misleading. I understand that there are probably seriously scholars who argue for genuineness, but I would seriously prefer a much more scholarly citation to support the claim. I was not trying to create a strawman, but instead have the wording accurately represent the citation. If we are going to cite Tekton, the POV needs to be qualified. Hope this explains the reasoning behind my edit, and hopefully inspires someone to find a more reliable source!--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 20:09, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not realize we were dealing with a source (that ref must be new). My apologies. The strawman I wish to avoid is as follows: the implicit claim that scholars hold X position, while only apologists (obviously based on religious preconceptions rather than scholarly work) think something else. In some cases, like new earth creationism vs evolution, this might be the case. But, when it comes to authorship of the pastorals, there are good reasons to think Paul wrote them, and other reasons to think he did not, and scholarship falls on both sides generally speaking. While there are apologists (particularly those who think that apostolic authorship is essential to inspiration) in the fray, there are just as many people with a different axe to grind against who join in the debate "on the other side". And besides that, the ivory tower of scholarship is not above such concerns and predispositions. Scholarly trends come and go, especially since criticism of the current view (whatever that may be at the time) is considered edgy, and in areas such as this were certainty is not possible based on available evidence this is more the case. I don't think we can place scholars into one group which agrees to have settled the matter of authorship of the Pastorals (Hebrews, for a counterexample, is a text where we can - really the only text in this article where we can); <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 06:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just so we aren't only citing Ehrman, I found this "...(3)All three Pastorals are pseudonymous, but II Tim was written not long after Paul's death as a farewell testament by someone who knew Paul's last days, so that the biographical details therein would be largerly historical, even if dramatized with some license. Titus and I Tim were written pseudonymously later, most likely towards the end of the 1st century, partly in imitation of II Tim. A "second career" was created. (4)All three Pastorals are pseudonymous, written in the order Titus, I-II Tim most likely towards the end of the 1st century. A "second career" was shapred (probably fictionally) for Paul with a second Roman imprisonment, so that he might speak final words about issues now troubling areas once evengelized by the apostle.... Although the majority of scholars favors a variant of (4), in my judgement (3) best meets some of the problems listed in Chapter 30 above in discussing the authorship of Titus and I Tim, and the implications of pseudeprigraphy."

<p>As for how we should present dissent among scholars, I feel that we should represent the majority view, and then have one sentence regarding minority views (instead of having a rebuttle to each statement).

<p>For history's sake, I have moved sentences that have been tagged for over a month to talk:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has even been theorized that Onesimus, the slave referred to in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philemon.html" title="Philemon">Philemon</a>, delivered both letters, and that <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philemon.html" title="Philemon">Philemon</a> was part of the Colossian church.</li>
<li>Attempts to resolve this issue whilst accounting for its undisputed Pauline theology produced the argument that the difference was due to Paul having been assisted, for example by Luke or <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_of_Rome_d1e2.html" title="Clement of Rome">Clement of Rome</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we still need a citation of the one tradition cited in antiquity for the so-called 'second career' of Paul.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:08, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If Brown just says there was 'one tradition cited in antiquity' without naming the source, it sounds like you would need to contact Brown directly to obtain that citation.

<p>I took a quick look through Brown, and the only relevant statement I could find was a footnote on page 672: "The first clear reference to a second imprisonment in Rome occurs early in the 4th century in Eusebius, EH 2.22.2." I didn't see anything relevant to anything being cited in antiquity on page 675. -- <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECat_Whisperer_fe2f.html" title="User:Cat Whisperer">Cat Whisperer</a> 17:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just took a look through Brown myself and found:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most scholars who accept Paul as the writer of Titus or at least the accuracy of the details given in Titus posit a "second career" for the apostle in the mid-60s dfuring which he was released frollowing this two-year captivity in Rome narrated in Acts 28:30 (AD 61-63) and went back east, namely to Crete, Ephesus, and Nicopolis. II Tim is brought into this theory to posit a terminus of Paul's second career in another ROman captivity and execution there in 65-67. (Sometimes the affirmation that Paul wore chains seven times (1 Clement 5:6) is invoked as evidence for this: yet Quinn contends that it stems simply from a count of the seven available NT works that emtniosn imprisonment...)</i> 641</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Paul's life situation pictured in Titus and 1 Tim, as we saw, could not be fitted into his "original career" known from Acts and the undisputed Pauline letters. Consequently in each case scholars posit a "second career" (actual or fictional) for Paul after his being released from the Roman captivity of 61-63</i>. 672</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I missed the footnote one 672. I removed the sentence from the article because Brown made it sound like the second career was a creation of modern scholars. Feel free to change the article.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 17:56, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is Eusebius:
<dl>
<dd><i>Festus was sent by Nero to be Felix's successor. Under him Paul, having made his defense, was sent bound to Rome Aristarchus was with him, whom he also somewhere in his epistles quite naturally calls his fellow-prisoner. And Luke, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles, brought his history to a close at this point, after stating that Paul spent two whole years at Rome as a prisoner at large, and preached the word of God without restraint. Thus after he had made his defense it is said that the apostle was sent again upon the ministry of preaching, and that upon coming to the same city a second time he suffered martyrdom. In this imprisonment he wrote his second epistle to Timothy, in which he mentions his first defense and his impending death.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Footnote <a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/footnote/fn13.htm#P1355_632717" class="external text" title="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/footnote/fn13.htm#P1355_632717" rel="nofollow">242</a> is also on topic.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 17:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If I'm not mistaken, the tradition is derived from 1 Clement:
<dl>
<dd><i>By reason of jealousy and strife Paul by his example pointed out the prize of patient endurance. After that he had been seven times in bonds, had been driven into exile, had been stoned, had preached in the East and in the West, he won the noble renown which was the reward of his faith, having taught righteousness unto the whole world and having reached the farthest bounds of the West; and when he had borne his testimony before the rulers, so he departed from the world and went unto the holy place, having been found a notable pattern of patient endurance.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Even so, Clement doesn't say explicitly that Paul had a second career. Some scholars argue that Clement, writing from Rome, means "Spain" when he says "the West". The idea of a second career, then, is a modern interpretation of an ancient tradition.</dd>
<dd>But I could be wrong. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 18:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
