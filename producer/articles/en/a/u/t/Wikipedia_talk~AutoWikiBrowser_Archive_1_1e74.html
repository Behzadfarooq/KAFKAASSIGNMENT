<h2><span class="mw-headline">AWB text reformatting clutters diffs</span></h2>
<p>Hi there AWB developers. I've noticed that AWB-assisted edits have a habit of reformatting wikitext in addition to the noted changes in the edit summaries. It would be nice if the reformatting were performed as a separate edit before the intended change (with an edit summary like "reformatting wikitext"). This would lead to much clearer diffs and a better reflection of what was actually done to the article. None of this applies, of course, if this behavior has changed in more recent versions or if what I have seen is a result of the AWB user's actions and not the software itself. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Dillon_10d0.html" title="User:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 16:34, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The edit summary is always "AWB-assisted" followed by a phrase of the user's choice. Therefore, it is the user who wrote the incorrect edit summary, not the AWB itself.&#160;â€”&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><big>M</big><small>ATHWIZ</small><big>20</big><small>20</small></a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><big>T</big><small>ALK</small></a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><big>C</big><small>ONTRIBS</small></a></sup> 22:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How is it "incorrect" if the user doesn't know it's happening or doing it intentionally? I don't have access to AWB since I have no Windows machine to run it, so I don't know if they see a diff before saving or if they have to request it just like on the primary web interface. Does a user really know that AWB realphabetized the categories? Is that an automatic behavior, or did the editor I observed do this intentionally and neglect to note it? Not to sound like I'm on a witch hunt or something, as the diff issue is a pretty minor inconvenience. I would say that AWB should strive toward being neutral on the original wikitext formatting, as far as possible. Reformatting is an excellent functionality to expose to the user by choice, but not if they aren't aware of it. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Dillon_10d0.html" title="User:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 03:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I noticed that tweak when I was reviewing the code for the first time, but I didn't know that was new recently. In addition, when I was reviewing the code, you seemed to use * and&#160;? differently than listed at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regex.html" title="Regex">Regex</a>. The article says&#160;? matches 0 or 1 recurrences of the character, and * 0 or more, but somewhere, you used a *?. This leads me to believe that, in C#, * means 1 or more, the equivalent of + in most systems. Is this correct?&#160;â€”&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><big>M</big><small>ATHWIZ</small><big>20</big><small>20</small></a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><big>T</big><small>ALK</small></a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><big>C</big><small>ONTRIBS</small></a></sup> 20:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The *? is a single regex atom. It means 0 or more, but it says to use <i>stingy matching</i> instead of the default <i>greedy matching</i> of *. Unfortunately, the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regex.html" title="Regex">Regex</a> article doesn't address greediness, but basically, a greedy regex will match as match characters as possible until it fails, while a stingy regex will match only until the atom that follows can match. There is a better explanation of greediness in <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/chapter/ch04.html" class="external text" title="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/chapter/ch04.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter 4</a> of the canonical <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i> (search for "greedy" in the text). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Dillon_10d0.html" title="User:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 03:23, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another thing that should be added is the ability to change categories with a modifier after them, for example {{Category:Wikipedians in the United States|Jtkiefer}} The way AWB currently handles them if you tried to change them over to say {{Category:Wikipedians}} or {{Category:Wikipedians|Jtkiefer}} I'd end up with something like {{category|Jtkiefer}} which causes problems and which is an unusable category. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 23:41, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Open Source</span></h2>
<p>Due to the recent success of Firefox, OpenOffice, and other open source programs, I was wondering what the general consensus would be on making the AWB open source. I could release the source code and then make a page, maybe Wikipedia talk:AutoWikiBrowser/Open source, where anyone could request features, and developers could post code. If I implemented such a plan, I would also make available to developers an extensive list of the changes in each version of the AWB. Any ideas?&#160;â€”&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><big>M</big><small>ATHWIZ</small><big>20</big><small>20</small></a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><big>T</big><small>ALK</small></a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><big>C</big><small>ONTRIBS</small></a></sup> 23:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At the moment we make people register to avoid anyone abusing the software, being completely open would make that impossible, any features can be requested here, it would be cool to have more people developing it though. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 23:52, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Abuse how? It's software for editing a wiki. Hardly revolutionary. If anyone really wanted to make their own then they could do so. This thing should be open source as should anything to do with the wiki (MediaWiki, etc).

<dd>Hmm. Just a very rough idea: would it be possible to keep a core part closed and make the rest open source? That core part would be released in binary as we have now and the rest would be open. After all, it's .NET&#160;:-) --Adrian Buehlmann 22:29, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Of course it's up to the authors, but my vote is to open up the source.. security through obscurity really isn't that effective, and it's not that hard for someone to write a vandalbot on their own. It is also not that difficult to decompile and modify MSIL code, so someone with some .NET knowledge could bypass the registration check. Great software by the way, I just used it in order to subst a template which has been deleted.. now I just need to re-learn regexes, it's been a while since I've used them. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 20:14, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is that this software would make high speed vandalism available to all, yes it is obviously possible that someone with a lot of spare time and decent programming skills could make their own vandal bot, but it is unrealistic. Also, consider that 1 person has already been removed form the check page for being reckless with it. Plus I am - prepare to be shocked - not a big fan of open source software in general, and the system that we have at the moment has been very successful in rapidly developing the program. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 21:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not a fan of open source? The Washington Post had an interesting article today, which basically stated that flaws in open source software are fixed 60% more quickly on average than those in closed source software. (With the AWB, all fixes are quick. The article was about profession software, for example, Firefox, all of Microsoft's programs, etc.) Anyways, if anyone wants the <i>closed source</i> code, all you have to do is ask Martin and he'll happily give it to you. Unless you become some crazed lunatic vandal, of course. The only reason it's not open source is because there are crazed lunatic vandals out there, and keeping the code confined to people whom Martin trusts prevents them from getting their hands on it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Bluemoose" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Bluemoose" rel="nofollow">E-mail Martin</a> and ask for him to e-mail you the code, and then just e-mail him the code back if you make any changes. It's as simple as that. Martin's always quick to respond to his e-mails (no matter what the time zone discrepancy may be). --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">2020</font></a> 22:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feature requests</span></h2>
<p>I have two requests. Every now and then I notice the alert about a long article having stub status. Could there be a button (or something) that would quickly remove all the stub templates. I hate scrolling through the text and finding it.</p>
<p>Secondly, this tool is works wonderfully with fixing typos. I imagine it could do the same for disambiguating pages, but I'm really not sure how it would work. The idea I have is somehow a the program receives the different terms from the user (which he collected from the disambiguation page). After getting the list of pages linking to the DAB page, the user goes through each one. If it's the first term (say, pop music), he clicks on it (or maybe presses a hotkey) and the link changes to that term. Say <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop.html" title="Pop">pop</a> -&gt; <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a>. Clicking on option two (pop art) results in changing <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop.html" title="Pop">pop</a> -&gt; <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_art.html" title="Pop art">pop</a>. I hope I've explained myself alright, it's difficult to describe. Let me know if you have questions or any suggestions.

In addition, it will not fix links beginning with hTTP - I did this since, if you try [hTTp://www.google.com], Wikipedia does not recognize it as a link.

<p>Martin says (above) that AWB "is not broken, it's not even specifically designed for this task as you seem to suggest."</p>
<p>We have no way of knowing the intent of the author that it's specifically designed for any particular task.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <b>actual effect</b> of AWB is to mass de-link dates, and to mass de-alphabetize inter-wiki links. For example, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&amp;diff=33309692&amp;oldid=33301872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&amp;diff=33309692&amp;oldid=33301872" rel="nofollow">breakage of Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel&amp;diff=33177849&amp;oldid=33115679" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel&amp;diff=33177849&amp;oldid=33115679" rel="nofollow">breakage of Israel</a>. That's just two very high profile examples.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should assume that it's misused because of poor quality control by the program author (regardless of intent), and prohibit futher use.</p>

<dd>"Mass de-alphabetize inter-wiki links" is NOT an effect of the program. Spanish has the ISO code es. Esperanto has the ISO co eo. I see nothing about the behaviour of the program that indicates that it puts eo after es in a alphabet-based sort. The fact that you don't, or won't, understand how it is sorting things is another matter entirely. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 20:53, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe the confusion is that the original poster was referring to "alphabetization" of the resulting list of languages, not the underlying codes. The examples cited (<a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>) used a sort based on alphabetization of the Latin alphabet transliteration of the local language names, but they were changed by an editor using AWB to be alphabetical based on the ISO-esque Interwiki language code. Since there is no official policy on interwiki link ordering, it is up to the editors of an article to agree on one scheme or another. They are both culturally biased, but the faux alphabetization of local names is not really any more internationally saavy because the sort order is still derived from Western languages. There is no inherent reason that the sound "A" should come before "Z" and that isn't even the case for all the languages that actually <i>have</i> those sounds. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Dillon_10d0.html" title="User:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 21:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I beg to differ:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWB does not require every edit to be approved by the user. It makes dozens or hundreds of changes with only one approval.</li>
<li>For those who have difficulty reading the diffs that I provided, concentrate on a few things:
<ul>
<li>removing (previously correct) date links for 1948 and 1967 (and many others) in Israel.</li>
<li>re-sorting (previously correct) interwiki links so that "Esperanto" is alphabetized before "EspaÃ±ol" (in both diffs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are many such bad edits, prompting a firestorm of complaints.</li>
<li>If you made the software, you are responsible for its output, not the poor sap that used it assuming that the rules it followed conformed to consensus. There is no disclaimer of warranty in this venue.</li>
<li>Finally, the argument concerning intent is pretty standard in the legal domain, and I'm sorry that's too esoteric for many to understand. Here's the short version:
<ul>
<li>The intent doesn't matter, and is not an element to prove.</li>
<li>The actual results are enough to indict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please cease and desist using AWB until its results are tested and proven to conform to consensus.</p>

<dd>(Thanks again Sean) William, you are simply wrong; <b>every</b> edit is checked by the user, if you have a problem with people removing dates then take it up with them, as long as it is a guidline it will be an option in the software.

<dl>
<dd>Rather, the user is <i>prompted</i> to check every edit. This is a very different thing; you can't enforce an actual check in code. And if someone's making a change every two or three seconds, he's spending much more time waiting for the page to load than looking at what he's actually doing. I recall one article where an AWB-assisted edit changed "May 9th, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>" into "<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">May 9</a>, 1955" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kermit_the_Frog&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32753842" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kermit_the_Frog&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32753842" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, correctly fixing and linking the non-functional date, but incorrectly unlinking the year; it's hard to argue that this edit was sufficiently "checked".
<p>My own bot has a function to convert old cut-and-pasted tables into invocations of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Template%7EAlbum_infobox_4665.html" title="Template:Album infobox">Template:Album infobox</a>. Because of all the crazy things folks have done with the formatting between the paste and my conversion, the function can't be 100% accurate, so I check every edit (in raw wikicode) before it's posted. Regardless, I still run it at the normal 30-second throttle, because <i>the bot, not me, is doing most of the work</i>. AWB should enforce a timeout as well. â€”<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 03:46, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it be possible to make a feature that would help AfD artciles? When I'm going through the articles needing cleanup I find the need to AfD some of them, but I don't want to stop very long or switch browsers to do that. I'd imagine that it would (after pressing a button) subst in the template then take you to the next page where you could write the summary and finaly takes you to the daily page to subst in the deletion page. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 15:12, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguation tools</span></h2>
<p>I just started using AWB today to do some disambiguation link repair. I don't have a lot of suggestions ye but figured I would add them here as I think of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing creation of a custom list of Edit Summary's that can be changed for each page without having to re-click start. I like to include what I actually disambuated in the edit summary so that a) someone who looks at the history does not have to do a diff to see what I did and b) so I can look at the work for a single disambiuation page and get a feel for how many links are going to which articles. I usually do something like <b>disambiguation link repair (<a href="../../../d/p/l/WP%7EDPL_c093.html" title="WP:DPL">You can help!</a>) <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Provinces_3b27.html" title="United Provinces">United Provinces</a> to <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Republic_6e56.html" title="Dutch Republic">Dutch Republic</a></b> but with a diffrent target article depending on what I did. It woudl also be good if you coudl apply the text from the dropdown then edit it for the given instance to add for example <b>two links</b>. In anyevent the edit summary is I think a good first step for doing DAB work with AWB.</li>
<li>A lot harder to implement would be allowing the find and replace to specify multiple replace with strings which the user woudl be prompted for each instance. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 04:38, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Add a filter to the list like the one that removes links outside of the main namespace to remove or select links via redirects. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 05:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AWB editing speed</span></h2>
<p>Martin, one of the rules for the AWB is "Don't edit too fast." What do you consider "too fast"? I noticed that you routinely crank out edits at five or so per minute, yet <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">User:Talrias</a> blocked <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">User:Bobblewik</a> on 29 Dec for editing the same amount, saying it was not possible. Is that speed acceptable?

<dd>I would be interested in the answer to this. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">User:Talrias</a> blocked me again today &lt;sigh&gt;. So if I go quiet again, either it has happened again or I have given up in disgust again. This problem is inherent in being a janitor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If people with blocking powers are using speed as justification then artificial speed reduction might be deal with the symptom, if not the disease. I do not know how I would target a particular edit speed. Is it possible to add a speed-brake at an acceptable rate, or a rate that could be modified by negotiation?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, I have been accused of being a bot in the past (e.g. on my talk page and elsewhere) because my manual edits are often fast. I think I have got up to 4 edits per minute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, a suggestion for increasing overall speed while keeping individual speed low might be to share tasks. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 22:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Too fast" depends on what you are doing, so some kind of throttle becomes useless, plus people doing disambig'ing etc. frequently edit just as fast. I havent been using my bot account because it is flagged and wont appear in recent changes, I probably should make a seperate bot account though.

<dd>(originally a reply to bobblewik, now down here after EC) In deleting categories that are about to be deleted from articles, it is not uncommon for me to open 10 or 20 tabs so I can go up and down the line with my cuts. While I did a bunch of stuff this morning with little heed to my speed, I am not sure that awb made me any faster than my multitabbed method. It just made me more efficient (well, until I broke someone's complex italicizing on an article or two). In fact I just checked and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Syrthiss&amp;offset=20060115135619&amp;limit=50" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Syrthiss&amp;offset=20060115135619&amp;limit=50" rel="nofollow">here</a> is my multitabs where I was doing 6 per minute, which is comparable to my awb speed this morning (on the first page or two of my most recent contributions). --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 22:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problems are; you havent been checking edits properly, your edit summaries are misleading sometimes and you have made very minor edits (which the main page specifically says not to do). If you come across a page where the task your are performing isnt necessary (i.e. you are fixing %s, but the page contains none) and/or the only edit it is making is very minor, then just ignore it. Also, err on the side of caution. May I also recommend that you generate a list of pages that definately need something fixed, such as a common typo (I can do that for you from the data dump if you want), because that way you won't come accross too many pages that should be ignored. If you are happy with <i>all</i> that then I am happy for you to comtinue using the software.

<dd>I see that. I read it a while back but it clearly did not sink in. That must be because I find it easier to remember things that seem rational and harder to remember things that do not. My simple view of the world has been than a small improvement is better than no improvement. Unless my memory is playing tricks on me, there is encouragement for editors to improve articles in any way they can. I do recall seeing instances whereby my chosen edit did not appear but I chose to go ahead on that basis. I could easily have turned off the 'general fix option'. Believe me, I wish I had. It would even have made my work faster. I still do not understand why small improvements are a bad thing but I won't forget the constraint now.</dd>

<dd>As far as misleading summaries are concerned, I usually attribute that term to a claim of <i>Doing X and Y</i> when it does A and B, or X and A. In my case, the summary said <i>Doing X. Y.</i> and the complaint was that it merely did X. Actually, it sometimes did X only, sometimes Y only, sometimes X+Y together. So perhaps it should have said <i>Doing X and/or Y</i>. Ironically, the very specific summary was added in response to a request for more detail by Talrias. I do not like being blocked by him so I took his request quite literally and probably gave too much detail.</dd>

That would mean I could be sure all my edits are a targetted 'hit' and may also have the benefit of the general fixes. The current situation means I now have a very strong incentive to turn general fixes off for all edits whereas I have only a very weak incentive, if any, to keep general fixes on.</dd>

<dd>Now, enough of that negative stuff and onto the positive. My aim was to bring the many instances of 'x percent' and 'x per cent' into line with MoS guidance which says digits should be paired with '%'. I used Google to find them, but if there is a way to probe a database dump, that would be much better. Just to confirm my knowledge of the rules: small edits are bad; summaries should not exceed the actual edits. If I am still persona non-grata, then that would be a shame but there is not much I can do about it. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 02:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your tone has grown slightly caustic. The point is, all your edits have some cost. Server time, wasted time of people checking RC (shouldn't that edit have been marked 'minor'?), filling up the edit history, etc. Removing that line changed the article in no way. You're supposed to ignore trivial cases because they are trivial (and should be done in conjunction with worthwhile edits, not as their own entities). If you haven't the time to change the edit summary while editing you are going too fast (unregistered bots, even manual ones, are supposed to go slower than one edit every 30 sec) and I doubt you are actualy sufficiently reviewing the edits. I agree, you shouldn't be using the bot for a while. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 04:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is difficult for anyone to detect tone in text. To the extent that 'tone' is apparent, it frequently looks worse than intended. So do not judge me please. I have no idea about server time or what RC is. All I know about is that articles have a lot of rubbish in them. I was trying to fix percentages in line with MoS guidance. I succeeded in that task and thousands of instances of percent are better for it. That seems to me to be a good thing, not a bad thing.</dd>

My limited understanding of computers is that extra code on a page is wasteful of something. I have already explained the reason for the same summary but if you missed it, the reason it remained as <i>Doing X. Y.</i> is because it was indeed doing X or doing Y, or both.</dd>

<dd>We're not being your enemy, just trying to help wikipedia and help you help wikipedia. Extra code on a page is wasteful to some extent, but because each and every edit is saved in the history, it will just use space on Wikipedia's servers anyway. No idea how much they've actually got, but it must be some huge amount. A larger problem is the server time though. By that we mean the time the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers" class="extiw" title="m:Wikimedia_servers">Wikipedia servers</a> take to make the page up and send it to you - something that is costly in such large quantities (as one of the most popular sites on the internet), and the main reason why Wikipedia asks for donations. And by RC, brokensegue meant <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Recent Changes</a>, a page which lists all the recent changes made to wikipedia. People check it and might look at the edits only to find that a space has been added in a place that makes no difference to the actual article. Same goes for the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Special%7EWatchlist_0b89.html" title="Special:Watchlist">Watchlist</a>.</dd>

<p>(indent) The point of the "general fixes" is simply that while you are fixing something such as a common typo, re-categorising or something, that it also makes other minor changes at the same time, as a rule of thumb, if a change doesnt actually affect the look of an article, then don't make it. Also, you will be pleased to hear that the software <i>does</i> have the feature you mention, the "ignore if doesnt contain" is very helpful as it will automatically skip any pages that do not contain what ever the problem is you are fixing. As for your rules; small edits are good, but not if the total edit is insignificant, edits can exceed the edit summary (but not by anything significant), this might sound strange to write, but the vast majority of edits ever made exceeds the summary in some way, just don't let them be misleading, (I think this problem will be solved naturally if you skip pages that dont contain the mistake you are fixing) thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 10:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Well, Martin recently developed a <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_DataBaseSearchTool_46e0.html" title="User:Bluemoose/DataBaseSearchTool">database dump search tool</a>. Either you can download and run it or ask Martin to scan the dump for the regex "per ?cent". That way, your fixes would be targeted to articles which (as of the last dump) contained percent or per cent, not all articles returned by a Google search of percent. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="yellow">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">2020</font></a> 21:52, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Is there any way for telling the AWB not to change (by default) a given piece of text? In two different revisions, two editors have removed a lone underscore that was instead necessary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35736037" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35736037" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&amp;diff=35147833&amp;oldid=35032768" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&amp;diff=35147833&amp;oldid=35032768" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> . Another editor has found the solution of replacing it with the HTML code "&amp;#95", but I am not convinced that the AWB will not delete it again. Having some way for telling the AWB not to change a given piece of text (or, at least, making it alerting the user that that piece of text is not to be changed automatically) would solve the problem.

<dl>
<dd>It does have a way of telling the editor what not to change, as it shows them exactly what it has done before it commits anything, unfortunately, as discussed above, Bobblewik has been less than thorough in checking, and for that reason is not able to use the software at the moment. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For this particular change, AWB should know not to remove underscores from the right-hand side of the pipe. In other words, given <code>[[A_B|C_D]]</code>, AWB should transform this to <code>[[A B|C_D]]</code>.

<dd>What the script does is it takes every link and, if it does not contain ":" and it does not begin with "[[_" (my script lacked these components, which is why it wasn't used), then it replaces all "_" with " ". I tried to get it to split the link at "|" but I couldn't get it to work. So, I guess, there is no fix. (It also tries to make [[Bracket|&lt;nowiki&gt;[]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; into [[Bracket|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.) Editors will just be forced to double check every edit before saving - then again, since everyone is <i>supposed</i> to be doing that anyways, there is no problem here.

<dd>Just a side question: As Netoholic points out to me on my talk this seems to be a common case to be carefully considered at least in respect to template calls. Is there any consensus how to write template calls? Is it normal that calls to templates are written at random with underscores or spaces? --Adrian Buehlmann 22:06, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Underscores are seen as spaces, so replacing them with spaces makes no difference to how templates etc. are displayed. They are removed simply because they are unnessecary mess. It does say on the project page not to make very minor edits for this reason. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:17, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok thanks. I had that "unnecessary mess" feeling too and thought that while I'm cycling through the calls of Infobox Film I could clean up that in the same run. I have clarified that on the project page that this also accounts under "extremly minor edit". Thanks. --Adrian Buehlmann 22:39, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe there should be a rule which searches if a link in the page in question leads to the underscore page. At least the odds of encountering such a problem again would be slashed. Although, any page which relies on underscores (any page which deals with game map topics springs to mind) will be an issue in the future. Being a statistical guy, right now there are 930,000 articles on Wikipedia, and there are probably at least 1000 pages which contain links which rely on underscores. Therefore, in an even edit spread, there's a 1/1000 probability that AWB edits a page incorrectly. Realistic odds are much longer but the 1/1000 is still too high to ignore.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Atkinson_6895.html" title="User:Dan Atkinson">Dan</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan_Atkinson_f691.html" title="User talk:Dan Atkinson">(Talk)</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Dan_Atkinson_a439.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Dan Atkinson">@</a></sup> 21:51, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Virually all those links to <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underscore.html" title="Underscore">underscore</a> do not actually contain an underscore, I'll make it so it ignores links that actually contain the word "underscore" though anyway. Plus no links rely on underscores, as they are seen as whitespace, a few links start with an underscore, but it ignores them already (such as <a href="../../../n/s/a/NSAKEY_05ad.html" title="NSAKEY">_NSAKEY</a>, but as you can see the underscore isn't actually part of the name for technical reasons). Plus AWB is not automatic, so it shouldnt matter anyway. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I had already seen the discussion on the AWB in the village pump, and I agree that the user is responsible for all changes. I suggested that the AWB could alert the user to more careful than usual when changing some pieces of text, but I consider that a suggested <i>improvement</i> for the AWB, rather than a fix. Not having any idea of how long would that take to be implemented, however, I don't know if the effort of realizing this improvement can be worthy. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 11:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True enough. I was wondering though if you coudl add a feature to add a category to articles if they do not already have it. I was using AWB today to add <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_Romania_47af.html" title="Category:Cities in Romania">Category:Cities in Romania</a> to all of the cities listed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Romania_%28alphabetical%29_938c.html" title="List of cities in Romania (alphabetical)">List of cities in Romania (alphabetical)</a> and there did not seem to be an easy way to do it. Some of them needed other Categories added too so just pasting over and over did not work. FOr that task it looks like we can just at the category to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Template%7ERomanian_cities_infobox_ab38.html" title="Template:Romanian cities infobox">Template:Romanian cities infobox</a> but for the future it might be a worthwhile feature. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 09:51, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know I'm evil (and greedy and possibly stupid :-): Could AWB be extended so that <i>mutilple</i> regex replace actions could be entered and executed in the same run (a list of search/replace fields)?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm on a totally wrong track, so I try to explain what I want to do: The underlying problem I'm thinking about to solve is changing calls to templates that need renames in parameters. Specific example job I'm about to do: <a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">template:Web reference</a> supports an old variant that used uppercase/lowercase in parameter names. I'm thinking about changing these to the new lowercase only parameters variant.</p>
<p>Reason for this (sorry for my verbosity): Web reference is currently a meta template and I'm trying to convert that to using the new CSS-Trick of Netoholic. I have problems to do that supporting both kinds of parameter sets, so I'm thinking about switching calls to the lowercase only parameters variant.</p>

<dd>However it happened, it seems that the changes are still not being reviewed in the latest round of the war on date links. In the Google edit cited above, [[January]] [[18]], [[2006]] got stripped of the brackets, rather than fixing it for the date prefs to work (manually removing the two middle brackets is all that is required). The malformed Dec 22, [[2005]] was handled in the same way.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yet another bug</span></h2>
<p>I'm not good at filing bug reports, so I'll just describe step by step how to reproduce this bug and leave the brilliant prose for featured articles... <tt>:-)</tt></p>
<ol>
<li>Opened AWB, started process.</li>
<li>While waiting for pages to load, opened MSN messenger, started to chat.</li>
<li>At the same moment when page finished loading in AWB, a carriage return ("enter") would be sent to my chat window.</li>
<li>Closed MSN, but then went to IRC using XChat. The same "carriage return" event happened, cutting sentences half-way.</li>
<li>If pages finished loading in AWB while Firefox was in focus, the last tab I opened with middle click would re-open in a new tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above happened enough times as to lead me to believe it wasn't just something I was doing wrong. It seems that AWB just wouldn't sit quiet in the background. I'm using the latest version of AWB (just downloaded it today) and I have no memory of this error happening before, so it might be interesting to have a look at this.

<dd>Really? When I use the AWB (which I haven't, unfortunately, been doing as much recently), I edit at about five pages per minute. To me, as long as I check each edit before submitting, I can go this fast. Each page loads in about five to eight seconds, so I can then spend seven to ten seconds scrolling through the changes window. If I see anything suspicious, I'll stop and investigate - otherwise, I'll submit. I see no reason why this technique should be criticized - sure, it's a lot of edits per minute, but they <i>are</i> each checked! --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">2020</font></a> 00:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument is circular. If there is no purpose to sorting them any way, why do you want to sort them at all? Obviously there *is* a purpose to sorting. It also helps editors to have a consistent sorting: for instance, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Category%7ETropical_cyclones_8c19.html" title="Category:Tropical cyclones">tropical cyclones</a> are categorized by basin, season, strength, and location, in that order. Keeping the order consistent lets editors see at a glance that there are the correct number of each category applied (1 basin, 1 season, 1 strength, 0 or more locations). Putting them into alphebetical order provides no additional benefit whatsoever. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 20:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The hurricane articles are sorted consistently. Of the 550+ articles, only a small fraction (those which have been changed by AWB or a bot) do not follow the same sorting rules. You are, of course, free to continue using the AWB sort feature - in most cases it is probably appropriate to do so. I am also free to keep fixing incorrect sortings, and to keep complaining.

<p>Not sure if I am doing this correctly so I'll just describe what I did.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to fix all the double redirects to a page I just moved.</li>
<li>I generated a list using the what links here feature and told it to replace <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_name.html" title="Article name">article name</a> with newname.</li>
<li>When the program went to edit a redirect it followed the redirects to the page (the on I just moved) and did the search and replace. Oc course there was nothing to replace since the article didn't link to itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a way to make it not follow redirects (or do what I'm trying to do)? Oh, by the way could you have it give out a warning if someone type in the category name as "Category:This category" because then it will look for "Category:Category:this category" which is almsot never what is intended.

<dd>Excellent. This would also be useful in doing a certain very routine type of stub-sorting task: where a stub category is being split into a number of sub-categories, where each each of those is already tagged by <i>another</i> stub-category (so the object is basically merger of (sets of) two existing patterns, e.g. {{<a href="../../../w/r/i/Template%7EWriter-stub_cd75.html" title="Template:Writer-stub">writer-stub</a>}} &amp; {{<a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-bio-stub_d3fe.html" title="Template:US-bio-stub">US-bio-stub</a>}} =&gt; {{<a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-writer-stub_98b1.html" title="Template:US-writer-stub">US-writer-stub</a>}}).</dd>
<dd>This is already doable in two passes, but that's obviously not ideal (more work, and even if set to auto-run, more server load and more RC spam). Another way would be if add/remove stub template support existed as with category at present (indeed, it's conceptually almost exactly the same thing, just inconveniently different in wiki-syntax).</dd>

<p>It would be great if AWB could recognise a subst'd AFD tag, and not suggest moving the Pages for deletion category to the bottom.

<p>It's nice to see the implementation of multiple find and replaces. Would it be possible to create multiline find and relplaces too? For example, when you set AWB to find a sub-heading and replace it with nothing, it normally leaves an extra unwanted gap (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abra_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38307178" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abra_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38307178" rel="nofollow">example</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bypass redirects and Skip articles</span></h2>
<p>AWB 1.8.1: If I have set "Bypass redirects" AWB does not edit the redirect page, it instead edits the target page of the redirect (superb so far). I have now set in "Skip articles" (on the "Set options tab") a regex expression in "Skip if doesn't contain". It seems to me that the skip expression is applied on the redirect page. I would rather expect that the skip expression is applied on the page that AWB edits, i.e. the target of the redirect if "Bypass redirects" is set. BTW an option that would "click ignore for me" if it is a null edit would be fine ("skip null edits"?). (Sorry for not using the newest version, I have just loaded a bunch of multi-regexes right now into a 1.8.1 instance of AWB and I am too lazy to reenter them into the newest version :-). And sorry for being so greedy on features. AWB is just such an wonderful thing :-) --Adrian Buehlmann 19:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bug when skipping unaltered articles</span></h2>
<p>If you have "Skip articles with no changes" set, then the "Preview" button acts like "Ignore". I can only assume that the dingus which checks for "no changes" is failing to spot any changes because these are not displayed when you do a "Preview". I note that this feature is disabled when you set "Preview instead of diff".</p>
<p>Might I suggest that the "Skip articles with no changes" should only actually perform the skip when you first land on the article and thereafter be disabled until the next article?

<dd>It also skips incorrectly if you suffer a failure loading the article up. This is not so helpful when you then have to go back and figure out which article you just skipped so you can try it again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Enabling of different versions</span></h2>
<p>Due to only the most recent version of the software being enabled, and being updated every few days, is it possible to enable multiple versions of the software, so that a particular download of the program lasts more than a few days, and then only require an update when a "major" update is made? The constant un-enabling of the different versions makes things quite difficult, as using AWB seems to require a new download practically every single time I use it.</p>
<p>A self-update feature in the program whereby it updates itself to the most recent version might make things less difficult as well.</p>

<dd>Not that I would want to speak for <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a>, but you might consider that AWB is still a development version and as such we â€“ as early users â€“ help to develop it by using it. As such I think the process that Martin uses (release often, release early) fits quite well. This also includes the early deprecation of older versions (it is good to use and test the new versions as they come out, as this helps improve the software too). This helps to make AWB strong and keep the workload for Martin as low as possible. I understand that this is a bit ugly for the users (me included!), but given the fact that the installation of AWB is trivial (just copy it in a directory) and that the settings can now be saved/loaded, I think we do Martin (and thus ourselves and Wikipedia) a favor if we do take the time to download the newer version before letting it go over articles. A new release each day is not that bad. --Adrian Buehlmann 07:35, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's right, but I accept the original point and will leave older versions enabled for longer. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 09:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't mind that older versions are disabled, but I would prefer that the check occurred at the "Make list" point and not after the "Start the process" button press. I know I can save the results and reload them, but it would be easier to switch to the new version if I didn't have to repopulate the article list. That's a small annoyance that I can live with though. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 15:17, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's because it bolds the first occurance of the title if it is near the very beginning of the article, other bold text does not occur at the beginning and the title is not bolded anywhere else in the article. The problems you point out are because I made a silly error in the code, I have uploaded 1.881 now, which fixes this. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 19:57, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
