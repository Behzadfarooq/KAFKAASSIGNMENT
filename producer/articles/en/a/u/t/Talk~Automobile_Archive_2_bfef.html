<p>the term "motor car" is more common in British English... well, not since about 1950. Angie86 04:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This will be a matter of varying personal opinion. "Motor car" is certainly a bit more formal and "posh" than "car", but is still widely used. "Automobile" just doesn't sound natural at all to this British English speaker; in the circles I talk in, at least, it'd be taken to be an American English word.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree - the word (or even it's shortened form 'Auto') just isn't used in British English. Motor Car would sound archaic to most people - although you do hear some London dialects using just "Motor" - as in "Is that a dodgy motor?" - meaning "Is it stolen?". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 17:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not wanting to stir up a hornet's nest, but I'm pretty unhappy with the whole definition of automobile we have here. Trucks and vans, whilst they can often carry passengers, are not "passenger vehicles", and so should be omitted – all the dictionary definitions I can find say an automobile is a <i>passenger</i> vehicle. It's also worth noting that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> defines an automobile as having <b>four</b> wheels. (See the final definition of the several in <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=automobile" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=automobile" rel="nofollow">this</a> dictionary entry.) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> |</sup></dd>

<dd>Well, I guess the Americans would have to speak out then. Perhaps the American standard is that the automobile is what the article says, and then we might just add a section explaining that it is an American term and how such vehicles are called in other countries. I am perfectly comfortable with the definition as we have it there now, so I believe if we find that it does not fit the name of the article, we need to change the name. The definition is OK. The only other phrase that comes to my mind is "motor vehicle", but aren't locomotives and airplanes motor vehicles?

<dd>Yeah, if we're talking about "common usage" then the American editors will obviously know best about how it's used. But those dictionary definitions are United States dictionaries, not English ones, so personally I'd like the article to make it clear that it's a broad definition of the term. Of course, we all know "Wikipedia is not a dictionary" but that doesn't mean it should contradict dictionaries!&#160;;) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 14:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But trucks and vans are fast becoming cars - a vast number of people here in Texas drive 'extended cab pickups' that have four seats and are used precisely as family cars - almost never carrying anything in the bed of the truck. Then there are these crossover vehicles that can be converted into either an SUV or a pickup truck bed - and the SUV is certainly merging with the 'car' into something in between. I think it's wrong to leave out SUV's and pickup trucks from the 'automobile' catagory. As for the Princeton definition of requireing four wheels - that leaves out an enormous class of three wheeled vehicles that you'd certainly have to define as 'cars'.

<dd>You should read the article rather than expecting one of us to spoon-feed you with an answer. You only have to glance at the first two paragraphs of the <b>History</b> section. Everything that everyone here knows about the subject is (of course) already in the article. The truth is that no one person invented the car.

<p>Responding to the request to place a photograph of an automobile at the beginning of the article—I chose one of the first four-wheeled model built by Karl Benz. The Velo model is not the original automobile for which he received the patent—which had three wheels—but it is the next version, closely resembling the original, and, the Velo is the model Karl Benz entered into the first automobile race. Therefore I felt it was appropriate as an honor of his invention, the beginning of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorsport.html" title="Motorsport">motorsport</a>, and more representative of most automobiles that followed. A photograph of the first Benz automobile, the 1885 Benz Motorwagen, already is placed near the photograph of the inventor, appropriately where it is visible while readers encounter its historical significance in the text.---- kb - 2006.05.07</p>

<p>Ther is now way that there are only 500 million cars with 220 million in the US. First off lets use logical estimates. Asia has about 3 billion- and the richer countries like japan, taiwan, korea, at least have 100 million cars. Plus china has an additional 25 million at minimum. Europe should have the same number of cars as the US has and South American should have a smiliar number also. There are at least 800 million cars world wide.<br />
I've removed the reference to the number of cars in the USA from the introduction. It makes sense to give the global total, but not for only one country. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 12:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the photographs, there are only American cars. Europe and Asia also produced some cars (I think quite early&#160;;-). So if someone has some photos of non-American cars lying around at home and is willing to donate them to Wikipedia, I'd be very pleased ... --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenogantner_31a3.html" title="User:Zenogantner">zeno</a> 00:52, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I fear you're mistaken. The picture at the top is clearly European about 1980 or so; as the the photos at the bottom, the first five cars are American but the next two are British, the third international (the Ford Focus). There follows an Australian car, two American and a Russian. There's definitely an American bias to them, but not exclusively. There aren't any Japanese cars there, though. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 05:29, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a quick extra comment - the selection of vehicles in the photo collection seems somwhat surreal to be honest - would it be possible to add some more historically important or iconic vehicles? In my opion, an article about cars could could use photos of cars such as the VW Beetle, Rover Mini, Citreon 2CV, Model T Ford, Willys Jeep, Land Rover, VW Golf and Jaguar E-Type. Maybe someone could add to the list? There are already some pictures available in the wikipedia for some of these (see below ), I'm sure there are more too. Plus, they would look better in historical order (IMHO). unless anyone has a reason for the current selection I shall make a start in a couple of days. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkadruid_a9af.html" title="User:Akadruid">akaDruid</a> 15:46, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Be very careful, though, that any list of 'historically important' is not US-centric, UK-centric, Euro-centric, or whatever. It would be an easy trap to fall into. Though I guess that's what Wikipedia process is all about; if someone doesn't like it, they'll fix it.</dd>

<dd>Which brings about the question: what cars are in the international 'historically important' list? Most of yours above are probably in there, though I'd argue that the 2CV represents a long-lasting and popular dead end rather than being a vehicle that inspired many others, and that the E-Type, though famous and sexy, isn't really developmentally that big a deal. The Land Rover, though ubiquitous, started life as but a British Jeep and evolved in no shocking or landmark-making ways. Though it depends what criteria one uses, of course! I'm probably coming from a 'influential to other designs' direction in those criticisms. I don't think many would argue that the Model T, Jeep, Beetle, Mini and Golf were milestone cars, but there have to be others. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 16:32, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

While the Chryslers and Saturns may be nice cars in themselves, I don't know if they belong here. At the very least, I shall start by tidying it into a the order it was intended, then add some of the agreed pictures. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkadruid_a9af.html" title="User:Akadruid">akaDruid</a> 09:40, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, done the above. Layout much better, and added photos of: Model T, Jeep, Beetle, Mini, Golf. What else? Fiat 500? I would like to see the E-type there. It was more of a milestone within the sports car market, rather than the car industry as a whole, but I think it was a major shift in design, marketing and consumer expectations. Performance and handling were miles ahead of it's time. I think we should add some more important modern cars too - maybe the Renault Espace, Smart car? Neither very attractive cars in my book, but much more influential than the existing new car photos. What about an influential SUV too? I don't much about SUVs I'm afraid. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkadruid_a9af.html" title="User:Akadruid">akaDruid</a> 10:39, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "Pickup Truck" is a purely American and fairly inappropriate name. The catagory should probably be 'Utility vehicle'. Along those lines, in the opening sentance under "general" it describes a vehicle that is capable of off road travel as an SUV... This is not really accurate. It would be a truck or a utility vehicle that is preferable for off road travel. 210.50.30.22 11:44, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd disagree; as an Englishman (albeit living in the US now) -- the words 'pickup truck' are quite familiar to a resident of the UK also, and I suspect to most of the world. 'Utility vehicle' to a British or American reader tends to imply something that isn't a pickup bed truck, most likely a Land Rover or other kind of enclosed-bed off-roader. I assume you are living in a country neither the UK nor USA, since 'utility' tends to mean 'pickup truck' only in places like South Africa and Australia. The problem with replacing 'pickup truck' with 'utility vehicle' is that you are replacing a regional term recognised by maybe 70-80% of native English speakers with one recognised by only 20-30%. <i>Your</i> regional terminology should not be privileged above someone else's just because it's a non-US variant.</p>
<p>Instead, I'd like to ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>For what populations are the words 'pickup truck' incomprehensible?</li>
<li>Is there a term those populations would recognise that is ALSO recognisable by those who use the existing terminology, that's succinct and not a description? I have a strong suspicion that the answer to this is no.</li>
<li>Is it better to just add a parenthesised explanation after the link for those</li>
</ol>
<p>who don't recognise 'pickup truck'?</p>
<p>I do agree that the American use of 'truck', unadorned, to mean pickup trucks primarily is confusing to everyone else, and we shouldn't be doing it in articles not specifically about US topics. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 19:03, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>For what it's worth, "utility" is not in common usage here in South Africa. We have a bilingual term, originally from Afrikaans, which is "bakkie". This is used for the vast majority of cases when refering to, well, bakkies. Failing that, the next most common term for them is "LDV" - light delivery vehicle. Of course "bakkie" would be wholly unacceptable for the purposes of general classification here, but I thought I'd clear up the slight incorrect inference above. --196.2.127.9 9 July 2005 14:42 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i><b>Motorwagen</b></i> was the German term created by the inventor, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Benz_7c1b.html" title="Karl Benz">Karl Benz</a>, in the application for his patent for the first motorized passenger vehicle put into production. That German term translates into, a passenger vehicle with a motor that propels it. Although the word, automobile, also may be used as a compound adjective (in English, the word was used as a compound adjective derived from Greek and Latin roots in France during 1883), the term <i><b>automobile</b></i> is most often used in English as a simple, undivided, noun—first occurring around 1890 when it was coined to mean a passenger vehicle that "moves by itself"—in order to differentiate between ones that do not, and ones that do, carry their own source of power to move. There are lots of assumptions in this use considering that the definition of <i>life</i> includes movement by itself. People, horses, cats, fish, worms, and sunflowers (when they turn to follow the sunlight) are capable of movement, but do not contain a motor (which are inanimate creations by humans) to enable natural motion, nor are they passenger vehicles. A <i>mobile</i> is considered a thing that is designed so that it can move if it is stimulated by something else—such as a breeze or heat currents. It follows logically that a vehicle named an <i>automobile</i> is designed so it can move via power provided by itself. In 2006, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merriam_Webster_16db.html" title="Merriam Webster">Merriam Webster</a> defines the noun, automobile, as, "a usually four-wheeled automotive vehicle designed for passenger transportation".

<ul>
<li>Why not reopen discussion on the talk page first? This page DOES say you should try to reach consensus there first. There are a couple of problems with this move, the first being that a simple move is not appropriate. <i>Automobile</i> and <i>car</i> are not complete synonyms. <i>Automobile</i> refers to all self-propelled vehicles, technically; in actual usage, it refers to all classes of four-wheeled, self-propelled vehicles used for personal transportation, including <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickup_truck.html" title="Pickup truck">pickup trucks</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/v/SUV_9cd0.html" title="SUV">SUVs</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minivan.html" title="Minivan">minivans</a>/<a href="../../../m/p/v/MPV_4084.html" title="MPV">MPVs</a> as well as cars. Thus, a refactoring is needed to make an article at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a>, because <i>car</i> is a subset of the class <i>automobile</i>.</li>
<li>The second problem is that there are other meanings for 'car' which don't mean the four-wheeled personal transportation device, including the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad_car.html" title="Railroad car">railroad car</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolley_car.html" title="Trolley car">trolley car</a>, etc etc etc. <i>Automobile'</i>s virtue is that it IS an unambiguous term. This is a qualified <b>slightly support</b> from me: I support it if you are willing to do a good amount of the work required to make this move really work. Otherwise, you're being an "idea person" and leaving the heavy lifting to others. I suspect that much of the content at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> could move to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a>, but a short article should be left at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 09:37, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>PS. characterising the previous debate as having 'no opposition' isn't quite the truth. Nobody supported keeping it at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a>, but the non-synonymous nature of the two words was recognised, and there was disagreement about where to move TO. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 09:41, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <b>oppose</b> for many of the reasons Morven put forward. Automobile includes all of the relevant vehicles, while car does not and could include non-relevant vehicles.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Morven laid down a pretty good case (despite his slight support for the move). Although, I would like to see <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> article discuss in detail more vehicle types than just the car and truck. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 21:40, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly oppose</b>. I'm not sure how Morven's argument gets him to "slightly support" the move, because the same thoughts lead me to the opposite conclusion. "Automobile" includes all the vehicles in question and is unambiguous; "car" is both narrower <i>and</i> ambiguous. Leave the article where it lies. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">Car</a> should be a disambig page. —<a href="../../../t/k/i/User%7ETkinias_6e4b.html" title="User:Tkinias">Tkinias</a> 21:50, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

The bulk of the article is about cars and every single illustration with the exception of the Jeep and the Hummer are recognisable as cars.

<ul>
<li>Note: Those opposing the move seem to be using the word "automobile" to have a meaning greater than the meaning of "car" which is unfamiliar to me, and also which is not borne out by the article itself.

<li>I've made a very small start, but in honesty the topic needs attention by somebody with far greater knowledge than I.

<li>Then propose a move to <b>motor vehicle</b> (I might support this), but <i>car</i> is grossly inaccurate when your article discusses a class of machines of which semi tractors are a part. <i>Automobile</i> is just as uncommon in colloquial American speech as it is in the U.K., but where accuracy is concerned no Subject I know would speak of "cars" when referring to lorries and vans. (In fact, just recently I heard a BBC reporter refer to "automobile manufacturer Peugot," so apparently the insidious Americanization conspiracy has infiltrated the highest echelons of British nationalism; in this case I think it's too late anyway, and expect to see you all driving SUVs by the end of the week.) <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustin_Hair_324b.html" title="User:Austin Hair"><i>ADH</i></a> (<a href="../../../a/u/s/User_talk%7EAustin_Hair_31c5.html" title="User talk:Austin Hair">t</a>&amp;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Austin_Hair_f978.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Austin Hair">m</a>) 23:56, Jan 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Both car, automobile and auto for short are used in English Canada. People speak equally of "car insurance" or "auto insurance" or "automobile insurance". There is no doubt that in common speech "car" is used more frequently, but as many have pointed out the word "car" has umpteen other meanings such as "street car", "elevator car". Motor vehicle is also broader than "car". Does anybody ever consult a dictionary nowadays?" The Ontario Highway Traffic Act, defines "motor vehicle" as including <b>an automobile, motorcycle, motor assisted bicycle unless otherwise indicated in this Act, and any other vehicle propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power, but does not include a street car, or other motor vehicles running only upon rails, or a motorized snow vehicle, traction engine, farm tractor, self-propelled implement of husbandry or road-building machine within the meaning of this Act</b>. As for the UK, I notice the main road associations are still called "Automobile Association" and "Royal Automobile Club", "British Automobile Racing Club". The abbreviation "auto" seems to be rarely used in the UK. "Car" is much preferred on the gov.uk websites. However, Motor vehicle is used quite a bit by the UK government --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentS_9f88.html" title="User:BrentS">BrentS</a> 01:01, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm looking at the phrase 'test drive' right now, which is presently pointing at a videogame. In looking for a disambiguation strategy I find that there seems to be nothing in Wikipedia about buying an auto (or other vehicle). Buying an auto is almost ritualistic in the United States and could make for an interesting article ... or an addition to this one.</p>
<p>Which would be better ... to add a section to this article or to start another? In the event of starting another, one might start a trend toward 'purchase' articles for other objects that have particular issues around buying them, such as homes, works of art, insurance policies, etc. That's why I hesitate to just 'do it' because it doesn't seem to be a place where Wikipedia has gone up to now.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that using 100% Bio-Diesel in modern diesel engines is actually not advisable. Mixtures up to 30-50% are no problem, but anyhting higher quickly becomes problematic. Modern common rail fuel injection systems need modifications in order to preheat the fuel and therefore reduce its viscosity, they need significantly stronger pumps and best would be a different set of injection nozzles ... All older diesel engines (80ies to mid 90s) can run with tiny modifications (the preheater) on nearly 100% Bio-Diesel without problem. These cars only experience a significantly higher wear of the fuel pump system, which usually fails fairly quickly. It is therefore very strongly advised for anybody seriously changing to bio-diesel, to have a spare injection pump system lying in the boot.</p>
<p>Must add a voice of agreement here. Bio-Diesel is not going to work very well without huge modifications to most modern diesels.</p>

Hey, how about a motorized unicycle!!!</p>
<p>The word "automobile" says nothing about the number of wheels. auto = self, mobile = moving. An automobile is a machine that moves under its own power, in other words. A (future) hovercar would still count, and have zero wheels. So yes, a motorcycle is an automobile, as would be a motorised unicycle. The problem is the term "automobile" as used by Americans and almost no-one else.

<dd>It's not just dangers to pedestrians and not just in the industrialised world. Car drivers are actually killed more often than pedestrians if memory serves me right. And although poor countries have fewer cars, they have their fair share of road kills (partly caused by more chaotic traffic I imagine). The total death toll of cars was 25 million according to a BBC documentary I saw a few years ago. To place this in perspective, in the US, cars take just a few months to equal the death toll of 9-11. And that's every few months. The article says a few things on the subject, but way too little given the gravity. And then there's nonsense like saying that alcohol and other drugs are a major factor. They only play a role in a few percent of the accidents, I believe. That's sort of like blaming something else and ignoring the real danger, which is that almost anyone is allowed to drive a car (after some relatively minor testing) even though it is basically heavy machinerey. If this were done in a company it would get some serious law suits for creating lethal conditions. But under less controlled circumstances (on the road) it is allowed, the obvious result of which is the huge death toll. Cars are the biggest death cause for young people (half the people killed are under 35 years old). At least in the Netherlands, and I assume the US won't be much different. There should be more figures, and not just at the end of the Safety section, but at the beginning. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 11:17, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone with the knowledge tidy up the history section? It seems to imply that the car was invented sometime in the 1880s, yet in the 'Internal Combustion Engine' (ICE)section it states that both Brown and Morey built cars powered by an ICE in the 1820s. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 12:33, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first internal combustion engines were static and <b>stationary</b>—they worked on a table, bench, or the floor—and were very limited in function. First attempts to create automobiles using internal combustion engines were not sucessful or, never repeated beyond the testing stage. They were crude attempts to adapt other devices into becoming automobiles. The vehicles you mention were never put into production and in fact, were put aside by the inventors. If they had been useful, that would not likey have happened. In 1878 Karl Benz began to design and patent engines that could be used to drive vehicles efficiently—and that also could support the engine and its fuel as well as carry passengers and their parcels. Several early versions were quite difficult to drive. <b>In 1885, Karl Benz designed and built the first automobile he could put into production. He was granted a patent on January 29, 1886 (for the automobile as a whole, not for the engine) and was already making them for sale.</b> Patents lapse if the invention is not built or produced within a specified period. Later in 1886, Daimler and Maybach built the first motorcycle that was driven any distance and tried to adapt a horse-drawn stagecoach into a motorized vehicle. They went on to design and build their first real automobile in 1889 which they could put up for sale. (Prior to Karl Benz's viable automobile there were many attempts to create vehicles that would move by themselves. Leonardo da Vinci envisioned it and experimented with the idea. People put early engines on boats, carts, wagons, and stagecoaches to try to convert them to mechanical drive, but the requirements for continuous operation are too demanding to be able to adapt makeshift attempts. Usually these beat themselves to death, being unable to withstand the violent mechanics. With inventions, often parallel technologies have to develop or discoveries have to be made before a giant step may occur) -- but of course, you knew all that! In the same fashion people state that the Indians of the New World never invented the wheel—when in fact, there are many examples of four-wheeled toys from the earliest cultures in the New World. Just because the principle was not applied to larger scale can not justify the statement, but it certainly describes the reality of transportation devices used, or rather, not used. Karl Benz continued to invent improvements in engine design. In 1896, Karl Benz was granted a patent for his design of the first boxer engine with horizontally-opposed pistons, a design in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead centre simultaneously, thus balancing each other with respect to momentum. Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly boxer engines and are also known as, horizontally-opposed engines. Today this design principle he patented continues to be used for high performance, automobile racing engines such as Porsches. ---- kb 2006.05.06</dd>

The automobile is an 18th century invention: How come there is no mention of the 1771 "Fardier" by Joseph Cugnot&#160;? ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FardierdeCugnot20050111.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FardierdeCugnot20050111.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FardierdeCugnot20050111.jpg</a> ) Same remark for the Amédée Bollée creations between 1873 and 1881( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bollee_mancel.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bollee_mancel.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bollee_mancel.jpg</a> and <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Boll%C3%A9e" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Boll%C3%A9e" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Boll%C3%A9e</a> ) Is it because they used steam instead of Beau-de-Rochas/Otto cycle&#160;? What about automobiles that use batteries, fuel-cells, solar power, Stirling engines&#160;? [O.R.]</p>
<dl>
<dd>O.R.: Early steam-powered vehicles, such as Cugnot's and those built by the Bollees (as well as those built in Britain, Austria, and Germany), were notable and innovative machines. However, they didn't initiate an industry the way IC-engined cars did. The early examples mentioned were few and far between, with not even a hint of series production. Even the steam-powered vehicles that did later enter production (Stanley, etc.) were overshadowed by IC-engined cars. Same with early electrics. The mass-production industry we know today was the product of the IC-engined car, the first production model being the Benz, which was Karl Benz's own design. There can be no question about this. The earlier examples of IC-engined vehicles, like Lenoir's, Marcus's, Delamare-Deboutteville's, etc., (1) weren't very successful (Lenoir's was heavy and slow, used lighting gas in heavy bottles, and broke down often; Marcus's had no seat and steering wheel and couldn't be controlled well; DD's vehicle's frame broke during the first trial; and all of the above and the others not mentioned were adaptations of horse carts, wheel barrows, and the like, and were cobbled together crudely, with no real design in mind), (2) didn't enter into production, and (3) were mostly unknown, and so didn't inspire anyone and no-one based their designs on them. That is why they can't be regarded as the ancestors of the modern car, innovative as they may have been. As I state in the main article, if none of those experiments had been conducted, the development of the automobile wouldn't have been retarded by so much as a moment, since Daimler and Benz knew nothing of them and didn't base any of their work on them, but all of the first cars that followed Benz and Daimler based their designs on those of the two Germans for a time. In a short time, improvements were made, especially in France, which took the lead in automotive design, and the rest is history.</dd>

Makes no sense to me and makes me realize how much would have to be redefined and rewritten to achieve such a mico-division. I would have to vote against the proposed move. ---- kb 2006.05.06</p>

<p><br />
I think somebody should write about the different kinds of engines:</p>
<p>-V shaped -L or in line engine -Rotary engine -H or Boxer engine -quasturbine engine -Flex fuel engine -and lets not forget the Hybrid engine</p>
<p>I'm sorry I couldn't write about them.</p>

<dd>You could try our article on <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_chase.html" title="Car chase">car chase</a> for a start. Beyond that, you might want to get hold of a special-edition DVD for movies that feature car chases. The director's commentry audio track, and the making-of advertising documentaries that they tack on, will often feature information about how the chase was filmed. Beyond <i>that</i>, there have periodically been articles in various magazines and newspapers about filming car chases. But to find them you need access to a library with a subscription to an electronic newspaper archive. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 04:18, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering the importanc of this article i thought it best to as for a consensus before making an edits to the opening paragraph.</p>
<p><b>From</b> An automobile is a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor. The word is mainly used in American English and Canadian English; in British English the term motor car is more commonly used.</p>
<p><b>To</b> An automobile or <i>car</i> in British English is a wheeled passenger vehicle that is self propelled using an onboard motor.</p>
<p>I ask if this or something along these lines is better as at the moment a automobile is anything that has a motor that onboard but could use another source of propollsion like a horse and can still be considered an automobile.</p>
<p>An i also simplified the whole use of car as i thought it went the long way around things and also have car in opening sentence allows us British people to know straight away that we have the correct page.</p>

<p>In one of the Dr. Z commercials Dr. Z says they invented the automobile but the article mentions Rivaz. Ok so maybe we need to be clearer about qualifiers. --<a href="../../../g/b/l/User%7EGbleem_11fe.html" title="User:Gbleem">Gbleem</a> 01:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"In 1806 François Isaac de Rivaz, a Swiss, designed the first internal combustion engine (sometimes abbreviated "ICE" today). He subsequently used it to develop the world's first vehicle to run on such an engine that used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen to generate energy. The design was not very successful, as was the case with the British inventor, Samuel Brown, and the American inventor, Samuel Morey, who produced vehicles powered by clumsy internal combustion engines about 1826."</p>
<p>The claim is also made that Benz invented the carburettor but the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carburetor.html" title="Carburetor">Carburetor</a> article says otherwise.

<p>I think this article needs major restructuring. It has a split personality - it can't decide whether it's going to be a 'gateway' to lots of other information about automobiles - or whether it's going to try to do the whole job by itself. IMHO, it should be the former...it should be light on text and heavy on links. To that end, I spent an alarming number of hours sweeping up all of the car parts articles (only about 1/3rd of them are correctly added to the AutoParts category), sorting them and tabulating them. More work of that nature remains to be done.</p>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>History</b> section is growing - and doing so in ways that sometimes contradict or expand on the main 'History of Automobiles' article. In my opinion, this whole section should be reduced to just a couple of paragraphs summarizing the history - with maybe one photograph. We don't want to have to maintain two completely separate articles on Automobile history - and we are rapidly heading in that direction. I believe we need to have a minimal amount of information for someone who just wants the 'cliff notes' version - and to strongly encourage people to read the main article.</li>
<li>The <b>Design</b> section has the opposite problem. It needs some modest expansion to a couple of paragraphs so that someone who only needs the briefest of introductions doesn't have to read the whole of the main article on that subject.</li>
<li>The <b>Alternative Fuels and Batteries</b> section again is too long - and just like <b>History</b> should devolve to the main article on that subject.</li>
<li>The <b>Economics</b> section is heavily biassed to a US market and to people driving a certain type of car. The ordered lists of cost of ownership is just nonsense for someone (like me) who owns a 40 year old car that's gaining value and a 2 year old car (a MINI Cooper) that's depreciating at about $500 a year. I'm going to <i>be bold</i> and move this entire section out to another article - it just doesn't work here - and it really needs a total rewrite to be more country-neutral and more carefully researched.</li>
<li>The <b>See also</b> section is a really ill-planned list of random links. Why is '<a href="../../../g/p/s/GPS_8c57.html" title="GPS">GPS</a>' there yet 'Car Engine' isn't? GPS has almost nothing to do with cars - Car Engine is a really obvious thing one should also read. This isn't just a list of stuff we tack thinks onto at random - it needs to be carefully planned. IMHO, there are hundreds to maybe thousands of other articles that relate to Automobiles - and the tabular approach that I've started to put together in the 'parts of cars' table is the only way to meaningfully organise this large article space for our readers. I intend to add more of those tables in the future - but tracking down all of the articles in a poorly catagorized space is very time consuming.</li>

<dd>Steve, thanks for beginning the discussion on that! This is going to be tough, as the topic is broad and not-that-well defined. First of all, the article begins with the statement that "an automobile is a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor". OK, but is a truck a passenger vehicle then? I'd say a truck is a kind of an automobile just as well as a bus is. So, we need to define the scope of the article (and perhaps then rename it accordingly):
<ul>
<li>only cars, vehicles designed to carry a limited number of passengers (how many, btw), or all motorized road vehicles?</li>
<li>only ICE vehicles, or all type of motorized vehicles, including electric and (!) steam road vehicles?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I am for the broadest meaning of the word "automobile" here, though given how it originated in the early years of combustion-engine powered vehicles (and, concurrently, electric road vehicles), we might describe all previous self-propelled road vehicles with only a few sentences in the history section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the important issues to be covered here are:
<ul>
<li>Basic principles - what is and what isn't an automobile, what types of automobiles there are, how are they used, how many automobiles there are etc. I can think of a map describing e.g. how many vehicles per person are there in given countries/regions.</li>
<li>History (obviously), in a limited form, and generalized (not US- or Western World-specific). rather than mentioning who designed the first tailfin, it would be important to show how the number of automobiles manufactured and operated throughout the world changed through the years.</li>
<li>Technical issues - what technical solutions are/were used in automobiles, including engines, drivelines, chassis details (suspension, axles etc.), bodies - basically all issues linked to in Steve's great two tables at the bottom of the article should be introduced in this way or another. Moreover, the links are currently oriented around modern, ICE vehicles, but the article needs to deal with more general issues, including historically-used solutions and technologies used in non-ICE automobiles.</li>
<li>Economic and sociological importance - this is a rather important topic, introducing such issues as passenger vehicle transport etc. I guess the "economics of car ownership" is a rather minor issue here, it can be linked this or another way from the body of the text, especially given the poor state the article is in now.</li>
<li>The future of the car is a very dangerous section which induces speculation and promoting of some ideas, concepts or products. I believe this can be dealt within the history section (if it was brought up to present years - the description of the current situation would include most trends that started to develop) and the technology section, regarding alternative and developing technologies. An appropriate balance should be struck - by no means should "future" or "alternative" technologies take up more space than current or historic. If needed, some additional articles might be created (though I think most of them already have their articles).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I believe the most important section, and thus one that should be the most developed, is the technology section. History and economic/sociological impact could be of more or less equal length IMHO. The introduction could be expanded, I think.

<dd>Dammit, I forgot about the automobile industry (broadly understood, i.e. including suppliers, cooperants and companies down the value chain, like dealers or fleet operators) and some notes on the production processes - these could be discussed within economics or perhaps in their own section, similar in size to history and economics. It might be hard to make the divide between industry, economics, technology and history though...

<dd>PS. Perhaps the industry section should be secondary to all other - issues should be introduced in them, and only expanded on or referenced to in the industry section? I wouldn't like, however, the history section to develop into "history of the automotive industry", as it is often written about.</dd>

<dd>Right - the issue of 'what is an automobile' is very tricky. I'm British - and it's a word we don't often use - but my understanding is always that it meant any vehicle that carried it's own means of propulsion onboard...so a pickup truck would certainly be an automobile. But then I don't think many Brit's would say that a railroad locomotive or a back-hoe or a ship was an automobile. The definition for me seems to be something like "a car or a pickup truck or a panel van or an SUV - but not a motorbike and not an 18 wheel truck.</dd>

<dd>We need to look at what new sections we need. The biggest gap seems to be that there is no overview saying "How a car works" that says stuff like "The engine drives the gearbox which drives the differential which drives the wheels." or "Fuel is pumped from the gas tank into the carburetor by the fuel pump - air is drawn in through the air filter and mixed with the gas as it's pulled into the cylinders - a spark burns the fuel and the gasses that creates pushes down on the cylinder before being pushed out of the exhaust pipe." You and I find that stuff so obvious that it doesn't need saying - but children coming here to write a 6th grade report on "The Car" may not.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think a section on motorsports is needed - perhaps something that says more about pollution and urban sprawl and such...maybe that should be in 'Economics &amp; Societal Impact'. The 'Future' section is tricky. We shouldn't be talking about anything that's not true yet. However, it would not be out of place to talk about research that's actually going on - designs that have been demonstrated...stuff like that.</dd>

<dd>I've been spending most of the afternoon trimming down some of the bloated sections in the article that are backed up by more expansive articles. The History section is next - but that's harder because much of it (but not all of it) is duplicated in the History of the Automobile article. What's amazing is when you look into a specific subject area (like 'brakes' for example) - you find a bunch of articles tagged with categories - so you can find them - but so many more <i>really</i> interesting subjects are written about - but not well categorized or widely linked to. Tracking those down is quite time-consuming - but also very rewarding - it's amazing the sheer breadth of information in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:26, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are absolutely right here! OK, with most of what you say - I would disagree with not including large trucks as automobiles. I would still define an automobile as a "road vehicle propelled by an on-board engine and at least three wheels", which includes both cars, buses and trucks of all kind. There is some problem with trikes and quads, but this is not meant to be a legal definition or anything&#160;:D Anyway, trucks are usually left aside when talking about automobiles, and I guess there needs to be a "branching out" done to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">van</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">truck</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> at some point (with those articles next in turn for attention of our WikiProject), but I wouldn't want to exclude any of them. Perhaps we need articles on both "car" and "automobile" and divide the content between them? (on consideration) What we need are a few good dictionary/encyclopedic definitions of "automobile", so that we stick to the lexical definition. We can then decide whether it fits the current article or whether it has to be split into car/automobile or expanded with buses, trucks etc.</dd>
<dd>As concerns the issues that I agree with you on completely&#160;:D The technology section should be formed along the lines of "how it works" obviously, not some technical guide only understandable for somebody who already knows the topic. I wouldn't delve into the peculiarities of the ICE too much, though, as not all automobiles are powered by them and there is a separate article (though a brief explanation of what happens inside the engine would of course be indispensible).</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, the wondrous "alternative" fuels and propulsion systems billed as "innovative" here are in most cases just as old or even older than the petroleum-fueled-internal-combustion engine-powered motor car concept itself, with it being the "alternative" vehicle for some time. I believe the article should clear that out and not follow the current fad of wowing those technologies as "innovative" and "new" - all should be described in appropriate sections of "how it works" and to some extent "history", with the latter perhaps mentioning how interest in those has risen in the recent years due to this and that.</dd>
<dd>The "future of" section absolutely has to go (and perhaps the article too), I hate those sections as they are a backdoor (or, should I say rather a major busy gateway) for all sorts of speculation and promotion of all kinds of everything. An encyclopedia does not deal with the future - perhaps it is a drawback, but still. If there is something actually going on, it can surely be described in the technology or history sections (the latter should end with something like "recent history", shouldn't it?)</dd>
<dd>I am not really into motorsports, so I completely forgot about it. There should be a section on it for sure, perhaps much smaller than the others, directing the users to different articles, but it definitely has an important place in this article. Depending on how the "impact" section would be written, it could be either a part or standalone - I can't make up my mind, as I can imagine different versions.</dd>
<dd>I really admire all the work you are doing. I am one lazy bum not contributing, but I don't really feel to well with such big tasks - I guess I am more of a "detailist" than "generalist", I like working on small details and smaller things, but I often get lost in the big picture. So, I am hoping that with your help the article will reach a manageable form and then we will be able to fill in the gaps and polish it. Perhaps it would be good to maintain a list of the issues that the article should cover/questions it should answer? All from me now, as I am getting sucked back into the mysterious world of the fabulous <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simca_Vedette_3ebf.html" title="Simca Vedette">Simca Vedette</a>&#160;:D Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 23:19, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The power of the driving motor varies from about 4 to 50 H. P. for ordinary vehicles, ranging from the run-about to the touring car, up to as high as 200 H. P. for specially built racing cars. Automobiles are also commonly, and generally in British usage, called motor cars.</i></li>
<li>Rhymezone: <i>Automobile: 4-wheeled motor vehicle; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine</i></li>
<li>Allwords.com: <i>Automobile: Motor car</i></li>
<li>The Colombia Encyclopedia: <i>Automobile: self-propelled vehicle used for travel on land. The term is commonly applied to a four-wheeled vehicle designed to carry two to six passengers and a limited amount of cargo, as contrasted with a truck, which is designed primarily for the transportation of goods and is constructed with larger and heavier parts, or a bus (or omnibus or coach), which is a large public conveyance designed to carry a large number of passengers and sometimes additionally small amounts of cargo.</i></li>
<li>Encarta - North American edition: <i>Automobile, self-propelled vehicle used primarily on public roads but adaptable to other surfaces. ... Automobiles are classified by size, style, number of doors, and intended use. The typical automobile, also called a car, auto, motorcar, and passenger car, has four wheels and can carry up to six people, including a driver.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>So - what should we conclude? I think by far the majority of those definitions agree that an automobile is a <i>car</i> - then define that as something that 'typically' has four wheels (so three wheeled cars aren't excluded but motorbikes pretty much are) - is self-propelled - and carries one to five (or two to six or ...) people (more or less excluding SUV's) - and also is <i>primarily</i> for passenger/personal transport - so excluding pickup trucks and panel vans.</p>
<p>From this, I'd say that the title section of this article has it about right and that we don't have to change a thing. An automobile is a "car". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SUV's are certainly borderline. Some of those definitions allowed for up to six passengers - which annoyingly covers some SUV's but not others. Other definitions don't impose a maximum number of people - but that can't be intentional since they don't appear to be trying to include Busses or Mini-busses with a dozen or so seats. In this decade, the border between cars and SUV's has blurred considerably - large hatchbacks, station wagons and mini-SUV's are pretty much identical things. Since there is no really bright line, I think we can leave this suitably vague - we can talk about SUV's if we feel the need. After all, we aren't going to exclude vehicles with more than 50 horsepower(!) or those that don't have an internal combustion engine - so we can't keep in line with all of those definitions. The main finding (I believe) is what we can safely exclude: motorbikes (definitely too few wheels), pickup trucks (not primarily designed for passenger transport), busses (designed for too many people), railroad locomotives (don't run on roads) golf carts and go-karts (not principally designed for road use) and horse-drawn carriages (not self-powered). What we normally think of as 'cars' get to stay - and we can feel reasonably comfortable with including such borderline cases as three wheeled cars, station wagons, smaller SUV's (with 6 proper seats but maybe 7 people if you squash them into bench seats), electric cars, stretched limos and so forth. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:19, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I totally agree. The opening paragraph needs editing, since it states that automobiles include trucks, pickups, motorcycles etc. I think the following needs to be removed: "Different types of automobiles include cars, buses, trucks, and vans. Some include motorcycles in the category, but cars are the most typical automobiles." <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 03:25, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh - yeah - one other thing. In reading/searching all of those dictionaries, I discovered a curious linguistic thing. Whilst it's pretty clear that 'Automobile' refers only to things we'd call 'Cars' - the word 'Automotive' appears to refer to all kinds of road vehicles - including busses, big trucks, etc. We may want to watch out for the implications of that. For example - we have two articles that sound like they should be merged - and which both contain a merge recommendation tag at the top: <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automotive_design.html" title="Automotive design">Automotive design</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_design.html" title="Automobile design">Automobile design</a>. Armed with our new dictionary definitions, we could reasonably argue that they should NOT be merged since the first should be talking about all kinds of road vehicle design - whilst the second should specialise in cars alone. Of course the articles aren't written that way - but maybe they should be? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Steve, you have done an absolutely stunning amount of research here! Still, I would be careful about "excluding" different vehicles here, as everything we exclude needs its own article written ab ovo, which can be hard without referring to this very article. I'd say a more "middle of the road" approach may be beneficial - saying that "the automobile" can be everything mentioned in the first paragraph now (or did you change it already?), but most commonly it refers to a passenger car. This way, we can describe some basics in this article, and will not have to repeat them for every kind of motor vehicle that is not a two-wheeler&#160;:D</dd>
<dd>I was also wondering about the definition of the "motor car", which might be a more "catch-all" phrase here (or perhaps I am wrong). My inclinations in this direction stem from the fact that the Polish equivalent, <i>"samochód"</i> (which is roughly a direct calque of "automobile") is usually defined as every road vehicle that is self-propelled and is not a motorcycle, which encompasses trucks <i>"samochód ciężarowy"</i>, buses etc. Such definition makes it easier to describe all kinds of motor vehicles related to the "automobile" described above. The articles on the <i>"samochód"</i> usually concentrate on passenger cars in the latter part, but thanks to the general description in the opening part, descriptions of trucks, buses, vans and whatnot can focus on the specific characteristics of those and do not have to delve into the history of the internal combustion engine and such.</dd>
<dd>I would also not exclude SUVs or even vehicles carrying more then 6 passengers, such as minivans. Or perhaps we just need to sort that all out when dealing with specific sections of the article. I guess we just need to make sure that related articles, such as <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">truck</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">van</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minivan.html" title="Minivan">minivan</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pick-up_truck.html" title="Pick-up truck">pick-up truck</a> etc. are compatible and "begin where this article ends".

<dd>Well, we can't lie about what an automobile is. That's just completely out of the question. I seriously doubt there is some compelling definition of automobile that I missed - given the body of well-respected dictionaries from both UK English and US English that I checked. If we want this article to cover a wider range of vehicles than just cars and (maybe) SUV's then we need to change it's title. It seems reasonable to me that this article needs to cover things like pickup trucks and small panel vans - but should it cover busses? 18 wheelers? Golf carts? Go karts? Motorbikes? Gasoline powered rollerskates? The problem is that once we widen the scope - where do we put the new cut-off? What snappy title do we use instead of "Automobile"&#160;? We can't go as wide as "Wheeled vehicle" because we'd pull in horse-and-cart, railroad locomotives and bicycles...which we definitely don't want. "Wheeled Road Vehicle" gets rid of railroads - but leaves us stuck with horse and cart and bicycles. "Self-powered wheeled road vehicle"...urgh!...this is starting to sound like "Just the things we want to talk about and not the things we don't."</dd>

<dd>Sadly, you are wrong about the word "Motorcar". It doesn't help. According to the many of the definitions I found, British English has the term "Automobile" and "Motorcar" as synonyms - so Motorcar also means "cars but not pickup trucks". In any case, "Motorcar" is a term that <b>NOBODY</b> uses anymore - not Americans, not Brits and probably not other English speakers either - British English speakers probably stopped using the word back in the 1930's or so. Everyone contracts it to "car" which brings us right back here. I'm a Brit (but I've lived in Texas for 14 years) - I would never consider using 'Motorcar' in speech or writing in either place - and even if I did, the meaning would be "Car...and maybe SUV" - just like "Automobile".</dd>

<dd>I think this rejection of 'motor car' is a mite too radical. I have seen the word 'motor car' in use much later than the 1930s or 1950s, which is the ridiculous assertion made by some in this talk page. I live overseas and don't have a lot of contact with English speakers, but I have seen it in written reports (written by an English-speaking colleague) in the 1990s. And as someone has pointed out, 'automobile' just doesn't cut it! As a technical term 'automobile' is probably the most internationally accepted term, but as for regarding it as a neutral, standard term for a car, there are too many people who don't accept 'automobile' as anything other than an Americanism.</dd>
<dd>If you do a search of UK, Australian, or South African Google, for instance, you will find the word 'motor car' still quite common, in very recent articles. The direction of change seems to be towards 'automobile' as the standard term, but the claim that 'motor car' is a totally outdated term that nobody now uses is completely false.</dd>

<dd>For what it's worth, (and as a native British English speaker) I agree that "motor car" is no more inclusive than "automobile", and no more appropriate for the project, but I also agree that rejection of "motor car" as an archaic term is too radical – and "sadly, wrong". I'd tend to say "car" but if being formal or "flowery" in my language, I'd be much more likely to say "motor car" and almost certainly wouldn't say "automobile"; that's just the way I've received the language. I'd <i>never</i> just say "auto", but it's not unheard of (especially in some regions of the UK) to say just "motor"! Anyway, this doesn't help move us forward, I just wanted to add to the weight of evidence behind "motor car" still being a current, valid term. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 13:26, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since we don't want to have to repeat a bunch of this stuff for trucks, busses, etc - we need to find a more inclusive title for this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You could list the classes of vehicle we want to talk about into the title: "Automobiles, Trucks and Busses" or something - redirecting to it from <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> of course. The problem is that if we change the scope we have a slightly strange boundary for the new article. Start thinking about golf-carts, motorbikes, powered bicycles...does the title need to mention every one of those in order to include them? Yuk!</li>
<li>We could try to write a title that described the definition of what we want "Wheeled, self-powered road vehicles with three or more wheels". This would almost certainly pull in things we didn't really want to include - and it's a really ugly title - but at least we can redirect to it from <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">Car</a>.</li>
<li>We could search for a better word - I'm not sure one exists. I should re-do my dictionary search for the word "Automotive" - that does seem to have a wider meaning (weirdly). Someone who designs busses would talk about himself as an "Automotive designer" - but he doesn't design "Automobiles".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So I guess I would vote for changing the article to Automotive technology or something - then in the first paragraph, listing the kinds of vehicle that comes under that term by defining "Automobile" as "cars and SUV's", "truck", "bus" and so on. Something like:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
 Automotive technology is a broad term that covers road and off-road
 self-powered vehicles that run on wheels or tracks - including automobiles,
 trucks, busses, motorbikes, tanks, golf carts, earth moving equipment, ....
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's a little ugly - but I'm sure someone with actual writing skills could polish it up into something readable. What that does is to dramatically INCREASE the scope of the article to include things we hadn't previously wanted to discuss (like motorbikes, back hoes, golf carts and tanks). Since I strongly desire to slim down the present article and make it more about links to other articles - we should have space to talk about all of these other kinds of Automotive Technology. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 14:41, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I understand your desire to rule out everything that is not a passenger car from the article, but I still feel that it would me much better to discuss the principles in this article and then move on to discussing passenger cars in detail and direct the users to specific articles on other types of related vehicles (I don't mean motorcycles and golf carts here, those have a pretty separate history and different characteristics).</dd>
<dd>Now you might find it annoying that I mention that, but the English Wikipedia has become much more than only "Wikipedia in English for UK, US and Aussie people", it is THE Wikipedia. I would guess there might be at least an equal number of people using English everyday in this way or another in countries where English is not an official language than where it is. For example, I would never use the Polish Wikipedia, and most of the people I know in Poland and other countries (who use Wikipedia, and most of the people I know and use the Internet as such do) would use the English Wikipedia in the first place, and when they would say "Wikipedia" they would mean this Wikipedia. Therefore, I believe that in general a quite open-minded and global approach should be adopted, especially when articles are dealing with such general and popular subjects as this one.</dd>
<dd>Browsing through Wikipedians which are available to me (in terms of lanuage), e.g. Polish, German and French, I found that corresponding articles mostly define the automobile quite broadly. A nice example from the German WP (approximate translation):</dd>

<dd>Gosh, seems like switching between languages hampered my English and lexical skills even further and I've come up with an absolutely horrendous monstrosity. Hoping that you can abstract from the wording and focus on the content, I would suggest a definition of similar meaning, which would clearly point out that the focus of the article would be passenger cars, but that other types of vehicles can also be deemed automobiles. As I said, I see the article giving an in-depth description of passenger cars, but not excluding other types of vehicles that can be seen as automobiles whenever they share important stuff in common (like early history or "how it works?").</dd>
<dd>Regarding your concerns about the inclusion of golf carts, we might add that <i>"recreational vehicles designed for transport on short distances, such as <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_cart.html" title="Golf cart">golf carts</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quad.html" title="Quad">quads</a> are deemed automobiles". As concerns the catch-all term, there is the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_vehicle.html" title="Motor vehicle">motor vehicle</a> (which we can, btw, use in the definition), which is much broader than any definition of the automobile I have heard of.</i></dd>
<dd>Anyway, we can go back to the definition later on, it is important how it is applied throughout the article. I guess the problem will pop out when editing most sections, and we will have to deal with that then - later we can alter the definition to reflect that. Once again, however, I would like to repeat that many people will come here expecting an article on something more than just a five-or-six seater on four wheels designed primarily to carry people.

<dd>I beg to differ with some of your statements, and I guess you contradicted yourself in a way (the last paragraph is the most significant for me). First of all, the dictionary is where exact meanings of words are established. An encyclopedia is where topics are discussed. While a dictionary has to stick to some strict rules regarding the meaning of words, an encyclopedic article might cross those boundaries. Look around, there are quite many articles that discuss much more (or less) than the dictionary meaning of a word. What is necessary is a good introduction explaining what is being meant by the word in the article and what the scope of the article is. It would also be good to direct people which are looking for things not discussed in the article that can be referred to by the same term to appropriate articles - which is why we have those neat disambig notices.</dd>
<dd>So, American English says one thing, the vernacular says other. And, regardless of your disdain towards non-native English speakers, "International English" is probably as popular as British or American English. Referring to "automobile" as something else than defined in this or other dictionary (some of the positions from your list I would consider more "reputable" also give slightly different definitions) is not inherently wrong in an encyclopedia. The encyclopedia should give answers on the issues people might refer to by a given word (especially if it is a "popular" encyclopedia like Wikipedia), even if it is lexically wrong.</dd>
<dd>So, the bottom line is that we do not have to change the title, just discuss (in a better way than I tried to do) which possible meanings of the word "automobile" are the subject of the article, perhaps emphasizing what the correct dictionary definitions of the word in English dictionaries are.

<dd>First let me clear up one point - I have absolutely no distain towards non-native English speakers. I am a non-native French speaker after all! But this is an encyclopedia for chrissakes - you have to have standards. Picking dialects of non-native speakers as the standard against which we measure our language is insane! But in any case - I'm very carefully not picking the dialect of any particular group of speakers...I'm using dictionary definitions.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I'm advocating renaming the article to more accurately describe what it contains. That won't confuse anyone or make it any harder to find because we'd have a redirect from <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> to whatever new title we might pick. This is all about the question of "What title would most accurately convey the contents of this article?" - and clearly, "Automobile" is the wrong word to choose if we're going to talk about a lot of other things that are not automobiles. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 20:26, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I am trying to say is that many people would mean many different things by the word "automobile". As this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary, I believe we need to cover the broader sense of the word, even if some auxilliary meanings will only be marginally featured, or perhaps the readers will be directed to the main articles. I believe that quite many people would be looking for information on the automobile in the broader sense. Even if it is against the American English dictionaries to describe the automobile in the broader sense, I think it is not unencyclopedic to adopt a broader definition for the sake of informing the user. Forgive for not making a detailed search, but I promise to give some examples where good encyclopedic articles here describe something different than what you might find in a dictionary.</dd>
<dd>What I am trying to say is that an encyclopedia DOES NOT have to follow dictionary definitions, but has to give answers people are looking for. If there are high chances that people would be looking for something under the word "automobile", we have to give it to them. And if a word has a different use in the vernacular (and it seems that it does have many different meanings to everybody) than in the dictionary, a popular encyclopedia like this one should follow the popular use and not the dictionary - perhaps noting which uses are lexically wrong.</dd>
<dd>Renaming the article to create some artificial construct existing only in this encyclopedia would be the worst thing to do. If anything, I would rather have the non-passenger-car content removed, as an encyclopedia DOES have to have an entry on the automobile. Perhaps to fend off further speculation, the article should be moved to "car", which I believe would be the most universal and popular word used to describe the passenger cars as you defined them above, with "automobile" redirecting to it. This will fend off any doubts about the scope of the article, as nobody would expect the article on "car" to describe buses or trucks. As a sidenote though I have to say that I am surprised that "<a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a>" does not contain any links to other (relatively unrelated) meanings of the word - I guess we would need a disambig notice directing to a disambig page at the top (for example for people looking for railway cars).

<p>(<i>deindenting</i>) My feeling is we'd be better off making this article about automobiles (i.e. basically just cars) and having an umbrella article (perhaps an expansion of the existing <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_vehicles.html" title="Motor vehicles">Motor vehicles</a>) that points to Automobile, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">Truck</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">Motorcycle</a> etc. One large article covering all these topics will get unwieldy quickly. As an analogy, look at the WikiProjectTrains article on <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locomotive.html" title="Locomotive">Locomotive</a> which is the "umbrella" article leading to separate articles on Steam Locomotive, Electric Locomotive etc. This seems like a good structure. I like the focus and clarity of keeping this article just about automobiles.

<dd>Well, my gut feeling tells me that lumping together motorcycles and all kinds of automobiles (let me abstain by the broader definition I am accustomed to) is not a good idea. They don't have THAT much common, whilst the blurry line between cars and trucks (Six-passenger SUV is an automobile, but a seven-passenger isn't? Is Honda Ridgeline an automobile? And how about Dodge Caravan?) would make it hard to make the divide between those two articles.</dd>
<dd>Besides, motor vehicles technically should encompass golf carts and other interesting stuff we might not want to discuss. So, we might run in trouble here. Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 21:53, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we're in agreement. I don't want motorcycles in the same article as cars. I'd like to see Motor Vehicles be a high-level introduction to automobiles, trucks, coaches, motorcycles, golf carts etc. The whole wide world of road vehicles (in fact maybe "Road Vehicles" is what that article should be called). Then the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobiles.html" title="Automobiles">Automobiles</a> article is just about non-commercial passenger carrying vehicles (so includes cars and SUVs). The <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">Truck</a> article is goods vehicles. The <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28vehicle%29.html" title="Coach (vehicle)">coach</a> article is commercial passenger carrying vehicles (everything from mini-busses up). The <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">Motorcycle</a> article is 2-wheel passenger carrying vehicles (maybe some three wheelers too). Maybe Recreational Vehicles is another article which includes golf carts to RVs? Military Vehicles could include tanks and armored cars. The exact boundaries need to be drawn and there will always be some fuzziness. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 22:04, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, what I am trying to say is that some of the so-called motor or road vehicles have a lot in common - cars, trucks, vans, pickups and buses/coaches. I believe that the automobile should be the top-level article for them, and since the automobile is most commonly used to describe cars themselves, the article should focus on the car, and branch out (perhaps that's not the right word, but I hope you'll get my idea) into articles on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">truck</a> or <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> at some point (I'd say <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28vehicle%29.html" title="Coach (vehicle)">coach</a>, understood as long-distance bus, would be a subtype of <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a>, so the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> article would branch out into that at some point), so that one would not have to go ab ovo, Benz, Daimler, combustion engine works that way, chassis is this thing etc. three times. The motorcycle, as well as military, special and "recreational" vehicles are quite different (can you show me the chassis of a motorcycle?), both in terms of history and technology (I know tanks etc. have chassis, but they are significantly different from car, truck and bus chassis).

<dd>SteveBaker, I do not agree with this concept. It violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> rules which state "A POV fork is an attempt to evade NPOV guidelines by creating a new article about a certain subject that is already treated in an article, often to avoid or highlight negative or positive viewpoints or facts. This is generally considered unacceptable. The generally accepted policy is that all facts and majority Points of View on a certain subject are treated in one article." I think that would be fair representation as as stated just under the POV fork section. "Once a proof has been presented and discussed elsewhere, however, it may be referenced." Thank you, but I am not convinced that the DS should be split from this article let alone even denied from this article. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 03:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OMG, this is insane! How can you push for one car to be specifically included in an article about the automobile in general and say that it's you who is fighting for NPOV?!? Do you want me to list all the other cars I consider revolutionary and push for them to be included? Those can even be more justifiable, as the DS, while unique and pioneering in many ways, did not really change the industry, as not many of its innovations were immediately adopted by other manufacturers, and some even never became popular. It is just a very important car, but this does not merit being described in the "Automobile" article rather than its own!</dd>

<p>I'm not happy.</p>
<p>I've analysed the last 1000 or so edits to this page...again.</p>
<p>Did the 19 days of semi-protection we had last month "cure" any of the vandals as the Wikipedia authorities claim? Well, no. Not in the least. The levels of vandalism after semi-protection are about the same as they were before semiprotection was tried. So a short period (19 days) of semi-protection does nothing to deter vandalism...not a thing. This means we should either not use it at all in these kinds of situation - or it should be permenant (for the kinds of articles for which it's needed). I strongly advocate the latter because <b>it works</b>.</p>
<p>During the blissful 19 day period when <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> had semi-protection, we were never once vandalised - we had 13 valid edits and no reversions whatever. During the subsequent 19 day period of zero protection, we were vandalised 121 times (always by anonymous users) with the page being screwed up for a total of 47 hours and 20 minutes. There were 102 separate reverts (17 by 'AntiVandalBot' and 85 done manually by logged in users) to correct these problems. This was not one single vandal but approximately 87 distinct IP addresses - all from different domains with no vandal being responsible for more than 5 of the attacks. During the same period, we had 18 valid edits - all by logged in users and no contributions of any kind (other than vandalism) from non-logged in users. The average time to perform a revert (on a high speed Internet connection) is 3 minutes (including pulling up the history, noticing a likely attack, examining the 'diff', clicking on the older article, hitting edit, adding a reason and hitting 'Save' - if you bother to go to the vandal's 'Talk' page and leave a vandalism complaint, it takes more like 4 or 5 minutes - but let's go with 3 minutes for the sake of statistics) - so the 87 reverts cost our editors a minimum of 4 hours and 20 minutes of their time. Interestingly, 87% of the vandalism happens between the hours of 7am and 7pm (US central time).</p>
<p><b>What can we conclude from this?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Obviously this article gains zero benefit from not-logged-in users. They contributed <b>nothing</b> over those 19 days when they had the opportunity (nor in the 19 days prior to the article being semi-protected). The argument that "much of Wikipedia content comes from these users" is quite obviously untrue for this kind of article...you can't even argue that "some" content comes that way. The answer is <i><b>none</b></i>.</li>
<li>The costs of allowing not-logged-in users to edit is:
<ol>
<li>For 47 hours out of the last 19 days, people coming to read about automobiles were presented with lies, disinformation, spam and obscene language (a cursory search reveals mostly the latter). To put it another way, if you visit <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> at random times throughout the day you have a 10% chance of seeing crap. It's actually much worse than that in practice because of the preponderance of vandalism during US daylight hours - which means that if you are a US Wikipedia reader, you have more like a 20% chance of seeing a vandalised article.</li>
<li>We wasted 4 hours and 21 minutes manually fixing the vandalism. This was time during which this article could have been improved - and you can do a LOT of improvements if you work on an article for that amount of time!</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to go back to whatever level of Wikipedia red tape decides on this stuff and demand PERMENANT semi-protection status for this page. <b>But I want to go further.</b> I want the people who contribute to this page (and who revert vandalism) to make a commitment. I want a <i><b>strike</b></i>!! I propose that if we do not get the permenant semi-protection that this page deserves that we refuse to work on it anymore...let the vandals have their way. I don't see why we should all waste our valuable time reverting this article for no good reason whatever when a perfectly workable solution exists.</p>
<p>This would be a different matter if this were some politically charged page where some kind of anonymity was valuable - or a very raw, new page that would require a lot of editing (potentially from non-logged in users) - or a sufficiently obscure article that the vandals would rarely think to look there - but it's none of those things. Remember - over the last several weeks, we got <b>not even one</b> useful contribution from an anonymous user so the price of permenant semi-protection is zero.</p>
<p>If you would agree to participate in a <i>no reverts</i> strike, please indicate below. Thanks <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 17:13, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I get very frustrated by editors, and especially administrators, who stick like glue to their own interpretation of the rules without considering the weight of feeling from the editors who <i>actually contribute</i> to a given article in a given situation. (My experience has been that the majority of administrators – though by no means all – are somewhat less open-minded than I consider appropriate for people in their position.) I didn't follow the debate on this particular partial-protection, but I agree with Steve's points, and so if there is any resistance to further protection, I for one would be prepared to sign up to a "no reverts" protest, <i>for a limited period</i>, to help to make the point. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 17:43, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've moved the paragraph on etymology to here for discussion.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term</i> automobile <i>is derived from Greek</i> auto- <i>("self") and Latin</i> mobilis <i>("movable"), referring to the fact that it "moves by itself". Earlier terms for automobile include</i> motorwagon <i>(from the German name "Motorwagen",) and</i> horseless carriage<i>. Although the term "car" is presumed to be derived through the shortening of the term "carriage", the word has its origin before 1300 A.D. in English as, "carr"—derived from similar words in French and much earlier Greek words—for a vehicle that moves, especially on wheels, that was applied to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chariot.html" title="Chariot">chariots</a>, small carts, and later—to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carriages.html" title="Carriages">carriages</a> that carried more people and larger loads. Note, therefore, that carriage and chariot come from the same root as car, which in a sense predates them.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This, I think, is too much detail, and too much of a distraction, at the start of the article. The reader wants to be told about automobiles, not the history of the word, and the article is already very long. If it is deemed desirable, put a link to wiktionary, or if that isn't detailed enough, perhaps write a new article on it. -- <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">de Facto</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/f/User_talk%7EDeFacto_6dea.html" title="User talk:DeFacto">talk</a>). 09:29, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree - we should move it down a ways, get the important stuff said first - but I think we need the etymology here someplace. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 13:47, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe this is an important part of the article and of course should be included, but summary is not the place for that. The article's summary is currently pretty hopeless, as it is no summary at all, given the length and breadth of the article. But leaving that aside, I believe the paragraph on etymology etc. would be a nice opening to the history of the automobile.

<p><b>Permenant Semi-protection</b> - This page has been granted short-term semi-protection at least once before - but after a period of 19 days, the protection was removed. I come back to this forum to request <b>permenant</b> semi-protection.

<dd>Thanks for putting back the semi-protection. But why not keep this kind of article locked up forever? It's not like we're losing a bunch of great edits from anonymous users. I don't think I've ever seen a worthwhile anonymous edit to this article. Locking anonymous edits out forever is precisely what's needed here. Every time semi-protection is removed, we'll be exactly back to where we were before we had protection. Nothing in the world is changing the number of random idiots who type "Car" into the search box then type in crap to see what'll happen. What do you think might change over a three week period of protection to change that? These problems are NOT caused by one or two habitual vandals of this page whom we might discourage with temporary protection - these are just random passers . <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 17:05, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ehh...you can't lock any article forever (unless it's a super high risk, such as the Main Page or ITN). You can have long-term semi-protection, but that's about it.

<p>This page was blanked by vandals for almost 30 minutes today. This is completely unacceptable for an article of this importance. We have to do something about this. I can't tolerate admins continually un-protecting the page and causing us all to waste our valuable time reverting vandalism rather than creating content. We've shown twice now that temporary sprotect doesn't prevent unacceptable levels of vandalism once the article is unprotected. I've analysed the editing patterns and shown conclusively that we lose nothing by sprotecting because unregistered editors provide a negligable contribution here and very nearly 100% of vandalism is by unregistered users.</p>
<p>I'm taking a moral stand.</p>

<p>I've now twice reverted edits by Parable1991 (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParable1991_66be.html" title="User talk:Parable1991">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parable1991_31f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parable1991">contribs</a>), wherein they have removed the space from <i>motor car</i> to make it <i>motorcar</i>. I don't believe that there is any etymology to support this term. Anyone? --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAtholM_bb1f.html" title="User:AtholM">Athol Mullen</a> 01:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Motorcar is not in my dictionary. Motor car is along with motor-car. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolma_ac3d.html" title="User:Malcolma">Malcolma</a> 10:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Scroll back up to the section "An Automobile is a Car - it's official!" - you'll see that quite a few of the dozen or so dictionaries that I quoted use 'motorcar' and quite a few others use 'motor car' or 'motor-car' - so I think both may be considered good English. However, even though both usages are alright, I think it's rude of Parable1991 to repeatedly change something that's already OK. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 11:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>In terms of common usage, I believe that 'motor car' would be far more common. Also, changing it to 'motorcar' may be considered a dialectic change, like changing from UK to US english... --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAtholM_bb1f.html" title="User:AtholM">Athol Mullen</a> 21:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes - I absolutely agree - the article should say 'motor car' - I'm just pointing out that 'motorcar' isn't wrong. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:05, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yep. That's fine. I've never seen it as one word but the fact that it would be a dialectic change over-rules any consideration of right or wrong. :-) --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAtholM_bb1f.html" title="User:AtholM">Athol Mullen</a> 22:39, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the Car Safety section it claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systematic research on crash safety started in 1958 at Ford Motor Company</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives the impression that Ford was a leader in Car Safety research in the 50's, but in the main <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_safety.html" title="Automobile safety">Automobile safety</a> page it states:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1950´s, Mercedes-Benz made the first crash tests</li>
</ul>
<p>While in the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volvo.html" title="Volvo">Volvo</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volvo_Cars_b67a.html" title="Volvo Cars">Volvo Cars</a> pages we can see safety features researched and first implemented by Volvo (not all dates in those pages agree):</p>
<ul>
<li>1944 Safety cage</li>
<li>1944 Laminated windscreen</li>
<li>1959 Three-point safety belts in the front (availible as accessory in 1957?)</li>
<li>1960 Padded dashboard (available in Volvo Amazon 1956?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any real evidence that Ford were leaders in crash safety research in the 1950s? Can we list any models where the results of this research was used, or significant Ford safety inventions in that period?</p>
<p>Otherwise we should remove the statement or amend to show Volvo and Mercedes as leaders in crash safety (research and application?) during that period. --<a href="../../../x/a/g/User%7EXagent86_97b9.html" title="User:Xagent86">Xagent86</a> 23:15, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
