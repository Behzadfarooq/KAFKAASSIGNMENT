<p>Hi! Re your recent changes on <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_etymology.html" title="Fake etymology">Fake etymology</a>, I think you may have missed the point of the article — fake etymologies <i>are</i> invented (and thus incorrect) etymologies, so it's not necessary to establish that each example is incorrect.</p>
<p>Also, please be careful with the "minor edit" checkbox — I noticed you've essentially rewritten <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choronzon.html" title="Choronzon">Choronzon</a> from scratch in a long series of minor edits. Rewriting from scratch is admirable, don't get me wrong — but since the point of flagging as a minor edit is to make it not appear to those who've excluded minor edits from their watchlist or <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentChanges_e0d0.html" title="Special:RecentChanges">Recent Changes</a> it's usually a good idea to avoid marking any changes to article <i>content</i> as minor. Minor changes tend to be spelling corrections, copy editing, fixing broken wiki syntax, that sort of thing, and a big series of minors that substantially changes an article might raise some red flags.</p>
<p>Hrm, I see now that <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">Shit</a> was the same sort of thing but without the minor flag. Don't forget that you can preview an article before saving. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel"></a>— <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 03:43, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And now on <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> too. Your edit left the article with:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>A folk etymology in the linguistic sense is an accurate explanation of the origins of a fake etymology or a misunderstanding of the history of the word or phrase.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reduce that for a second: "A folk etymology is an explanation of the origins of a fake etymology". No, that doesn't make sense at all; a folk etymology is an etymology, and thus it explains the origin of a word or phrase. The etymology of "kitty-corner" is a folk etymology; that folk etymology explains <i>the origin of "kitty-corner"</i> and not <i>the origin of people misunderstanding what "cater" meant</i>. I realize this sounds pedantic, but I don't see any reason for being imprecise on something that a great percentage of the population regulary get wrong. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel"></a>— <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 21:17, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Eh, we're not so much tangling now. When I saw one of your first edits on <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_etymology.html" title="Fake etymology">fake etymology</a> that appended "No" after one paragraph and "That's a load of bullshit" after another I wasn't sure if it was well-intentioned, and when I saw a lot of substantial edits marked "minor" I was a bit suspicious, but that's taken care of. Right now I'm more concerned with getting <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> unambiguous, because a couple weeks ago it was awful — pretty much identical to "fake etymology".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think we're in agreement that that's not what we want, but that's what laymen think it means. So if we don't want that, why not explain exactly what it means according to the discipline that coined the term? To "explain the origin of a fake etymology" just doesn't make any <i>sense</i>. "Bob came up with an acronymic expansion of 'Fuck' and told Sue"? That's the explanation of the origin of a fake etymology, and they'll all be identical — someone thought of it and spread it around. The key bit about folk etymology is that even though it was based on a mistake it's part of the <i>real</i> history of a word, and that's what I think most people miss. It's easy for someone to understand that since "fuck" wasn't an acronym then the acronym story is a fake etymology, but it's not as easy for them to get that if it became "fucq" over the years <i>because</i> of the fake etymology (and, uh, the Queen&#160;:-) that the acronym part would be part of "fucq"'s accurate etymology.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hrm, now that I think of it, it doesn't make much sense to say that folk etymology explains the origins of a word, either — it's a <i>process</i>, not a thing, which might be why that wording's sort of odd there. Yeah, I think that makes more sense. "Kitty-corner" has an etymology, not a folk etymology; part of that etymology is where "cater" became "kitty" through the <i>process</i> of folk etymology, but "cater" becoming "kitty" isn't <i>a</i> folk etymology. Does that sound right to you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it does, I'd propose the following:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Strike the whole "A folk etymology is" paragraph, and replace it with something like</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Folk etymology, then, is the process by which a fake etymology becomes a legitimate part of the history of a word or phrase.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_etymology.html" title="Fake etymology">fake etymology</a>, replace the "folk etymologies, which are (presumably)..." with something like</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>folk etymology, a process by which a word or phrase develops based on a fake etymology.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What do you think of that? Having spent a night or two fixing all of the folk/fake etymology confusion in the articles that linked to <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">Folk etymology</a>, though, I'd like to at least make sure that it's clear to Wikipedians.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Agincourt thing is fine, I guess. I don't meant to contest the accuracy; I know it's a lark, but it just sits odd to have the explanation followed by "This is untrue". Maybe the explanation should go <i>in</i> <a href="../../../v/_/s/V_sign.html" title="V sign">V sign</a>, and <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_etymology.html" title="Fake etymology">Fake etymology</a> should just link to the articles that talk about fake etymologies like <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> does for its examples.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's really nothing personal, now, though I started down that road at first — the combination of the minor edits, the style of the first changes you made, and then you showing up all over my watchlist after I mentioned it seemed like a red flag at first but I'm satisfied it was just coincidence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAuto_movil_6117.html" title="Edit section: Folk/fake etymology, clamato">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Folk/fake etymology, clamato</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/Clamato.html" title="Clamato">Clamato</a> ended up on my to-do list after an IRC discussion (not in #wikipedia) about the absurdity of adding clam juice to, well, anything, really. I found a neat history while trying to find out why someone would do that, and thought it'd fit nicely into an article.</p>
<p>As for folk and fake etymologies, the difference is a lot bigger than you'd think. "Fake etymology" is easy: an etymology (history of a word of phrase) that isn't true but is popularly believed. It's really just a purported etymology that doesn't pan out.</p>
<p>Where it gets tricky is that the "etymology" in "folk etymology" isn't talking about the same meaning of "etymology" as "fake etymology" is. In "folk etymology", "etymology" refers to the process of change itself, and not the historical account of the change.</p>
<p>In "fake etymology", the etymology <i>is</i>. A synonym for "fake etymology" might be "contrived history". In "folk etymology", the etymology <i>happens</i>. A synonym for <i>it</i> might be "modification based on popular belief". Fake etymologies are countable — "fuck" has at least two fake etymologies (the acronym and the archers). Folk etymology isn't countable; both "rake-hell" and "kitty-corner" developed via (one process called) folk etymology.</p>
<p>Does that make it clearer? I really wish the terms didn't look like they were meant to be opposites. I'd never use "fake etymology" outside of Wikipedia; even when I was fixing a lot of the articles that linked to "folk etymology" but talked about wrong but popular etymologies I linked to [[Fake etymology|popular etymology]]. I'd almost go so far as to say that "fake etymology" isn't so much a <i>concept</i> as it is merely the word "etymology" with the adjective "fake". <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel"></a>— <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 21:56, Nov 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I figured that instead of talking to you and <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> about folk/fake etymology on your talk pages, that we should probably be discussing it on <a href="../../../f/o/l/Talk%7EFolk_etymology_8ef1.html" title="Talk:Folk etymology">Talk:Folk etymology</a>. I just summarized what I've said to you and Pasquale there; we should probably continue the discussion there so that anyone else interested in the article knows it is going on.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Back on the subject of squeezing clams into a glass: the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Caesar_680c.html" title="Bloody Caesar">Bloody Caesar</a> is a quintessential Canadian summer drink (although I can't stand them myself, but I don't like tomato juice much, let alone tomato juice with clam, let alone tomato juice with clam, tabasco, and Worcestershire sauce, even if there <i>is</i> vodka in it), so Clamato itself is pretty unremarkable Canada-wide. I imagine using it for something other than a Caesar would be as uncommon as anywhere else. As for its history, give <a href="http://www.cincypost.com/2004/05/19/clam051904.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cincypost.com/2004/05/19/clam051904.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> a read — that's the article I mention in my to-do list, that made me want to write a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clamato.html" title="Clamato">Clamato</a> article in the first place! <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel"></a>— <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 16:05, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Kevin, it's not personal; it's procedural."</p>
<p>I agree. I initally thought you were a troll, this is true. I was not overly concerned though until you delete the {{Nonsense}} tag. That sent up a ton of red flags for me. That is the wrong procedure. The correct thing to do was to put a comment on the talk page that you were still working on it, then continue to work on the article. The first administrator that came along would have seen your comment and then removed the {{Nonsense}} tag.</p>
<p>Then when you blanked the talk page, I was even more concerned. That is even moreso the incorrect procedure. You should have simply added your comments and then continued to work on the article. If the article got to a place where it was no longer a candiate for speedy deltion or VFD then it would not be a problem and it would neither be deleted nor moved.</p>
<p>Finally, as far as you making claims about my level of contribution on the vfd page that were not true, I don't appreciate that. I think that most of your contributions are of a fairly low quality, but I've never said anything to that effect in a public forum. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clamato.html" title="Clamato">Clamato</a> is a very poor encyclopedia artice (in my opinion) but I've never put it, or you, down. Please refrain from intimating that I am a deletionist who doesn't contribute to the Wikipedia project as both of these claims are patently untrue. In fact, I've saved more than one article from VFD by adding to it. If you really feel that it's not personal but procedural please stop spreading untruth about me. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 19:15, Nov 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to keep the facts straight, the word 'nonsense' appeared in the text box minutes after I began the article. It was like, 'How odd. That shouldn't be here.' When it appeared again, I left it and found a speedy-delete tag on the page. This was not erased.</p>
<p>As votes for deletion appeared, I wiped them and left a note in their place saying that the page was in the process of being written, and sent Kevin (above) a message saying to please come back and judge the article when it was, in fact, an article, rather than two sentences of an article.</p>
<p>Kevin (above) restored everything but my note on the talk page, wiped my message on his talk page, and went into 'I am unable to admit I'm wrong' mode, ignoring requests to stop marking things for deletion. Hilarity ensued.</p>
<p>Rather than deleting his comment (as he deleted mine), I leave it here as testimony that my contributions are of a fairly low quality, and that <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clamato.html" title="Clamato">Clamato</a> is a very poor encyclopedia artice [sic]. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 21:35, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted your edits on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratocaster.html" title="Stratocaster">Stratocaster</a> because material was deleted yet it was marked as a minor edit. According to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">Wikipedia:Minor_edit</a>, marking a real change as a minor edit is considered bad behaviour, even more so if it involves the deletion of some text.

<p>The change was removing a list of 'famous Stratocaster players' that had been pasted into a paragraph where it didn't belong. If you want to include favorite Stratocaster players, please add them to the existing list at the bottom of the article. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 15:17, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note to all: In general, when I write an article, it stays written -- my watchlist rarely shows a substantitive change in a major piece of text. This is, I think, because the text is pretty good and people like it.</p>
<p>However, the watchlist shows a lot of links added, lists of things appended and interspersed, and (recently) people trying to get their own names into articles such as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">Hardcore punk</a>, apparently for vanity's sake alone (see that article's talk page for gory details). I monitor that fairly strictly on several articles, and don't always signal my changes well. I am, in fact, a notably sloppy, piecemeal editor who wades around in chaos making a million tiny changes until everything gets pulled together in the end.</p>
<p>If I've deleted something you've added, it's 100% not personal, 100% not because I'm being overprotective of an article (I rejoice over good edits and additions), and probably only 50% cursory -- especially if it's a self-reference or a mention of a favorite band, guitarist, oyster, sausage, mythological personage, et al., who's included because it seems (to me) to be one's favorite, and not because it's objectively lacking from the article. Sometimes I'm over-hasty. I'll try to signal changes better in the future, and I thank Icd for issuing a mild smack on that account. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 15:54, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The latest version looks much better now. That paragraph did look very awkward with a laundry list of guitarists jammed in it.

<p>Thanks for your positive comment on my recent changes to the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecaster.html" title="Telecaster">Telecaster</a> article. I am hoping to gradually expand it and make it more authoritative with references from several books I have, all of which have notes on the Telecaster. Most informative have been Duchossoir's <i>The Fender Telecaster</i> and Bacon and Day's <i>The Fender Book.</i> If you do not have these books yet, I highly recommend them. The Duchossoir book is especially fascinating for its exhaustive detail, though the other has great color pictures of all the Fender models. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 02:21, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A little detective work has led me to your door (and I apologize in advance for dredging up what may be bad memories). A long time ago you added a considerable portion to the behaviour section in the <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceanic_whitetip_shark.html" title="Oceanic whitetip shark">Oceanic whitetip shark</a> article, most of which survives today. I'd like to add a reference to avoid claims of OR, so do you by any chance recall where that originated?

<p>By repeating Spylab's posting that the "midnight riot" was suggested is false and misleading. I knew all the players at the time and "The Big Apple Rotten To The Core" (produced by Sallese) prompted the show. The record was a staple in hardcore history of NYC but that would be disputed by those that were jealous of it's popularity. I assume that those jealousies still exist today and are part of the reason that the articles are butchered. I've tried to present an accurate potrayal in few words while including key figures. Now you say I am being warned. I don't understand your reasoning. If you want a fictional version of histroy then that's fine by me. You would be doing an injustice to readers of Wilkipedia. I think the refs. to Sallese that you moved was a good idea but that still doesn't warrant repeating falsehoods posted by Spylab. It is quite obvious that he has a bone to pick and his predjudices are hurting Wilkipedia.</p>

<li>Wow, I came here for a different reason, and again I see Punk NYC (AKA Bob) attributing things to me that I have not done. Please read carefully and direct your comments to the appropriate person instead of obsessing about me. I do not appreciate your unwarranted attention.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 18:56, 4 October 2006 (UTC)Spylab</li>

<ul>
<li>The Big Apple Rotten to the Core compilation was one part of a much larger story in NY.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kraut already had two records out in 1981, and had opened for The Clash at Bond's Casino. The Bad Brains were in town, and had a ROIR tape out. Urban Waste had an EP out. Heart Attack had a single out. Cracked Actor and The Corpsicles had singles. The Beastie Boys had an EP out. The Nihilistics had a single. The New York Thrash tape was out.</p>
<p>That's not a complete list, as you know.</p>
<p>Now, please listen to me here, Punknyc. This article is about ALL hardcore in THE ENTIRE WORLD. Bob Sallese, a regionally-known promoter of ISM and (briefly) The Mob, plus a bunch of bands like The Headlickers, certainly deserves a mention, but is not entitled to this encyclopedia article, written with much effort by many people, as a vanity platform.</p>
<p>He is certainly entitled to his own article, which someone ought to write.</p>

<ul>
<li>All those bands were certainly important but the fact of the matter is that before the release of "Rotten To The Core", the scene in NY was in a downspin and going nowhere. The commercial exposure reignited the scene. I hardly think a blurb about heavy commercial airplay of "John Hinckley Jr." which led to a late night hardcore show on commercial radio is dominating the page. The blurb I edited is more accurate than stating that it was "suggested". This is supposed to be an encyclopedia. The fact is that that "Rotten To The Core" &amp; "John Hinckley Jr." by Ism, prompted commercial airplay for a host of local groups and long established bands from the West Coast like Black Flag &amp; The Circle Jerks. This was a turning point for hardcore in NYC. The story WAS appropriately placed in the "early support" section. It was a major turning point in NY whereas the West Coast had been getting commercial support much earlier from the likes of Rodney Bingenheimer. Furthermore, Spylab continues to post personal attacks and falsely identifying people with little knowledge of what he is saying yet Wilkipedia adminstrators allow this rubbish to stay and delete key information.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPUNKNYC_55ed.html" title="User:PUNKNYC">PUNKNYC</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, in Long Island. That's one of five boroughs in New York City, not counting New Jersey. I'll tell you what you should have done. You should have put out that Heart Attack stuff that ended up never being released until like two years ago, and/or tried to work with the Nihilistics, and if that failed, you could have done a Satan's Cheerleaders album or something. Or fired Lyle Hysen from the Misguided and done a record with a decent drummer. I'm talking just Long Island. If you want to talk Queens, Murphy's Law was super-huge, yet didn't record until like 1985. Paths untaken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, Sallese/Jism stuff gets as much mention in this broad survey article as The Germs. Why is that not enough? I mean honestly now. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 20:52, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not about to do anything. I'm just a fan of the genre. Queens is one of the five Boroughs but part of Long Island. Queens was birthplace to the Ramones and many only pioneers of punk. The majority of Long Island is in Nassau &amp; Suffolk Counties. Long Island is not a borough. Big Apple was predominately a NYC comp (see the "just the facts" in talk for hardcore punk). "The Headlickers" were the only band that didn't hail from NYC but played at A7 All those bands you mention were important as well if you're talking early NYC hardcore. Murphy's Law evolved in the later days and I suspect were influenced very much by The Mob since they were at all their gigs.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPUNKNYC_55ed.html" title="User:PUNKNYC">PUNKNYC</a></p>
<p><br />
Ok, geography lesson absorbed. I'm working under the unshakable and evidentiary proposition that as a user who only edits articles in order to add references to Bob Sallese, you are in fact Bob Sallese. With that in mind, what I said was twofold. You ought to have released some other records back then, if you're now going to claim foundational status in the early NY hardcore scene. Big Apple and some ISM records is good and important, but it isn't exactly the Posh Boy of the East Coast (and please note that Robbie Fields isn't even mentioned in this article). It's more like Rat Cage Records, historically speaking. (And Dave Rat Cage isn't mentioned at all either.) (And neither is Javi Savage, or for that matter Jack Rabid.)</p>
<p>The other thing is the 'because.' They aren't mentioned because this is a broad survey article about the ENTIRE hardcore movement in the ENTIRE world, from 1978 to 2006. I'm not sure you understand this. Long Island (including Queens) circa 1982-1983 was one part of one scene, out of literally dozens in America alone. I'm stretching my arms all the way out. "Big." Now I'm putting my palms together about three inches apart. "Small." This article is about "Big." What happened in Long Island in 1982-1983 is "Small." <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 05:59, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>There wasn't much happening on "Long Island" in those days. Punk pioneer like the Ramones were from Forest Hills, Queens and Johnny Thunders was from Bayside, Queens. So I don't understand what your obsession with using the term "Long Island" since native NYers always refer to Nassau &amp; Suffolk as "Long Island.</li>
</ul>
<p>My posts refer mainly to bands that were from the 5 boroughs. I have met most of the players that you mention here and was planning to update this site regularly. I began with certain key points that were totally left out. This stuff has been deleted &amp; distorted over &amp; over again. You say the whole page is about Jism/Sallese yet there is no mention of Jism, "Ism" and one mention of Sallese as the page stands. I'm sorry, but "John Hinckley Jr" &amp; "I Think I Love You" were getting major commercial airplay in the NY metropolitan area and in NJ as well. The ref: to "The Big Apple Rotten To The Core" has been completely &amp; repeatedly removed over the years while I and a few others restore it. If I can't get past step A, how can I get to step B? Plus...little mention of the "False Prophets" or "The Undead", no mention of Pat Duncan or Tim Sommer until today...What about "Butch Lust &amp; The Hypocrites" with Lenny Steel of "Pure Hell" and later with Screaming Mad George of "The Mad"? What about "Even Worse" or "The Young &amp; The Useless" or "Killer Instict" (one of the early female "hardcore bands")? So little mention of "A7"... Rat Cage records was extremely important. "The Beastie Boys" were a much better hardcore band than they are given credit for. Jack Rabid ( who by the way, use to be another claiming that he came up with the term "Hardcore") was very important on the scene. Javi Savage important as well and a very nice person I may add. Not enough on "The Stimulators" if you want to talk about the early days. Not enough on "The Mob" &amp; "Kraut" either. You are stuck on this "Long Island" thing that just never existed. There were a few good bands from Nassau County like "The Nihilistics" and "The Headlickers". I thought "Heart Attack" had some members in Nassau County also as well as Whitestone Queens. "The Big Apple" comp was a pure New York CITY comp with only one band from Nassau County. Ism (Queens, NYC), The Mob (Queens, NYC) Butch Lust &amp; The Hypocrites ( Brooklyn &amp; Manhatten, NYC), Squirm (Brookyln, NYC), Killer Instinct (Queens &amp; Manhatten, NYC), The Headlickers (Nassau County)</p>
<p>The funny thing is that you admit that this article is lacking in so many ways and yet try to justify it. When anybody adds valuable input that upsets the status quo, they get deleted, accused of being somebody else or distorted. It appears this site is being ran by a select few members of a hardcore clique that want to go back in time and remember things as they wished it was instead of as it actually was. Yeah, I could point fingers and name some names but that's not my style because even the A-Holes were part of an exciting moment in music history. They should all get credit where credit is due. Each and every one of the people &amp; bands that we both named should have AT LEAST one link at minimum leading to a bio. Unfortunately that takes time and if I can't even manage to put one ref. with a link to "Ism" without it getting deleted, how the heck can anyone find the time or want to find the time to constuctively contribute to this article to make it completely accurate??????????????</p>
<p>You can think what you want about who I am but you are wrong and what difference would it matter anyway? The entire site is posted by people hiding behind aliases and I don't care who they are as long as they get their facts straight. If you want this section to be accurate, the administrators should stop it from being torn apart by a few people with an agenda. From my reads, that agenda is to create a fairytale &amp; candy coated illusion of what really happened.</p>

Nonono, I'm going to be very clear here. The article, 'Hardcore Punk' is a survey article about the entire genre. It's ALREADY beyond the recommended length for Wikipedia articles. It simply cannot include everything that's important or relevant. There simply is not space.</p>
<p>But the way it works is that there are OTHER articles devoted to individual hardcore scenes, bands, and people. Each of these can be just as long and detailed. Also, if one doesn't exist yet, it can be created.</p>
<p>When you add stuff into the broad, comprehensive 'Hardcore Punk' article, it's competing with gigantic amounts of other relevant information. Whereas, adding brief factual information into the article on NY Hardcore, or really specific and detailed information into the articles on ISM, Bob Sallese, WLIR, etc., is absolutely wonderful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your editors continue to make the article a joke. If you take out all brief explanations of key players and leave no links then what would be the point to have more detailed seperate bios and articles. As it stands, all references to Pat Duncan, Tim Sommer, Bob Sallese, Ben Manilla, Jack Rabid have been omitted. Yet Rodney Bigenheimer &amp; Tim Yohannon info stays. This is a very one-sided article. These names were equally important in NYC as were Bigenheimer &amp; Yohannon were on the West Coast. The beginning of the article is a joke too..."Hardcore originated in North America, primarily in and around California, Texas, and Washington, DC, although Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Vancouver, and Boston were also important." What the fuck!@#$@#$%^&amp;&amp;&amp;????????? This is a total OPINION!!!!...and in my opinion....California, NYC, DC, &amp; Boston were the most important places. To write this article suggesting Texas &amp; Vancouver were more important than NYC or Boston is a joke!</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, what about the other key players without even a link...The Stimulators, The Mob, Bad Brains, Ism, Kraut, Butch Lust and the Hypocrites with punk veteran Lenny Steel of Pure Hell on guitar, The False Prophets,The Undead....all extremely important in NYC in the early days which made the way for the movement to carry on. Oh that's right, this article for some reason wants to discount the importance of NYC even though Hardcore was a direct evolution from punk which was basicly born in Queens NY with the Ramones grew up in Manhatten at CBGBs &amp; Max's Kansas City. Nah, NYC and the key players to this genre mean nothing...The article as it stands is now a joke. In the early days, hardcore was dying in NYC because...nobody wanted to book the bands...nobody wanted to play it on the radio...Nobody could afford to put out a record or distribute it right...A7 was EXTREMELY important, Pat Duncan &amp; Tim Sommer were extremely important, Dave Rat Cage Records &amp; Bob Sallese were extremely important. "The Big Apple Rotten To The Core" was extremely important. Nobody could get a good comp out and get it played commercially as well. It was a turning point and not to list briefly the importance with links to the players is a joke!!! The success of Ism's "John Hinckley Jr." &amp; "I Think I Love You" on WLIR leading to the first commercial broadcast in the NY metro are of Black Flag and the first commercial hardcore show with Ben Manilla were extremely important. Ben Manilla went out on a limb with the station. He also almost got fired over an incident at Nassau Colliseum when he &amp; Jism of Ism sang the Star Spangled Banner hardcore style before an indoor Soccer game. They pulled the plug and the station was never even warned about they were going to do it.</p>
<p>The early support section is a joke. The Stimulators, The Mob, Bad Brains, Ism, Kraut, Butch Lust and the Hypocrites, Lenny Steel, A7, Bob Sallese, Jack Rabid, Tim Sommer, Dave Rat Cage Records, The Beastie Boys, Pat Duncan, "The Big Apple Rotten To The Core" &amp; "John Hinckley Jr.", Ben Manilla, WLIR, should all have links &amp; breif explanations SOMEWHERE in this article. If not, it is one-sided fairytale meant to pump vanity writings for a select group of individuals and bands. When someone like myself comes along with an extensive knowledge of the era, they get squelched. I wonder how many others with valuable input have been turned away from the site after reading the farce. You are doing the young readers an injustice and anyone else who want to learn about the subject. This is not an encyclopedia but a PR page for a select group of individuals and bands. Granted, some may not liked how history unfolded but what happened is what happened and they can change it in this fairytale but they are only fooling themselves. I will add this message to the discussion page and see if anyone with one iota of common sense wants to fix the article.</p>

<p>I don't think it's fair of you to make personal attacks and false allegations against specific parties whose reputations can be compromised and cause specific damages. Even worse is doing it with no certifiable sources. Even though I may not be "certain parties", I can easliy get in touch with them. I beleive all personal attacks (including my own) should be removed and false accusations should never be posted. I think the article is starting to look very legit now and am pleased that Kraut, Pat Duncan, Sallese, Tim Sommer, The Mob and Ism have been noted for their important contributions to the genre. Despite what you may think, I believe we are on the same side. Not to sound like Rodney King but hopefully, we can all just get along.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPUNKNYC_55ed.html" title="User:PUNKNYC">User:PUNKNYC</a></p>
<p>Now look. I seem to have made a mistake in discussing this with you as though there were two sides to the issue -- in trying to explain and convince rather than simply taking action. What you're doing is adding multiple vanity references to an article over and over and over, and reverting them back again and again and again. And when people ask you to stop and explain why it's necessary to stop, you keep doing it again and again and again, always with some new, contradictory story as to why the additions are relevant. I believe I've summed up the situation with admirable restraint.</p>
<p>What this is, is ridiculous. It is an obvious, flaming, arm-waving, 900-foot-tall violation of Wikipedia practice with blinking red lights and smoke billowing out of its ears and other orifices, for which you have been warned and warned and warned and warned, by several editors and at least one admin.</p>
<p>Maybe you think I'm your problem. Your problem is that you're trying to put stuff into an encyclopedia article that doesn't belong there. It doesn't matter whether you, personally, are Bob Sallese, or whether you're a dogged Bob Sallese fan of some sort. In adding multiple references to Bob Sallese to an article that has very little to do with Bob Sallese, you are in violation of Wikipedia practice. In violation of Wikipedia practice. In violation of Wikipedia practice.</p>
<p>Violation, violation, violation. I hope this is clearer now. I fear it isn't.</p>
<p>You may wish to further debate the historical relevance of Bob Sallese. Google shows that nearly all the references to Bob Sallese on the Internet point TO THIS ARTICLE, and specifically to text added by yourself and by aliases of yourself. Sock-puppetry constitutes another violation, as it happens. There is a surfeit of violations, a galaxy of violations. There are violations like sand grains on a beach.</p>
<p>I am, as you know, aware that Bob Sallese existed and that he released an early hardcore vinyl compilation in New York, as well as several records by the band ISM circa 1983-1984. I have for that reason kept a reference to Bob Sallese in this article. I am beginning to see this as a mistake. You will repeatedly revert edits unless there are MULTIPLE, PARAGRAPH-LONG references to Bob Sallese, including information relevant only to people who are: A) devoted scholars of the life and career of Bob Sallese, or B) Bob Sallese. I have previously copied some of this text to the article, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Sallese_b1fc.html" title="Bob Sallese">Bob Sallese</a>, where it would better serve the Bob Sallese community.</p>
<p>I have also previously recommended that some of this text may be appropriate and beneficial in the articles on New York Hardcore, ISM, and other subjects. It does not, however, demand several references in the master article for Hardcore Punk, for reasons imminently obvious and impossible to expound upon without doing violence to the very concept of rationality.</p>
<p>However, I'll try once again. The article would suffer from space constraints even with a fair and appropriate ratio of Bob-Sallese-related material -- which, if one were being objective and strictly following Wikipedia guidelines (as I am being generous in interpreting), would approach or achieve zero.</p>
<p>I am going to ask that you agree not to tamper with this article any further. The next thing I do will be to request that you be banned from editing articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 18:28, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I hate to ask you this but where did you study mathematics? There has consistently been 1 AND ONLY ONE reference to Bob Sallese in the entire article which you continue to remove. There are two references to Ism, one pertaing to Jism and Sallese's joint venture to bring hardcore into the mainstream which goes on to explain how the first commercially aired hardcore song in NY led to the first commercial hardcore radio program in the NY metropolitan area. How do you count multiple ref. to Sallese. Admit that you have a personal vendetta against this person.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also added a ref. to Pat Duncan, &amp; Tim Sommer which you have not omitted. It's quite strange. The second ref. to Ism is justified because it points out a historic momenmt when hardcore entered the charts competing with mostly supergroups of the 80's. This is a seperate accomplishment and worthy of mention in the article which is suppose to be an encyclopedia of hardcore punk. There is so much other vanity postings and opinionated trash in this article that I have not touched but yet you continue to vandalize facts to the history of hardcore along with verifiable sources and citation</p>
<p>So please, stop the double talk. One and only one ref. to Sallese, one ref. to Jism (where Ism is mention to clarify who Jism was) and one actual ref. to the band Ism is hardly "MULTIPLE REF". Why the game playing? why the lying about multiple Sallese ref? I have e-mailed a copy of all the discussion of Sallese off to him and to Ism handlers. I think they have a right to know about false allegations posted on these boards. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPUNKNYC_55ed.html" title="User:PUNKNYC">User:PUNKNYC</a></p>

<li>Ism was never on the charts except for once (as you claim) in the 30s on the CMJ chart, which tracks college radio play. This is non-notable, as many hardcore bands were on the CMJ chart at higher positions. It represents a special POV pleading to include the band Ism in this article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ism's radio play on WLIR is not notable, however it is perhaps appropriate for an article on New York Hardcore or one on Ism. For perspective, please review this list of bands competing in the <a href="../../../w/b/c/WBCN_Rock_%26_Roll_Rumble_23a2.html" title="WBCN Rock &amp; Roll Rumble">WBCN Rock &amp; Roll Rumble</a> during the same time period. This represents another special POV pleading to include Ism in this article.</li>

<li>Excising other factual information from this article in order to turn around the charge of 'vanity editing' constitutes deliberate vandalism.</li>

<p>Gosh, thanks for all those well-thought-out, carefully checked commets at the<a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophelia_Benson_e901.html" title="Ophelia Benson">Ophelia Benson</a> AFD. In the future, to improve the level of your contributions to Wikipedia, might I suggest you improve your practices in two areas. First, you should actually read the article you are commenting on, and take note of its contents. Second, you should consider the claims made in the article against the relevant notability criteria, even, as necessary, checking the references and external links provided for the article..<br />
<a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophelia_Benson_e901.html" title="Ophelia Benson">Ophelia Benson</a> is a well-known published author, not merely a blogger (although she is probably notable as a blogger, too). Her two books are listed by title in the article,even though none of you astute readers noticed that. (Apparently the identification of Benson as an "author" and the listing of the book titles in distinctive type was insufficient to tip off careful and well-informed Wikipedia editors like yourselves; perhaps one or two of you may have suggestions on how to improve such descriptions.) Her books meet the notability criteria, having been reviewed and discussed in major media. In fact, Benson is a native of the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, and both her books have been reviewed/discussed in the <a href="../../../t/l/s/TLS_099d.html" title="TLS">TLS</a>, which even <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> acknowledges as "one of the world's preeminent critical publications." (The second review appears in the October 20, 2006 issue, and is not yet directly cited online.)<br />
Benson's two books may be only available through such obscure retailers as Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Truth-Matters-Ophelia-Benson/dp/0826476082/sr=1-1/qid=1162146949/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Truth-Matters-Ophelia-Benson/dp/0826476082/sr=1-1/qid=1162146949/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Fashionable-Nonsense-Guide-People/dp/0285637142/sr=1-2/qid=1162146949/ref=sr_1_2/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Fashionable-Nonsense-Guide-People/dp/0285637142/sr=1-2/qid=1162146949/ref=sr_1_2/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and Barnes &amp; Noble <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780826476081&amp;itm=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780826476081&amp;itm=1" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780285637146&amp;itm=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780285637146&amp;itm=2" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and the relevant pages give samples of reviews and indicate the caliber of Benson's audience.<br />
Now I recognize that article deletion is a holy and privileged activity, and that deletion of articles about women whose claims to notability don't involve performances emphasizing, flaunting, or exposing their mammaries is a virtual sacrament which shouldn't be disrupted or contested, however ridiculous or inaccurate the basis, unless the circumstances are really really unusual. But while one of England's "leading cultural critics" is apparently not, by Wikipedia editor consensus, as notable as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chessie_Moore_3df5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chessie Moore">a moderately obese middle-aged woman who films herself having sex with dogs</a>, and the <a href="../../../t/l/s/TLS_099d.html" title="TLS">TLS</a> is apparently by the same consensus not a "major" publication with the stature and reputation of <i>Color Climax Anal Sex</i> or <i>Big Fuckin' Tits</i>, or even <i>Juggs</i>, I think she deserves to be included in Wikipedia.<br />
I now realize that the excessive literacy and cultural awareness I displayed in recognizing the name of a well-known figure in the British academic-literary world is inconsitent with the qualities required of a good Wikipedian, and fully justifies the assumptions of bad faith you have all made. I now know that in-depth knowledge of any subjects outside of pornography, Pokemon, and professional sports can only damage the Wikipedian enterprise, and I will do my best in the future to follow your lead and to contribute only with regard to subjects about which I know nothing, or next to nothing.</p>
<p>Now (dropping the ironic stance) I deserve a public apology from each of the posters whose sloth, carelessness, malice, or incompetence led them to make unfounded, uncivil, derogatory comments about me (and about the entirely blamess Ms Benson). And I deserve a display of abject, public, unqualified self-execration from the ArbCom member who charged to the head of the attack. I expect, of course, nothing but renewed incivility, personal attacks, and evasion of responsibility. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 20:38, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
