<p>A quote from the article: "Unlike the Deaf culture, which recognizes and accepts many people who are hearing, the Autistic culture generally shuns neurotypical people (NTs), and the sentiment among the Autism rights movement generally considers people who have self-diagnosed to be part of a fad which considers Autism/Asperger's as a mere personality type."</p>
<p>That contains two separate assertions that are at odds with what I've seen of autistic culture, and one that is somewhat at odds with what I've seen of Deaf culture. There are no citations backing these things up, either.</p>
<p>Basically, there are segments of the Deaf community that do shun "hearies". And large segments that consider some hearies (especially hearing children of Deaf parents, and interpreters) part of Deaf culture. (I don't have a cite for that but I'm sure this could be found somewhere.) So there's a fair amount of diversity of opinion about hearing people among Deaf people, and while the statement as general is probably true, it shouldn't be used in contrast to autistic culture.</p>
<p>Because the segments of autistic culture that reject NTs are, like in the Deaf community, only small segments, with most of us not bearing any malice, hatred, rejection, etc towards NTs. Many people in the autistic community have had to go to great lengths to show that we do not in fact hate NTs. The following article: <a href="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/History_of_ANI.html" class="external free" title="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/History_of_ANI.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/History_of_ANI.html</a> is a history of one autistic community that was fairly formative for modern autistic culture, and they're explicit about not hating or shunning NTs. I'm sure if you look around you can find other citations that are equally explicit.</p>
<p>The second part of the statement that causes trouble, is that the sentiment among the autism rights movement generally considers people who have self-diagnosed to be part of a fad... etc. You'd again need to cite sources for that, and if you looked for sources, you'd find that there's a great diversity of opinion about self-diagnosis. One autistic man who does not as far as I know consider himself part of the autism rights movement urged conference organizers to verify an official diagnosis for all autistic people speaking at their conferences, and many people within the autistic community responded to this by refusing to show our official diagnosis as a display of solidarity with people who could not obtain one but were equally autistic. Many people in the autism rights movement signed that letter (in fact, more than are on there right now because I've been too busy to update the signatures): <a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/whoisautistic.html" class="external free" title="http://www.autistics.org/library/whoisautistic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autistics.org/library/whoisautistic.html</a></p>
<p>So you'd have to find cites to back those statements up, and I suspect if you looked around, you'd find more cites (like the two I provided) refuting those statements.</p>

<p>I think the external links section is way too large. When the Aspergian Pride's list was separate from the external links section I thought that was ok because then people would still have a shorter list that is easier to go through. But now with the two links sections there is only one hard to sort through list. I think either the links needs to be divided back into separate "external links" and "aspergian pride links" sections like it was before, or the external links list needs to be cut shorter, or the external links section needs to be divided into subsections to make it easier to sort though. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 08:57, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A protest about the instant deletion of the word <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspiette.html" title="Aspiette">aspiette</a>:</p>
<p>Oy RN, you do realise that the word aspiette is a real word, it is part of autistic culture, and you have ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT to undo my actions as you just did right now! This is supposed to be a world of free speech, and yet you just took away my right to put this word here! Geez mate!</p>
<p>(cur) (last) 08:09, 8 October 2005 RN (rv - aspiette was taken out by even Joe, so its obviously not used enough to be in the terms here....)</p>
<p>That is a VERY bad call - and if this goes away, I will contact the admin here! Kitkatsavvy</p>
<p>As the inventor of the word aspiette, I am very sad to see it being redirected to the "Autistic culture" section. Now RN, I don't care how much of a bigwig you THINK you are, this word does get used to call a female aspie an aspiette! Now why don't you GIVE me the right to have my word as it's own listing - just like it is right here - <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aspiette" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aspiette" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aspiette</a> .

<dd>So basically, you made a word and you want it in the dictionary and wikiepedia. <i>It doesn't work that way.</i> Words get to be included in reference material when they have established significant usage. One or two people doesn't cut it. (If it did, all the goofy family slang my family has would qualify!) "Aspiette" can be shown to be used only by you and <i>maybe</i> one or two others. That's not appropriate for WP or the dictionary -- in fact, I think it should be removed from Wiktionary as well.</dd>

<dd>Personally, I'm not wild about turning "aspie" into a gendered adjective and a diminutive gender at that. I know there's controversy about the majority of autistics being male, and they're still trying to figure out if that's true or if there are just a lot of autistic girls slipping under the radar. Maybe that's why you want to have a gendered adjective stating <i>I am not just autistic, I am a female autistic.</i> It's the affix "ette" that bothers me. Most of the autistic women I know are anything but -ettes, and the only other thing "aspiette" brings to mind is something used for personal hygiene. I know this isn't the issue, and the real issue is that I've never seen "aspiette" before. It's going to have to be used a lot more, by a lot more people, before it can be considered part of the general <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon.html" title="Jargon">jargon</a>. Look at the trouble we've had getting people to accept that <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> is legitimate and not POV inspeak. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 02:47, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In this case, Neurotypical defies the conventions of neologism because it is a neccessary glossary word to even have a legit discussion. Aspiette is a pronoun affecation, and Aspie allready applies to both males and females. I think actually that you really accidentally ended the case when you called yourself the words originator. That means it is def a Neologism. Don't get me wrong, I am a pro Neologisim person, but the limits of writing &gt;&gt;textbooks&lt;&lt; aren't the fault of the Wikibookians or Wikimedia, they are the conventions the public has come to expect, and if we don't conform to those conventions, what we end up with is a whole lot of people that won't respect us. The truth be told, You have been given enormous berth, allready this is pushing the limit of the difference between a Encyclopedia and A collection of group memoirs. I'd like to see you continue, and I am fascinated and amused to find so many aspies here. Please quit beating the WikiPedianss about the ears for doing their jobs. As an interesting aside, there are fun ways to cheat. For instance, you could write a paragraph on Aspie culture, and include a bit about words and neologisms of that culture. In that context, you become simply a reporter of undisputable facts. 209.129.49.65 03:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 03:22, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Popular misconception is that autistic people live away from other people due to the lack of socialization, and their tendency to like <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solitude.html" title="Solitude">solitude</a>. For example, such as living in an <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a> area rather than a <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_area.html" title="Urban area">urban</a> area, however there has been some autistics that can maintain living in <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburb</a> or large city like <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>.

There has been speculation about the author in an article about AS on Locus online, and a well-known technology pioneer who is though to be autistic has cited Egan as a favourite author.</p>
<p>What about all of those well-known autie and aspie autobiographies? THese are the most prominent form of literature about autistics.</p>
