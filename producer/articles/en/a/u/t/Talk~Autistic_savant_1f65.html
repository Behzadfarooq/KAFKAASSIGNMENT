<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutistic_savant_1f65.html" title="Edit section: Proposal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposal</span></h2>
<p>Here's a proposal for making this article clearer and (I hope!) reducing some of the controversy:</p>
<p>1. Rename it to Savant Syndrome</p>
<p>Savant Syndrome is the primary topic of the article. Autistic Savant is either a subset of Savant Syndrome or an out of date term depending on your point of view. I think we can reference autistic savant as both, and idiot savant as an out of date term. If I am understanding the rename instructions properly this is a bit of a project in and of itself.</p>
<p>2. Use the U. of Wisconsin site <a href="http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as the primary source.</p>
<p>It's big, it's comprehensive and it's up to date.</p>
<p>3. Include a discussion of splinter skills</p>
<p>People reading the article seem to conclude that any fictional portrayal of low intelligence and some special skill is a portrayal of Savant Syndrome. This suggests to me that the article is not doing a very good job of describing what Savant Syndrome is or the skills of people who have it. A longer discussion of the splinter skills and their common roots should help. Clarify that splinter skills are critical to the definition.</p>
<p>4. Trim the "Famous Autistic Savants" and rename to "Famous people with Savant Syndrome"</p>
<p>Rather than a list of people who may or may not have Savant Syndrome, for each person include the specifics: the handicap and the splinter skills. Remove all entries for which we don't have documentation. It will not only help illustrate the syndrome, it will help with the tendency to add various miscellaneous "odd and very skilled" people to the list. A list of people with Savant Syndrome would include Kim Peek (who is not autistic).</p>
<p>5. Trim the "Fictional Portrayals" to fictional characters with a mental handicap and Savant Syndrome splinter skills</p>
<p>Various fictional "superman" or special mental skills are not portrayals of Savant Syndrome. I am not familiar with everything on the list, but looking around it looks like most entries are reasonable but I would order it from most to least reality based. It's reasonable to make the test for fictional portrayals is weaker than that for real world examples but at some point it gets silly.</p>

<p>"Savant" is a person with knowledge. I think you are describing Savant Syndrome, which now that I look I notice is missing for the wikipedia. An austistic savant is an austistic person with Savant Syndrome.</p>
<p>Much of the controversy over this article comes from the mismatch of the entry title and the contents. Perhaps most of the text should be moved to a new article "Savant Syndrome", with this article just a short discussion of Savant Syndrome in autism. Meanwhile I corrected the summary to refer to Savant Syndrome, since that's really what this article is about.</p>

<p>Less than 50% of the savants are autistic. Savant`s differ from the normal person in that certain genes are not expressed properly during neurogenesis or even later on in life, so they lack certain properties of the brain in particular "neural filters" or connections. Savants are a great riddle for all of neurology but it is clear by now - by general concensus - that they are lacking brain functions and not having aditional functionality. It is also clear from an evolutionary perspective that the process of gene epxression in the brain to alter brain function so that new features emerge takes lots of generations rather than one generation in which a whole new functionality can only appear through damage. Rather savants lack certain functions which are masked in healthy individuals and thus give insight into various functions of the brain which would be very hard to study in healthy individuals. One way to study such properties in healthy individuals is via transcranial magentic stimulation, but the technique is everything from sophisticated and very inaccurate - as one can easily imagine by the mere modelling of the magnetic and electric field lines. Perhaps in the future additional conductor materials that are injected and not impacting the health of the individual may help the efficacy of those methods. So please correct this article and incorporate precise state of the art knowledge. Slicky 09:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've moved and edited this page to reflect modern nomenclature. An idiot savant is not the same as a savant, as evidenced by the oxymoronic pairing of the term "idiot" with "savant". A savant is a person with a (usually) high and specialized intellect in a field or fields without regard to other capabilities.</p>
<p>The term "autistic savant" is now used partly to remove the pejorative sense of "idiot" but more in recognition that the disability is seen most often in diagnosed autism. <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 02:09, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some say only about half the cases are assoc with autism. I'm with Jef Reinten (above). It seems ludicrous to refer to nonautistic people like Kim Peek as autistic savants. Seems to me a choice between "savant syndrome" or "savantism". Maybe "savant" but that does have the broader meaning. <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 05:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The term autistic savant is misleading as it suggests that all of these people are autistic. In fact less than half of all savants are autistic. Most scientists working in this area now simply refer to these people as savants or as having savant syndrome. Refer to the further reading that I have added for more information, once I have collected more I will change the heading. Jef Reinten 06:43, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Considering that most people are familiar with the term "idiot savant" (i.e. 5.4 times more prevalant on Google), and more importantly, because the term "autistic savant" is highly misleading and equally offensive (or at least obstructive) to idiot savants who aren't autistic, I suggest we reconsider the title of this article instead of pandering to linguistic revisionism for more "PC" standards. Personally, my vote goes to "savant syndrome", which not only is most often used in medical terminology, but is only about half as prevalant as "autistic savant" on Google and might in fact outstrip it in layman use if it is properly acknowledged. This term is not only up to "modern nomenclature" standards, but is also far more accurate in describing the vast array of people who have the syndrome but aren't necessarily autistic. 66.229.227.145 22:45, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the confusion comes from the history of the term "autistic". Autism as it was defined up until sometime in the 70s or 80s was a severe handicap always associated with severe limitation in some mental skills and most particularly communications skills. Rain Man was a reasonably accurate portrayal of this definition of autism. The current definition is much broader and describes what is frequently a much less severe handicap. The skills of a savant present a very dramatic contrast between the high and the low; quirky smart people are not savants. I would suggest "savant syndrome" to minimize the confusion since people no longer associate the term autism with a very severe mental handicap. Margaretolson 19:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I made minor edits to the definition to match the [autism] page and standard definitions of autistic savant. Margaretolson 01:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The nomenclature is still confusing. I agree that a more appropriate heading may be under 'savant syndrome'. As is noted <a href="http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/faq.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/faq.cfm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, only half of 'idiot savants' are autistic -- and it seems to me that 'autistic savant', 'idiot savant', et al are often used to generally refer to those with extraordinary skills despite great mental handicap.</p>
<p>I think it may have been a bit hasty to restrict the article to say that 'autistic savantism' is exclusively for those with autism -- but this is mainly a problem of the confusing nomenclature. Should there be two different articles, explicity seperating 'autistic savants' from the general 'savant syndrome?' Are they considered distinct phenomenon by the medical community? This seems a little redundant to me -- the most appropriate answer seems to be to have one article under 'savant syndrome' that includes all areas of mental handicap, and have all common nomenclature redirect to it. The fact that autism is commonly associated with the syndrome could be elaborated upon in the new article. Any thoughts? -<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschel_4f32.html" title="User:Herschel">Herschel</a> 13:57, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am inclined to agree that there should be one article called Savant Syndrome that mentions autistic savants as a major but not the only category. It did not really occur to me that this article might be covering both subjects, given it's title of "Austistic Savant". I'm a bit new to editing the wikipedia and perhaps don't know what things to check. I'm also having a bit of trouble figuring where in this talk page new comments show up.Margaretolson 01:08, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the names that do not match standard definitions of autistic savant. Margaretolson 01:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please see my comments above on terminology. A savant is the person who can play Mozart by ear but can't handle a job flipping burgers. If you can find a job that matches the savants skills they can do well, but this never involves interacting with people. Cleaning up and clarifying the terminology will help clean up the inclusion list. The listing of an IT executive on the main page perpetuates misunderstanding. Margaretolson 19:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have noticed that some of the individuals listed in the article are either not autistic and/or not savants. I would appreciate it if others could browse the lists and apply their own knowledge and experience of those listed to confirm the validity of their inclusion, particularly in cases where they're on the autistic spectrum, but savantism is not present. The same applies to the film and literature section. It might also pay to include in this section of the talk page any related edits and the reasoning behind making them, to act as a reference point for potential editors that seek to (re)include these individuals in the future.

I'm likewise removing K-Pax and the sci-fi entries. Being a lightning calculator does not make one autistic; if the Mentats belong on this list, so does Mr. Spock.

<p>I have removed nonsense to the effect that some of these people work in mathematics. Numerical calculation is not at all the same as mathematics. Lest anyone think I'm talking about sophisticated mathematics understood only by professionals, I hasten to add that I am not. Consider the Pythagorean theorem, a statement known to all 15-year-olds (Except, perhaps, in the USA and among some isolated xenophobic tribes of cannibals). If one discovers a new proof of that theorem, one has done a bit of elementary mathematics. If one relies on the theorem to know which numerical calculations need to be done to solve a problem, then the person to whom one entrusts the details of the calculation need not understand the mathematics. This is not to say that calculating prodigies do not understand any of the mathematics that justifies their calculations; rather, it means that the field in which they are prodigies is numerical calculation; they are not discovering any new mathematics. This error is another instance of the fact that most educated lay persons do not suspect that such a field as mathematics exists. For example, a professor of medicine once asked me whether graduate students in mathematics must discover new things in mathematics in order to earn a PhD. Of course, as in other fields, the answer is "yes", but this professor went on to say, "Isn't all of mathematics already known?" In fact, hundreds of scholarly journals are devoted primarily to the incessant publication of new discoveries in mathematics -- not something that those autistic savants do, contrary to the statement I've just corrected on this page. Notice the strange negative way in which the medical doctor phrased the question: instead of saying "Is everything already known?" she said "Isn't everything already known?" It seems as if people use that negative form only when their talking about an assumption they've made without thinking about it. I question any assertion that those autistic savants to who someone said may be working "in the field of mathematics" have made novel discoveries suitable for publication in the aforementioned journals. And no one replied here on this talk page, for months. That is why, being reminded on my own discussion page that I had written that query, I came back to this page today and altered it. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:38, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm curious as to the extent at which an autistic savant with calculating skills can calculate -- both for an "average" savant with this skill (insofar as much as there can be such a thing as an average savant&#160;;)) and for somebody who is <i>particularly</i> adept at calculation. For instance, in <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain_Man_bc4a.html" title="Rain Man">Rain Man</a>, Raymond is shown calculating the square root of a randomly-chosen number (presumably with an irrational result; I haven't checked) accurately to a good number of decimal places. That seems outrageous to me, as if it were just fictional drama that couldn't really happen, but has it actually been done?--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">Furrykef</a> 01:56, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't give you the kind of documentary evidence you're probably seeking (though I'm sure there's literature on the web) but there are stories of actual autistic savants who could calculate quite a few primes, or give a day of the week for any date in the past, correcting for leap years and the switch from the Gregorian calendar. Most of these stories deal with an area of specialization, as opposed to all-around calculating genius. I would not be at all surprised if a Rain Man could calculate square roots with precision. I can even envision how it could be done, though I certainly couldn't do it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I should remark, though, that autistic savants are a tiny, tiny, fraction of the autistic community, but there are quite a few autistics who are able to impressively excell in various intellectual pursuits, especially when they are able to use visualization to understand the problem. Temple Grandin has become an expert in humane treatment of food animals by being able to visualize the animals' fears. This is qualitatively different from the more typical scientific method, which might make decisions based on strictly human testing and observation.--<a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 02:14, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, I understand all that, I'm just thinking the information would be good to have when somebody who knows or bothers to look it up comes along. Calculating primes or giving the day of the week for a date in the past is pretty darn impressive, but it doesn't seem to be something that the layman would relate to as easily -- primes don't mean much to most people and quickly calculating dates to that precision doesn't sound as impressive as it is. People can relate to a square root, though, because they know what it is and they know that doing one of a randomly-chosen number (with that precision) in your head is pretty impossible for the normal person no matter how smart they are. Of course this is only my opinion, but in any case I think it's good information to have here.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">Furrykef</a> 15:07, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well. Firstly as a computer programmer, I don't really see a distinction in required skill set between being able to verify a number is prime and take a square root. They both involve the same type of basic calculation skills. Furthermore, I think that you overestimate the difficulty of taking a square root. Prime factoring is actually a harder problem, quantatatively. If you have a good memory and you can subtract in your head pretty well, you can convert a number into binary or hex pretty quickly and then take its square root pretty fast too. Personally, I can't do it because I suck at mental arithmetic, but I don't at all doubt that someone who had significantly elevated abilities in numerical calculation would be able to. And indeed, its one of the challenges of the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_Calculation_World_Cup_1a15.html" title="Mental Calculation World Cup">Mental calculation world cup</a>. Of course, this article, and all those I've read, come rather short on actual timings for these feats. I wonder, do these people calculate significantly faster than someone would be able to on paper? Obviously, anyone who can factor a six-digit prime in a few minutes can... But taking a square root of a six-digit number would be child's play by comparison. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ostrich_9910.html" title="User:The Ostrich">The Ostrich</a> 23:24, 29 Apr 2006 (GMT)</p>
<p>Calendar calculations aren't all that hard if you are very good at mental arithmetic and have an extremely good memory. The same is true for the other calculation tricks mentioned above. Some autistic people (my brother, for example) can do most of this. Whether or not they will do it for you on request is another question. I am also a programmer, I personally am not at all good at mental arithmetic (too much of the arithmetic required in my childhood homework assignments was solved by "Matt what is...?"). He can calculate considerably faster than I can on paper and in less time than it takes to pull out the calculator and punch in the numbers. Savant is a hard test, and this article does not reflect this. I will wait a few weeks for more comments before rewriting it. Margaretolson 19:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

               I don't agree. Loe shows the hints of authism you`ll find in a regular young man's psychological buildup. The protagonist rather devotes himself to a authistic-like  state of mind in order to cope with the pressure of filling an identity. If anything, the book blurs the line between authism and "normality."

<p>autistic are not idiots.they are autistic how are idiots,but you can't tell the auther way around.This article should refer to savant syndrom or something.idiot savant are peopol with extraordinary skyls on one area,that contraste charply with ther very low IQ.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a historical reference. According to the sources, the *Autistic savants* (not all people w/ Autism are savants) typically have low I.Q.s with extraordinary skills in an area. So it's not exactly incorrect. Also, I changed the "not always associated with autism" because the description is, shock, autistic savant. <a href="../../../s/z/a/User%7ESZadeh_0b00.html" title="User:SZadeh">SZadeh</a> 19:34, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the page it says...</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Guthrie, autistic savant with calendar and sports trivia skills, behavioral basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the film "Rain Man"</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT in the page about <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Peek_d62b.html" title="Kim Peek">Kim_Peek</a> it says that HE is the basis for the rain man character. Can someone clear this up?</p>
<p>Yeah it says it was Kim Peek on the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain_Man_bc4a.html" title="Rain Man">Rain Man</a> page, the <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Peek_d62b.html" title="Kim Peek">Kim Peek</a> page and i think the simpsons page [$pringfield]] <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitbitz.xx_1ca5.html" title="User:Bitbitz.xx">Bitbitz.xx</a> 08:08, 8 December 2006 (UTC) =)</p>
<p>I believe Dustin Hoffman studied a variety of well known Savant Syndrome individuals as preparation for the film and that the role was an amalgam of them. Kim Peek was possibly the most influential savant but it would be incorrect to imply that the film was entirely based on him.</p>

<p>In the "Movies and literature" section, Forrest Gump has been added and removed several times -- it seems that there is some disagreement as to whether he could qualify as an example for this article. It would be nice if some agreement could be reached as to if he should be included or not.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that he fulfills the criteria given by the article. Although not explicity stated that he is autistic, he has low I.Q., is borderline retarded, and exhibits extraordinary skills in many areas. I would think that he is one of the most notable uses of the 'idiot genius' archetype in film and literature. What do other people think? -<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschel_4f32.html" title="User:Herschel">Herschel</a> 13:41, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Savant Syndrome and Austistic Savant are reasonably precisely defined and describe a set of characteristics that occur in real people. Forrest Gump may be a low IQ character who exhibits extraordinary skills, but his is a completely fictional character. Unlike "Rain Man" there aren't (to my knowledge) real people with Forrest Gump's mental skills mix. Or if there are, they don't have Savant Syndrome they have something else.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that if we can write a clear and accurate definition (and I agree my tweaks could use more work) this article could be much less controversial Margaretolson 01:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it just me, or is the Savant Syndrome link in the first paragraph, which redirects to this very article, completely silly and ridiculous to have?</p>

<p>I didn't read this whole talk page I admit. But I read the article and it says "Daniel Tammet, UK. synesthete first recorded savant to have no easily recognizable autism" I looked at the Daniel Tammet page and the first sentence seems to debunk that he has no autism as well as indicating he has many more abilities than 'just' being a synesthete. So basically the description of Tammet in the Autistic savant article seems wrong to me.
