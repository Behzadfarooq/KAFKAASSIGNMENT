<h2><span class="mw-headline">Promotion</span></h2>
<p>I believe that the next step towards improving this article is to work on the "promotion" section. I'd like to hear some thoughts on this, if anyone has any to offer. Personally, what I think is lacking is a one paragraph overview that basically <i>characterizes</i> the album's promotion—the image associated with it, the reality show, maybe the degree of corporate muscle behind it, etc. But it's a difficult thing to write, to be sure of it being entirely accurate—not just broadly, but also in the more subtle aspects where things might be left somewhat open to interpretation—and NPOV. So I'm still thinking about how to craft a paragraph like that. But anyway, I envision a two paragraph section there: one that's a basic outline as described above, and another (well, it might take two) summarizing as briefly as possible the chronological release of the singles and the notable TV performances. Then I'd like to take the rest of the detail and split it off into a subarticle. What does everyone think about that? I know that Tony and maybe John didn't like my last subarticle, so I'd especially like to get their agreement to this proposal. I also hope we can <i>concentrate</i> our efforts on this one section, maybe work through it one sentence at a time, instead of doing massive rewrites that just produce conflict. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:34, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that the next step towards improving this article is to trim it massively and remove large amounts of trivial, non-encyclopaedic information which is only of interest to hard-core fans. Please stop reverting any changes you don't like, Everyking - yours is not the final word. You're making this article worse and worse. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 04:35, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Insults aside, could you identify what in the article you consider trivial and nonencyclopedic, so perhaps we can talk about it? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:43, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I am sorry if you perceived an insult in what I wrote - none was intended. I'm just trying to be honest. There have been plenty of suggestions of what should be changed about this article, and plenty of attempts to edit it according to what the broad concensus suggests, but you've ignored and reverted everything. It looks like it would be a waste of time for me to list my concerns as well, or edit the article at all, while you continue to revert people's well-intended editing with comments like <i>ok, there was one useful change i found in there, but rv the rest, i don't like it</i>. You should stop behaving like you have the final say on this article, and then it will improve, because many people can produce better work than one person alone - that's what this whole Wikipedia lark is about, no?</dd>
<dd>By the way I did really like your 'Astronomy-cruft' comment about the Cat's Eye Nebula article&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:11, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It isn't like I have any greater say than anybody else. Now that I've moved out so much detail into subarticles, I'm not sure what's left to be considered trivial fancruft. I'd be open to considering anything if it was pointed out to me; I intend to nominate it on FAC again at some point down the road, and I'd like to have at least some people's objections addressed before I go ahead with that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:27, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My rewrite</span></h2>
<p>Hopefully this thing will work out properly this time because I'm really sick of having to deal with all this, ahem, crap. I think the article's a tiny little bit lopsided in its POV, especially regarding the reviews; I tried to balance this by taking out one paragraph full of nothing but positive quotes from the Village Voice, but overall, there are noticeably more positive than negative quotes about the album. Anyway, please avoid blanket reverts. You urge me to discuss and then go ahead and revert without leaving a note on the talk. "Do as I say, not as I do" isn't very encouraging (the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> is a good example). One or two mistakes or bad wording don't give you licence to just destroy everything. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:14, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's like I didn't even write what I did above. Please avoid massive rewrites, let's concentrate on one section at a time and work gradually...and then you go making a massive rewrite. The offer still stands. Let's work gradually and discuss things individually. I'm not saying things have to meet with my approval beforehand. I'm just saying we should work gradually and concentrate on discussion. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 17:56, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you're so eager to discuss, then I suppose you could start by explaining what was wrong with my changes. And I see no good reason to not rewrite; I'm just following community consensus since a lot of people on FAC and PR asked that the article be trimmed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:12, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>You removed some info. Looking over the edit, I see now it was not quite as massive as it first appeared. I'll think about incorporating some of your changes back into the article. In any case, I really want us to focus on working on one part of the article at a time and reach a consensus about it, and then move on to another. I suggested we work on the promotion section that way, but if you like, we can start with the lead.</p>

<p>One difference that stands out is that you changed it to say "is the title of..." This isn't conventional, is it? We don't start bio articles like "John Forbes Kerry is the name of...", or anything like that, generally speaking. Your revised second sentence may constitute an improvement, it may be more clear, I'm not sure. You changed "helping to set her apart from her sister" to "distinguishing", which is less wordy, I'll grant, but I'd rather that it said "helping" in there somewhere. Also, at the beginning you use the word "debut" twice in quick succession, which I don't like. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:26, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So your solution is to revert instead of fixing those problems? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 19:22, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there are problems, they can still be fixed, John. I'm getting tired of talking to myself and hearing my own echo.

<dd>Then why is your solution to the problems reverting? You err on the side of keeping your edits; I err on the side of deferring to others. That's why I haven't bothered to revert you and I don't revert edits I don't like to articles I had a heavy hand in writing just because I don't like them. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> in particular trimmed <a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Day_in_the_Life_a6f0.html" title="A Day in the Life">A Day in the Life</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Long_and_Winding_Road_8bc0.html" title="The Long and Winding Road">The Long and Winding Road</a>, something I was not very happy about but did not revert.

Instead, I tried to incorporate his changes into the article. You seem more interested in preserving your work, assuming that just because it's been there for so long, it's better to err on its side than on the side of someone else's edit. I repeat: <b>Blanket reverting an edit with good changes in it instead of fixing the bad changes is not a solution to any dispute</b>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 04:42, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a blanket revert. More than 90% of my changes were reverted, and if anything, I find your version less informative. People who don't know much about the record industry might wonder how "Pieces of Me" was a hit before the album's release; calling it a hit single clarifies that. And just what was the error with the vocal backing track on SNL? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 06:33, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to create a separate "promotion and publicity" article (suggestions for better phrasing?). This article will continue to grow quite substantially in the future, and I need more space before I can even start to address <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">User:Sjc</a>'s FAC objection (it was Sjc, right?). So I would like it if everyone involved in this dispute would state their opinions on this and hopefully agree that they will vote to keep the subarticle if it gets listed on VfD. Tony hasn't been saying anything much on this lately, but he's a prime suspect for wanting to delete the subarticles, so an agreement from him to vote keep would be especially good to hear. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:43, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because you can't solve editing issues in the main article doesn't mean you offload the problem to other articles. That's getting seriously near fancruft and I would gladly vote to delete and/or merge &amp; redirect.

<dd>What is it with you? The only problem to be solved is overcrowding. Now how am I supposed to "solve" that in the main article without simply deleting a bunch of valid content, which would be even worse than having a 50KB article? The way to solve is it to move it out to a subarticle, which is what I'm trying to do, so if you could just agree to it, that would be great. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:53, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you are right, then. But I don't know what in the article you think is fancruft, because you haven't told me. You complained about the chart stuff, but that's fixed now. So what's left?

<dd>The singles charting info should be moved. The promotion section could be condensed (instead of giving each appearance one sentence, chuck as many as you can into one sentence). And we don't need to know what songs Ashlee performed at each appearance; just say she performed tracks from the album at performances X, Y and Z in Europe or she performed a hit single at concerts F and G. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 06:33, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, John, we aren't so far apart, really. I could accept removing the singles chart data, since it's already in the singles articles as well as <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_sales_and_chart_positions.html" title="Autobiography sales and chart positions">Autobiography sales and chart positions</a>. But the problem is that having it seems to be standard for album articles, and I hate to break with convention... As for promotion, I think we basically agree there, too. It's just that I want to preserve the info elsewhere, whereas you seem to want to remove it without moving it anywhere else. But if you could just agree to vote keep on a subarticle, that problem would be resolved. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:54, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is a <i>free</i> resource; there's absolutely no reason to rely on external links, none of which are likely to survive for all that long in the scheme of things, in place of having the information here. I don't ever argue Wikipedia ought to be a knowledge base or whatever you deletionists are always saying, but I believe the promotion of a multiplatinum album across several countries is a notable subject and therefore warrants inclusion. Tell you what, John: we'll compromise. I'll remove the singles chart data if you agree to support a promotion subarticle.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wholesale reversion</span></h2>
<p>I don't agree with what was effectively a wholesale reversion of my edits to the article. The only things you allowed to remain were rewords which didn't alter the article's POV, like my change of "but it gets" to "which is". Other changes actively removed POV from the article, like my change from "<i>The Village Voice</i> praised Simpson's singing, stating:" to "<i>The Village Voice</i> described Simpson's voice, stating that:". The following quote reads "Simpson can pack so much contradictory emotion into a single line—a single word—that the music can barely contain it," which can be interpreted as praise, but may not. If the reader wants to interpret it as praise, let them, rather than informing them of what is praise before they are allowed to make their own judgment. I don't engage in reverting, because it never works anyway, the other user will simply revert my revert anyway, so I won't change the article any further. However, I think it should be said that any time an editor decides to give up on an article because of another user's actions, it displays a great failing on the part of one of the users, and in this case, it certainly isn't mine. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 04:19, Jan 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say I kept a fair proportion of your changes. I'm always glad to have a fresh pair of eyes look the article over; sometimes they spot something I've been overlooking, and in your case you did catch some things. As for the <i>VV</i>, it certainly is praise, if you read the review, but if the point is important to you, I'll change it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:03, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said, those were examples. I resent that I have to spell it out to you, but I suppose I shall.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yours: Autobiography <i>is the first album by the American singer Ashlee Simpson. It was released in the United States by Geffen Records on [[July 20, 2004, and debuted <b>there</b> at number one <b>in sales</b>.</i></dd>
<dd>Mine: Autobiography <i>is the first album by the American singer Ashlee Simpson. It was released in the United States by <a href="../../../g/e/f/Geffen_Records_6b65.html" title="Geffen Records">Geffen Records</a> on July 20, 2004, and debuted at number one.</i></dd>
<dd>You reverted that. Why? The "there" is simple redundancy. There is no purpose for it whatsoever. As for "in sales", it's unnecessary. What else could it have debuted at number one in, bananas? Sales is obvious, it doesn't need to be said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next change was mostly semantics, I don't mind really, but it's not as much Simpson's show as it is MTV's. She doesn't own it. MTV does.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next edit clearly removed POV, and yet you reinserted it.</dd>
<dd>Yours: <i>As she said just before the album's U.S. release:</i></dd>
<dd>Mine: <i>Prior to the album's release, Simpson said:</i></dd>
<dd>Saying "as she said" is to agree with her. We're not here to agree with anyone. It's an encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I removed this:</dd>
<dd><i>Musically, the album incorporates both rock and pop elements, in notable contrast to the more strongly pop-oriented music of her sister Jessica.</i></dd>
<dd>That has already been stated in the intro. Why be redundant? It's probably the reason why this article is so ridiculously oversized. You put it back in.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next part is simply horribly written. It begins with <i>Critical reviews of</i> Autobiography <i>have been mixed,</i> and yet what follows are a series of quotes which praise the album. Only in the next paragraph are the negative reviews. An intro to a paragraph should discuss the paragraph, not that paragraph and the next one after it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your repeated linking of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a>, you should be aware that one is not supposed to link the same thing multiple times. If absolutely necessary, one can link again later in the page, but how is this necessary?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then you reverted my change from "[[suburb|suburban]]" to "[[suburb]]an". I have no idea what you're thinking doing that, the linking style you reverted to is plainly incorrect. In the same paragraph, you removed a link I placed to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a>. No idea why. You just removed it. Great.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next part has me baffled. You appear to have misunderstood a quote.</dd>
<dd>Yours: <i>The fifth track, "Love Makes the World Go Round", was described as "a smooth, clean, Top40 ready slice of generic pop" by IGN in its review.</i> People <i>magazine, however, said that Simpson "succumbs to cliché" on this song.</i></dd>
<dd>Mine: <i>The fifth track, "Love Makes the World Go Round", was described as "a smooth, clean, Top40 ready slice of generic pop" by IGN in its review, <b>and</b></i> People <i>magazine said that Simpson "succumbs to cliché" on this song.</i></dd>
<dd>The IGN quote is negative, just as the People quote is negative. You really think "generic pop" is a compliment? That's incredible. I don't know how anyone could possibly consider it a compliment. Here, you have reverted to a version where a negative quote is treated as a positive one, and even compared to a negative quote.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You do the same again in the next reversion of my edit.</dd>
<dd>Yours: <i>"Better Off", the album's sixth track, was described by</i> People <i>magazine as a "bubbly" song that "should have Hilary Duff worried". <b>However,</b> IGN, <b>in its review of the album,</b> called it a "slow-to-mid-tempo shuffle that actually features some poignant imagery", but "falls victim to the run-of-the-mill production and eventually simplistic lyrics."</i></dd>
<dd>Mine: <i>"Better Off", the album's sixth track, was described by</i> People <i>as a "bubbly" song that "should have Hilary Duff worried". IGN called it a "slow-to-mid-tempo shuffle that actually features some poignant imagery", but which "falls victim to the run-of-the-mill production and eventually simplistic lyrics."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both of the quotes are positive. You're saying "however" as if they're complete opposites. The third quote could perhaps be preceded by a "however", at most.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I removed some redundancy in the next section, which you replaced, fine, I won't go over that again. But then you replaced the <b>incredibly</b> POV word "humorously". I don't find it funny. Steven Hawking's football boots don't find it funny. Maybe you do, but you are POV, everyone is POV, that's why we try to stop ourselves. But I remove your POV, and you are either blind to it or prefer to actually leave POV in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next paragraph begins with "it", which puts a lot of stress on the word. It literally has to carry the sentence. I replaced it with the song title, but no, you reverted it. Bad writing seems to be your preference.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next thing you did, I also do not understand.</dd>
<dd>Yours: <i>"You can't push a river, you can't make me fall / but you can make me unreachable," <b>she sings</b>.</i></dd>
<dd>Mine: <i>"You can't push a river, you can't make me fall / but you can make me unreachable."</i></dd>
<dd>How is "she sings" necessary? It makes it sound like a fan site, and doesn't add anything. Are people going to be mistaken and think that someone else sings that line? No, they're not stupid. "She sings" would be fine on your home page, but keep it off Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Next you remove my links to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minute.html" title="Minute">minute</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second.html" title="Second">second</a>. No reasoning I can see, perhaps you can enlighten me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, you side with Simpson, and this introduce POV.</dd>
<dd>Yours: <i>Perhaps the <b>most notable</b> of Simpson's 2004 televised performances came when she appeared on</i> Saturday Night Live <i>as a musical guest on the night of October 23/24, and was scheduled to perform "Pieces of Me" and then "Autobiography". She was unable to perform the second of these songs due to an embarrassing error with a vocal backing track, which <b>she</b></i> <b>needed because her voice was weak that night due to acid reflux (a condition which had also featured on <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i>).</b></dd>
<dd>Mine: <i>Perhaps the <b>best known</b> of Simpson's 2004 televised performances came when she appeared on</i> Saturday Night Live <i>as a musical guest on the night of October 23/24, and was scheduled to perform "Pieces of Me" and then "Autobiography". She was unable to perform the second of these songs due to an error with a vocal backing track, which <b>was said to be</b> needed because her voice was weak that night due to acid reflux (a condition which had also featured on</i> The Ashlee Simpson Show<i>).</i></dd>
<dd>Whether it is "most notable" is not for you or anyone else to say. But the fact that it is best known is simply undebatable. And as for the conclusive statement that she needed the voice track because of acid reflux: proof, please? Mine is more accurate. It gives the reason stated, rather than giving the reason. Even if someone were quoted as saying it, it doesn't mean it's true. You can't just say "This is the facts because Ashlee Simpson said it". There is full motive for not being honest here, and while I don't know which way is true, I think that no one else does, either. No one can prove it either way, and the article should reflect this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next (the/their) is semantics, mine is better English, but we've covered bad writing already. Then I added the word "also", which you removed. Mine clarified that we were still talking about the same episode. Yours is unclear.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know how you can claim that you kept a fair amount of my changes in the article. I just listed the things you didn't keep, and on a cursory glance through the diffs, you kept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28album%29&amp;diff=9047358&amp;oldid=9038981" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autobiography_%28album%29&amp;diff=9047358&amp;oldid=9038981" rel="nofollow">four minor changes</a>. I don't know what you consider "fair" about that, but perhaps you'd like to specify that yourself.</dd>

<p>All right, all right, you make some good points. I'll go through the article and change some things accordingly. The problem with a lot of it was that a paragraph placement got moved and therefore a whole bunch of paragraphs were red, making it difficult for me to determine what was changed. So I erred on the side of caution and restored my version. But with most of what you point out, I agree with you. I think Jessica's only linked once; she was linked twice, but you fixed that, and then I kept your fix. I think I remember doing that. I also kept your change of "most notable" to "best known". As for the "Love Makes the World Go Round" issue, the quote <i>seems</i> positive to me. "Smooth", "clean", "top40 ready"...all that sounds positive to me. "Generic pop" obviously doesn't. So I think it's mixed, and I'll change that accordingly. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:04, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your use of wholesale reverts on articles relating to Ashlee Simpson is damaging, in my opinion.

<p>It needs to be compressed. The quotes are too long and the over-faithful reproduction of every "I was like" and "um" from interviews and shows makes her look like an imbecile. There is too much devoted to lovingly cataloguing every single TV show performance of every single track. Just because something happened and there is abundant information about it doesn't mean that it is worth devoting a lot of space to. At the same time when people try to put really important things (like Autobiography staying in the top 2 for five weeks) into the top paragraph, don't remove them. That's where really important things belong.</p>
<p>Don't make a meal out of the obvious. Of course Autobiography is autobiographical ("According to Simpson, the songs on Autobiography are, as the title suggests, strongly autobiographical"). You don't need to treat this as speculation by Simpson, she <i>knows</i>. A strong statement ("Simpson says the album was inspired by 'what I have gone through in the past three years'...") would be good here.</p>
<p>There are too many quotes from rock media. Don't sweat it, don't even bother to attribute within the text when that would be intrusive. Summarise and put the source in the "External links" for those who want the skinny. Five paragraphs on the critical reception? Trim it to two. Trim it to one if you can. One sentence if you dare. Rolling Stone, NY Times and the Voice matter, the rest dont.</p>
<p>You don't need to laboriously describe banal detail. This, for instance:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the video, which includes considerable symbolism, Simpson plays two different versions of herself, blonde and brunette, who live in separate "worlds" which exist side by side. The world of the blonde Ashlee appears happy and perfect, while the brunette Ashlee seems to have more negative feelings—at one point she shoves a bowl of cereal prepared by the blonde Ashlee off a kitchen table—but eventually it is revealed that the blonde Ashlee is not as happy as she seems. At the end of the video, shadows are seen symbolically leaving the brunette Ashlee.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Compare with this:</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat, trim out what is not necessary. Don't be scared to be ruthless, you can always restore stuff if you change your mind. But don't just keep adding stuff until you've given the thing a serious pruning for relevance.</p>

<dd>I've been working on quote trimming for a while; I've removed a lot of ums and you knows. One thing I'm uncertain about is whether um should be replaced by ... or just eliminated completely. I've been putting in ..., just because I live in fear of factual inaccuracy of the slightest kind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You say not to make a meal out of the obvious; well, someone else added in that "according to Simpson" to the "strongly autobiographical" part. I had just written it as a plain statement of fact before. I thought the change was perhaps of questionable merit, but I could see some sense in it, so out of deference to the work of others I left it in. As you can see, your claims about my proprietorial attitude are greatly exaggerated. In fact, I often err on the side of favoring others' revisions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I just plain disagree with you about the reviews/criticism, both due to theoretical reasons (I feel that detail is notable and relevant) and practical ones (people who read this article may very well be considering whether or not they want to invest a few dollars in the album, and an accurate, reasonably complete assessment of the album's critical reception helps greatly). I've even thought about creating a subarticle for that, so I can add more, but I've so far declined to do so because of the opposition I'd expect and because I'm uncertain how to implement it with the article's present format. (And also because the thought of having yet more to maintain, update and expand makes my head hurt.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the "Shadow" video: well, I think that's useful info, but you must remember that this article was originally written at a time when the subarticles we now have didn't exist, so I was throwing in every detail that had any kind of significance. Now, there's somewhere else it can go, so I'd be open to summarizing that about the video a bit more, although I think your version is too radical in that regard. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:26, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It doesn't matter who put the rubbish in to start with, you have resisted practically every single attempt by other editors to change it to something better. The subarticles I regard as a huge error because they have only been created, every single one of them, because of your unwillingness to permit this article to be edited properly. The nonsense about "blonde Ashlee" and "brunette Ashlee" are amateurish, literal-minded and very wasteful of the reader's time. So she wears a wig to illustrate the symbolism, what else is she going to do, blackface? People who want to know whether to buy the album <i>will</i> be grateful if you pop the review links into "External links", but they'll be doubly grateful if you'll just say whether the main players gave it a thumbs up or a thumbs down. If they need more they won't rely on a Wikipedia summary of the reviews anyway, they'll use the links.</p>
<p>About your attempts to trim the verbal tics out of the quotes. You have repeatedly resisted attempts to trim the following monstrosity.</p>
<p>"I think that it's an album that's, like, very true to my emotion; I think that, you know, people like to hear when somebody's being real, and you can, like, tell, if you listen to an album, if they're being real or not..." ("</p>

<dl>
<dd>The problem with the demographic aim of recordings is that short of a direct statement from the label, you would have to reverse engineer it. That would be original research at best, but more likely it would end up as repeated speculation from the popular press. Pop performers routinely throw out the "all ages" statement, it's standard practice. The article perhaps could point out that the Ashlee Simpson Show had a particularly strong showing in the Nielsen 18-34 bracket, but really that belongs in the article for the show. SoundScan doesn't capture purchaser ages, only geography, so those reports wouldn't help much for this either. The target for this album was 12-34, but getting an official to say that on the record may prove difficult. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 01:34, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>There's no consensus if Everyking doesn't agree. Call it the majority. The overwhelming majority. Everyone else.

<p>The term for the concept you are describing is <i>unanimity</i>. A consensus typically differs from unanimity in allowing for some outriders who consciously abstain from or oppose a collective decision. For instance on VfD a "rough consensus" concept is used that permits a decision for deletion to be taken despite a significant minority of objections. The bar for rough consensus varies according to the admin who makes the decision, but values such as 2/3 (popularly regarded as the working minimum) and 4/5 are typical. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:12, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Read the article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a>, Tony. It (correctly) excludes those measures as "consensus".</p>
<p>In diplomacy, a consensus really is "everyone agrees". That's why treaty language is <i>so</i> rigid. In general, it means "everyone consents". That doesn't mean all agree but it means the solution is at least <i>acceptable</i> to all. I know you think that the majority should steamroller the minority -- although I'm astonished to see that you suggest that a <i>third</i> of views can be ignored -- but it is clear that you do not have a good understanding of what a "consensus" actually is.</p>
<p>The "rough consensus" concept is used by deletionists so that they can ignore the view that certain articles should be kept. VfD is the most pernicious section of Wikipedia, a breeding ground for discontent. I agree that it would be unworkable if one or two holdouts prevented articles that breach the policy from being deleted, but holding article popularity contests is, I'm certain, not what was intended when it was invented.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:26, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The exclusion that you refer to is due to a recent edit to the article on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a> (within the last month) and constitutes a factually false statement ("Such measures do not fit within the definition of consensus given at the beginning of this article." Consensus decision-making is about the process, not the measures used.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, but have a look at what it says about the process, Tony. Discussion, not votes, is the key. Get negatives out into the open and then work out how they can be turned around. You just don't understand the basic concept.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even if what you said were true, your attempt to equate consensus with unanimity is false, because the article still explicitly lists U-1 as a possible definition of a consensus decision.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not equating it with unanimity as such. I am equating it with accord. They're not the same. My version of a consensus doesn't involve a poll as such, unless it is a means to uncover dissent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, consensus as understood in that article, and as I understand it, requires the commitment of all involved that an accord is the aim of the process. That's not so on <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>, where editors such as Raul and chocolateboy (and to a lesser extent you and Theresa) are not working for an accord (you and Theresa have not worked for a solution for all but only to persuade dissenters to your point of view); and I doubt it is so here, where James's commitment to a consensual solution is sketchy and some on the other side simply want to steamroller him with a majority vote.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The U-1 idea is simply an expression that a single person should not hold up progress by simply being obstructionist. However, you could only employ such a definition if those involved had a priori agreed on it! Otherwise there would be no consensus for the consensus, if you get me.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't consider your claim that "rough consensus" concept is a deletionist end-run tactic, or your description of VfD as a place for "popularity contests" for articles, to be worthy of response.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If "rough consensus" is described as a 2/3 majority, it is hardly aiming for general accord, and this viewpoint is adopted, so far as I know, only by deletionists. And what else would you call VfD, where articles are contested on their "notability" and voted on in a quasi-beauty contest (I use the lawyers' version of that term)? There are guiding criteria, but these are wilfully ignored.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rough consensus is the <i>de facto</i> decision-making method of VfD. "Rough consensus" works because nobody objects to the principle enough to attempt to disrupt the process.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're very wrong on that score. Not only do people object -- fiercely sometimes -- and quite a few of them, but there have been several attempts to disrupt the process. The problem is that those who do object, far from being seen as dissenters whom a consensus should attempt to include, are rather seen as problems who must be dealt with -- and have been -- by further treating the will of the majority as though it were a "consensus".<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is some incongruity in the article, namely the emphasis on comparisons with Jessica Simpson. The whole gist of the album project is supposed to be about Ashlee being judged on her own merits, and the article's admission that the two record different kinds of music illustrates that the comparisons are strained, being made only because they have the same parents. The "I'm not Jessica, waaaahhhhh!" thing should obviously get good coverage in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28song%29.html" title="Shadow (song)">Shadow (song)</a>, and perhaps <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ashlee_Simpson_Show_e83d.html" title="The Ashlee Simpson Show">The Ashlee Simpson Show</a> and/or <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>, but let's keep this article concentrated on the album.

<dd>There's a certain logic to that, and I acknowledge the point. However, emphasis on comparisons has been very strong in the media, in promotion, etc., so it would almost put me in the curious position of pushing a POV unsympathetic to Ashlee to disagree with you on this, that Ashlee should be represented more independently of her sister or her family. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:56, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the "Promotion and publicity" section, the nature of radio adds is misrepresented. Specifically, this does not counter the assertion that publicity drove album sales -- rather, it supports it. Radio addition for new recording acts is a function of promoter effectiveness. I'm not saying that the article should use this as some sort of ammo to demonstrate that Joe is selling a package, only that the false contrast needs to be severed. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 16:20, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just passing by. Er... a quick comment. Isn't this article a bit overdone&#160;? I mean over detailed&#160;? It looks like pretty immature collection of fan details. Maybe lake of ability to distinguish between passion and general encyclopaedic aspects. I suggest this article be condensed to 20ish lines. Bye.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../g/t/a/User%7EGtabary_85f8.html" title="User:Gtabary">Gtabary</a> 17:37, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Long live the stub! May all Wikipedia articles be similarly reduced to a stubbish state, devoid of any detail that could bore the reader. It's an album. From 2004. By Ashlee Simpson. Mixture of pop/rock. Includes POM, Shadow and La La. What else do you need to know? That's plenty! In fact, it's a bit long. We need to trim some of the fat. The ideal Wikipedia article contains information which can be fully articulated in a single word, or better yet, a single syllable; may we all strive towards that goal. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:19, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds like a wonderful idea. Maybe you could demonstrate the technique on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_%28album%29.html" title="Autobiography (album)">Autobiography (album)</a>? --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 19:53, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The suggestion that 20 lines is appropriate is, in fact, wildly inappropriate. I have been as supportive as any of cutting the article down a bit, but there is plenty to say about this album that it should quite easily fill up 32kb, IMO. And I say this as someone who has never heard Ashlee Simpson, but can pretty much guarantee I wouldn't like her if I did. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 04:08, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why was this article moved?

I should have checked <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_dac7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music">WP Music</a> as you pointed out, perhaps the title does need a change again, as do the titles I've suggested on the disambig page; please do feel free to alter as necessary. —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuropedia_a641.html" title="User:Neuropedia">Neuropedia</a> 04:14, 2005 Jan 13 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I fail to see why doing so would be a bad thing. It serves to encourage other editors to fill in the redlinks, something I'm in the process of doing now, once I've taken enough notes on them. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✎</sup></a> 04:53, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about moving it <i>again</i>, but it's under the proper title now. I'll go fix any double redirects now. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✎</sup></a> 06:31, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't have any objection to moving the title, as attached to it as I was. We ought not be biased in favor of stuff from the present day, after all. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:35, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everyking, when you said you would not revert against consensus, what exactly did you mean by that?

<dd>Yes, and a few partiallys add up to an entirely in the end. So, to put words in your mouth then, Everyking, when you said you wouldn't revert against consensus, you meant you <i>would</i> revert against consensus, but would divide your revert up into several steps? If that's not what you meant, please clarify. And tell us what you think the consensus is regarding this article. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 14:53, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
