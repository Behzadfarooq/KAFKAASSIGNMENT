<p>For the years BC, I suggest to add a corresponding year category to the pages on <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category_talk%7EYears_c3cd.html" title="Category talk:Years">Category_talk:Years</a>. Oddly it's being debate if there should be a category for these pages, rather than which one.

Earlier years don't have individual pages, later years are already categorized. - User:Docu</p>
<p>The BC year articles were actually my next target. I've asked for clarification on <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category_talk%7EYears_c3cd.html" title="Category talk:Years">Category_talk:Years</a> on whether they should be categorized by year or by decade.

<p>I recently started creating a system which attempts to suggest appropriate categories for uncategorized articles.</p>
<p>My first idea was to isolate words that commonly appear in article titles, and find categories in which these words also appear, which I successfully implemented. A quick look at the results revealed that the most common words are geographical place-names, especially names of states in the United States. A quick look at the <i>contents</i> of these articles, in turn reveals distinctive patterns created by articles about counties and municipalities which have been created by the <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a>. The upshot of this is that tens of thousands of articles can be categorized with minimal human intervention.</p>
<p>I have created some special routines in my auto-categorization system to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterate over the 50 states of the U.S.</li>
<li>Grep article titles and the first 500 characters of each article for the state name.</li>
<li>Skip disambiguation pages by detecting {{disambig}}, the phrase "is the name of several places", etc.</li>
<li>For the remaining articles, isolate the text of interest. The text of interest is the first 500 characters, excluding a leading div block (usually an image of some kind) and everything after the phrase "As of", which marks the beginning of the Rambot's rambling about census data.</li>
<li>Match key phrases in the text of interest, like "is a town in [[Foo County, Bar]]".</li>
<li>Where key phrases are found, suggest appropriate categories, like "Category:Foo County, Bar" and "Towns in Bar".</li>
<li>Segregate articles that can be automatically classified into one file, and put those that cannot be in another.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system currently knows how to parse towns, villages, cities, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_township.html" title="Civil township">townships</a> that are part of counties, and counties that are part of U.S. states.</p>
<p>It treats <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish.html" title="Parish">parishes</a> in Louisiana, and <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borough.html" title="Borough">boroughs</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census_tract.html" title="Census tract">census areas</a> in Alaska, as the equivalent of counties. It also recognizes boroughs that are part of Pennsylvania counties. In other states, a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borough.html" title="Borough">borough</a> may be part of a township which is turn part of a county. These and all other areas which are part of subdivisions of a county (or equivalent) are also ignored because I'm not sure how they are supposed to be categorized.</p>
<p>Charter townships in Michigan are <i>not</i> automatically added to Category:Charter Townships in Michigan, though they are added to <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETownships_in_Michigan_d882.html" title="Category:Townships in Michigan">Category:Townships in Michigan</a>. The complexity here will have to be addressed manually or by future automation. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:46, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The system has automatically classified about 31,000 articles. I have a human-readable dump, but it's 6.5MB long, and this is unwieldy to post on the wikipedia. A truncated version is posted at /workspace. Please let me know if you would like a copy of the full version.</p>
<p>I also have a machine-readable version (3.4MB) that will need to be passed to a bot that can automatically add a given article to a given category if the article isn't already in a category. (Duplicates like "Alaska_Township,_Minnesota" are noted and removed from the machine-readable version.) I will write such a bot if no one else wants to take responsibility for doing this.</p>
<p>After these articles have been categorized, I will re-run the auto-categorization system and see if what the next-most-common patterns are that might be exploited in a similar fashion. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:46, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think so. There are about 830 existing county-level categories in the United States. It seems a logical place to put articles about a particular region that covers multiple municipalities.

<dd>No, I don't have any particular articles in mind--all that I've come across recently, I've fixed and added categories manually. Could it generate a list of places where A) it did not find rambot county-language AND B) don't already have county categories?

<dd>Not having noticed this project earlier, I failed to notice how many people have been working on categorizing the city articles. The rambot has the advantage of knowing 99% of the city article names without having to parse anything because it created them. As such I don't have to parse through state and county articles to find them. Anyway, I recently did bot runs over all the county and city articles performing a slew of changes. One of those was to perform the categorization. There were a large number of articles that had categorization already, but also many that were missing it. I know there is a list above, and I don't even want to try and go through all of those cities to remove the ones that I've completed. But all of the "Category:COUNTY_NAME County, STATE" and "Category:YYYY in STATE_NAME" where YYYY is the a town, city, etc, have been added. I also created those missing "Category:COUNTY_NAME County, STATE" articles by adding a "Category:STATE_NAME counties" link (See: <a href="../../../w/a/s/Category%7EWashakie_County%2C_Wyoming_3325.html" title="Category:Washakie County, Wyoming">Category:Washakie County, Wyoming</a>). I have not created any missing "Category:YYYY in STATE_NAME" articles, but I could very easily do it on the next bot run. Oh I forgot one thing. There are actually two lists of cities, so I am not totally done with updating the cities, although I've seen Beland's bot working away on that, so the rest may have been caught, but I'll have to run the bot again and catch those cities that are not easily associated with a particular county. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 20:07, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
