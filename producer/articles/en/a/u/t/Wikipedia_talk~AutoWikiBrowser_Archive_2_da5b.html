<p>What does remove categories mean? Do you mean, remove deleted categories from a page? In addition, what is a "database dump"?

<dd>Yes, that is what I mean about categories, the database dump can be found <a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/" class="external text" title="http://download.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it is the entire wikipedia database in XML format. How are you going about the spell checker? I have a plan to implement one fairly simply, but am waiting on Microsoft to release the next beta of WinFX. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 09:43, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I started a script to fix misspellings with <a href="../../../p/o/p/WP%7EPOP_b34f.html" title="WP:POP">navigation popups</a> autoedits, but haven't worked on it in a while. I recently was thinking I could change the script to make an array of words from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_of_common_misspellings_For_machines_8c34.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings/For machines">Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings/For machines</a> and correct them using the AWB - I just need more C# training. Why are you waiting for the next WinFX beta? I know it's the new Vista programming API, but how will that help you spell check?&#160;—&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><big>M</big><small>ATHWIZ</small><big>20</big><small>20</small></a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><big>T</big><small>ALK</small></a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><big>C</big><small>ONTRIBS</small></a></sup> 20:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because it has an extension to allow spell checking in textboxes and richtextboxes, so it would be really simple, and a lot better as it suggests the correct spelling just like a word processor does, which would be really cool. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow... there goes my project. (Does it have an "add" function to add words such as Wikipedia to the dictionary?) Even if you do get your hands on a copy of WinFX beta, how will you extend its benefits to all users?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spam protection?</span></h2>
<p>While editing with the AWB, after I clicked save, I received some notice about "spam protection" but the AWB navigated to the next page on the list before I could read the page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Skip articles with no changes</span></h2>
<p>I found that if the AWB is out of focus when it finds an article with no changes, it will remove the article from the list in the bottom right but the browser will not navigate to the next article on the list - to do so, I have to select start again. Is this problem similar to the one with the save button and, if so, can you fix it using the invoke member script?

<dd>You can't run AWB outside the ZIP file? Strange. Is this a security restriction imposed by your employer which provides your Windows box? I can extract the exe from the zip file and save that in a folder, with the settings file saved to the same folder. I can then copy the settings files to different names and copy them back to the standard name. So I have several settings files. To my knowledge, if I doubleclick onto something inside a zip-archive, winzip (or whatever you use) extracts that file to a temp folder and opens/runs it from there. If you can do that, then I guess you should be able to run exe's from the temp folder. Puzzled. --Adrian Buehlmann 10:38, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's totally bizarre, I have no idea what is causing it, and I would be very surprised if our admin people had imposed this. If I extract the executable from the ZIP file and attempt to execute it, I simply get the error I reported above. I can run it from inside the ZIP file perfectly well, except that it cannot—obviously—see the XML settings file. In any case, wouldn't it be much more convenient if you could pick a file from a dialogue, rather than all that messy copying (which runs the obvious risk of copying in the wrong direction, overwriting stuff and the usual garbage)?

<p>Yesterday when I was delivering <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP">Esperanza</a> news using AWB, I noticed when you had a new message, it comes up with a message box saying something along the lines of "You have a new message. Please answer it before continuing." This confused me, seeing as when I went to look at the message in my other browser, there wasn't one. Then I realised that the page in question that I was trying to save (<a href="../../../s/w/d/User_talk%7ESWD316_2795.html" title="User talk:SWD316">User talk:SWD316</a>) had a fake "You have new messages" banner at the top. Because AWB thought I had new messages, it refused to save so I had to deliver that message manually. It's not a huge deal, but I was wondering if you could stop the browser from preventing you to save a page if you have new messages (...or not). Is it just an issue with stopping people putting fake messages at the top of their userpage/talk pages? <span style="color:deeppink"><b>— <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:deeppink">FireFox</span></a> • <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:deeppink">T</span></a> • 11:00, 14 February 2006</b></span></p>

<dd>The point of this feature is, if you're making controversial edits, an admin can remove you from the checkpage and leave you a message.

<p>I downloaded the new version 1.92, but somehow am unable to connect properly. I'm sure it's the right version, I'm listed and I definitely am logged in at IE, but it still gives me the usual "Not enabled" message. I hope v1.93 will solve my troubles. It also made me think whether, seeing as from now on, you intend to label the versions differently, it might make sense to provide the second-newest edition as well. E.g. in my case v1.91 might work, but I can't get it (and my old version is far outdated, didn't use AWB for two weeks or so) -- <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenesis_fb2e.html" title="User:Genesis">Genesis</a> 13:59, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Using the AWB framework for trivial edits</span></h2>
<p>I had a discussion with <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">FireFox</a> on this matter. I believe AWB is a great tool, but one should not use it for edits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borel%27s_lemma&amp;curid=1461105&amp;diff=39576764&amp;oldid=17166276" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borel%27s_lemma&amp;curid=1461105&amp;diff=39576764&amp;oldid=17166276" rel="nofollow">this kind</a>. Such edits just clog one's watchlist, without providing any tangible benefit.</p>
<p>Another idea would be to provide a specific edit summary when changing something, just saying "cleanup" is too generic I think.

<p>About the dialog window for setting up "Find &amp; Replace":</p>
<ul>
<li>There should be spaces in the window title, which is currently <i><b>FindandReplace</b></i>.</li>
<li>The contents should auto-resize with the window. I wanted to make it bigger to work on a long regex, but the list control stays the same size.</li>
<li>It should be possible to re-order the items in the list. I am assuming here, based on the sample Adrian gave for migrating {{journal reference}}, that the list is traversed top-to-bottom and each regex applied to the whole article in turn. in this case, it would be helpful if it were possible to:

<p>Thanks to all for responding and especially to Martin for constantly improving AWB at such a remarkable pace. To the issue: I had some rough idea, but I don't know if it is worthy. How about (yet&#160;:-) another button "repeat" near that (very good!) "stop" button? I was thinking along the line that if AWB is stuck (however that may be caused) it might be possible for AWB to remember the name of the last article, the last action done (preview, diff or save) and the content for that article that was used on that last action. The user could then "help" AWB to detect that the last action failed (usually caused on the server side) and simply repeat that last action — without loosing any input the user might have done on that last action. It is probably difficult to detect for AWB and it might make matters simpler if AWB could get input from the user as the user sees immediately whether there was a server problem (thanks to the browser window). Just some rough brainstorming. BTW AWB has become a very strong tool now which makes things possible I would have never dreamt of before.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minor requests</span></h2>
<p>I just noticed these minor things while I was updating the user manual. They're petty and most people might not care, so you don't have to change them.</p>
<ol>
<li>On General menu, change "WordWrap" to "Word wrap".</li>
<li>On General menu, change "Show preview instead of diff" to "Show preview instead of changes" (because "diff" button has since been renamed "show changes").</li>
<li>Don't begin file and help menus with a horizontal line (click on them to see what I mean).</li>
<li>On About menu, make a link to the online user manual.</li>
<li>Don't make the About box fade if the mouse isn't moved for three seconds - it sometimes gets annoying.</li>
<li>Make "stop" button same width as all other buttons.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Or, instead of making the "stop" button the full width, maybe add a "pause" button next to it that pauses the counter during bot mode. Since Wikipedians must monitor (or at least should monitor) their bots, they might notice changes that need to be made. By pausing the bot counter, they can make the changes and then click "pause" again (maybe have the text change to "unpause" once clicked?) to restart the timer. This is more efficient than stopping and starting since then any edits made to the edit box are undone and must be remade. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">2020</font></a> 23:38, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Memory usage</span></h2>
<p>I dunno of this is just an unfortunate "feature" caused by using .NET, but AWB seems to be a <b>major</b> memory hog. It just never release any memory, after editing 500+ pages with it I literaly run out of system memory and is forced to shut it down and start it back up because my system starts glitching on acount of insifficient memory (I have 1Gb RAM and 2Gb swap file space).

<dd>Also it doesn't respect Internet Explorers cache settings. I have set IE to use no more than 20Mb for temp files (becuse the darn thing gets unstable after the cache grows beyond a scertain size and then takes forever to clean out), but after running AWB for a while my C drive filled up with over a 100 Mb of cache files, not a <i>huge</i> problem, but slightly anoying. Would be nice if AWB could be set up to use the general IE settings, or at least allow such things to be configured internaly for the IE object used by AWB. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 02:26, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good news for all proponents of open source (which, as of now, appears to be everyone). SourceForge has two "levels" on projects: admins and developers. Developers can view and edit the source, and admins, (here's the main part), can choose who is a developer. In other words, vandals won't have access to the source!</p>
<p>The process will go something like this: Wikipedian 123W creates SourceForge account 123S and posts a message at the AWB forum on SourceForge asking to become a devloper. The message will be signed 123S. Then, Wikipedian will leave a message at a page TBD on Wikipedia saying that 123W is 123S and will sign it as 123W. That way, the admins of the project can make sure that 123S is really 123W and not a vandal/impostor. Then, an admin grants 123S developer privileges and he/she can access, view, and edit the source code. Currently, Martin, Adrian, and I are the admins and there are no developers. Once Adrian figures out how to work the CVS (anybody else know how?) we'll get the project up and running (assuming that the results of this poll continue for the next six days). --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a></i> 23:43, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've had an account with sourceforge for ~7 years. Anyone can see the source code. That's the nature of sourceforge. Developers can "check out" and also upload code instead of just downloading it like normal users.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(because of this, it may be wise to possibly remove some features before initially submitting the code)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One admin will usually be in charge of taking care of the web site/forum/mailing-list with (hopefully) someone somewhat familiar with it for a backup in case the main site/forum person has to be away for an extended period. Another admin will often be the policy person ie "these are the features we are working on for versions x, y, and major version z" (<i>avoid feature creep/bloat</i>) and tries to keep people from deviating from that goal. Multiple redundant admins work well as long as everyone sticks to the agreed plan.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, and from experience, direct access for developers shouldn't be that different from becoming an admin on a wiki site. At first, new code is are handed off to admins or developers until the admins are comfortable with letting that person do the direct updates themselves.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The difficult part isn't so much getting files into CVS and updating them, it's more getting everyone on the same roadmap and working to the same end rather than a bunch of people all working on their pet features. <i>This is why it's best to not give developer access to people until some time has passed, they can get administrators to upload new code</i>. Also, this is what most often makes or breaks projects, people understanding what features they are working on towards version X and sticking with it. The worst possible scenario is when coders ignore each other and keep trying to re-invent incompatible wheels.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BTW: CVS has a very steep learning curve but it's pretty much like how wikipedia works. Diff views, history, rollbacks, and other similar features are all included but the geekyness is 10x.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before any code is uploaded I would suggest an IRC conference on freenode.net with all admins/Martin present because starting a project off on the right foot is 90% of what makes a project work.

<dd>Out of interest, who here is actually interested in helping develop it? I am pretty sure that most understand the goal of this program, although setting that out as clearly as possible can do no harm. Also, I can not emphasise this enough: This program has only been in existence for a short period of time, it is very much still in development. In fact, I set its development status to alpha on sourceforge, as I don't think it could even be called beta until all known bugs have been fixed. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 10:25, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you can tell, I'm new to SourceForge. I guess I misread the help file. Adrian is working on CVS but that's we've figured out so far. After thinking about debates such as the edit summary one below, I'm starting to see your point (I'm addressing That Guy right now). If everyone's a developer, then person X might change the edit summary, and person Y will change it back, on and on just like an article edit war. We should start with few but trusted developers and then slowly grow as we can trust more.</dd>

I also don't know the difference between a void and whatever else there is, public and private, etc. (although I used to, and I can probably look this up quickly). Other than that, I'm pretty proficient. I don't know what Adrian's skills are, but, as I said, he's currently working on this CVS stuff. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a> 21:17, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am very thankful for this application and many more editors benefit from those who use it. I would respectfully ask that, if possible, a few features get added because Martin is very familiar with the code. If not, I understand completely but it doesn't hurt to ask&#160;:)</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts enabled for the edit box (Alt-C/X/V/etc...) to make it easier to use an external spell checking application.</li>
<li><s>Enable "Make From Text File" for importing article names. I have a huge list of Ancient Egypt articles I would like to load at once for example. Being able to use a list makes it less likely to lose place because of people getting lost moving up and down deep category trees.

<dd>Maybe we should move this to a separate topic (not the poll), but I'll answer some of your requests here anyways. (1) Do you mean cntrl+c, not alt+c? I've noticed that that is missing, too, but you can still use the context menu. I'm not sure if C# allows shortcuts like that but Martin might know. (2) There's already an option for "make list from text file", it's just that the titles must be surrounded in [[Title]], not "Title". Just take your text file, copy it, paste it into Microsoft Word (even though I hate Microsoft, I don't know of any other program that does this), and do a find-and-replace (cntrl+f) with "wildcards" (ie, regex) enabled to replace (newline)" with [[ and "(newline) with ]] (I don't know what newline is, but it's accessible from the submenu if wildcards are enabled). --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a></i> 01:32, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I did mean <b>ctrl</b>. I'm used to using ctrl-a and then ctrl-c to copy text to an external editor like jedit and do my spell checks there. As far as the second issue, I didn't realize that the "make list" button did double-duty as "load list". The entry box above was greyed out so I (oops) assumed that the feature wasn't enabled.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit summaries</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">Edit summaries</a> are for summarizing edits, not for promoting software (even if it <i>is</i> free and open-source, and even if it was capable of running on my Mac).</p>
<p>As I scan my watchlist, every time I reach an edit summary that starts with "AWB assisted ...", I have to pause and read through it to discover what the summary of the actual edit is; and usually it is something trivial. If you must promote your software in the edit summary, at the very least put the summary first, followed by "... using AWB", or "... [AWB]", or some such.</p>
<p>Relevant discussion regarding another such tool is at <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7ETools_Navigation_popups_72c4.html#Misusing_edit_summaries" title="Wikipedia talk:Tools/Navigation popups">Wikipedia talk:tools/Navigation popups#Misusing edit summaries</a>.

<dd>I look at it as "full disclosure", rather than as "promotion". People would equally, if not more so, complain about "semi-automated" edits being used, unflagged. The portion after the link is up to the user using the software, and obviously should indeed be a useful edit summary, as per the usual standards for such.

<dd>You make a good point about labelling semi-automated edits, but this information is secondary to the actual substance of an edit.

<dd>I agree with Alai, there should always be a way to tell that an edit was assisted by software in some way. Edit summaries are intended for consumption by Wikipedia editors, not the general public. There is no reason to leave useful information out of an edit summary, and nothing in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">Wikipedia:Edit summary</a> warns against noting a software-assisted edit.</dd>
<dd>Since it is up to the user to control AWB properly, and since it can perform multiple edits, there is a higher potential for problems than with Lupin's script. For that reason it's essential to note that AWB was used in the edit summary. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 05:48, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a bit problems seeing what the problem is that Michael has. But maybe this is part of the problem or I do not understand his concerns. What I can say, I do not care that much what the edit summary is, that AWB produces. I for one have had several occasions where I found it helpful to know that an edit was done using AWB. So it adds valuable info to the edit summary. I have also made some settings for AWB available to others and I must say I do feel a bit responsible for having done so, so occasionally I do take a closer look on an edit to assess whether everything is fine or whether I do need to issue a warning that there is a bug in the settings I have provided. So in fact, it is helpful to me that the AWB hint is at the beginning of the edit summary. I think Bluemoose might be in a similar position as he certainly feels responsible for having given us such a powerful tool and if we do damage with it to Wikipedia he will certainly stop it. So, as I see it - even if I do not understand Michael - he asked to move the AWB notice to the end of the edit summary. So if he is happy with that, I support that. I think this is not such a big thing to do. I for one can live with that. However, this is up to Bluemoose. --Adrian Buehlmann 08:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Edit summaries are most certainly not for "promotion", it is simply so it is clear how the edit was made, which is the same for people who make "popups assisted" (or what ever it says) edits. To say it is spamming your watchlist, or somehow makes it difficult to read your watchlist is just unbelievable. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 11:23, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seeing this edit summary in my watchlist prompted me to use the software. I believe that this raises awareness of tools available for editing just like other open source tools available to us (like Lupin's popup tools). It is also valuable to know how these edits were made.--<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungfuadam_b5d5.html" title="User:Kungfuadam">Adam</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a><sup>(<a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungfuadam_f667.html" title="User talk:Kungfuadam">talk</a>)</sup> 11:55, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a weak preference for the begining. Because the 'begining' moves depending on the length of username, I don't see moving the boilerplate to the end as an improvement. And having it at the begining is consistent with most of the other tools: "reverted edits ...", "popup assisted...", "robot modifying...", "robot adding...". While I wouldn't object strongly if it moved to the end, I'm sure that someone out there will!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 14:26, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I scan the edit summaries of my watchlist by following the un-linked parentheses "(" with my eye, to find the following edit summary, which may also be prefixed with an arrow and grey section heading. All of these can be recognized in a quick scan, without having to stop and read. Adding a blue link to the mix before the actual content of the edit summary, which I have to stop and read at every occurrence, slows this process down, especially since there are several different variations. Robots are a special case, and I usually ignore them, but user-supervised tools like popups and AWB seem to generate errors more often, so I'd rather see what an editor is using them for.</dd>

<dd>In response to Michael's comment above, he said that "Popups-assisted..." has been changed to "... using popups". I just did a reversion of my sandbox using popups <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mathwiz2020/sandbox&amp;diff=40477139&amp;oldid=40477086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mathwiz2020/sandbox&amp;diff=40477139&amp;oldid=40477086" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and the summary was "<a href="../../../p/o/p/WP%7EPOP_b34f.html" title="WP:POP">Popups</a>-assisted reversion to version 36441023". Popups is still at the beginning. Plus, I find it helpful to have the "AWB-assisted" at the beginning so, when scanning my watchlist, recent changes, a page's history, etc., I know to double check that edit to make sure the user didn't let a mistake slip by. Users are supposed to double check all edits but some, unfortunately, don't, so double checking AWB edits allows me to alert those editors that they should be double checking. It is not advertising - in fact, I found the AWB based on such an edit summary, and I am very glad, because it has saved me lots of time on <a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_links_e7ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Bad links">Wikipedia:Bad links</a>.

Why the hell would I want to promote it? Similarly, it is poor form to spam your concern about this on many peoples talk page and for you to mock the edit summary with your own "Safari assisted.." edit summary is just immature.

Perhaps your are not at all interested in promoting AWB, although obviously you informed other editors with whom you are sharing your software somehow. But the watchlist's usability is going downhill as it gradually gets filled with edits which first announce themselves as made by robots, Popups, AWB, and other tools, and many of which only provide a boilerplate summary as an afterthought. And actual commercial spammers will eventually try to take advantage of every free opportunity they can, including the possibility of filling articles' edit histories with permanent links to their concerns.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Martin completely in that there has to be <i>some</i> notice about the AWB or else people will complain. If you don't want to "advertise" with a big "AWB-assisted", then what alternative is there? I was reading on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> the other day about a bot who linked in all edit summaries to his user's account so that there would be no problems. However, the bot got logged out and the only indication of who it was was by clicking on an ellipsis (...) that linked to the user page. Well, most people didn't know to click on the ellipsis because it wasn't obvious. The point here is that you must blatantly state what was used to avoid arguments.</dd>

<dd>Secondly, I don't see how watchlists are being "bogged down". My watchlist has (at most) one AWB'd page per day. And the reason why AWB doesn't leave the section links is because, in order to do so, you need to specifically choose to edit only one section. The AWB edits the whole page, but, even though changes might only be made to one section, it was still the <i>page</i> that was edited, not the link next to a section title.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AWB is open source</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday I finally managed to push up some AWB sources to sourceforge. Martin made me an admin there and sent me the sources to upload them. I've used TortoiseCVS-1.8.25 on WindowsXP for this (first time install for me). To my great pleasure I noticed this morning (UTC+1) that they had finally appeared at <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/autowikibrowser/src/" class="external free" title="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/autowikibrowser/src/" rel="nofollow">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/autowikibrowser/src/</a> (after a delay of several hours. Hrrmmm). Hooray! Please note that I haven't yet uploaded the other files needed to build. The public project page is at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autowikibrowser" class="external free" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autowikibrowser" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/autowikibrowser</a>.

<dd>It looks good. I tried checking out the files to my local CVS and it worked fine. It is strange that the files took so long to appear. Normally, that shouldn't happen but it could be because it was the initial start of the CVS for autowikibrowser.

<dl>
<dd>That's the default directory (module) you should be using instead of /src. That way, you can have seperate related projects in the future like autowiki-international, autowiki-beta, autowiki-stable or something similar where code is completely seperate for {whatever} reason. Specify the module name "AutoWikiBrowser" (case sensitive) in the future for committing and checking out code and it will keep things clean for developers.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Can we commit to a longer enabling time?</span></h2>
<p>For each version of AWB, would it be possible to commit to its being enabled for at least X amount of time (or perhaps disabling the enabling by version altogether)? For those of us who are not helping to develop the program and just using it as necessary, the constant re-downloading is bothersome.</p>
<p>If enabling by version is to continue, could we commit to versions of the program being enabled for at least two weeks or a month? In light of the fact that most of the revisions are minor, I don't think that's much to ask. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 17:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1.96 (which is the version I upgraded from) and the current version were released <i>four days apart</i>. That is a really short period, and the changes were simple bug fixes, which most users could probably pass over until there is a big revision. Please consider changing to a method where users are notified of new versions being in place, but not completely shutting off access to older versions. Or, as I've mentioned before, you may want to consider something that will make the program update itself. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 22:06, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sometimes I have released more than one revision in a single day, but in such cases old versins are left active for substantial periods of time, often until there was a very important change. When you say "the changes were simple bug fixes" consider that I made the changes, so am in a considerably better postition to say how important they were. As for automatically updating itself, it is a good idea, but probably beyond the scope of a free piece of software used by just a small number of users, I will look into how it could be achieved though. Also remember that part of the reason it is so strict is that the program is being developed, if the versions were release versions, then they would no doubt be left enabled for much longer. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:51, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bluemoose - If you right click on the sandbox, choose CVS, and then "Make patch...", couldn't you theoretically just release a patch without a new version number? That way, users would only have to download the patch if they so wished. Then, the next time a major upgrade is made to the code, a complete version (not just a patch, but the program) would be made available (and required by the checkpage), including all patches, in case the user didn't install them earlier. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mathwiz2020_ee03.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mathwiz2020"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathwiz2020_4489.html" title="User talk:Mathwiz2020"><font color="red">th</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020"><font color="blue">wiz</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mathwiz2020_2e0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mathwiz2020"><font color="black">20</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">20</font></a> 01:01, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The problem was the &lt;i&gt;, which in most cases do mean <i>italics</i> and changing all instances of &lt;i&gt; to '' would have made sense, but in the Ojibwe language case, the &lt;i&gt; was used to mean the "i-character" and should not have been corrected to the incorrect ''. <a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLippert_e254.html" title="User:CJLippert">CJLippert</a> 23:40, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How about selective application of "general fixes"?</span></h2>
<p>I'm doing some image replacement, and a lot of the pages I hit turn out only contain "ghost links" to the image due to previos use in transcluded templates, so a null edit would clean it up, but if I have general fixes eneabled it will move stub tags and clear exessive whitespace and such, so I can't do "clean" null edits with it eneabled. However once in a while I run into a page where I would like to run the general fixes on, but in order to do so I have to go to the set options tab, turn it on and then click the "start" button all over again. Would be nice if I could just right click in the edit textarea and click "apply general fixes" or something like that without the hassle of swaping tabs, and re-starting the edit process. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 17:34, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recently added a "re-parse" item to the textbox context menu, this runs all the selected functions again, it's not quite what you want because if you dont have general fixes enabled then it doesn't apply them (and if you did have it enabled it would auotmatically do it).
