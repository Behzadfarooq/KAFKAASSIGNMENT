<p>Thanks to <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">User:Michael_Hardy</a>, I realized that I should have posted my request for help and so forth on this page rather than on the actual automail article. This is my first attempt at a wiki article. I encourage your support and or criticism. Also, be aware that the sections about each characterâ€™s relevance to automail is somewhat lifted from the cited internal wiki links. so restating the above noted.</p>

<dd>I am following the precedent set by the main Fullmetal Alchemist page, and it also serves to point out the lack of character sections for certain people. It also declutters the main body of the text slightly, and makes it so that we do not have to redundantly use their name in the body of text in order to link to them.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 08:25, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's always a good idea to alternate between names, nicknames and third person references. It adds healthy variation and stops the monotony in my opinion. Besides, it's not too redundant, and the links radiate more of the "wikipedia" artistic flare in my opinion. The names were already present in the section, nevertheless you are right in the sense that it limits the author's ability to freely express himself within the content. That's journalism for you. &lt;chuckles&gt;weez cough&lt;/chuckles&gt;</dd>

<p>There is something else called automail which is completely non-related to the world of Full Metal Alchemist. Some program that automatically sends mail to a list of targeted victims.

<p>This is a hybrid of a scientific explination and an alchemic explination for the power source of automail.</p>
<p>Theoretically and logically if alchemy is powered using alchemic energy, which stems from each person's inner gate, then that same alchemic energy can be used to power the automail. In today's everyday mobile prostetics, limbs are powered by amplifying the existing electrical energy left over by the nerves via outside electric input. The same is true with automail as the way it is controled is also derived from the small current emitted by the nerves.</p>
<p>Through the use of integrated circuits and motors, prostetics are made a bit bulky and less powerfull because of the materials and limited energy used. So anyway you put it, to achieve such automail performance, the automail's basic components must logically be created from alchemy for the type of effeciency represented. Such as the magnet to operate certain motors could be forged from alchemy to be more powerful. Moreover, I believe this in effect is used to amplify the signals of the connective tissue to the automail much like Ed's pocket watch amplifies his alchemic energy, although he really doesn't need it.</p>
<p>Anything that has a soul has an inner gate as seen when the priest forges the revival of Roze's boyfriend in the second episode of the anime by using the souls of birds.</p>
<p>So in theory, the same principle may be used to amplify the voltage of a person's nerves into the automail much like a strong magnetic field can amplify voltage in an electrical circuit (motors rely mostly on voltage rather than amperage anyway). Whether or not the user of the automail is aware that alchemy is the source of their mobility is not important. What is important is that it uses the power of the person's or animal's soul, later realized to be the inner gate.</p>
<p>And even though the first step of transmutation is understanding, the second step is decomposition through the use of alchemic energy, and the final step is reconstruction in which those atoms are reconstructed into something new. Ed states in episode 15 to scar,"transmuting in Alchemy can be described in having three steps. Understanding, decomposing and reassembling. You must be stopping the transmutation at the second step, decomposing."</p>
<p>Why not stop at understanding? Pinako's dog with the automail may not know alchemy, but it knows it was missing a leg and now it has a new fake one. That I think is enough understanding to use alchemic energy in powering automail.</p>
<p>all in all... don't take it too seriously. It's a show, and doesn't al move on his own regardless of automail and motors and such? just pure alchemic power.</p>
<p>Automail is much more about engineering and anatomical science that alchemy anyway.</p>
<p>It kind of makes you think if that was the real reason winry wanted to take apart Ed's state alchemist watch. (probably not)</p>

<p>And tjstrf, take good care of the article for me... please don't take off the html i put in because it is very important at holding some things on the page together. i also realize the post about automail energy was purely opinionated, however, seeing how there is no hard evidence, theories should be supplied untill the time evidence does surface.</p>
<p>feel free to add your own theories, but just don't take mine off... it makes a lot of sense when you analyse it. it's purely factual and concurrent with the series.</p>

<dd>Well, I've been here for a couple months, so I guess that still qualifies as new. I have read the manual of style and naming conventions. I don't know about Automail except that he was very new when he started this article. I was gone for the last week, and the article got a bit messed up during that period. I'll start fixing it now. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 3 July 2005 01:54 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On avoidance of self-referential pronouns, that is not a naming convention (which this article does not violate that I can see, except maybe that it could be better named Fullmetal_Alchemist(Automail), though that might violate the no hierarchies rule) but rather a style rule. Unless you are referring to User:Automail having created the article Automail, which is a special case because the article was created before User:Automail existed, and he named himself after the article, rather than the other way around.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 3 July 2005 02:25 (UTC)</dd>

Section is "Automail's Energy Source", paragraph 2, which is not from official information. However, it has been corrected (and for a long while, now), so I'll remove the note from the top of the page. Sorry if I brought some confusion. And it looks like I forgot to sign my comment.

<p>I understood how that was an error already. As a matter of fact, they went over it on the main FMA talk page and decided not to state that Automail was even powered by alchemy. What I didn't understand was how we violated a naming convention or avoidance of self-referential pronouns. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 5 July 2005 08:33 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently put up a section dealing with the character Bard, who appears with an automail arm in ep.5 of the anime, but i've noticed that it has been changed twice to Bald. This could be petty vandalism, but it could also result from a perceived instance of the common Japanese pronunciation of l's as r's, I've checked the anime, and he <i>is</i> in fact referred to as Bard. In any case, Bard is by all means a more regular name than Bald, so it's most likely Bard. -<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHoborgXVII_c79e.html" title="User:LordHoborgXVII">LordHoborgXVII</a></p>
