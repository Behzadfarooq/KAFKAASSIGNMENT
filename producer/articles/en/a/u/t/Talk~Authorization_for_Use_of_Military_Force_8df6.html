<dd>I'll try to find a source for it ... shouldn't be too hard. I'm more curious about the two Republican senators (Craig and Helms) who are cited as "present/not voting", which I assume means that they made a point of abstaining, which is kind of weird. Are the House abstentions along the same lines, or were they just members who were physically absent? --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> (<a href="../../../j/f/r/User_talk%7EJfruh_8e72.html" title="User talk:Jfruh">talk</a>) 23:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salim_Ahmed_Hamdan_206b.html" title="Salim Ahmed Hamdan">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> was the first detainee to be tried in such a tribunal and the proceedings were put on hold until the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> heard the appeal of Judge Robert's initial decision in favor of the Bush administration, when Judge Roberts was on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit_c851.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit">DC Court of Appeals</a>. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court's <i>Hamdan</i> decision only found that the military tribunals <i>as proposed by the Bush administration</i> for the detainees held at <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp_1ca5.html" title="Guantanamo Bay detention camp">Guantanamo Bay detention camp</a> were not <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> under the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_def6.html" title="Geneva Convention">Geneva Convention</a>, not that <i>any</i> military tribunals were "illeagal" -- as the sentence in this article implies. In fact, in the <i>Hamdan</i> case, Judge Stevens' majority opinion (the portion Kennedy joined) even says that the legislative branch can create the structure of tribunals that would be competent tribunals per the Geneva treaty. Simply saying the tribunals were found to be <i>illeagal</i> is inaccurate and provides a misleading sense of security, to those concerned about civil liberties, that there will <i>not</i> be some form of military tribunals in the future. This is especially a concern since the Senate is now debating new legislation introduced by Republican senators in order to try the detainees held at Guantanamo. With current makeup of the senate, these tribunals will most likely not offer anything like the protections of civilain U.S. federal courts. From the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamdan_v._Rumsfeld_6f22.html" title="Hamdan v. Rumsfeld">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a> Wikipedia article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The opinion next addressed the substantive issues of the case. It explicitly did not decide whether the President possessed the Constitutional power to convene military commissions like the one created to try Hamdan. Even if he possessed such power, those tribunals would either have to be sanctioned by the "laws of war," as codified by Congress in Article 15 of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice_9124.html" title="Uniform Code of Military Justice">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ), or authorized by statute. As to the statutory authorization, there is nothing in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_b9a7.html" title="Authorization for Use of Military Force">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) "even hinting" at expanding the President's war powers beyond those enumerated in Art. 15. Instead, the AUMF, the UCMJ, and the DTA "at most acknowledge" the President's authority to convene military commissions only where justified by the exigencies of war, but still operating within the laws of war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore I have changed the wording of the sentence to read: "The AUMF was unsuccessfully cited by the George W. Bush administration in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamdan_v._Rumsfeld_6f22.html" title="Hamdan v. Rumsfeld"><i>Hamdan</i> v. <i>Rumsfeld</i></a>, in which the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruled that the administration's <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_military_commission.html" title="Guantanamo military commission">military commissions</a> at <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_Bay_detainment_camp_d6fa.html" title="Guantanamo Bay detainment camp">Guantanomo Bay</a> were were not <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a>."--Historypre 18:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Historypre, thanks for the reply. "Competent tribunal" is a technical term that I suspect many readers will not understand. You seem to think that saying that the miliary commissions at Guantanamo were illegal somehow suggests that all military commissions are illegal. I just don't imagine many readers will make that false inference. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 19:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may chime in here: while I agree that "competent tribunal" is a technical term that may be puzzling, I think it may be too sweeping to say that they were simply "illegal." The decision said that they were illegal as constituted, but pointed to a route by which a similiar institution would be legal. "Competent tribunal" is a link, so those curious about the term can just click on it. Heck, I don't know why this argument is about using one term exclusively; why couldn't the text just say "...decided that the tribunals were illegal, as they are not competent tribunals under current law" or some such? --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> (<a href="../../../j/f/r/User_talk%7EJfruh_8e72.html" title="User talk:Jfruh">talk</a>) 20:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good comments, Jfruh. My only objection to "...decided that the tribunals were illegal, as they are not competent tribunals under current law" is that it is somewhat longwinded for the intro. I went with "illegal as constituted". OK with everyone? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrust_e04a.html" title="User:Crust">Crust</a> 20:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
