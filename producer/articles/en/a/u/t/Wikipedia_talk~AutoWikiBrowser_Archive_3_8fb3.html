<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where do the stubs go?</span></h2>
<p>In this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irrotational_vector_field&amp;curid=461454&amp;diff=41029821&amp;oldid=36139739" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irrotational_vector_field&amp;curid=461454&amp;diff=41029821&amp;oldid=36139739" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, AWB had the stub go under the category. I believe the "standard" is to have the category at the end, followed only by the interlanguage links. So, does AWB put the stub at the very bottom on purpose, or is it a bug? Thanks. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 03:56, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS Note that <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon">User:Encephalon</a> stated that it is the AWB framework which put the link at the bottom, rather than the user. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 03:58, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just thought I'd mention that I've confirmed that this is something AWB does, probably as part of its general fixes function. If you run AWB now, generate a list from a "Google Wikipedia" search of "irrotational vector field", check the general fixes box, and "start the process", AWB brings up one proposed change only for the above <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrotational_vector_field.html" title="Irrotational vector field">stub</a>: moving the stub link two spaces below the category links. It does seem to me that changing this so that the cat links always go right to the bottom is harmless; certainly it lends a uniformity of sorts, as in full articles the cats are placed at the bottom as well.

<dd>I just tried that change in AWB to do just that and tested it on that article. It works, and sorts the way you are talking about. But, I'd like to talk to Bluemoose to see if there is a specific reason that stubs are currently put under categories (<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a>?)

<p><br />
I've done some research on IRC and by searching and it seems that this issue isn't documented in any "here's the exact way to do it" sort of way although it seems to be "known" as standard by those who answered my questions.</p>
<p>What I've found is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stub notices should be after Categories so they show up at the end of the category lists.</li>
<li>Interwiki bots are programmed to put language after the above.</li>
<li>Featured article goes at the very bottom (see <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_articles_c405.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured articles">Wikipedia_talk:Featured_articles</a>))</li>
</ul>
<p>I've submitted code changes to reflect the above. (stub after category instead of stub last)</p>

<dd>The new order makes no sense. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersondata_45db.html" title="Wikipedia:Persondata">Wikipedia:Persondata</a> says that person data should go where it was already (before cats). And the stub template clearly is better where AWB put it, e.g. on <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrotational_vector_field.html" title="Irrotational vector field">Irrotational vector field</a>, before AWB moved it the stub was joined on to the body of the text, I specifically made it so it doesnt join stubs onto the text because people have complained about that. And the de facto standard place to put Link FA templates is just before the interwikis (the comment on the featureed article talk page says "bottom" but only as opposed to the top of the page). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 11:13, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

OK, the stub should not be joined to text. But I still think stubs should be <i>before</i> categories, at least that's how things are in most articles have seen. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 17:03, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stubs should definitely go after the categories. Stubs are an editorial feature and categories are a reader feature. Readers out number editors by a huge margin and they are the people we are here to serve. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 22:41, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minor bug regarding "loss of session data"</span></h2>
<p>I just noticed that if you get a "uneable to process due to loss of session data" (or whatever it says) message, AWB will remove the page from the list and move on as if the save had been sucessfull. The correct behaviour in this case would be to restart the edit as if a server error had ocured. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 12:51, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A couple of List related wishes</span></h2>
<p>Would it be possible to have AWB generate a list based on File links on image pages too? That would be usefull. Currently I'm copy and pasting them into a text editor, using a macro to "wikify" them, save as a text file and then import the text file, wich works, but it's a bit of work, would be nice to just input a Image: page name and have AWB automaticaly pick up all pages the image is used on. Also a "remove duplicates" option would be nice. After copy and pasting file links for a dozen or so images I was left with quite a few duplicates, wich I ended up having to use Excell to filter out. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 19:39, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Blanket substitution of everything is (arguably) very harmful. The server load argument in favor of substitution, for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28technical%29&amp;diff=36036098&amp;oldid=36035357" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28technical%29&amp;diff=36036098&amp;oldid=36035357" rel="nofollow">has been refuted</a> by Wikipedia's lead developer. Think about it. Is using a psuedo-bot to edit hundreds of articles without adding any content really of benefit to the servers?</p>
<p>It's certainly ok or beneficial to substitute some things, but before you decide to do it, keep in mind that substitution is effectively permanent, and in many cases clutters up markup, making it more difficult for newcomers to edit, with marginal or no benefit.

<p>Along the same lines, I would love to have a more functional parser instead of the simple find/replace tool. At the very least, it would be nice to be able to modify text using wildcards, e.g. find all words beginning with lower-case "a" and replace them with uppercase "A" (a* to A*).</p>

<dd><code>\r\n</code> does not insert a carriage return during Find/Replace -- it inserts <code>"\r\n"</code>. Here's what I meant with the parser: I'm converting aircraft specs to a template format. I have a spec like <i>wingspan: 50 ft (15.2 m)</i> that I need to convert to two lines: span main=50 ft and span alt=15.2 m. I can't even get AWB to insert span main= and span alt= on two separate lines, not to mention getting it to divide the 50 ft (15.2 m) into two separate entities appropriately place on separate lines (I can write regular expressions to find them but the Replace part of find/replace is rather limited in its ability). Or am I missing something?

<dd>anonymous access is working for me at this time using the instructions from the parent page of this one. I just tried it with tortoise. I don't normally use tortoise, so I can't troubleshoot problems but if you still can't get access, you can alternatively download the zipped <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/autowikibrowser-cvsroot.tar.bz2" class="external text" title="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/autowikibrowser-cvsroot.tar.bz2" rel="nofollow">daily backup</a> and work with the source code that way. If you are using Windows, you'll need an archive program like <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winrar.html" title="Winrar">Winrar</a> that can handle .bz2 files to decompress it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regex revisited</span></h2>
<p>Am I doing something wrong or is AWB using Regex only for Find and not for Replace? I'm especially wondering about the memory (parenthesis).</p>
<p>For example, when I run the following on <a href="../../../b/-/3/B-32_Dominator_f929.html" title="B-32 Dominator">B-32 Dominator</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find: <code>\**\s*\'*[Ww]ingspan\:*\'*\:*\s(.*)\s\((\w.*)\b\)</code></li>
<li>Replace with: <code>\|wingspan main=\1\r\n\|wingspan alt=\2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It finds the correct string but instead of recalling \1 and \2 from parentheses, it literally inserts \1 and \2. Is this related to the literal interpretation of \r\n or is AWB incapable of performing this operation altogether.</p>

<dd>AWB is fully capable of all regex functions, there was a slight problem mentioned about in interpreting \r\n literally in the replace field, that is fixed now in 2.0.2.0, as for interpreting \1 and \2 literally, that is because that is incorrect regex syntax, what you should use is $1 and $2. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 18:08, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where do the stubs go? Part 2</span></h2>
<p>AWB moves stub templates to the bottom (after interwiki links). This seems like a good idea, because, presumably the stub template will be removed RSN. (The only guideline I could find was <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a> <i>near the bottom of the article</i>.)

<p>Currently, AWB loads a page, then the changes and then stops. What I'd like to see it do is to keep loading the other pages in the list. It would save them in some cache where from they would be immediately available after the current page has been saved. Of course modem users or users paying per transferred data might want to uncheck this option but it would greatly improve the editing speed for broadband users. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroOne_fb52.html" title="User:ZeroOne">ZeroOne</a> 21:52, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently I cannot figure a way to extract words from the page title. This would be crucial, however, if I was to use AWB to assist in setting category sort keys. There are dozens of categories where articles should have but do not have category sort keys. I've been working through <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_2143.html" title="Category:Lists">Category:Lists</a> and its subcategories manually now. Allowing regexes to access the titles somehow would be sufficient. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroOne_fb52.html" title="User:ZeroOne">ZeroOne</a> 21:52, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, so that the results of those regexes could be carried to the article content. Something to make, for example, the title <i>List of mathematics related topics</i> into the string <i>Mathematics related topics</i> that could be used as a sort key. Also might need to convert <i>Firstname Lastname</i> into <i>Lastname, Firstname</i>. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroOne_fb52.html" title="User:ZeroOne">ZeroOne</a> 22:57, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But you would never need to put a category key <i>List of mathematics related topics</i> in that article, as articles are sorted by their name by default, also note that their is an option that guesses the birth and death categories, this guesses the category keys as well. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 23:02, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Namespace filtering</span></h3>
<p>I know you can filter out non main namespace articles from the list, but it would be nice if this could be extended to allow you to choose namespaces to filter out. When pruning links to disambig pages, you generally don't want to edit any talk pages, but still edit image, category, portal and project pages if there are any. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 18:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Line numbering</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes AWB makes a mistake, such as when wikisyntax square brackets are mixed with contextual ones. It's easy to identify these from the diffs, but with long articles it can be tough finding where it is. Since the diffs state the line number, line numbering down the side of the edit box like an IDE or a "go to line..." button would greatly simplify this task. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 18:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm changing miscapitalised headers e.g. "Partial Filmography" to "Partial filmography" - I have a table of some 230 common mistakes as regex replacements.

<dd>Bluemoose - A code suggestion that I tried but it didn't seem to work for me, maybe you can get it to work now: When the page first loads, before it's parsed, save it to string oldArticleText. After it is parsed, save the wikisource of the page to newArticleText. Then, do a regex replace to both strings to replace "\r\n" with "" (nothing). If the two match (if one string equals the other) then the only differences are blank lines and skip the article instead.</dd>

<p>I have been told by <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">User:Ian Pitchford</a> that the reason he has been shifting year of birth categories to the top of the selection of categories with this piece of software is that it is a feature of the software (and that makes it official Wikipedia policy in his opinion). Reading the project page, I think he may well be mistaken, but could the software be reviewed in any case please to ensure that this doesn't happen en masse? I don't think it is even possible to make any sort of sensible case that years of birth and death are the most important or useful categories for a person, so they should not go at the top of the list. The most relevant categories should come first, eg for a President of France, it would be <a href="../../../p/r/e/Category%7EPresidents_of_France_bd99.html" title="Category:Presidents of France">category:Presidents of France</a>, not <a href="../../../1/8/3/Category%7E1837_births.html" title="Category:1837 births">Category:1837 births</a> or <a href="../../../1/9/0/Category%7E1902_deaths.html" title="Category:1902 deaths">category:1902 deaths</a>.

<dd>This would likely be the "Alpha sort categories" option, so any category which began with a digit would likely suffer the same fate. As to whether the birth/death categories are most relevant for a person, simple logic would indicate that these would be the categories most likely to be common to all biographical articles; it would therefore make sense that they appeared in the same place for each article, which implies sorting them to the head of the list.

<dd>Perhaps that is because people have been using this piece of software? The whole idea of putting them in alphabetical order is ridiculous and this software totally distorts the editorial effort. People put great effort into sorting categories in the way that will be most useful for the reader, but your software allows all this effort to be casually wiped out without a thought or a care. But reversing it again is then more effort. Whether you are right or wrong, this feature is iniquitious and it should be removed. It stands to reason that the people on here are users of this software, so may support this absurd approach even if the majority of users are actually opposed to it. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 22:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is the de facto standard. Plus, from a more technical point of view, being in alphabetical order makes it easier to find a category, means that category order will appear more similar between different articles, and isnt susceptible to people re-ordering to give different ones a higher priority. I think these reasons are all individually more important than the reason you give, and common practice across Wikipedia evidently agrees. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 00:19, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>This is a style issue, not a technical issue. Alphabetical category links do not make a category easier to locate unless you already know the name of the category you want to find. There is no accepted standard in Wikipedia's <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">Manual of Style</a> and any de facto standard is disputable. It would be helpful if the AutoWikiBrowser did not encourage users to make sweeping changes to article style without consensus on what should be preferred. The best order of category links usually depends on the subject at hand. Consistency or "technical issues" should not trump common sense or the judgment of the editors working on individual subjects. There is more discussion about this at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_31e1.html#Recommended_order_for_Category_links" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization">Wikipedia talk:Categorization#Recommended order for Category links</a>. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 17:58, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmm, I've <i>always</i> put birth and death categories at the top, long before AWB and I can't rely say I've ever seen a biographical article where the birth and death categories where not the first (though granted I've mostly just seen stubs that only have one or two categories anyway), it does seem to be a very strong de facto standard. As for general alphabetising I'm more iffy. Grouping by relevance and importnace does have some merit. Makes sense to have "novelist" and "sience fiction writer" close together and not have "revolutionaries" or whatever between them. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 22:07, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Martin. You're right. I should have tried a manual edit before posting here. Apologies. But this makes me thinking: What about (yet) another button "next" (don't beat me :-) and a "auto next" mode? If "auto next" mode is off, AWB would wait until the user has seen and checked the page after the save. The user could acknowledge the move to the next article with a click on "next". "auto next" would be enabled by default (current behaviour). Instead of having a new button, we could rename the "Ignore" button to "next" and reuse that button. The current "auto mode" (bot mode = automatic save after timer) would also imply "auto next". --Adrian Buehlmann 18:09, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Removal of excess blank space does what it says it will do, that page should be formatted properly with a table, or just not be used with the blank space removal.</li>
<li>Bolding works fine for me on that article, maybe you have an older version?</li>
<li>It only converts URL/HTML entities automatically when they are in links, because sometimes people prefer URL/HTML. Use the option in the context menu to convert anything else you want to.</li>

<p>It didnt remove the leading blanks, the problem was due to the large quantities of spaces used for formatting, but either way, awb is not meant to be automatic or perfect, and that option is not enabled by default either.

<dd>With only 63 article edits, you wouldn't have been approved. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 11:44, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My point was that I'd like to use it for a project with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_c6a0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer and video games">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer and video games</a> (See "Talk page template"), which requires me to edit <b>Talk</b> pages by adding this template. So you won't see it in my main listing. The AWB was pointed out to a member of the cvg wp that "the new version of AWB works great for this exact task". Which means editing talk page. Clearly those need to be taken into account. It was made for this purpose, so why is policy (and "rule of thumb" policy at that) stopping someone from helping out a project that needs people to help them out? Of course I realize the signifigance of the edit count in order to keep vandals from using it negativly. But I'm fairly sure I would be able to finish off a large portion of this project if I had this tool. I am going to request the members there to make a comment here about it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMason11987_41fe.html" title="User:Mason11987">Chris M.</a> 22:30, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To append, I just kicked off a little project (may end up just being a personal one) on <a href="../../../t/l/a/Wikipedia_talk%7ETLAs_from_AAA_to_DZZ_3370.html" title="Wikipedia talk:TLAs from AAA to DZZ">Wikipedia talk:TLAs from AAA to DZZ</a> which is something else that would be <i>much</i> easier with AWB. I already did 47 edits with this, and if need be I <i>will</i> do these manually til I hit 500 if need be, but it really seems pointless to everyone involved to wait til then. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMason11987_41fe.html" title="User:Mason11987">Chris M.</a> 22:54, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
