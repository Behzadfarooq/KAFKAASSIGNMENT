<p>I was effected by collateral damage caused by an autoblock incident today, which led me to make two disturbing discoveries.</p>
<ol>
<li>Autoblock incorrectly blocks the IPs of proxy servers instead of user IPs</li>
<li>The time out of 24 hours doesn't work, the IP of my proxy server remained blocked for more than 24 hours</li>
</ol>
<p>These are very serious issues for wikipedia, the incorrect blocking of the proxy servers would likely prevented tens of thousands (or more) of Sydney wikipedians from making any edits.</p>
<p>What is the state of the code for the detection of user IP addresses? Aside from incorrectly interpreting proxy IPs as user IPs?</p>
<p>I have avoided putting this on the main page for WP:Autoblock as it is kinda embarassing. We need to sort this out ASAP. By comparison the time out of the autoblock seems minor.</p>
<p>Please advise me of what may be done.</p>
<p>BTW all users of the ISP tgp.com.au have no choice but to deal with the ISP's transparent proxy system, which works fine apart from when websites incorrectly detect the proxy IP as the user's public IP. This is a website's issue. Other websites have it correct <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/" class="external free" title="http://whatismyipaddress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://whatismyipaddress.com/</a> for instance does a fine job detailing both the public IP and the proxy IP and the reverse DNS-lookup of the proxy server.</p>

<p>I was one of the lucky few to be invited to the beta of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Web_Accelerator_467b.html" title="Google Web Accelerator">Google Web Accelerator</a> during its launch. I've had no problems for almost a month... but, today, while trying to edit a page, I got a WikiMedia warning notice that my <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP address</a> was blocked from editing!</p>
<p>...except it's not my IP that was shown. The blocked IP was 72.14.194.19 ... I pay my ISP for a high-bandwidth high-availability DSL line with a static IP, and that certainly wasn't it. It, in fact, is one of the many IP addresses for the Google Web Accelerator cache proxies.</p>
<p>When you use GWA, the program "cheats" by keeping a web connection open the entire session instead of opening and closing per file like regular web accesses go. Typically, the first time you connect to a remote machine, it registers your ISP-assigned IP address as its incoming connection, but subsequent connections are provided through Google's proxy. Since your internet "pipe" is being used full time instead of constantly making and breaking connections, this speeds up many websites with little problem.</p>
<p>Of course, when someone else before you has vandalized a page and you happen to land on the same proxy as they just used for that session, you find yourself blocked as well.</p>
<p><i>There is a solution, however.</i> Simply go to your Google Web Accelerator toolbar, click the "Accelerator" button, which brings up the GWA menu, and select "Don't accelerate this website." The latest versions of the software include this as a dialog box on the preferences page. Add en.wikipedia.org to the box marked for "Sites that you do not want to use Google Web Accelerator". You may want to do this for other sites that let you edit content and administer your account (such as <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantART_5bd3.html" title="DeviantART">DeviantART</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>).</p>

<dd>Thanks for this info, Kylu. Should any of this information be on the "IP Blocked" page template, since GWA seems to be picking up in popularity and there's nothing currently that helps to explain the problem? The only reason I was able to navigate to get this info and learn that it was GWA that was giving me the odd IP (and subsequent IP block warnings/messages) was because someone else had put it on the user page of the person who handed out an IP block to a GWA proxy IP. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 03:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a mask, to keep the IP addresses used by logged-in contributors private. If the message said "12.34.56.78 (Autoblocked...used by User:Foo" then it would be obvious what IP User:Foo was using; instead, it gives a mask #12345 that has no obvious connection to the IP address, but if unblocked, will be used by the software to unblock the correct address.

<p>I have been autoblocked a number of times, and each time it was because the autoblock was intended for someone else. Your program is deeply flawed. I neither live in China nor do I use AOL, so the suggestions on how to deal with this annoyance are not applicable here. Clearly, your program is hindering the ability of editors who are not AOL users or living in China. Since your program affects so many different users in an adverse way, it is not unreasonable to suggest that it be scrapped or re-coded to remove this flaw. I appreciate the intent of the software, but the manner in which it executes it's task is unacceptable. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_Star_ca1f.html" title="User:Wandering Star">Wandering Star</a> 14:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why when I try to edit different pages do I get different reasons and users who have been blocked, specfic to that page. Also is this new thing? I distinctly remember being assured I wouldn't be constantly blocked for being an AOL user after I created an account. It's a fairly pointless idea as anyone really that determined to vandalise wikipedia would find a way-if they are AOL users, open internet explorer and there ban is lifted for some other poor person to inherit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClomb_be0b.html" title="User:Clomb">Clomb</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clomb_5e7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clomb">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I might actually suggest that in the majority of cases, the best solution is to create a user account and simply continue to edit. If, as in your case, you've created a user account and still find yourself hit with blocks, please contact any admin (I'm around often, for instance) and provide us with the block number (it may refer to block #16436 or similar) that's affecting you. In most cases, the autoblock can be removed and you can continue with your editing. AOL users hit with an autoblock may also wish to simply wait a minute and refresh the page: Chances are the problem that caused the block is gone and you'll be able to edit again. Lastly, if you visit your talkpage ("my talk" at the top of the page) and put {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} on that page, an attentive admin may remove a block also. Please note that not all of these suggestions will work in all situations, also you may wish to click on the "unblock" in curly-brackets (called an "unblock template) to see more details on how it works.&#160;:) <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 04:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep you're wrong just then I did not remain autoblocked after my IP must've changed (I clicked to edit an article, got the "User is blocked" page, checked my block log and found I was not blocked directly, checked IP block log and found IP was blocked, went random article, clicked "edit" and was able to edit. Then I checked the IP block log again and there were no unblockings. Since I am able to edit now I logically conclude that my IP address changed and as a result I can now edit.

<p>One way to reduce the collateral damage of autoblocks might be to allow users who have registered an email address to bypass autoblocks, so long as the email address doesn't match the email address of the blocked user (or perhaps, of any blocked user). It would be up to the blocking admin if a hard autoblock is used (the current behaviour), or a soft autoblock (the default, under this proposal), or no autoblock at all, as per the recently implemented option.

<dd>A good point. We would have to discount Mailinator addresses. In fact, we would have to have a list of sites whose email addresses don't allow a user to pass a soft-block. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 20:30, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are times when a hard autoblock impacts too many other users, but not autoblocking allows a vandal to pick another username and keep going. A soft autoblock would be less effective than a hard autoblock, but better than no autoblock, and it would impact less users than a hard autoblock would.

<dd>Looking again, I'm not sure I've addressed your comment. Do you mean not useful because you don't think people would use soft blocks, or because you don't think that soft blocks would stop any vandalism?

<dd>I mean probably not useful because a) the majority of contributors probably don't have an email address supplied and b) Vandals would just add an email address while they were signing up to avoid autoblocks.

<dd>Seems unworkable because of the ease of availability of free email addresses. Sure we could spend our time gathering lists of those to exclude but I doubt it's very practical. Persoanally I have a fair number of gmail invites, I can create a dummy account elsewhere, send a gmail invite and create a new gmail account for myself. Are we going to exclude gmail from this scheme? --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be nice to have a status (that any admin can edit) of not being affected by autoblocks. Let's face it if a user makes 500+ non-vandalism edits it is not likely for them to vandalise. Autoblocks are used to get rid of troublesome vandals and there's no point autoblocking a username that existed a few months before the vandalism ever took place. Sorry if this has been asked before but if it has that just means I have even more support. We could have a page like Wikipedia:Requests for autoblock immunity for editors to be quickly reviewed and then approved for autoblock immunity. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiSlasher_63a7.html" title="User:WikiSlasher">WikiSlasher</a> 06:46, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seems reasonable, but I don't think the request page is needed. If a user is caught by an autoblock and uses the unblock template it should just be a matter of course for the admin to "tick the box". --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:05, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to point out that the autoblocker stops and deters more than just vandals. As it stands the autoblocker deters established editors from using <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a> to make <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> against or vandalise the userpages of other editors with whom they disagree with because a blocked sockpuppet will limit their ability to continue editing and repeated unblock-auto requests will raise enough suspicions for a administrators to call in Checkuser. -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&#160;►&#160;</span></a></span></small> 11:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I liked the non-vandal list idea, until I read Netsnipe's comment. I want all those puppeteers caught. Couldn't puppeteers lie and say they have an AOL account so no one would get suspicious of their repeated requests for unblocking? <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 22:31, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Awesome. This checkuser sounds great. I think the checkuser should be made into a bot that constantly checks people for sockpuppetting. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 23:55, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Why is it that when someone logs in from an autoblocked IP they can't edit or make a new account? I remember autoblocks weren't as restrictive. Wiki is Freaakky. 05:43, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Say for example someone makes an account to post abusive comments on someone's user page and is warned a couple of times and then blocked. Without autoblocking as soon as they were blocked they could do it again and again and again. It would also help defend from vandalbots (automated programs that vandalise). So basically it's to stop people vandalising thousands of times with tons of accounts. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiSlasher_63a7.html" title="User:WikiSlasher">WikiSlasher</a> 14:12, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"...Autoblocked because your IP address was recently used by "XarionC". The reason given for XarionC's block is: "vandalism"..." I have no idea who this XarionC is. Please unblock my IP.</p>
