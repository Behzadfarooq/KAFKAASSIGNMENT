Users should not be allowed to create articles about themselves, or at the very least there should be a prominent notice on the page to the effect that that is what was done.

<li><a href="../../../h/a/y/Hayford_Peirce_fdda.html" title="Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> -- I wrote an initially over-long autobio about myself and then cut it greatly to a barebones article. It's very hard to know precisely what to put in or not when writing about oneself, so an autobio either tends to be a little too short or much too long. But I <i>do</i> think, however. that Wikipedia ought to be encouraging living people to be writing about themselves in a substantial way, or even a <i>very</i> substantial way, even though this may at first sight seem like vanity to others. It may well be true in the long run that if one is substantive enough, someone else will eventually write a bio of that person. But how long do we, the users of the encyclopedia have to wait for it? And isn't even the most informed biographer going to miss details and insights that only the person concerned knows? As a "for instance", right now the American author Allen Drury, who wrote the famous (and wonderful) <b>Advise and Consent</b> and a *ton* of other books only has a 1-line entry about him. He died a year or so ago at age 90, more or less. It would be nice if someone like him had written several thousand (or more) words about his career, as seen by himself. Now his voice, and that perspective, is lost forever. I think that most people who actually *have* a noteworthy career, or achievements worthy of being written about, will actually tend to be over-diffident about themselves if anything. I think that the "vanity" factor that a lot of Wikians worry about is overstated, that they are reacting to the vanity bios pasted by 14-year-old students, etc. This is, of course, a problem, but I think the difference between them and an Allen Drury writing about himself, or let's say a Mickey Mantle, or an ex-governor of North Dakota, will be easily discernible.</li>

<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">User:Anthere</a> - <strike>lucky warm only. I would certainly support avoiding self-promotion, but the most important aspect for me would be "no self promotion". I would not strictly support enforcing the rule&#160;: as long as NPOV is respected (and NPOV also include honesty about one own fame imho), it should be fine. Sadly, it is tough to be honest about oneself&#160;:-)</strike> I am not sure I was clear. I disagree with a rule stating one should *not* write about himself. I would support guidelines saying to avoid to do so. The two questions I would ask are "Is the person famous enough to be here, if yes, let hir write about hirself" second would be "Is it written in an obvious self-promotion goal or in a pov way, if no, let hir write about hirself".</li>

I should that although this proposed rule is obviously inspired by the arguments over Daniel C. Boyer, I am not advocating the removal of that article. I haven't examined the particulars of that case closely enough to decide whether he warrants an article in Wikipedia or not. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 04:46, 30 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for creating this proposed rule.</p>
<p>I think we should take it a couple steps more. People should recuse themselves from writing articles about themselves, their companies, products, research they have done, friends, or relatives. And they should recuse themselves from editing and contributing such articles on the wiki. If someone wishes to edit or contribute to an article to which they have personal ties, the material should be posted to the talk page and the edits performed by others.</p>

<dd>My philosophy on rules for Wikipedia is that they should be the minimum necessary to ensure the continued improvement of Wikipedia, and therefore I have made my proposal quite narrow. I would agree that people should not <i>originate</i> articles about the topics you list, generally. I don't see that a ban on their contributions is necessary, and might potentially be counterproductive (if, say, the biographer of a famous person became a Wikipedia contributor, I wouldn't want to prevent them from contributing their knowledge if it is incorporated according to Wikipedia rules such as NPOV). I would agree that anyone who edits an article that falls into those categories should disclose on the talk page their connection to it.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 22:51, 30 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The current version of the welcome page doesn't mention your home town etc, but it does say "we'd like you to contribute your knowledge". People are likely to have knowledge about things that relate to them.

<dd>I wrote an article about my father, since I think bringing urethane to the USA is a notable achievement. Others have made minor changes, but no one seems to have thought it POV. I also started Pineville and Charlotte, both of which have been edited by the Rambot. The bowling pin incident is mentioned elsewhere on the Web, but the collection of molds isn't; that and the specifics in the Pineville and Charlotte, I think, give them character that wouldn't be there if I had had to look everything up. -<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreAbbat_a2d0.html" title="User:PierreAbbat">phma</a></dd>

<p>The basic idea seems sound, but I think it should be narrow. For example, I added "poet" to the article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_M._Ford_39fd.html" title="John M. Ford">John M. Ford</a>. I know him very casually, and I know he writes poetry because I have a chapbook of his work. If, at some point, someone writes an article about someone I'm close to, I'll do my best to be fair, but I'll also use my knowledge to check for accuracy. For that matter, if I ever become famous, and there's an article about me, I'm going to make sure that it doesn't get basic facts (like date and location of birth) wrong. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I agree with most of what has been said. I think there are two main principles.</p>
<p>1. Authors should not create or expand articles that may be perceived as self-promotion.</p>
<p><br />
2. Authors should recuse themselves from content disputes where they have a conflict of interest, such as articles about themselves, their employer, or some other organization where they are heavily involved.</p>
<p>In time #2 may well become the more important principle since it is the one more likely to be encountered as the 'pedia grows in distribution and influence.</p>

<dd>Inserting via edit conflict (my thoughts do overlap with yours): I'm still in favor of an outright NO on everything that smells of self-promotion. The difficult point is how to formulate as a policy what is a quite simple rule in itself: be honest and modest, don't consider yourself too important, don't annoy, don't brag. Most people understand and follow that rule, but how can it be made into a tool to wield against those who don't? A few thoughts on this:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Don't write articles about yourself, your accomplishments, and people and things that you have a (financial, emotional, whatever) interest in. It's okay to give someone else the facts who can insert them (preferably after fact-checking), but don't insert them yourself.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So I should only write about stuff I am <b>not</b> interested in? That sounds very boring. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Abstain from editing such articles whenever possible. If you must correct errors or add necessary material to such articles, clearly state your sources ("- published here and there; - personal knowledge; - Google says:")</li>
<li>Include conflict of interest statement. As with every scientific journal, it should be mandatory that people state every possible conflict of interest when contributing to articles they could be biased about.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Some people may not want to admit where they work, so would not want to include such a statement if they edited a page about their place of work. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of subtle forms of bias (like selecting information, presenting information to persons who suport your views, etc.).</li>
<li>Don't even try to assume you can be neutral about things that concern yourself. Accept the judgement of others (knowledgeable and honest others, that is).</li>
<li>If somebody calls your contributions "self-advertising", "self-promotion" or "vanity page", it's not improbable that they are. If a majority of the contributers involved agree on such a judgement, it's not probable that they conspire against you.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These are just preliminary thoughts and I'd welcome any discussion. It seems clear that if somebody absolutely wants to push their views, perhaps using dirty tricks, it may take a real lot of work for others to prevent it. But since a Wiki is built on mutual trust perhaps even more that on mutual control, we could make it clear what's acceptable and what is not, and trust that Wikipedia spirit will prevail. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosebamse_5238.html" title="User:Kosebamse">Kosebamse</a> 21:40, 31 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that covers everything I write for Wikipedia! All that'd be left would be a bit of light copyediting and clicks of the "random page" button.</p>
<p>Leaving that aside, though, I agree with the spirit of the rest of what Kose is saying... not least because it's stuff we should be doing anyway. Like, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">cite your sources</a> - we should be doing that anyway, but it's <i>especially</i> important for auto-biographical stuff. Similarly for the rest. So a page that went along those lines, I think I could support, if it was well written.</p>
<p>We also need guidance for people working on articles where other contributors have a personal stake. Like, remember that the person you're working with may be especially sensitive to criticism, etc... <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:02, 31 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have an interest in Computer Science, does this mean I can't edit articles about Computer Science?

I didn't include anything auto-biographical in the Drexel University article.

<dd>Hm, difficult question. It's beyond doubt that Wikipedia has had enormous benefit from people contributing things that they are interested in. On the other hand, it seems that in some cases of deliberate misuse it may not be enough to rely on people's honesty and modesty, and mutual control.</dd>
<dd>The Boyer affair shows that 1. it's not difficult to deface Wikipedia with a rather un-encyclopedic intention, 2. it takes long discussions and much work to revert that, and 3. a policy would be helpful to shorten that process. Several arguments against deletion of Boyers edits hinge on definitions ("did he <i>create</i> this or that page? No he didn't, so we should not delete it" etc.). It would help if we could say "well he didn't create it, but he used it for purposes contrary to Wikipedia's principles and policies, so we are on the safe side to delete".</dd>
<dd>It's obvious that we can't say (as I naively suggested above) "don't edit things that you have a personal interest in". But IMO it is necessary to <i>define what degree of interest and what kind of interest is acceptable.</i> From the discussions it seems to emerge that with an article about yourself you are possibly too biased: strong personal interest may be enough to say: hands off. But what about other interests?</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I would still be happy to find a way of formalizing what defines self-promotion and the like. I know it when I see it, but it would help do have a better definition than that so we can use it for a policy. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosebamse_5238.html" title="User:Kosebamse">Kosebamse</a> 14:06, 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a difficult question: Daniel C. Boyer is and always be one person (currently a self-congratulatory one); wikipedia is and always has been nearly anyone who wants to participate (there are some noted exceptions). So someone from Britannica or Encarta could easily come along and adjust the Wikipedia articles to reflect his/her own view of the situation, and provided it's done from the NPOV, the contributions will stay. Obviously degrees of enthusiasm for wikipedia vary among its members, while Boyer's degree of enthusiasm for himself seems constant. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 15:57, 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two points: (1) I don't think material one does research about should be excluded -- if one is an expert (in an academic sense) on a topic, one should give his or her knowledge to wikipedia. Other could NPOV it. Of course, everybody is an expert in hisself/herself, but not in an academic or at least semi-academic sense. One shouldn't write about things one is mainly emotinally interested in (like one self, lovers, crazing fandom), but one should write about things one is mainly "professionally" interested in, does research into or knows much because it's ones field of work or hobby. (2) I think there should be a mention of the user page on the new guideline, a la "If you want to put information about yourself on wikipedia, do it on your user page.". I'm not sure, but I think I haven't seen it. -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe">till we *)</a> 14:28, Aug 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Amount of discussion</span></h2>
<p>I'm interested when Kosebamse says "it takes long discussions and much work to revert that" - I don't see that. I merged all the Boyer articles into one, and the discussion needed basically amounted to me saying "I want to do this - objections?", ignoring Boyer's objection as self-interested, and then doing it. Similarly, I removed links to Boyer's article from a bunch of articles, and did so with no discussion at all.</p>
<p>The reason that the deletion of certain redirects, and the proposed deletion of Daniel C. Boyer has caused so much discussion is largely because there are a range of competing views on the subject. That's just a side-effect of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>-based model: all systems of government have weaknesses. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 14:36, 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Put it on your User Page</span></h2>
<p>Hey folks, I've been reading this debate and it doesn't seem that people have brought this up very often: why don't we just move the article to Boyer's userpage? I personally am I shameless self-promoter, but I would never put information on my achievements in a wikipedia article. Instead, I have put my self-promotion on an external page that I link to from my own userpage <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyfaller_0cdc.html" title="User:Skyfaller">Nelson</a>.</p>
<p>Since some wikipedians might not have an external page where they can brag about themselves, it is fine to brag about your activities on your userpage, perhaps making a subpage for each play you write, etc. Then, if people want to link to your stuff, they can make links from wikipedia articles to your userpage, where you can edit and update your own information without worrying about NPOV. The fact that it is on your userpage tells visitors that it is inherently POV, but at least it's only one degree of POV, and it is therefore easy to filter the slant out.</p>
<p>If a wikipedian DOES get suddenly famous, then perhaps at some point people will want to create formal articles paralleling the user space articles. But until there is a community of people with an urge to create articles, I think people like Boyer and myself should do self-promotion on their userpages, and people wanting to support that self-promotion should link to the userpages from the articles. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyfaller_0cdc.html" title="User:Skyfaller">Nelson</a> 18:18, 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess so, but I'm also suggesting that the userpage be considered more of a genuine article in this case, or perhaps subpages dedicated to your individual works. If enough people link to your personal material, then perhaps you need a real article, but until then I'm suggesting that you move all of your material to your userpage somehow. In other words, perhaps you should edit your userpage to be more article-y, with the recognition that people may use it as an article? Or perhaps have the top be article-y, with more bloggy stuff at the bottom? Oh ick, please refer to my shorter and more coherent post at Talk:Daniel C.

<p>Yes, articles that have been around longer <i>are</i> more encyclopedic, as a general rule, throughout Wikipedia. That's one consequence of the constant improvements.

<dd>I think they may be more factual and more neutral, but I disagree that they must be more encyclopedic. They may be more encyclopedic in proportion because non-encyclopedic ones have already been deleted or otherwise dealt with, but it does not follow that because an article predates the policy that it should remain because it is probably okay. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 21:50, Aug 2, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So what's the point in this policy then? If people can write neutrally, what does it matter if they write about themselves?

<dd>Camembert, you say <i>it's possible to</i> write <i>about oneself in a neutral way</i>.

When it comes to neutrality it's better to err on the side of caution and assume that the neutrality of somebody's autobiography is difficult or impossible to verify. Why doesn't Britannica allow, say, Tony Blair to write about Tony Blair? Their reasons are good enough for Wikiepdia, too. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosebamse_5238.html" title="User:Kosebamse">Kosebamse</a> 20:35, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

We're different from Britannica in that they can employ whoever they like to write their articles, whereas we have to make do with whoever decides to write them - I wouldn't <i>encourage</i> people to write about themselves, but if they provide verifiable information, I don't think we should delete it (there have been a small number of decent autobiographical articles, incidentally, but I'm afraid I can't remember what they were).</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, I can ignore the arbitrary rule at will by simply recreating any article that gets deleted because of it (assuming that it's not an article about me), because if <b>I</b> recreate it, then it won't be covered.

<p>I think I'm in favour of the proposed new rule -- though I'm in two minds as to whether it's enforceable (but how enforceable are any of our other policies anyway?) At its best, it should act as <i>guidance</i> to newcomers that this is not a place to advertise themselves or any commercial services they may offer. When I've witnessed other people (I think it's safe to mention Isis as an example now she's gone) shamelessly promoting themselves, I admit I've been tempted to do the same, but I've restricted myself to mentioning what I do on my user page, which I feel is quite a reasonable thing to do and serves the same purpose in the long run. However, people should not be put off writing about people they know, even friends of theirs, if they happen to be worth an encyclopaedic mention -- and I think most of us are well able to judge whether that is the case. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 20:17, 5 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I entirely agree with the policy, if it is interpreted as a matter of etiquette. That is, people should be strongly discouraged from starting articles about themselves and things that they are responsible for, and from editing articles on such subjects after they have been created. (I think for them to request changes on the talk page would be much better.) This is not because I think that anything they write would be shameless self-promotion. I'm sure that a lot of people would be able to write perfectly neutrally on these subjects. But the articles would inevitably end up being less trusted than other articles. Other people would always have their suspicions that maybe it was not entirely neutral. People who would ordinaryily wade in to neutralise the article might be less inclined to do so if there is a chance of getting into an edit war with the article's subject. To speak from personal experience, when <a href="../../../i/s/i/User%7EIsis_f221.html" title="User:Isis">Isis</a> was around, there were a few things I wanted to change in the article about her, but I didn't, because I thought it might start a conflict. So on the whole I think the place would be more comfortable if people avoided working on articles about them and their own things.</p>
<p>However, I think it is ridiculous to propose deleting articles once they are here, solely on the basis of the historical accident of who created them. If an article is here, regardless of who put it here, it should be judged purely on its merits, the same as for any other article. If it is found to be about a topic that shouldn't be covered here, then delete it; if it is found to be about a topic that should be covered here, then keep it. Our aim is to build up human knowledge by adding information. To remove information just because someone has added it in a way we don't like doesn't help anybody.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and I think that some people are going a little over the top in saying that we shouldn't add articles on relatives, people we know, and even <i>things that we have an interest in</i>! I've added <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Jones_b71d.html" title="Noel Jones">one of my relatives</a>, and I think that should be okay. (He wasn't a close relative - a first cousin of my grandfather, or (more probably) only a <i>half</i> first cousin, if that's a valid term - and I never even met the man...) But I think we should be very careful not to add information that we only know from our own personal experience of the subject matter, and that can't be independently verified.

<dd>The "interest in" comment has been repeated a number of times and was taken out of context from something I wrote, which admittedly may not have been particularly lucid. The intended meaning of "interest in" was more vested: an ownership interest, a political interest, anything where the author would stand to gain from the popularization of a particular topic or POV. Chrysler's marketing department shouldn't come here and make a writeup on Jeeps. The New Brunswick chamber of commerce shouldn't come here and write about tourism. I never intended to mean that people should avoid writing articles on <i>things they find interesting,</i> which, as has been pointed out, borders on the ridiculous.

<dd>Even on this narrower definition, I think it is still problematic. Suppose a historian comes here who has written a book about the medieval history of France. I would say that having him or her write about medieval France in Wikipedia would be one of the best things we could get, but according to this definition of the policy it would be forbidden (interest in Medieval France could lead to enlarged sales for his book). Likewise, a homosexual would not be allowed to write about homosexuality (because he has interest in the POV that homosexuality is okay).</dd>
<dd>I don't think that the Chrysler marketing department should be writing about jeeps, but I do think that there's plenty of room for individual Chrysler employees to do so.

<p>Can someone try to clean up the wording? I do not believe that a policy can be promulgated effectively while at the same time the possible silliness of said policy is expounded upon. I changed this once before but the original wording is back. The wording is rather defeatist and weak in other areas as well.</p>

<dd>re: Boyer -- I believe that Starling's role in the creation of the Boyer page is beside the point, since there is a reasonably wide consensus that nobody would have cared if there was only a brief, independently written, factual article on Boyer, which is probably all that Starling ever intended. The ongoing dispute stems from material Boyer had added after Starling created the page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These claims keep surfacing, and yet I would like to challenge anyone to reveal information I added to the article that was not factual, and reiterate that the bulk of the excessively long article about me was caused by someone else's merging of <i>The Octopus Frets</i>, <i>The Tailgating Spinster</i>, &amp;c., which was hardly my idea. My chief changes to Daniel C. Boyer were in the areas of linking, correcting false or misleading information, and mentioning that <i>The Tailgating Spinster</i> was dedicated to the memory of Keiko Ann. These claims are very misleading, to say the least. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 00:39, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arguments and sources</span></h2>
<p>I have problems with proposed guidelines #4 and #5. To me, not being neutral is not enough reason to forbid someone from engaging in a controversy. In almost all cases where there is a controversy, there are people involved who are not neutral. I would even say that that is usually how controversies start: Someone sees an article and does not agree with it. Usually the person who does not agree is not someone neutral, but someone with an opposite POV. They try to improve it, someone else thinks they have overdone it, and bingo. Controversies don't occur on subjects that people are neutral about.</p>
<p>As for #5: citing one's sources often is hard for such a subject. One has heared, read, experienced much about the subject, and might well be able to just write about it without getting <i>any</i> sources involved. I recently wrote an article about Cantor's diagonal method for the Dutch Wikipedia. I am a mathematician and the diagonal method is my favorite piece of mathematics, so one might well say that it is a "subject close to my heart". I have read about it in various books, but none of them were at hand as I wrote my article. If asked for sources, I would not know which to mention, and even if I did, might have to take a 500 km train ride to just get the title and author. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 10:47, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Tim!</dd>
<dd>I took your advice and i am acting nice - i just stopped editing wikipedia, because there is no sense in editing anything if your work would be deleted within few hours. Is that what is expected from the only source of information about a topic? "Remain passive, because whatever you write, others would delete because they have no knowledge about the subject, so they treat your work as stupid."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I want to state, that as the Holy Prophet, i can expect that 99% of world population would be my fierce enemies who would like to kill me. I am just revealing the truth about the world, that is very much contrary to their beliefs, paradigms, points of view, religions, ideologies etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is why only i am able to write objectively about myself. My enemies would like to delete all the information about me or describe me very negatively. My followers would describe me with too much positive attitude.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other problem is that it is really hard to find any objective information about a prophet when one cannot speak himself anymore... Usually people falsify the prophets message after ones death and create quite fantastic and often very stupid "interpretations" of "what the prophet wanted to say..."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So it is hard for me to understand, why the prophet is not allowed to write himself about him and his doctrine and ideology...</dd>

<dd>Thank you anyway for the good deed that you made yourself about me and my ideas. I really appreciate it.</dd>

<p>Paul: yes, you can, but frankly no, I really can't recommend that you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you're really worthy of an entry in an encyclopedia, then surely someone else (someone you've never met) will eventually stop by here and create one. If you aren't: well, then they won't.</li>
<li>it's <i>really</i> hard to write NPOV about yourself, and taking the inevitable harsh edits or VfD character assassination can be tough too.</li>
<li>frankly, for every one arguable autobiographical entry, there's a hundred utterly undeserving ones. Some of these are just kids having a laugh, but there are quite a few efforts to deliberately (and in my opinion dishonestly) insert themselves into the wikipedia. This seems to be motivated either by vanity or a desire to enhance one's google pagerank. By asking this question here in such an open way you've already shown yourself to be a million miles (1.4 million km) above such pondscum, but by creating the autobiographical page you propose you risk being tarred with the same brush. I'd steer clear of such company, if I were you.</li>

However, if you look at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAuto-biography_0a7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Auto-biography">Wikipedia:Auto-biography</a>, the example they give for something "close to your heart" and acceptable is an athlete or official actually involved in the Olympic Games writing about them. At what point does it cross the line from being close to your heart to being actually about you? The athletes and officials sound pretty close to the Games. It would seem to me to be the difference between an event that involves you and an event that IS you. So, maybe it might be OK to write about a march on Washingon that you helped organize, but not all about how your latest scientific discovery saves the world. Or am I missing the point?

<dd>Hm, now that you mention it, it does seem POV, probably because all of the links at the bottom are to websites and news stories that talk about the recent scandal, and all of the comments are like, "critics say that Diebold sucks". There is also no information about their ATMs and other things that they make. On the other hand, the scandal is why Diebold is in the news, and the primary reason why people care about the company. Note that there is no article on <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avante.html" title="Avante">Avante</a> or any of Diebold's other competitors. This is of course not an argument for deleting the info on the controversy, I actually wanted to add more information on the latest developments (Wikipedia is not paper), but it is an argument for writing a less narrowly-focused article. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyfaller_0cdc.html" title="User:Skyfaller">Nelson</a> 05:43, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds like a good and ethical example to set. I know that many people think of Christians as bad people without morals, so I think it's especially appropriate for you to challenge these prevailing stereotypes. Perhaps you'll be known "The Good Christian", and who knows, maybe we can hope that sometime in the future only academics will remember the original, negative connotation of "Christian", and that the word "Christian" primarily will make people think of "The Good Christian" instead, the one person who did the right thing when all others, with better reputations, did nothing or did evil. Oh, wait, never mind, that's "Samaritan" and "Good Samaritan" I'm thinking of.

<dd>The problem with "guidelines" is that they quickly elide into authoritarian laws, rules, and commandments, and the mere *mention* of enforcement -- i.e., "I'm sure it wouldn't be strictly enforced" -- reminds me that most proposed guidelines do more harm than good. Accordingly whenever I have been in a position to "enforce" guidelines, I have refrained from doing so, and referred to the guidelines that I have promulgated as "suggested protocols." Even so, carefully choosing my words has seldom prevented authoritarian control freaks from citing my suggested protocols as if they were the Word of God, etched on stone tablets. In this regard, the guideline that should be first and foremost among Wikipedians is that people should think for themselves. Now, if only we can find a way to enforce that guideline. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 23:02, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)

<li>From experience, a lot of the people who've contributed to their own articles have not been able to keep in mind NPOV, so people will be very suspicious of people editing articles about themselves.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Personal articles and solution thereof</span></h2>
<p>Among the votes for deletion, the most commonly encountered category is personal articles. These articles are usually by some flaky person of no true interest to a Wiki-xxx. Though seldom encountered in votes for deletion, there also exist people who are of some minor interest, but who would not always justify an article. I propose a solution for both categories.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a separate Wiki with unlimited (except for size) personal articles. The idea is that if you can't easily deal with them, at least categorize them into a heap where they would be harmless. The existing Wikipedia would simply redirect via creator selection option, or by speedy VfD to the personalWIKI. The personal articles would not be searchable by Wikipedia, but would available through a different Wiki name.</p>
<p>A variation on this is to also require personal articles to have an selectable "open date" e.g. 50 years in the future, when the article would finally be posted to the public, but held confidential to Wiki (via password) prior to that date. The idea here is that some people actually are noteworthy, and that often such people would be reluctant to publish personal information prior to their death. I recently encountered an example of this. The lady was a former professor of French, had lead an interesting life, but was otherwise little known publically. She is also very old and probably near death. An article about her would be highly appropriate, and, it would be best done with her assistance. What do you do with such an article?</p>
<p>I think that such future open date personal articles would tend to attract the less flaky members of society, and, would be a useful content. Perhaps such articles could be automatically forwarded to Wikipedia after the open date. Posted by User:66.44.3.205</p>

<dd>I don't think its a good idea either "Create a separate Wiki with unlimited (except for size) personal articles." Am I reading this right: so everyone could write an article about themselves?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Existing biographical articles discovered by their subjects</span></h2>
<p>What are the policies regarding editing an existing article about yourself? I know of two articles thus far which have been edited by the subject after he or she discovers the article's existence. This isn't a case of someone creating a vanity article on themselves but of someone who was notable enough for someone to have written an article on them. This sort of thing will become more common a) as the number of biographical articles on wikipedia grows and b) as use of the internet grows. Specifically, the article <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_B._MacDonald_335e.html" title="Kevin B. MacDonald">Kevin B. MacDonald</a> has, of late, been edited by the professor himself and the article on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a> has recently been discovered by the journalist in question. Their interventions have been useful as far as providing missing information (such as birthdates) and correcting errors but there is, of course, a danger of the articles basically becoming autobiographies. Are there guidelines in place to deal with this? If not what guidelines should be implemented? Should there be a complete ban on individuals editing articles on themselves? should such edits require some sort of mediation before being accepted? AndyL 01:03, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's worry about it when and if it becomes a real problem. For now, common sense applies; if the subject of the article seems to be making useful and factual contributions, then there is no problem. If they actively try to turn the article into a promotional piece, their edits should be treated like any other NPOV violation. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 21:34, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If I could keep it to "just the things that might appear in Who's Who" about me, would anyone object making it more of a real article instead of the crap I write about myself for columns? --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandalSchwartz_3a9b.html" title="User:RandalSchwartz">Randal L.

<dd>The obvious common sense answer is that they should avoid editing the article directly, but can help a lot by adding checkable information to the talk page for uninvolved editors to add. e.g. <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheldon_Rampton_e438.html" title="Sheldon Rampton">Sheldon Rampton</a> never touches articles about his own projects, but he does add useful stuff to the talk pages.

<dd>Actually, that's not 100% true. I believe I created the article on the <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin_Coordinating_Council_on_Nicaragua_97f3.html" title="Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua">Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua</a>, a nonprofit organization for which I have volunteered for many years. (Currently I'm a member of the WCCN board of directors.) I created the WCCN article in December 2002, shortly after I first heard of Wikipedia and when I was still learning how it works. I also did some editing about the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheldon_Rampton_e438.html" title="Sheldon Rampton">Sheldon Rampton</a> article (although I didn't create it; it already existed before I ever heard of Wikipedia). At the time I had no idea that anyone thought it might be inappropriate to create autobiographical articles or articles about a topic in which I was personally involved. Once I learned that Jimbo thought this was inappropriate, I've tried to comply, even though I personally disagree with this rule, for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li><i>It's unenforceable.</i> If anyone wants to create an autobiographical article, it's easy to do so under a sockpuppet or anonymous IP. On <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org" class="external text" title="http://www.sourcewatch.org" rel="nofollow">SourceWatch</a>, my own wiki, I've noticed several cases in which people have done exactly this. For example, we have a long puff piece about <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Michael_Johns" class="external text" title="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Michael_Johns" rel="nofollow">Michael Johns</a> that it's fairly obvious was created almost entirely by Johns himself. Incidentally, Wikipedia also has an article about <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Johns_a47a.html" title="Michael Johns">Johns</a>, for which Johns himself is obviously the primary author, although he's done it anonymously. On SourceWatch, we don't have a policy against autobiography, and I've never attempted to interfere with Johns' article. I see wikis as a research tool rather than as the final arbiter of interpretation on a topic, and even though Johns' article is full of self-aggrandizing rhetoric, it also pulls together a list of articles he has written that would be useful to a journalist interested in reporting about him, so I think there's more benefit than harm in letting him edit freely.</li>
<li><i>It encourages people who want to write about themselves to do so covertly rather than transparently.</i> On SourceWatch, we tell people that anyone can edit anonymously if they prefer, but we encourage them to contribute under their own name. If they contribute to articles about themselves, there's a good chance that someone will figure it out anyway and accuse them of being sneaky. By contrast, I think the Wikipedia policy actually encourage sneakiness.</li>
<li><i>It's vague and unclear.</i> It's obvious that the policy implies I shouldn't edit an article about myself, but does it mean I shouldn't edit an article about the Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua? Should I also avoid editing articles about Nicaragua? What about articles on Wisconsin, where I live? Exactly how much familiarity with a topic defines the threshold at which people should disqualify themselves from writing about it?</li>
<li><i>The policy eliminates from participation the individuals who are best-informed about the topic.</i> It's true that it no one can have a neutral point of view about themselves, but Wikipedia doesn't require that individual contributors have a neutral point of view. Rather, it strives for <i>articles</i> to have a neutral point of view, by synthesizing and integrating the diverse points of views of multiple individuals. In the case of the Sheldon Rampton article, I added the fact that I was born in Long Beach, California and the fact that my leaving the Mormon Church was influenced in part by Mormon feminist Sonia Johnson -- facts that are not widely known and that I don't think are particularly self-serving. I think the addition of these facts improved rather than hurt the article. I also added the sentence about criticism of me by Rick Berman, who calls me a "self-anointed watchdog," "scare-monger," "reckless" and "left-leaning." (My expertise about myself includes the fact that I'm familiar with criticisms of myself.) I mention this sentence in particular because it demonstrates that autobiography doesn't inevitably lead to puffery and self-serving edits. I put in the sentence about Rick Berman's comments because Jimbo argued on Wikien-L that the Sheldon Rampton article didn't contain any criticisms of me. I invited people to add some, but no one did, so I decided to add some myself.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In some ways, I could argue that the articles about myself are weaker because I've refrained from editing them. For example, the article about <a href="../../../p/r/_/PR_Watch_acda.html" title="PR Watch">PR Watch</a> includes a section describing "Sheldon Rampton's contributions to SourceWatch" that is pretty ridiculous. The two contributions which it mentions were added by a disgruntled SourceWatch user who got angry and started vandalizing our site after I challenged his whitewash of the Tienanmen Square massacre as "<a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Denying_the_Tiananmen_Square_massacre&amp;oldid=14132|a" class="external text" title="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Denying_the_Tiananmen_Square_massacre&amp;oldid=14132|a" rel="nofollow">perjorative phrase</a> [sic] used by Western media to describe the June 4, 1989 effort by the People's Republic of China to regain control of the main plaza of its capital city." This individual then began looking for opportunities to attack everything I wrote, so he latched on to an article I wrote about a tobacco-funded think tank in which I stated, "<a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/wiki.phtml?title=Smoking_as_a_civic_duty|Only" class="external text" title="http://www.sourcewatch.org/wiki.phtml?title=Smoking_as_a_civic_duty|Only" rel="nofollow">a tobacco-funded think tank would ever go so far as to describe smoking as a civic duty</a>." My critic (who chose to remain anonymous, even as he attacked me publicly) tried to interpret this as a culturally insensitive statement, on the grounds that some Caribbean and Native American cultures regard smoking as a religous sacrament. Obviously I wasn't referring to Caribbean and Native American cultures when I wrote about a right-wing think tank headquartered in Washington, DC, so this criticism is a rather forced point at best. The main thing, though, is that these particular topics are very peripheral to the main thrust of what I've written on SourceWatch and elsewhere, so it's rather bizarre that they are listed as though they somehow typify my writings. I don't find them offensive, just strange, and if I were editing the article about myself, I'd either delete these examples altogether or replace them with something more representative.</dd>

<dd>Having said all this, I do agree that there are potential problems if people edit articles about themselves. If you look at the history of the Sheldon Rampton article, you'll find a couple of instances where people who don't like my writings have been deliberately antagonistic in the hope that they could goad me into some kind of fight. See, for example, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Talk%7ECenter_for_Media_and_Democracy_52e1.html" title="Talk:Center for Media and Democracy">Talk:Center for Media and Democracy</a>, where one person declares that "Getting Rampton's goat is just icing on the cake." I don't want to waste my time on that kind of pissing match, and I generally trust the broader Wikipedia community to strive for fairness, so even if self-editing <i>were</i> encouraged here, I probably wouldn't do much of it. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheldon_Rampton_b54a.html" title="User:Sheldon Rampton">Sheldon Rampton</a> 10:41, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article about my company? Wikipedians for hire?</span></h2>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>(I posted on the request for pages talk area, but figured a cross-post to this talk page would be ok.)</p>
<p>I work for a US-based non-profit that does reproductive health work in Asia, Africa &amp; Latin America. We don't have an article about us yet, and I'm inclined <b>not</b> to create it myself, although that does seems to be permissible under certain circumstances and depending on a number of factors.</p>
<p>However, I'm also disinclined to wait for someone to happen to create it, since we're a significant enough presence in our area to justify an article on us.</p>
<p>Is it being done yet that Wikipedians can be "hired" to create content? Obviously, that sort of thing could raise concerns about objectivity etc, but seeing as though anything that might be written on spec would be subjected to the same editing for NPOV etc as anything else, it seems like something that could be made to work in some fashion or other.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any thoughts.</p>

<li>Thanks, Isomorphic. I'm wondering if there is room for a project of some sorts to help facilitate people and entities that will have to walk these Autobiography issues choosing to walk them correctly. I'm basically trying to create, on my company's discussion page and on my login's discussion page, a blueprint for how to act with respect to this sort of stuff. I wish there were a few options in somewhat a cousin vein to a license of sort that I could use there instead of having to try to create the wheel and also figure out which and how many spokes should go in it. Maybe even something that I could then get my president to sign off on being our company's official policy towards its employees' interaction with Wikipedia? Does that make sense? Strikes me that as Wikipedia and Wikipedia's relevance grow, these sorts of issues will be ever-present and increasingly important to address. Anyhoo, anyone who wants to help point out a couple opportunities for improving my 'wheel' can feel encouraged to visit my talk or my company's talk. `~:)<a href="../../../p/f/w/User%7EPfwebadmin_7d33.html" title="User:Pfwebadmin">Pfwebadmin</a>

<li>As it happens, I'm planning to do a major expansion of the article on my own employer. Outside of this page, I don't think there's any guidance on Wikipedia as to how one should behave in editing article on subjects you're personally involved with. The key point is just that an article must remain neutral. The joy of Wikipedia is that even if the original article is one-sided, it can be made neutral. I would recommend sticking, as much as possible, to facts that can be verified using third-party sources. Admittedly, I don't know how closely I'll follow this myself; it's much easier to get historical information from the company itself than to try to find any third party who's written significantly on it. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 02:59, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>People normally won't expect a guideline to be literally followed all the time. However, they *would* expect it to be literally followed in cases that seem to be directly and intentionally addressed by it. This guideline is very specific about not editing articles about yourself; the only aspect of it which suggests otherwise is that the article mentions adding but not deletion. Most readers would interpret the spirit of the article to mean that editing an article about yourself is not allowed at all. I doubt that most readers would interpret it to mean that you can remove false claims about yourself. I'm also not convinced that either the original writer of the page or the voters meant it that way.
<p>(If it's really okay to remove false claims about yourself, and if the article really isn't trying to suggest otherwise, then there should be no problem with altering the article to explicitly say so, right? After all, it's not really changing the article at all.)</p>
<p>And under what grounds could someone remove false claims about themselves anyway? They couldn't say the claims are false--that would be original research, as pointed out in this article. They *might* be able to claim the statements are unsourced, but there are such things as inaccurate sources. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 16:48, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wikipedia is not a mechanism for correcting incorrect sources. What the sources say is what an article should say. If someone has a disagreement with what a source says about them, they should take that up with the source, not with Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:27, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, subjects of articles shouldn't really be removing false claims about themselves. The problem is that while they may be knowledgeable about themselves, they aren't impartial. What if they're just trying to whitewash their own record? On the other hand, subjects of articles can and should point the errors out on the discussion page. They can also point us to sources they consider more accurate. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 04:44, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that before putting any points on the project page we need to agree on them.

<li>Let's have some discussion about this so some sort of consensus can be reached. Although I suppose my opinion could be changed one way or the other, I think users should be advised <i>not</i> to add new information or remove what they believe to be false information about themselves. They should be advised to post suggestions in the article's talk page regarding what they think should be added or removed. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 08:16, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Take a look at the AFD. 4/1 voted for keep, was properly referenced, notable person. But it seems that he wrote it about himself. Managed to write it neutrally too. So it was userfied.

<p>If we agree with the general policy that people writing about themselves have a conflict of interest when it comes to being open minded, then this also applies to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikip" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikip" rel="nofollow">Seigenthaler Gate</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a>|[[User talk:AlMac|&lt;sup&gt;(talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the autobiography rule is silly. I think that the only issue should be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and otherwise I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to contribute to an article about yourself. If someone was writing a biography (which is essentially what we are doing), and they did not consult the person who they were writing about, then it would not have much credibility. Whilst it is difficult to write neutrally about yourself, some people are more able to do so than others. Similarly, when writing about *ANYTHING* that you feel passionately about (i.e. have a clue about) you will always struggle to be neutral. Therefore, there is really no reason to apply NPOV more strongly towards autobiographies than any other article.</p>
<p>One big factor with this is accuracy. If someone writes about themselves, or at least is consulted, or able to be consulted, then there is a much greater chance of accuracy. They will more easily be able to fix up tiny little errors that others might not know about, and can also more easily find cites to reference things.</p>
<p>I actually think that the Seigenthaler controversy is only a secondary example of this rule being wrong. I think that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> is a primary example - where the person was banned from Wikipedia for trying to write about himself. That is so awfully wrong, and has been picked up by the media.</p>
<p>At the end of scrutiny I don't think that this autobiography rule can stand up as having any merit whatsoever. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 13:55, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">an interesting wrinkle</span></h2>
<p>There's been discussion above on the situation where a clearly-notable person 'discovers' his own Wikipedia article, written by others, and wants to start editing it. But what about the case of a long-time wikipedian who eventually becomes famous/notable and gets written about? He/she will be in a dilemma: it will be ethically inappropriate to edit the article without disclosing his/her personal interest; yet if the user values the anonymity of all his/her past edits he/she may not want to identify him/herself. Just a little brain-teaser. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 21:49, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's called <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">sock puppetry</a>, and it appears that <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia discourages</a> (SHOULD NOTs in RFC 2119 parlance) such practice. As Jimbo Wales put it: "There's no specific policy against it, but it's generally considered uncool unless you have a good reason." Would this count such a good reason? --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamian_Yerrick_2a18.html" title="User:Damian Yerrick">Damian Yerrick</a> 03:05, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it's not a sock puppet if no page is ever edited by the person's two accounts. That is to say, I could have one account for historical articles, and another one for mathetmatical ones, and be rigorously sure <i>never ever ever</i> to cross this boundary. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 03:57, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe this hypothetical user needs to make a decision about which is more important to them; keeping their edits anonymous, or correcting flaws in an article about themselves. Not to play big-brother/privacy-nazi here, but if the user doesn't want to associate their real name/reputation on edits they don't sound like they have much faith in their own knowledge and probably shouldn't be making those contributions to start with. I'm just having trouble seeing a situation where someone would not want their contributions scrutinized in regards to who they were unless they were making negetive contributions, or simply a commonly known quack in the field they protrayed themselves as being an expert in. Ironically, before this policy change on having to be registered to edit articles, the person could have made the changes to their autobio while not logged on, citing who they were in the Talk page, and have maintained the anonymity for their regular account.
