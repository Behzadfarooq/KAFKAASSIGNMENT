<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>I dropped notes round a while back to those who have listed themselves at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One</a> to ask for suggestions for selected articles on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Portal%7EFormula_One_d870.html" title="Portal:Formula One">portal:Formula One</a>. There was a pretty good response, both in terms of how it might work and of articles suggested. <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Hill_de37.html" title="Damon Hill">Damon Hill</a> came out with the most support and was brought up to <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> standard after a lot of work by <a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkully_Collins_923e.html" title="User:Skully Collins">Skully Collins</a> before going on as the F1 portal selected article a couple of weeks ago. It is now at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">Featured Article Candidates</a> as a Featured Article candidate (why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further?).</p>
<p>Several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or bi-weekly 'Selected Article' could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard. Although it wasn't quite what I had in mind when I started, this seemed to work pretty well for the Damon Hill article, so I've drafted up a process for doing this more regularly. See <a href="../../../f/o/r/Portal_talk%7EFormula_One_Management_of_selected_articles_36a5.html" title="Portal talk:Formula One/Management of selected articles">Portal_talk:Formula_One/Management_of_selected_articles</a> for details. Essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new 'Selected Article'. I'd be grateful for any comments on how this might work - I'm sure some of you are more familiar with things 'Wiki' than me - as well as your votes for the next candidate (by 16 July).</p>
<p>You may also want to help with the article <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Villeneuve_0aff.html" title="Gilles Villeneuve">Gilles Villeneuve</a>, which was the next most popular after Damon Hill. The idea is to try and get it up to GA standard by 16 July and then put it on the portal as the 'Selected Article'. I hope you can help! <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 15:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you may have heard the Mega Society article was deleted awhile ago, at the end of an acrimonious AfD/DRV process. There is a wide divergence between deletion <i>policy</i> (as defined by various policy guideline documents) and deletion <i>practice</i>, as implemented by admins (who claim to be following the "spirit" of the law). Consequently there are lessons to be learnt from the experience, which will not be obvious from reading the guidelines. Here are some tips for future conduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single purpose users are frowned upon and were a frequent bone of contention during the AfD and DRV processes. So I urge you all to "establish" yourself as Wikipedians: create, edit and even ... delete articles! There are plenty of articles that need attention.</li>
<li>It is a <i>very</i> good idea to put something on your user page, (it doesn't matter what) to avoid showing up as redlinked users -- being redlinked will count against you in any debate.</li>
<li>When voting, include <i>brief</i> reasons which are grounded in policy (votes not backed by reasoning may be discounted; too much reasoning will be ignored).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the bias against soliciting (see judgement) I may not be able to contact you again, so I suggest you put the Mega Society in your watchlists.</p>
<p>The closing admin's comments on the Mega Society:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Within the argumentation of the debate, the most significant point raised by those who supported the article was that a new draft was available. The article is not protected, so this may be posted at any time and (assuming it is not substantially similiar to the older version) it will be judged anew on its merits. This is good news for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bad news for you is that it is well-established practice within Wikipedia to ignore completely floods of newer, obviously "single-issue POV", contributors at all our deletion fora. I'm among the most "process-wonkish" of Wikipedians, believe me, and even process-wonks accept that these sorts of voters are completely discountable. Wikipedia is not a pure democracy; though consensus matters, the opinion of newcomers unfamiliar with policy is given very little weight. Your vote, that of Tim Shell, and that wjhonson were not discounted. The others supporting your view were. I promise you that it is almost always true that, within Wikipedia, any argument supported by a flood of new users will lose, no matter how many of the new users make their voices known. In the digital age, where sockpuppeting and meatpuppeting are as easy as posting to any message board, this is as it should be for the sake of encyclopedic integrity. It is a firm practice within Wikipedia, and it is what every policy and guideline mean to imply, however vaguely they may be worded. (I do agree that our policies, written by laypeople mostly, could do with a once-over from an attorney such as myself; however, most laypeople hate lawyers, so efforts to tighten wording are typically met with dissent.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If your supporters were more familiar with Wikipedia, they would realize that, invariably, the most effective way to establish an article after it has been deleted in a close AfD is to rewrite it: make it "<s>faster</s>, better, stronger."

<p>So the outcome was not entirely negative, although I was disappointed by the admin's rather cavalier approach evidenced by the response to my enquiry:</p>
<dl>
<dd>.... why did you discount the votes of, say, <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">User:GregorB</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">User:Canon</a>? They are not new users, nor did I solicit them. I presume by Tim Shell you mean Tim Smith? ...... --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

</dl>
<p>to which I received this rather off-hand reply:</p>
<dl>
<dd>User:GregorB offered a very brief comment not supported by policy. User:Canon did take the time to offer analysis at DRV, but he had been among the first voters at the AfD to offer a mere "Keep" without explanation; therefore, I assumed he had been solicited by someone.

<p>which didn't fill me with confidence about Wiki-"due process".</p>
<p>Anyway, my grumpiness aside, the Mega Society article, is presently under userfied open-development at <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_mega_48b7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice/mega">User:MichaelCPrice/mega</a>, and will reappear at some point, when (hopefully) some of the ill-feeling evidenced during the debate has cooled. I am very heartened by the article's continued development, and by the development of associated articles. Thanks for everyone's help!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the kind comment, as for running/making a bot the only information I have is on <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html#Software_which_may_be_useful_for_making_bots" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT#Software_which_may_be_useful_for_making_bots</a>, basically, people who have made bots, like myself have done so from scratch, but now there is plenty of open source material to use. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 18:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Noticed that you've joined with the rest of folks who want to take over the world by telling everyone about cryptography. Welcome aboard.</p>
<p>I notice that you've contributed to some of the history and ancillary topics (eg, Military Cryptanalytics); perhaps you'd also like to chyme in (from an Eire perspective?) on the Teapot Tempest (cy v ci, a category on the Project talk page). Not too long ago, the crypto-corner was up to one per-mille of all en.Wikipedia articles. We may not manage that again, but Onward into the breach dear cryptiacs! Onward! <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 15:12, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "teapot tempest' can be found at a link on the main Wikiproject page, under heading discussions, IIRC. Rather Swiftian really, but there was strong feeling, and perhaps some remains. There's also a bit of it at talk:cryptography in one of the (the earliest, I think) archives. There are a couple of pointers to some other short discussions there as well. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 13:23, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! You are correct the biography of the subject as it stood was not enough to assert their notability.

<p>The Teapot Tempest papers may be found on the WikiProject Cryptography page under cipher v cypher. Like letters to the Times (London), much noise and little illumination... English is really a language most ready to embrace chaos -- of vocabulary, spelling vs pronounciation, borrowed words, ... Uniquely so, I haven't any idea, but it's fascinating. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 10:20, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Autarch,</p>
<p>By coincidence I revisited the English version of the in title mentioned article.<br />
Found just within a year your Irish translation.<br />
It has been a hobby of me to find Irish words since I noticed that there are Gaelic words derived from my mothertongue i.e. Dutch.<br />
I'd like to thank you for this valuable and interesting contribution which of caused an edit in the <a href="../../../../nl/s/u/t/Sutton.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Sutton">Dutch</a> Wikipedia.<br />

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I was curious as I read the book fairly recently and didn't remember that as the source.
