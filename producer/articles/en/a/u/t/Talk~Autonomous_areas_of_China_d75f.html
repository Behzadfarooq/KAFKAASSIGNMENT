<ul>
<li>I'd be willing to move them all. Assuming cut and paste and no server timeouts it's a small project. Tobias, can you explain why you think pluralization is contrary to WP conventions? You would never, for instance, see "Southern state of United States". The first "state" would be pluralized. The WP convention says singular titles are preferred because an article should be about a single thing. <i>"Articles that actually distinguish between multiple distinct instances of related items can be sensibly given a plural title when the alternative would be to create an inappropriately large number of short articles"</i> A list of regions is a singular item (the list) but the title should reflect that the subject is pluralized (regions). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 02:30, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This would be my opinion, though I have no concern about them. Leave the redirects alone. Extra redirects that were pluralized might help lost users but there is no context to rename the existing ones. League and Banner should probably be pluralized, they contain lists. And replace the parentheses with "of Inner Mongolia" as well. SAR is a defining term without a list - singular.

<dd>Ran can you imagine that we have some type of entity that only has one entry (member)? I have no example but maybe this exists.

<dd>Yes, there is the Shennongjia Forestry Area which is the only county-level forestry area of China. Hong Kong was the only special administrative region of China from 1997 to 1999. But that is beside the point.</dd>
<dd>My point is that it should not be the presence or absence of a <i>list</i> that makes a difference in the naming conventions of articles. Rather, it should be a set of naming conventions that we can agree upon and work with. For example, if we agree that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_China_f518.html" title="Provinces of China">Provinces of China</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefectures_of_Japan_0625.html" title="Prefectures of Japan">Prefectures of Japan</a> etc. sound better than <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_China_ccd2.html" title="Province of China">Province of China</a>, Prefecture of Japan etc., then perhaps we can move pages to fit those conventions. Whether lists are present in those articles is not important. And we should certainly be aware that this is against the naming conventions of Wikipedia in general, since we have articles like <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a> etc. even though there is obviously more than one dog or cat in the world. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 06:10, Mar 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dear ran - this is 100% clear&#160;:-) presence of a list has to say nothing. But it seems pluralization has a lot of opposition now. maybe from people that have never seen all the 150 other pages, each having maybe 20 links to it on average. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> 06:20, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the present conventions on pluralisation. Articles should be title as one of the item, unless for lists or categories of that items.

<p>One problem though: Schmucky, these articles aren't simply lists. Some articles, like <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_China_38df.html" title="County of China">County of China</a>, don't contain any lists at all. These are encyclopedia articles that talk about specific administrative divisions and how they work (e.g. how autonomous regions work, why they were set up, when they were set up, etc.). Do you think it's appropriate to pluralize in this case? -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:11, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, ran, I see the problem is larger and more comprehensive than this single article, which I assumed when I created the request to move. I still support pluralization, at least of this article. The basis for whether an article should be pluralized or not depends on whether the contents are plural. If the article is defining the idea, ie, answering the question "Q: What is a province of China? A: A political subdivision" then singular would be correct. If the article is defining things that match the idea, ie "Q: What are the provinces of China? A: The following regions..." then plural is correct. I don't think a single convention is possible - we have thousands of editors so the style of the contents themselves is in disarray. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 18:31, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, but I think this article is supposed to be on what an autonomous region is specifically, not just a list of autonomous regions. A list can already be found in <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, so a separate list would be pointless in any case. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 19:33, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)<br />
I've added some more info, making this article into a general article about autonomous entities in China. As you can see, this is certainly not a mere list (at least, not any more&#160;;) ) -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 23:51, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does the ROC have any autonomous region?

<dd>No, the ROC doesn't have autonomous regions. But why would that mean renaming to "... of the PRC"?

<ul>
<li>The "China" here means "China", not necessarily the "PRC". The article talks about the autonomous regions of China. Since there are no autonomous regions in China other than those set up by the PRC, no confusion would arise if we simply talked about the autonomous regions of China, as all of them were set up by the PRC. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:46, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Autonomous region" is an administrative division of the PRC. Only political entities can have administrative divisions. There's no equivalent in history, nor in ROC's administrative division system, to "autonomous region". — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:32, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>There's no equivalent in history, nor in ROC's administrative division system, to "autonomous region".</i> Which is precisely why we don't need to specify PRC in this case! No ambiguity could possibly arise from talking about the "Autonomous regions of China", so why should we overcomplicate things?<br />
It is true that only political entities can have administrative subdivisions. So why aren't you campaigning for the move of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefectures_of_Japan_0625.html" title="Prefectures of Japan">Prefectures of Japan</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/p/Departments_of_France_f3ab.html" title="Departments of France">Departments of France</a> to Prefectures of the post-Meiji Reform Japanese state or Departments of French governments since the French Revolution? Clearly, Japan and France are, like China, geographical and culture entities that have been represented by multiple governments throughout history, incluing a few cases (e.g. Free French / Vichy France) where multiple governments existed? Clearly, Japan and France themselves could not, as geographical ideas, possibly have prefectures, or departments? And clearly, Japanese prefectures and French departments were established only after the Meiji Reform / French Revolution? Why aren't you campaigning for those to be moved?<br />
The answer is simple, and I'll answer it for you. The only prefectures of Japan are those that existed after they were established. (duh!) It is ridiculous to talk about the prefectures of the Japanese state during the Yamato Period, because such a thing does not exist. Hence we do not need an article called Prefectures of the post-Meiji Reform Japanese state. When we say <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefectures_of_Japan_0625.html" title="Prefectures of Japan">prefectures of Japan</a>, it is already self-evident that those refer to Prefectures of the post-Meiji Reform Japanese state. And the same goes for the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_region_of_China_62bf.html" title="Autonomous region of China">autonomous region of China</a>. The only autonomous regions that exist on the land of China were established by the PRC.<br />
Our current conventions of PRC and ROC were designed to handle cases of ambiguity, such as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_ab3e.html" title="Politics of the People's Republic of China">politics of the People's Republic of China</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_Republic_of_China_7cf2.html" title="Politics of the Republic of China">politics of the Republic of China</a>, where any other arrangement would be POV. This is not the case here. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 22:02, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't agree. The conventions is not "designed to handle cases of ambiguity", but to avoid implying "China" coincides with either side. The current title is already implying "China" equals the PRC, or at least, the PRC as the sole government of China, and legal successor to its immediate predecessor. There no such problem with the examples of Japan or France that you suggested. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 22:13, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the current title does not imply that China = PRC. The current title implies that the autonomous regions of China are all autonomous regions of the PRC.<br />
And please read my Japan and France examples more carefully. Those talked about <i>ambiguity</i>, not the problem of the succession of states. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 22:19, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can "the current title implies that the autonomous regions of China are all autonomous regions of the PRC"? Autonomous region is an administrative division only of the PRC. It only exists in this part of history, and by a government which is not the exhaustive or sole representative of China.<br />
The<sup>&#160;</sup>examples of Japan and France are not applicable because they are not divided countries. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 08:56, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Autonomous region is an administrative division only of the PRC.</i> -- exactly, and therefore the current title brings no ambiguity. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 15:48, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By comparing the title and this sentence, one can already tell "China" and "PRC" are equated. Yes it brings no ambiguity to many, but it already infringes the conventions that China coincides with the PRC, or with mainland China. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 17:50, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it doesm't make that equation. Now, <i>if</i> both the PRC and ROC had aut. regions, and if this article were called <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_region_of_China_62bf.html" title="Autonomous region of China">autonomous region of China</a> but talked about only the PRC's aut. regions, then you'd have a point. But that's not the case. The ROC has no aut. regions. "Aut. regions of China" and "aut. regions of the PRC" are one and the same concept, so this article can be at either. Obviously the shorter and more succinct (and equally correct) option is the better one. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 20:04, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My position is clear. If both the PRC and the ROC are mentioned, it's alright to be titled "..of China". It is not the case here.

<dd>Hey guys I found something&#160;:-) <i>The Republic of China arranged Mongolia and Tibet as "regions", which were in effect autonomous, before retreating to Taiwan following Chinese civil war.</i> This was in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_region.html" title="Autonomous region">Autonomous region</a> that Ran supposed I should merge with "my" new <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_entity.html" title="Autonomous entity">Autonomous entity</a>. ....if I would have known this before I would just have moved A.region to A.entity <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> 23:08, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is precisely why I had misgivings about moving "autonomous region of China" to "autonomous entities of China". It muddles up the definitions. Should we take "autonomous" to mean the sort of "autonomous" that the PRC means, or "autonomous" in its dictionary sense: i.e. self governed?</dd>
<dd>When the PRC says "autonomous", that's a pretty well-defined concept. These are all entities with a Han Chinese secretary and an ethnic governor; they're all covered under the same section of the constitution, etc. If we go by this definition of "autonomous", then there are clearly no equivalents in the ROC or any other part of Chinese history. The ROC certainly didn't go around following Soviet practice in this matter.</dd>
<dd>But if we go by the dictionary sense, the "autonomous entity" can be basically anything in Chinese history that is or claims to be "autonomous". It could include Tibet or Mongolia of the ROC, since they were hugely autonomous if not de facto independent, especially compared to the autonomous regions of the PRC. In fact, this category would even include Hong Kong and Macau, since those are clearly autonomous within the PRC, much more autonomous than the autonomous regions. In fact, I can even go on to argue that since Tibet, Xinjiang, etc. aren't really "autonomous", they shouldn't even be covered under this article, because they don't "truly" fulfill the definition of "autonomous".</dd>
<dd>So, it's really a choice on our part. Should "autonomous entities of China" describe the PRC-definition entities, or the dictionary-definition entities? If the former, then the ROC regions should not be included. If the latter, then Hong Kong and Macau should be included, and the autonomous regions (Tibet, Xinjiang) etc. might need to be moved out to their own separate article. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 01:10, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>merge your nice statement into the article&#160;;-) . <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_entity.html#China" title="Autonomous entity">Autonomous_entity#China</a> also mentions the SARs. It is not dictionary- <i>or</i> PRC-definition, but better both. Readers this way can learn more, like I learned from your statement. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> 02:41, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Then perhaps we can rearranged the pages. "Autonmous entities of China" will cover all autonomous entities ever existed in Chinese history. "Autonomous entities of the PRC" will then cover only those autonomous of the PRC modeled after the Soviet model.
<dl>
<dd>This wouldn't solve the definition problem, though. "Autonomous entities of the PRC" can still refer to the dictionary definition, in which case HK / Macau will still have to be included, whereas the unqualified inclusion of Xinjiang / Tibet would be POV. I originally wrote this article intending "autonomous" to be the PRC definition.</dd>
<dd>I hope to keep this article in its present state and scope, if possible. The autonomous regions / prefectures / counties / banners of the PRC are a class of their own and deserve their own article. Does anyone have any more ideas for the title of this artlcle? -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 02:41, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Not a bad idea.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Then stick with the constitution. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> article does tell this meaning.

<dd>Which one is used more often on Wikipedia for the 56 groups? Ethnics or nationalities?</dd>
<dd>"Of the PRC" is necessary because, unlike others, these entities only exist during and within the PRC, i.e. in both the senses of time and of geography. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:00, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but don't you think you're overdoing it? It's not like we're going to be confusing anyone or offending anyone or stating anything falsehoods with "Ethnic autonomous areas of China". Why make the title long than it has to be?</dd>
<dd>As for the other thing: I use ethnic(ity) when I write, because it's less confusing. But the official term is probably "national(ity)". -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 23:23, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But then unlike provinces or counties there's no counterpart in history, nor in the ROC which coexist at the time being. It's purely PRC-related, while provinces or counties are not. In those cases China refers to everything (from dynasties to the ROC and PRC), but in this case China is used synonomously with the PRC.</dd>
<dd>Then let's use ethnic(al/ity). I agree it's far less confusing. What we need is to create nation(al/ality) as redirects. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 02:06, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, no where in the PRC's 1982 Constitution mentions special administrative regions are province-level. Article 31 does not state it explicitly, and by the literally meaning special administrative regions can be set up at any level. In practise the two SARs currently exist, namely Hong Kong and Macao, have been provided by the Article 12 of each of their basic laws that they are direct subordinate to the Central People's Government (note: ≠ the State Council), i.e. bypassing all levels of the hierachy. Their levels might be higher than province, like sub-provincial prefecture-level cities to ordinary prefecture-level cities. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 08:06, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)
