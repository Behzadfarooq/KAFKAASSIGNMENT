<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Edit section: Marvel Comics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marvel Comics</span></h2>
<p>The first appearance of the Creation Matrix, later also known as the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, was in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel's</a> <i>Transformers</i> comics, where the Matrix's first appearance pre-dated its cartoon appearance by over a year. The Creation Matrix was first illustrated as a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer program</a> in Optimus Prime's mind, required to bestow life on newly-created Transformers. Prime was captured by the Decepticon leader, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a>, and decapitated, the Matrix program used to bring the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructicons.html" title="Constructicons">Constructicons</a> to life. Before Shockwave could animate <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetfire.html" title="Jetfire">Jetfire</a>, however, Prime transferred the Creation Matrix to the mind of <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buster_Witwicky_97d7.html" title="Buster Witwicky">Buster Witwicky</a>, who used it to take control of Jetfire and rescue Prime. The Decepticons were able to tap the energy of the Matrix to create the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunticon.html" title="Stunticon">Stunticons</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Combaticons</a> when Prime used it to give life to the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerialbots.html" title="Aerialbots">Aerialbots</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectobots.html" title="Protectobots">Protectobots</a>, but Prime's subsequent destruction left all assuming that the Matrix had been destroyed.</p>
<p>However, this was not so. When Prime was resurrected as a Powermaster, he revealed the truth - the Matrix was actually a physical object, stored within his chest cavity, which the Autobots had unwittingly lost when Prime's body had been blasted into space. Shockwave had merely tapped residual energy from his head. Thus began a Matrix Quest to recover the talisman - but the Autobots had no idea what was waiting for them. The Creation Matrix had retained an imprint of each of its former holders, giving it a rudimentary sentience that had, during its exile in space, come to question the nature of evil. Recovered by the Decepticon, Thunderwing, who also had a Matrix affinity, the Matrix itself became tainted with evil and took control of Thunderwing, attacking the Autobots, and forcing them to jettison it into the depths of space once more.</p>
<p>The true nature of the Creation Matrix then became apparent as the threat of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a> bore down upon Cybertron. The Matrix was a fragment of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus_%28Transformers%29_7a0f.html" title="Primus (Transformers)">Primus</a>, the Transformers' deity, responsible for the creation of their race. Encoding a portion of his lifeforce as a genetic matrix, set in light patterns within a crystal, Primus had given his children a means of creating new life, as he had created them. Amidst the Unicron crisis, Thunderwing returned, but was destroyed by Unicron, allowing Optimus Prime to purify the Matrix and destroy Unicron himself.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Megatron stole the Matrix from Prime in order to animate a new legion of troops for himself, only to have <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starscream.html" title="Starscream">Starscream</a> steal it in turn, and use it to merge himself with the Decepticons' battleship, the Warworld. Rather than fall prey to evil, however, the Matrix's overwhelming goodness began to affect Starscream, and he relinquished the power rather than have his personality altered. Prime was then able to use this goodness to purify the Swarm, a dark byproduct of Transformer reproduction.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Edit section: Animated Series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Animated Series</span></h2>
<p>The Matrix of Leadership first appeared in the animated <i>Transformers</i> series in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Transformers%7E_The_Movie_e0ea.html" title="Transformers: The Movie">Transformers: The Movie</a></i>, when a dying <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> passed it to <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a>. Prime was the seventh holder of the Matrix - after the death of the sixth holder, <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Trion_e945.html" title="Alpha Trion">Alpha Trion</a> briefly kept the Matrix safe before bestowing it upon Optimus.</p>
<p>Before passing away, Prime spoke of a prophecy - that one day, "The Chosen One" would rise from the ranks of the Autobots, and use the power of the Matrix to light the Transformers' darkest hour. That darkest hour soon came upon Cybertron in the form of the world-eater, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>, who knew that the Matrix's power was the one thing that could destroy him. Recreating Decepticon leader <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> as <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a>, he dispatched him to destroy the Matrix, but when Galvatron obtained the talisman, he tried and failed to use its power against Unicron. Ultimately, the Chosen One who could open the Matrix proved to be the youthful <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Rod_%28Transformers%29_9776.html" title="Hot Rod (Transformers)">Hot Rod</a>, who reclaimed the Matrix and was transformed by its power into <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodimus_Prime_0745.html" title="Rodimus Prime">Rodimus Prime</a>, before opening it within Unicron and releasing its power, which tore Unicron apart from within.</p>
<p>As the animated series progressed, more was divulged about the nature of the Matrix that had not been explained in the movie. When injured in battle, Rodimus' consciousness briefly entered the Matrix itself, and he discovered that it was more than a mere source of energy - it, in fact, contained the amassed wisdom of deceased Autobot leaders throughout history. Venturing into the Matrix a second time, Rodimus was shown the history of Cybertron by the ancient Autobots whose consciousnesses existed within the Matrix, revealing to him the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quintessons.html" title="Quintessons">Quintessons</a>' role in the creation of the Transformers. When he was resurrected, Optimus Prime later did the same thing when faced with the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_Plague_ceb1.html" title="Hate Plague">Hate Plague</a>, and came to a drastic conclusion - to cure the madness of the plague, he expelled all of the wisdom from within the Matrix, saving the universe, but emptying the Matrix and leaving only a shell.</p>
<p>The Matrix's story subsequently branched off in two directions following this, as America and Japan took the story in their own unique directions. In the US finale, "The Rebirth," Optimus Prime used the shell of the Matrix as a substitute key to access <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_Sigma_6c1a.html" title="Vector Sigma">Vector Sigma</a>. Conversely, in Japan - where the Matrix is treated simply as a reservoir of pure energy - the shell was left hidden on Earth to slowly recharge its depleted energy. However, the emptying of the Matrix had destabilised Vector Sigma, leading the Autobots to search for its location before Optimus Prime sacrificed himself to restore the computer's balance. The ghost of Alpha Trion re-energised the Matrix, but Optimus Prime merged with Vector Sigma to stabilise it, and Rodimus Prime was again left in charge of the Autobots.</p>
<p>No origin was ever offered for the Matrix of Leadership in the animated continuity, but it was vaguely hinted that it was in some way connected to the origins of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>, perhaps to explain why it was his antithesis. Unicron was created by the insane genius, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primacron.html" title="Primacron">Primacron</a>, but turned on him. After Unicron's attack against his master, Primacron's assistant was shown to flee, and from his damaged robotic body, an object that appeared to be the Matrix emerged. If this truly was intended to be the Matrix, how the Transformers obtained it was never revealed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990s</a> animated series, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Wars_98b4.html" title="Beast Wars">Beast Wars</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Machines_b86e.html" title="Beast Machines">Beast Machines</a> series, the nature of the Matrix was explored and evolved.</p>
<p>These series used "The Matrix" as a term that referred not merely to the physical object, but to an actual other-dimensional realm - the Transformer <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a> also called the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allspark.html" title="Allspark">Allspark</a>, the well of all sparks that are, have been, or ever shall be. From the Allspark springs all Transformer life, and when a Transformer dies, their spark returns to the Allspark, sharing its life experience with the collective, creating a huge store of accumulated wisdom and knowledge. Understanding this, it can be retroactively assumed that the physical Matrix object wielded by Autobot leaders in the cartoon continuity is not simply a storehouse of knowledge itself, but rather, a gateway to this afterlife realm. Similarly, this also explains its ability to bestow life as seen in the comic book continuity - by transferring a spark from the Allspark through its connection to the realm.</p>
<p>The Matrix was also used as a nickname in the Beast Wars series for the facility which produced <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximal.html" title="Maximal">Maximal</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoforms.html" title="Protoforms">protoforms</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Contrary to rumor, there are no accounts of Alpha Trion ever officially holding the Matrix in the role of Autobot leader - the only certainty is that he kept it safe between the death of the most recent Autobot leader, and the appointment of Optimus Prime. His presence within the Matrix when Optimus Prime consults its wisdom to stop the Hate Plague would suggest otherwise, but later expansions on the fiction of the Matrix illustrate that it is not merely Autobot leaders who inhabit it, but all deceased Transformers, explaining Trion's presence.</p>
<p>Galvatron has briefly been able to steal the Matrix on occasion, but has consistently failed to harness its power. His lieutenant, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_%28Transformers%29_a62e.html" title="Scourge (Transformers)">Scourge</a>, on the other hand, displayed amplified physical powers when he held the Matrix for a short period, suggesting an affinity for it. Scourge's physical structure was monstrously mutated when he was filled with the Matrix's power, however - presumably due to his nature of a creation of Unicron failing to properly interface with the Matrix.</p>

Councillor Xaaron suggested that High Councillor Traachon step down and allow a military officer to assume Autobot leadership. Traachon then used his powers of veto and effectively elected himself out of office, allowing Optimus Prime to assume supreme command of the Autobots.</li>

<p>In addition, the UK Marvel Comics included Rodimus Prime in their stories, and he once lost the Matrix to a <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quintesson.html" title="Quintesson">Quintesson</a> General, Ghyrik.</p>
<p>While the above possessed the Matrix at one point or another, not all became a part of the Matrix. The Matrix was shown to have its own "consciousness" of sorts during the Matrix Quest, where it referred to itself in plural. Prior to the evil being purged from the Matrix, it "spoke" its "contributors": "We are Primus. We are Prima. We are Prime Nova. We are Sentinel Prime. We are Optimus Prime. We are Thunderwing." It is not clear whether, after the evil of Thunderwing was purged from the Matrix, the Matrix reverted to a consciousness ending with a part of Optimus Prime.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the short-lived Marvel Generation 2 series, Megatron took the Matrix from Prime; he never used it but Starscream stole it and did take it as a part of himself. The Matrix began turning Starscream away from evil and toward good. It was so powerful that Starscream gave the Matrix back to Prime in order to keep from becoming good and losing his evil nature.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Edit section: Lesser Matrices">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lesser Matrices</span></h3>
<p>Although the Creation Matrix is the one single force forged from Primus with the ultimate power to bestow life and destroy Unicron, there have been other Lesser Matrices of Leaderships forged. These Matrices were forged from the Transformer God Vector Sigma and bestowed to a select few including: Lio Convoy, Big Convoy and Fire Convoy. In Japanese continuity, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Primal_d343.html" title="Optimus Primal">Optimus Primal</a> is depicted as bearing one of these Matrices, which is in conflict with the American series, in which he did not possess one (as he was merely a scientific explorer and starship captain of no notable standing). The Optimus Prime of the alternate universe of <i><a href="../../../a/r/m/Transformers%7E_Armada_2d23.html" title="Transformers: Armada">Transformers: Armada</a></i> also possesses a Matrix (Much like the original Matrix, it serves as the symbol of the Autobot Commander).</p>
<p>These Matrices mimic the abilities of the original Creation Matrix. In <b>Beast Wars Second</b>, Lio Convoy used his Matrix to create Lio Junior. These Lesser Matrices can also power up their hosts. In order to defeat the titanic Destron known as Majin Zarak, Lio Convoy tapped into the power of his Matrix and was powered-up to Flash Lio Convoy, while Optimus Primal tapped into the power of his Matrix and became Burning Convoy. Together their Matrices formed the powerful Matrix Buster attack which defeated Majin Zarak. Lio Convoy later combined the power of his Matrix with that of Big Convoy's Matrix (which was used to power-up his Big Cannon) to defeat Unicron.</p>
<p>In the Transformers: Zone OVA and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestars.html" title="Battlestars">Battlestars</a>, the planetary Zodiac, also known as <a href="../../../z/o/n/Zone_Energy_0d03.html" title="Zone Energy">Zone Energy</a>, replaces the original Autobot Matrix of Leadership as a means of repairing, reformatting, and/or reviving Transformers.</p>
<p>In <b>Transformers Car Robot</b> (also known as <b>Robots In Disguise</b>), God Fire Convoy (also known as Omega Prime) was powered by Fire Convoy's (also known as Optimus Prime's) personal Matrix, which also augmented itself with the God Sword (forged by Brave Maximus, also known as Fortress Maximus) and used it to defeat Devil Gigatron (also known as Galvatron).</p>
<p>Not all Lesser Matrices are good. Like Primus, Unicron also forged some Matrices which were used to manipulate certain Transformers to his dark designs. Unicron was able to control the Predacon known as Galvatron through the Galvamatrix, as well as the Predacon Overlord Shokoract, through the Matrix of Conquest which housed Unicron's Dark Essence itself. The Transformers: Universe incarnation of Nemesis Prime possesses an artifact known as the Dead Matrix which is a black version of Big Convoy's Matrix. This Matrix had the ability to absorb Sparks, and was created to neutralize the Matrix of Leadership. Nemesis Prime attempted to use this Matrix in the Transformers: Cybertron comic book series to kill Primus. Although he was stopped, the Dead Matrix was taken by Soundwave and used to help return Unicron to life after his death.</p>
<p>During the <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/Transformers%7E_Generation_2_d770.html" title="Transformers: Generation 2">Transformers: Generation 2</a></i> toyline, Optimus Prime received multiple toy forms in a relatively short period of time, and to explain these numerous bodies, the tech spec of his "Go-Bot" incarnation, credited an internal "Reconfiguration Matrix" with the change (similarly, the original Matrix is credited with reformatting Prime from his "Hero" body into his "Laser" body in the Japanese G2 <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>). The Reconfiguration Matrix has subsequently been credited with the reformatting of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Ironhide.html" title="Ironhide">Ironhide</a> into his <i>Transformers: Timelines</i> body represented by the toy available exclusively at <a href="../../../b/o/t/BotCon_1902.html" title="BotCon">BotCon</a> 2005, and with the rebirth of <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> and the creation of his new body represented by the 2006 eHobby exclusive "Laser Ultra Magnus" toy. Where exactly this internal Reconfiguration Matrix comes from is still a mystery, but a few long-time Transformers fans have speculated that it was somehow derived from the planetary Zodiac (<a href="../../../z/o/n/Zone_Energy_0d03.html" title="Zone Energy">Zone Energy</a>) in the Transformers: Zone and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestars.html" title="Battlestars">Battlestars</a> storylines.</p>
<p>According to the extended biography given in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine for 10th Anniversary Optimus Primal, he carries the "Matrix of Purification", which can be used to cure the sick, and be used to "ease the strain of Unicron's corruption from Cybertronians".</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Prime_3575.html" title="Leo Prime">Leo Prime</a></b> (1998): Although his Matrix was not detachable, Leo Prime was the first Transformer toy to come with a Matrix. The Matrix was part of the chest sculpt, located inside a left chest panel.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Convoy_52d6.html" title="Big Convoy">Big Convoy</a></b> (1999): The first Transformer to come with a Matrix that was detachable. Its handle design allowed Big Convoy to hold the Matrix, although it meant altering the handle from its more orthodox shape.</li>
<li><b><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Transformers%7E_Robots_in_Disguise_9278.html" title="Transformers: Robots in Disguise">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></i> Optimus Prime</b> (2000): Like Lio Convoy, the <i>RiD</i> incarnation of Optimus Prime's (<b>Super Fire Convoy</b> in Japan) Matrix was a permanent fixture inside a chest panel. Looking little like the standard Matrix design, this feature was treated simply as a power cable port in the animated series.</li>
<li><b>Convoy (also known as Optimus Prime)</b> (2001 Millennium New Years Special Reissue): Made of solid die-cast metal, this Matrix was designed to fit inside the chest cavity of the original Optimus Prime/Convoy toy. It also came with a chain so that collectors could wear the Matrix as a neckpiece. Although this Matrix was sculpted to look just like the original Matrix, the design of Optimus Prime's fists meant that he was unable to hold it.</li>
<li><b><i><a href="../../../a/r/m/Transformers%7E_Armada_2d23.html" title="Transformers: Armada">Transformers: Armada</a></i> Optimus Prime</b> (2002): The Leader-class Optimus Prime figure from this toyline featured a non-removable Matrix sculpted inside his chest. Notably, the smaller, Supercon size-class version of the figure did not.

</li>
<li><b>20th Anniversary Optimus Prime/Masterpiece Convoy</b> (2003/4): The Matrix included with this figure is both removable, and can be held by Optimus Prime, due to his individually articulated fingers. This is the first Matrix that can also actually open, and can be made to glow in its traditional blue color via an LED inside Optimus Prime's chest cavity. The Matrix was also included in the Japanese-only <b>Masterpiece Ultra Magnus</b> redeco of the toy, but it could not be opened. This was an homage to a scene in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Transformers%7E_The_Movie_e0ea.html" title="Transformers: The Movie">Transformers: The Movie</a> where <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> was unable to open the Matrix. Like the Matrix of Cybertron Prime, this too can fit in the chest of the original Optimus Prime.</li>
<li><b><i><a href="../../../c/y/b/Transformers%7E_Cybertron_8061.html" title="Transformers: Cybertron">Transformers: Cybertron</a></i> Optimus Prime</b> (2005): The <i>Transformers: Cybertron</i> incarnation of the character (known as <b>Galaxy Convoy</b> in Japan) comes with a Matrix which can be stored inside the chest and removed, and can be held by the figure, somewhat awkwardly (His fingers are one solid section, but can move). Interestingly, the Matrix toy itself is perfectly sized to fit inside the cab of the original Optimus Prime toy and many fans have taken to storring it there. Prime's Planet Key also has a Matrix theme to its sculpt, although the gold accents are only available in the Japanese version of this toy.</li>
<li><b>T.H.S.-01 Galaxy Convoy</b> (2005): A beautifully sculpted Japanese exclusive miniature of Galaxy Force Galaxy Convoy (Cybertron Optimus Prime). The figure features an opening chest, as with the larger counterpart. The tiny Matrix which is revealed can be removed, although an electrical screwdriver or fine tweezers may be necessary! Unlike the Generation 1 version, this matrix has a yellow interior.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>T.H.S.-02 Convoy</b> (2006): Essentially a small 4 inch tall version of Masterpiece Convoy, he too came with a removable Matrix, but it is not able to be opened. As with the T.H.S. line, he comes with a variety of hands for different functions. Two hands have slats in them to slip the handles of the Matrix into and it will allow him to hold it. It has weight and is made of die-caste metal.</li>
<li><b>Revoltech Convoy</b>: Able to be held awkwardly but artfully in convoy's left hand, this Matrix is not able to be put into its chest. Also, adhering to the comic-look roots, the Matrix has a small pale dot in the blue center giving it the feel of a glow and gloss.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a></b> (2005 reissue): The Japanese-exclusive reissue of the Galvatron toy, recolored to match his cartoon appearance, includes a die-cast Matrix accessory. (The Matrix accessory used is the same mold as the one used in "New Year's Special" Convoy, colored gold.) Additionally, the version of the toy (in its original colours) exclusive to the eHobby website features the same accessory, colored green in reference to the comic book incarnation of the Matrix.</li>
<li><b>Matrix of Leadership Replica</b> (2006): Sculpted by Robert Lee. This item was limited to 1,000 pieces and distributed by Diamond Select Toys in conjunction with Art Asylum. It came with a golden display stand with the Autobot symbol on the front and a replica of the Key to Vector Sigma. Using 3 AA batteries and the replica Key to Vector Sigma accessory (placed on the backside of the display stand), with the Matrix placed on it, it can change colors from blue to purple, to green, to red, and back again.</li>
