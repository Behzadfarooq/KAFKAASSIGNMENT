<p>The work culminating in Revision as of 20:44, 27 February 2007 WLU (Talk | contribs) (e-sized pictures, trimmed list of behaviours, minor other changes)</p>
<p>Presents problems of a very real substantive nature</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It is no longer clear what is presented from the source</li>
<li>B. The subcategories, while a reasonable approach, are not actually presented in this way by the source which is a rather well received source cited and in effect extends or limits any number of the behaviours listed--that is a no-no</li>
<li>C. Key Behaviours are "Key Behavours" Unusual they may be but then many other syndromes and perfectly normal children may also display them so No, they are not Unusual. These behaviours are not the diagnostic apparatus, they are used in conjunction with a clinical history. Key Behaviours, is a Key Category</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of behaviours was already trimmed--anyone who reads the literature would know that. Key behaviours that are actually listed in the DSM and the ICD were cut--NB this entire article derives from accepted criterion (a WIki premise by the way) and that basically means that editor WLU has deleted substantive criterion and substituted a personal perspective which is also a no no.</p>
<p>deleted sentence</p>
<p>On a positive note, the behaviours could do with expansion as is done by many of the authorities listed here. But on that list, it is misleading and not a constructive change. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See below for my post re: rationale on the photos (if you haven't already) - I was also responding there to what I thought was a sensible request. Although this is an encyclopedia, I think that humanizing the subject is vital and very relevant. I say this not as the owner of the pictures in question, but as a mom to a kid with autism. The photo of Dr Asperger is lovely&#160;;-) but doesn't exactly improve anyone's understanding of the nature of the autistic mind. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndwhatsnext_0f27.html" title="User:Andwhatsnext">Andwhatsnext</a> 02:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whatsnext. Your goal is not in dispute. Your response to a reasonable request for photos is sensible. Humanising, to what extent I do not know, is essential in my view. I am just saying that the photos need to relate directly to the text--which the line of toys does (I did not see that at first but yes, it works) Asperger's photo is, by way of presenting history, a reasonable addition-and humanises the history of the topic. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I wasn't questioning the inclusion of the Asperger photo - merely noting its limited use in humanizing the topic as a whole.&#160;:-) In any case, I swapped out the "(cute) kid with a bus" pic and replaced it with one of him precisely stacking cans. I have had a lot of positive feedback on the can image (as well as the one of the line of toys) from parents and siblings of autistic kids. Apparently, they have seen the same thing happening in their homes. (As I was adding the photo, Quinn brought me a big tower of Ello pieces. He wanted help sticking on one broken bit. Some things never change, eh?) Anyhow, I'm sure I don't have to suggest letting me know if you don't want the picture on the page... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndwhatsnext_0f27.html" title="User:Andwhatsnext">Andwhatsnext</a> 04:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"A deletion of a single copy of the gene on chromosome 22q13 can result in language or social communication disorders[78] (see also 22q13 deletion syndrome).

<dd>I do agree that the page looks pretty dry. What kind of photos do you envision? Kids in school or snaps of autistic kids in other scenarios? I happen to have a cutie-pie with autism who hangs around my house (well, okay, he's my baby) and I love to show people his photo ( <a href="http://faceautism.org/wp-content/uploads/quinn-with-bus.jpg" class="external free" title="http://faceautism.org/wp-content/uploads/quinn-with-bus.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://faceautism.org/wp-content/uploads/quinn-with-bus.jpg</a> ) specifically because he *is* autistic -- and looks sweet and "normal" and happy. I think they're usually expecting to see a miniature version of Dustin Hoffman in "Rainman."</dd>

<dd>I feel that the first photo on the page is valuable simply because it DOES look just like a kid holding a bus. The point being that autism doesn't [necessarily] make a kid look odd or freakish or clearly "disabled." (See above when I first posted the URL to the picture and my first statement about my POV.) I realize others may not care and/or agree, and that's cool. I'm certainly not going to insist. There are also other photos I can upload - one of him stacking cans comes to mind. And he's a fabulous speller, too, so maybe something showing that ability would work.</dd>

<dd>He's totally adorable! ^_^ I do remember checking out one of the sources in this article that made a point about certain facial characteristics that Autism can cause, although subtle; e.g., the shape of the eyelids and ears, and sometimes the mouthline... I'll try to dig it up again and paste it here. The photo is somewhat relevant to the "appearance" aspect of Autism, fulfilling the point of "omigosh they are not totally hideous and deformed." They are both definitely useful, and I will uphold their inclusion. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 03:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Breaking up the behaviours list is a substantive change.</b> Further elucidation can be made in the article below. It was ambiguously labeled and a number of the listed behaviours are actually part of numerous development areas so the subcategorisation represented the key behaviours inaccurately and certainly not in accordance with the cited source. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Photos</b></p>
<p>Originally I thought the The picture of the child asleep does nothing for the article. However, now that I think of it, it could be noted in the key behaviour "spends a lot of time stacking objects, lining things up or putting things in a certain order." Give the text more cohesion.</p>
<p>The little boy with the toy, while cute, is meaningless. It is a child with a toy. That is it. A very cute child to be sure but not the purpose of the article. Have you got one of a child walking on toes or spinning or sitting separately from other children?</p>
<p>So, while reverted some substantive changes in the text, I left the photos intact and my view on that is personal. Those photos by the way, have these been released and appear here by permission? I have no idea where they came from. (You Tube is just a drop, not a legal entity with authority to disperse this.) <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Addendum - if you can't tell, I'm scrambling for sources to justify including the bus picture for a reason other than sheer cuteness (which, although it is reason enough for me, might not fly well with the rest of Wikipedia&#160;:-P). I'm tempted to use the cranial circumference source, but the caption that would go with the picture just kills me: "Autistic kids often have larger head circumferences than others, like this little tyke. <a href="../../../s/o/_/So_I_Married_an_Axe_Murderer_9257.html" title="So I Married an Axe Murderer">Look at the size of his head!</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108174/quotes" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108174/quotes" rel="nofollow">It's like an orange on a toothpick!</a>" ...No, I cannit du tha'. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 06:58, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't think the cranial size aspect will be that obvious. The cute picture could be worked in if there was a good section on how people expect autistic children to look. If there is an article that purports to show that many people do think autistics look funny and how that has been debunked, then there is an avenue. However, if all the pictures are of a very cute ginger-haired boy, then it might look a bit slanted. There is such a thing as too much. One thing that may be persuasive and add to the point that autistic children do not standout visually, is a photo with a mix of autistic and non-austitic chidlren and the caption "Of the X number of children in this photo, Y of them are severely autistic." Permission to publish may be a problem though. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HFA is not defined in the DSM or the ICD. It has no purpose here except as a disambiguation. The article on Wiki here is not well referenced and that at best should be a disambiguation page and not a separate article. It begins by saying it is an informal term and then proceeds as if it were an establish defintion, contradicts itself, conflats Asperger's and HFA and makes redundant comments that are in other articles which merely fills it out. There are numerous articles on this listed in PubMed but they do not refer to a common defintion nor do they accept a core diagostic set of criteria nor agree on what it is or if it even exists.</p>
<p>Use of the term here needs to be curtailed unless someone can show this is an accepted designation and not merely a flag run up the proverbial research flag pole. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 07:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anyone know what is wrong with this? a more recent theory relating autism to high levels of television viewing while young.[50]?</p>
<p>Premise asserts that in countries with cable TV there is more autism. Onset of symptoms averaging about 3 years of age.</p>
<p>Problem is, those countries with high end technology--like cable TV--are also a strong correlate for countries with health technology and education that would even consider autism. In other words, there will be a strong correlation between countries with health professionals looking for autism and those with cable TV. Go over to the section from NIH on neuropathology. There are numerous studies that show the various areas of the brain have actually slowed or stopped developing as late as 6 weeks before birth and much earlier. So, the mother's TV viewing habits are now implicated?</p>
<p>My point, we can employ studies that come out of reputable institutions like Cornell, but that does not mean these authors are worth citing. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 22:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Finding good research is a problem. It's really easy to do a sloppy study and misinterpret the statistics involved. If you can find any that are questionable, let's contest it. TV is probably only a problem because parents use it as a babysitter and sitting an autistic child in front of a TV is probably the worst thing you can do to them. But that doesn't mean the TV is to blame; I think that's absurd. I agree we need quality refs and there's a lot of junk out there being cited. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 23:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's talk about who reads this and how it needs to be composed. People here talk about 'encyclopedic' as if it were a universally understood word. It varies enough to make that a bit simplistic if not downright naive.</p>
<p>This line I wrote in Genetic section "Genetic influence comprises a significant aspect of research in the causes of autism" is relatively formal. It could be stated thus, "Research into the causes of autism includes genetic influence," or "Genetics is a common topic of the causes of autism," or "It is believed that a persons genes may be a cause of autism," or . . . .</p>
<p>"comprises" is not a common word for a lot of people who read Wikipedia (On a limb? Don't think so. Lots of high school students and parents with no extenive background in formal English read us here.) And how significant is significant? But this is a common way of wording an opening sentence like this. And "genetics", how many people who read this are conversant in the topic?</p>
<p>On the one hand, if the writing is too pedestrian, the reader may downgrade the knowledge of the writer and pass it off as amateurish when in fact there are plenty of people here with advanced degrees in various fields who edit Wikipedia. I have a post graduate degree with about 400 hours in neurology and neuroanatomy--and not just studying pictures and models. I logged hundreds of hours on cadavers. I also have a graduate degree in applied linguistics. So, while I am relatively familiar with the genre of formal scientific papers in more than one field and the basic biological issues in this section, I am also aware that it can go overboard by being too technological and formal.</p>
<p>Suggestion: While we write and edit, feedback on how this reads is important. I occassionally send a friend here to read what we have and get their reactions. Teachers in special education, parents with children who are disabled, anyone who might have an interest in the topic and some level of expertise who might want to get a survey level knowledge of the article. We debate a lot of issues but it is still important to make it comprehensible. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with removing "disorder," but I do really like the term "spectrum," and use it often when trying to explain to the clueless why my son isn't like X autistic person they know or Y autistic person on TV. Since there are countless variants and degrees of autism -- all different colors, if you will -- I think "spectrum" covers that nicely.

<dd>Oh, surely. I just think that the spectrum idea promotes the misconception that one person is "more autistic" or "less autistic" than another, depending on how close to non-autistic they act. Someone can appear to be what is called "profoundly autistic," but at the same time given the proper tools to express themselves they are just as creative and articulate as someone who looks "less autistic". viz. Silentmiaow and others. I always think of one of those color-selectors they have in art programs like Paint Shop Pro, where you see a circle which includes all the colors and you can click any point in the circle and get a slightly different shade or an entirely different color or somewhere in between. That is my personal model for autism although I find the Moebius ribbon sufficient for everyday. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 22:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I did the most recent re-write of that section, and I wasn't pleased with it but couldn't think of a better way. I do think that emphasis needs to be given to the large amount of diversity that autism has in presentation. All the kids I worked with were radically different from each other in potential, performance, ability, symptoms, far more than one would expect given they were all given the same diagnosis. All this to say, a single cause does not give a subtly different presentation in this case, it has radically different presentations (in my opinion). <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 13:54, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you say so. Would you say children with autism differ from each other in potential, performance, ability (lets leave symptoms as being different from those) more than children without autism - IE the range of variation is increased by autism? <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 01:05, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say that they differ about as much as one kid differ from each other, in all those measures/areas. The point I guess I'm inarticulately trying to make is that considering the use of a single diagnosis, the presentation is incredibly idiosyncratic. It's one of those things I don't think I could ever find a reference for, and only stands if the editors of the page are willing to leave it there. It's based on my time working with autistic kids, and talking with others who also worked with them. In my experience (which is not sourceable), "...a disease will give subtly differing" is incorrect in the use of the word 'subtly', it's more 'wildly'. Again, my own experience, can't think of and probably couldn't find a reference. If you wanted to go ahead and change it or even remove it, I don't have a porblem with it. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 03:20, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
