<p>I don't think it's a good idea to have this 'important people' list included. Such a list is almost always biased. E.g. in this list, there are not even all winners of the Herbrand award, the most prestigious award in the field, included.</p>
<p>I propose to delete this list.</p>

<dd>I disagree. If you think it's biased, you can add other names who take an opposing viewpoint. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 20:19, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree with Uli. It's not that the list is biased, it's more that automated theorem proving is a large, diverse field, and hence the list is always bound to be incomplete. I could easily expand the size of the list by two, but very few of the people would be known outside the field. Moreover, currently, only one of the <i>important</i> persons has a Wikipedia entry of his own - this seems to indicate that there is not that much interest in the list or the people. Finally, many people are hard to classify - is e.g. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Knuth_c2da.html" title="Donald Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> important in theorem proving? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 22:30, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section "Availiable Theorem provers" has a lot of dead links. I would expect that if they are actually availiable, there should be a place from which they are availiable. My personal opinion is that the section should either be renamed "Known theorem provers" (second choice), or (my first choice) we should link to where they are availiable. <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahaj_bfe3.html" title="User:Nahaj">Nahaj</a> 11:22:10, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since we are at the point where most folk are there with some sort of claim to fame, and meaningfull links, maybe it is time to remove the people that have neither? I don't know where the demarkation should be either... but "important people" without any listed accomplishments, and no pointer to anything meantingfull seems the place to cut to me.

<dd>It would be nice also, in my opinion, to make link to actual citations for some folk. If a claim to fame is they won a prize, then a link to a list of the prize winners would be appropriate.

<dd>Fleshed in some reasons for some the "important people" that I recognised... some of the rest I've never heard of at all, or don't know enough about to comment on. Since many of ones that I did recognise were at places recognised as having Automated Reasoning connections, so I pointed the names at their personal web pages there, instead of to non-existant or stubbed wikipedia pages. That way people can check their accomplishments directly themselves.

<dd>Looks like someone "fixed" it... Note that The inventor of Resolution is properly John Alan Robinson, (publishing as J. Alan Robinson), not plain Alan Robinson as the link says. This can be checked by actually looking at the "author" line of the pager, or looking at almost any of the online citation services. He is emeritus at Syracuse. [Yes the original affiliation was wrong, he is not at Manchester, that is a different Alan Robinson (the mathematician) <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahaj_bfe3.html" title="User:Nahaj">Nahaj</a> 21:09:38, 2005-09-02 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Someone" is me. My priority was the get the wrong link out. Alan publishes both as J. Alan Robinson and as Alan Robinson (see e.g. the <i>Handbook of Automated Reasoning</i>). Since an article on him does not yet exist, we are free to create either one. But by what name is he best known?

<dd>His name is John Alan Robinson, although you are right that he publishes both J. Alan Robinson and as Alan Robinson (Notice the historic trend...). I would have thought it best to have his page use his actual name, and mention others he publishes under. (And I think that the full name is a better disambiguator than what's there now, since I believe that there is more than one computer scientist named Alan Robinson.) <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahaj_bfe3.html" title="User:Nahaj">Nahaj</a> 01:25:38, 2005-09-03 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm not particularly happy with all of the recent edits. In particular, no serious ATP system enumerates all possible proof trees - all implement a refutation-complete calculus with redundancy criteria, and use a fair derivation strategy.</p>
<p>I also think that we are now moving to many details into the introduction.</p>
<p>Any comments?</p>

<dd>I generally agree. As I read it, it miss-characterizes how Theorem Provers work (enumeration of proof trees), and uses this as a premise to make an argument (people will need to help them out) that seems unreated to anything there. And I totally agree with your second paragraph. <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahaj_bfe3.html" title="User:Nahaj">Nahaj</a> 00:24:42, 2005-09-13 (UTC)

<p>I dont know if this is the right place to ask, but i quite dont understand something: if the problem is recursively enumerable you can not always halt for sentences in the language. Then, how is it decidible? BTW, i belive this article also should be merged with automated reasoning. --VyNiL 11:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, if it is recursively enumerable there is an algorithm that always holds for sentences in the language (i.e. in this case <i>valid theorems</i>, not all formulae!). It cannot hold on <i>all</i> sentences (and in first-order theorem proving we cannot guarantee termination for non-theorems).</dd>
<dd>With regard to the merge: <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automated_reasoning.html" title="Automated reasoning">Automated reasoning</a> is a superfield of automated theorem proving, but both are easily large enough for individual articles. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 16:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
