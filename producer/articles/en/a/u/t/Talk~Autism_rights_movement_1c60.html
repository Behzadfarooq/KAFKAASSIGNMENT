<p>The statement "Autism (especially High-functioning) is linked to poverty, depression, and suicide.", under "# 6.2 Responses from the movement... Further responses of the movement can be summarized as follows:..." seems to be really out of place. Since the responses listed seem to support the movement, this one just seems like it was placed there in a vandalism attempt. Thoughts? <a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENodnarb232001_43d4.html" title="User:Nodnarb232001">Nodnarb232001</a> 07:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Definitely out of place. I would guess that the "school-yard bully" treatment of anyone not deemed to be normal would be more likely to contribute to poverty, depression and [suicidal thoughts]. Of course, autistics would fall into the bully's definition of "abnormal" thus becoming prime targets as they are particularly unable to fight back. I would suggest that high-functioning autistics in this more (enlightened?) age are more likely to take their place as functioning members of society and I am sure that <a href="http://home.att.net/~ascaris1/index.html" class="external text" title="http://home.att.net/~ascaris1/index.html" rel="nofollow">Frank Klein</a> would agree with me there. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimScott_971d.html" title="User:JimScott">JimScott</a> 23:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Falconleaf. Please cite the commentary that "the movement" is related to acceptance of homosexuality and the assertion that it has a liberal bias.

<p>Should we avoid using words/phrases like "pro-cure" and "anti-cure"? I'm coming at this from the perspective of the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">Abortion_debate</a>, and the terms "pro choice" and "pro life" which these labels seem to be modelled on.</p>
<p>The use of "anti-cure" can be justified because its a label a group has chosen to put on themselves. In general we accept the use of such self-given labels, though we might have second thoughts about... I can't think of anything right now, but something like paedophiles insisting on being called "child lovers". On the other hand, even with the quotes, should we be accepting "pro-cure" and using it throughout the article, even with quote marks (which don't make all that much of a difference). Could we fall back "detractors"/"critics" etc as would be more usual?</p>

This article frames discussion is such a way that in order to advocate for my older son, I should be consistent in leaving my younger son unable to eat solid food, use basic motor skills or be able to coherently communicate with others. Because if I want to help one, I *must* be a part of an ideology that rejects accepting the other's differences and wants to treat my older boy as "diseased." How incredibly stupid. (Unsigned)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't find the statement in the article that parents should not try to help and educate their children. Maybe the article should address that, as it has been discussed repeatedly elsewhere. Something like not being able to eat solid food could even be life-threatening, although not necessarily related to autism. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 23:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article justifies the movement's position vis a vis children repeated with rhetorical slight of hand suggesting that since severe developmental differences in children might become less severe over time, that one ought not to provide treatment -- and in fact, that one ought not to provide the specific (behavioural) treatment that would help my younger son, as his problems are in fact related to autism and do, in fact, threaten his health.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Does the article really do that? I'll have to check. The autism rights movement is really not that different to the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disability_rights.html" title="Disability rights">disability rights</a> movement. So the movement is more concerned with social issues, and not medical jargon such as "outcome" and "severity". Opposition to ABA is not universal in the autism rights movement, but it is common on the following grounds: (1) Unproven effectiveness - you say ABA will help your son, but you'll find that the evidence on the effectiveness of ABA is rather poor; (2) Possible use of aversives; (3) Unknown adverse effects - e.g. psychological pressure to "fit in". <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 16:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I keep hearing that it's "unproven," but the sole source for these assertions are autistic rights activists, none of whom have admitted to vomiting all over themselves to express displeasure. Furthermore, the only source for use of aversives again comes from activists. Your last criticism is based on unalloyed speculation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me use a parallel example from my own experience. My brother and I are both symptomatic for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marfan_Syndrome_8b59.html" title="Marfan Syndrome">Marfan Syndrome</a>. We're both tall and hyperflexible and have had some problems with posture. In my case, I've only had to deal with flat feet. I don't think anyone should discriminate against me based on the way I look or try to lop a few inches off. But it does not follow that this also means that nobody should have given my brother, who displays Marfan's more severely than I do, several surgeries to ensure that he can walk and see properly. But if I were to use the POV of the movement as expresed in this article, then it would be wrong, because we ought to not interfere with his "physiodivergence," just as we ought not to interfere in mine. In fact, you could even speciously argue that since I turned out all right, there's no reason to assume that he wouldn't.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm guessing those treatments are clinically proven. Do you think a behavioral treatment for your brother's condition would've been appropriate? That is, punish bad posture/walking and reward good posture/walking, with food and such. Same with vision - why not? <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 16:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it has been proven in clinical trials -- just like ABA -- sure. What makes behavioural treatments any different from others? Because of a pervasive social bias against them? Who's attaching a stigma to people with autism now, then? Or could it be that your definition of "autism," specifically excludes non-pathological elements that go beyond mere "diversity?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, that argument *is* specious, and like the argument put forth in the article, it does not take into account the time sensitive nature of treatment. If my brother had not had his "physiodivergence" treated like the disease it is (in his case, not mine) in time, then he would have suffered ill health for the rest of his life. Similarly, my younger son's neurodivergent nature *is* a disease and it needs to be treated like one, even if my older son's is not and even if many other people in the autistic spectrum's divergences are not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's ironic, really. This movement for neurodivergence justifies much of its activism by *ignoring* divergence within its own spectrum, because to admit that there is a real pathology at certain points in that spectrum, separate from any reasonable social construction. You yourself have suggested a further rhetorical trick with the "not necessarily related to autism" comment too, where we can magically reclassify real pathologies as "not-autism" when they are clearly facets of some kinds of autism. This kind of selective reading is also a fallacy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What you have to realize is that any pathologies associated with autism are not autism. Consider diseases associated with certain races or genders. They are not the same as the race and gender, but conditions that occur more frequently in that race or gender. There's no reason to medicalize an entire race or gender because medical conditions occur more frequently in them. But you can medicalize the conditions themselves. Unless a pathology is characteristic of all autistics (or at least of most autistics) you really cannot say that autism as a whole is phatological because of that pathology - to be consistent, you should do that with races, genders, sexual preferences, and so forth. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 16:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So what you're saying is that anything bad that correlates with autism isn't autism. This is inaccurate and obviously an instance of reasoning at the service of an agenda. Your statement about the criteria of pathologies is also mistaken. By your reasoning, if somebody saws off my foot and I walk with a limp, then the limp is not a consequence of having a foot removed because there are people with feet who also walk with a limp. This is obviously not so. Similarly, there are several pathologies that are associated with autism in a way that obviously indicate that they *are* symptoms of autism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The thing is that I *don't* think my older son should have to conform to many of the standards set by the "neurotypical" world. We trust him to enjoy personal growth within his own interests as much as we can and we do not force him to do things that upset him just because that's "how it's done."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But there is no way I can support any movement that would provide this support at the expense of my younger son's well-being, which as a Canadian, this movement has already done. This ideology is broken; it needs to be fixed.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps "The autism rights movement has created and been the target of some internet memes, much of which is sarcastic criticism of self-diagnosis, through perception of sexual self-identification." I assume it's a few pictures or text jokes somewhere comparing those who self-diagnos to an autism spectrum disorder in comparision to someone coming out the closet or who have gender difficulties. - Gattsuru 3 November 2006</dd>

<p>I have removed the following from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Autism can be considered to be a genetic gift, as it has been shown that brilliant minds are often linked to autism. Famous autists include Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, an the poet W. B. Yeats. This can all be explained in a book entitled- In Autism and Creativity: Is There a Link Between Autism in Men and Exceptional Ability. Note that autism in women is often under diagnosed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This was in the introductory section, and this paragraph does not describe material relavent to an introduction to the movement. In addition, famous people <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speculated_to_have_been_autistic.html" title="Speculated to have been autistic">speculated to have been autistic</a> is already mentioned in the article, so this new information is redundant. It also seems to suggest that Einstein, Newton, and Yeats are undisputably autistic. However, it is necessary to say that some people have disputed such claims, per Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a> policy. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 09:02, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I remember when Einstein (along with Every Artist Ever) was bipolar, and for a brief period he was schizophrenic. I also remember when Mozart had Tourette syndrome because he wrote scatological humor. Psychiatric texts at least used to talk about saints who had visions as having "psychotic breaks", and Van Gogh has been diagnosed with just about everything. There are people over on Songfacts who seriously believe John Lennon had ADHD because he had an interest in a wide variety of subjects, and on and on. It seems that retroactively diagnosing famous people with the disease du jour doesn't make a lot of sense.
