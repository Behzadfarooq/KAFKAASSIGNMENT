</pre>
<p><br />
Description of each type:</p>
<p>1. Text/ASCII Stereogram A Text column either random or specific is used as a repeatable pattern. While Text Floaters (1.1) type shows same looking text areas at different levels of depth, a Hidden Image Text Stereogram (1.2) shows a relief scene. Because of discreet nature of positions of ASCII characters the 3D image always has limited number of layers.</p>
<p>2. SIRDS - Single Image Random Dot Stereogram. A dot with random color is used for all connected points (*explaining diagram needed) in a row. Number of levels of hidden relief scene is limited by a maximum number of pixels between maximum and minimum parallax.</p>
<p>3. SITS - Single Image Textured Stereogram A color image is used as a base pattern. Special algorithm copies the pattern with a horizontal shift which depends on relief of a hidden elevation(depth) map. Unmapped Texture Stereogram (3.1) is a most popular type of stereograms because of an ease of its production. Mapped Texture Stereogram (3.2) requires adjusting position and scale of the pattern along with creating specific texture which corresponds with hidden objects and their elements. Mapping allows to show details and desired colors on specific spots of hidden scene. Because of repeatable nature of Single Image Stereogram all connected points should look same, thus not all parts of hidden scene can have their own color. In other words one dot of the pattern will be assigned to many points in one row.</p>
<p>4. Array Object Stereogram These stereograms do not contain hidden image. They consist of an arrays of cloned objects distributed along horizontal line. The distance between objects (parallax) defines virtual level of depth on which the objects will be observed. Flat Objects Stereogram (4.1) uses array of same images which will look flat inside a stereogram. 3D Objects Stereogram (4.2) uses array of images that each one represents different view of virtual 3D object. Certain rotation of each image will reproduce stereoscopic relief of all objects in array. Morphing objects Stereogram (4.2) have an array of objects each one slightly differ from one next to it. Although it causes retinal rivalry this technique allows to vary object's color or shape in one array. Solid Array Stereogram (4.4) consists of 3D objects connected each to other. Instead of rotation a taper modifier is used to create stereoscopic effect and to preserve array's integrity.</p>

<li>These images are purely made for recreational purposes?</li>
<li>Are there any limits on the size of the depicted objects?</li>

<li>Recreational: some people claim autostereograms actually help correct eye problems (assuming that you are using wall-eyed viewing). I think this may be true, but I haven't yet come across real evidence/literature on this. The two-image version (those viewed under stereoscope) actually helped the military discover camouflaged ground vehicles. But... err... yeah, they are mainly for recreation.</li>
<li>Size: I am not sure what you mean by size. Is it the overal size of the hidden 3D image (that is, the physical dimension of the stereogram - A4, legal, poster size, etc.)? Do you mean the physical distance between the repeating patterns? These all depend on the viewing distance. I was able to see the autostereograms in this article projected on a 12-foot screen, but it required extreme eye divergence. It took me quite a while to master that. Another reviewer in the article discussion page also asked about this. I think I'll add a subsection on this.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Recreational: Single Image Stereograms can be used where ever a stereoscopic presentation of clear relief needed in full screen. For instance - watching elevation maps in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications and results of electron microscope, previewing Objects in 3D modeling tools. But because not everybody can view Stereograms, they may be just useless. Also they (SIS) can be used for any purposes where hidden but readable information needed, like answers for a task, not annoying advertising messages, serial numbers and IDs. I would love to have a credit card with hidden number&#160;;)</li>

<p>is that the only PD example you have? It's has extremely limited contrast for the square and will be hard for inexperianced people to image (it's also _small_) <a href="../../../r/b/o/User%7ERboatright_c3e8.html" title="User:Rboatright">Rick Boatright</a> 22:00, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's my first image upload and there's a <i>lot</i> of stuff about not making images too big, so I erred on the small side. All I've got is an un-cropped version. What do you mean by contrast? That the square doesn't 'jump out' enough? Please understand that these are time-consuming to make by hand, so if I'm to change it I need to know everything that's wrong with it. --<a href="../../../r/p/a/User%7ERparle_26de.html" title="User:Rparle">rparle</a> 22:08, Mar 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Boy, I know they're time consuming to make by hand. I can't imagine. Ick. But here's the thing. Make a thumbnail with a caption of "too small to view for effect" and link to the full sized image. I _think_ that to get a reasonable "pop" you're going to have to approach 500 pixels wide.... There are times and places that a big image is appropriate. <a href="../../../r/b/o/User%7ERboatright_c3e8.html" title="User:Rboatright">Rick Boatright</a> 00:05, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've got a few skeletons of pictures lying around and I've got a pretty good idea of what I'm doing right and wrong with them, so I should be able to do one with better contrast and maybe (if we're lucky) a more interesting shape. I'd love to do the wikipedia logo, or at least it's silouette. --<a href="../../../r/p/a/User%7ERparle_26de.html" title="User:Rparle">rparle</a> 03:12, Mar 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The one I've put up now is much higher contrast then the first. It's big enough to see pretty easily I think. --<a href="../../../r/p/a/User%7ERparle_26de.html" title="User:Rparle">rparle</a> 20:01, Mar 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the following line because I had no clue what it was meant to say. If someone wants to clarify, be my guest:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that there is a clear limit on how much the eyes can go away from each other, it is when there are parallel&#160;: about 6 centimeters away.</dd>

<p>I added quite a few images and paragraphs. Due to server problem, I didn't edit my writing carefully. If anyone is interested in editing my writing, please go ahead.

<p>is there a publication of researh on the limitation? i.e. to what extend this method can create illusion of 3D? For example, apparently it can only emulate surfaces, i.e. the viewing angle is only some 20 degrees. For fine can the 3d object illusion be achieved? e.g. can it emulate a mesh of wire? is it possible to extend this method to include color? ... <a href="../../../p/0/l/User%7EP0lyglut_ef39.html" title="User:P0lyglut">Xah Lee</a> 19:00, 2005 Feb 6 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a dozen of examples to illustrate some of the issues you brought up. Due to wikipedia server problems, the editing process took 5 times longer than it would have under normal conditions. But this is my first wikipedia editing... perhaps this is the norm&#160;:( I will add more paragraphs in the future to address other questions. For instance, the limit for the perceived depth of image is the distance between repeated patters. The limit for the resolution of depth is the physical size of each pixel. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred</a> 2005 Mar 7</p>

<p>I don't have many specific comments for further improvement at the moment, however, continued work in image sizing and positioning for good viewing in all browsers would be recommended.

<p>Wonder if it is true that you can only lack this ability to see what is not there, if your eyes are bad(..how bad?) when ur a kid. Perhaps i should start staring half hours at these pics? I anyhow dont have lazy eyes, or lack off stereoscopic vision (there is a whole lot of difference for me watching the real 3d world from watching flat pictures) However i am shortsighted all my life, is that the answer? Can't help but being curious to know wether i would see the effect when i trie for more then halfhours.80.57.242.54 07:34, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You need <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereopsis.html" title="Stereopsis">stereopsis</a> in order to see autostereograms. But stereopsis is only one of the many mechanisms used by the brain to reconstruct stereo shapes (<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binocular_vision.html" title="Binocular vision">binocular vision</a>). What you experience as 3D vision may in fact some from other visual cues. There is a simple way to check. Get yourself a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereoscope.html" title="Stereoscope">stereoscope</a> and see if you can see 3D images. If you can, then you will eventuall be able to train yourself to see autostereograms. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred Hsu</a> 08:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the head should be: regain stereoptic vision. I tried stereoscope, i think, it must have worked. However probably i underdeveloped the issue wich having to do so much with contours only makes sense. As a child already i thought intelligence was helped by shortsightedness (sublimalisation of essentials) , and tiring of stereoscopic experiments indeed (rea)points to human's visual intelligence. more stereopsis feels nice(pretty), but when the gorilla has to choose between a banana and an office-job:)(80.57.242.54 09:23, 9 September 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Hey, Keenan, in a few days, I'll try to make sense of all new stuff added into this article, and do a first round of copyediting. I'll ask you to proofread one more time when I am done, if you don't mind. Hopefully, wiki's built-in diff will be good enough to allow you to quickly look at new changes. I've noticed that when a paragraph is split into two, the diffing process gets really confused. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred Hsu</a> 04:10, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current definition, while not incorrect, could be improved upon by mentioning that the differing images have to be presented to differing eyes. While this is mentioned elsewhere in the article, readers parsing the article looking for a brief overview may fail to realise the importantance of binocularity upon reading this definition.</p>

<p>I didn't find any information in the article about if autostereograms "work" for people who may be afflicted with one of the various types of color blindness. Does anyone have any good information to add on this topic? I think it would be appropriate to document in the article if so. Thanks. --<a href="../../../v/3/r/User%7EV3rt1g0_22aa.html" title="User:V3rt1g0">V3rt1g0</a> 03:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Autostereogram does not rely on color. In fact, on this very same talk page (scroll up), you will find a black and white autostereogram. Autostereogram only rely on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereopsis.html" title="Stereopsis">stereopsis</a>. Remember, the hidden shapes appear colorless to a viewer regardless of the actual color of patterns in the autosteregram. The hidden shapes are revealed as depth changes. Let me go back to the reference books to see if I can dig up some paragraphs to support this, and I'll enhance the article. Also, my limited empirical observations based on only a few cases seems to indicate that often color blindness goes with <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amblyopia.html" title="Amblyopia">amblyopia</a>. Now, this is just my own speculation and is not based on any research or reference books at all. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred Hsu</a> 05:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting. Even if you end up not finding anything with enough officialness for the main article, I appreciate your answer here all the same. Thank you <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred Hsu</a>. --<a href="../../../v/3/r/User%7EV3rt1g0_22aa.html" title="User:V3rt1g0">V3rt1g0</a> 16:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to official policy, links to forums are not allowed, even if the topic of the forum is on the topic of the article itself. I know from my own experience that <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/3D-Stereograms/" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/3D-Stereograms/" rel="nofollow">the yahoo forum on autostereogram</a> is excellent. Members of this forum mail brilliant home-made autostereograms to other members of the group on a daily basis. If you are interested in autostereogram, you definitely need to sign up. But people keep adding this link to the article, and it keeps getting removed. I think it is time we create a section on this talk page to explain why such links are not officially allowed. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredhsu_99cc.html" title="User:Fredhsu">Fred Hsu</a> 00:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
