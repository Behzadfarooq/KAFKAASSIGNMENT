<p>From the article: <i>There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism diagnoses is 173%.</i><br />

<p>First of all, forgive me if my edit is not up to usual Wikipedia standards, as I am a complete newcomer and have only just created an account! However, I was compelled to add to the talk discussion on this article. Under the section on "Brain Trauma", there is no mention of Dr Patricia Rodier and her work on the connections between the microstructures (and deviations from the norm thereof) of the brain stem and autistic spectrum conditions. Her work was covered in great detail in an article in <i>Scientific American</i> (issue dated January 2000), said article having been made public domain: the article is called <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~cory/autism-info/orgautsa.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unc.edu/~cory/autism-info/orgautsa.html" rel="nofollow">The Early Origins Of Autism</a> (click link to be taken to the article, and note that the text formatting on that page is <i>not</i> conducive to easy reading!). I have been in touch recently with Dr Rodier, and from her correspondence was motivated to contact Siemens Medical with respect to the possibility that MRI scanners may have the necessary resolution to home in on these brain structure changes as a diagnostic tool. Siemens Medical kindly sent me (via snail mail) a huge sheaf of documentation covering their MRI scanner systems, and scanner technology is, according to this documentation, approaching the resolution needed for such an application. I would consider it appropriate to add references to Dr Rodier and her work in this article (at the moment my editing skills are insufficient for me to undertake this task) and so if there is anyone associated with this page who could perform the requisite editing while maintaining the high standard of the article, I would be grateful for their time and effort in this endeavour.</p>
<p>The article expands upon the brain stem changes and couples them to HOX genes, said coupling having been demonstrated experimentally in the laboratory using transgenic mice. Again, an addition to the article mentioning this would be welcome.</p>
<p>As for my own compelling interest in this topic - I was diagnosed in late adult life with an autistic spectrum condition. As can be seen from the above, it need not necessarily constitute a cognitive impairment! <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalilasseia_7ac2.html" title="User:Calilasseia">Calilasseia</a> 13:20, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is the inclusion of Kim Peek appropriate in this article? As the <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Peek_d62b.html" title="Kim Peek">Kim Peek</a> article says, "Kim Peek was born with macrocephaly and missing corpus callosum." This is not autism. Or, rather, he may be autistic, too, but these other problems are not problems of autistics. And his picture is on the front page of Wikipedia in the context of the autism article. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 17:21, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the picture choice was unfortunate (I thought the temple gradin one or one of the others would get picked). Also, I'm fairly sure that Peek is not behaviourally autistic either... which makes it even more peculiar. IIRC the Rain Main movie took Kim Peek as an example and modified it to be an autistic savant, thus the confusion (I'm not sure who modified the caption to read an autistic savant but I really do not believe its accurate...). --<small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 17:39, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is the source that Kim Peek was (impliedly) the chief inspiration for Rainman? I attended a discussion led by Dr. Rimland several years ago, in which he said that his own son was a major model for Dustin Hoffman in portraying Raymond. Dr. Rimland said that his son's first reaction to meeting Hoffman in person was to tell him "You look older than your picture." -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 18:53, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would it be more correct to say "Persons with Autism" rather than "Autistics"&#160;? I remember when I worked at a tutoring center for children with Down's, Tourette's, Autism, we had to say "Children with Autism" and such (As the main teacher would say: "They're people first, Autism is part of who they are.")</p>

<dd>Actually, "persons with autism" is offensive to autistics. It would be like saying "persons with deafness" or "persons with homosexuality" or "persons with left-handedness". --Jose</dd>

<ul>
<li>Autism is sort of an exception to the rule, as autistics is a more well-known term. For example, even on Asperger's syndrome you'd say "People with Asperger's syndrome", but the term autistics is so well known and is a dictionary term in a lot of dictionaries that it is generally more expected to say autistic rather than "People with autism". --<small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 00:02, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The way I understand it: Some autistic people prefer to be called "autistics" or "autistic people" because person-with language is used for illnesses (a person with AIDS, for instance.)

<p>It might make sense, but then we use person-with language on the Asperger's page.

<p>Most parents I've worked with prefer child with autism to "autistic" -- I can't say it's "generally more expected" to say "autistics." And I don't know that saying "person with" gives the impression that autism can be removed -- i.e., person with diabetes, person with artificial limbs...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly, the <i>parents</i> prefer "child with autism". They want to believe that the child exists separately from his or her neurology. I'm not saying that what the parents want doesn't matter, but they have to face reality sooner or later. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 21:38, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it comes down to choice. I've been diagnosed with autism since 1970 and I use both forms. Among autistics, that's what I say and how I think of myself but when I talk to professionals and parents I usually use the 'person with' form so that people don't get hung up by terminology but listen to what I have to say.

<p>I think this reflects part of the controversy: whether autism is a trait (difference) or a handicap (deficit). I don't think we can resolve this issue here, but the article needs to make it clear there are two different ways to see it. I'm not sure, but I imagine something can be gleaned from the way deaf people view things. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 01:03, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the reason Asperger's Syndrome is treated differently is because it's two words. There are some people who feel the terms "aspergian" or "aspergic" are appropriate, however many others feel that AS is just another flavour of autism and any new term would be redundant. I personally describe myself using the terms "I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome" and therefore "I am autistic" or "I am an Aspie". I almost never say "I have AS". If anything, it has me.&#160;:-/ 24.87.206.79 14:35, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The primary distinction in this case is not the word itself but rather wether one uses "am"/"is" or "have" when refering to Autism/Aspergers.

<p>I would like to register a complaint about using the Kim Peek photo for the front page of Wikipedia. The photo plays to the prejudice that people with a disability or exceptionality are, of necessity, "odd" looking. This affirms in the popular mind that "different" means "abnormal" in a readily identifiable physical sense, which leads to a very unhelpful objectification of human beings. Some disabilities are accompanied by physical manifestations, some are not. Autism does not have any characteristic appearance. Why did we not use the picture of Temple Grandin, who is quite deeply autistic, or of the "little professor"? -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 18:48, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering Kim Peek is the most famous autistic person, I don't really see what there is to object to. If the featured article was "President of the United States", I would probably use a picture of George Bush, because despite the fact that he's truely awful (in my not-so-neutral point of view) it's clearly related.

<dd>Kim Peek is possibly more familiar to those who are not familiar with autism, maybe (despite it being a common misperception/stereotype). Even though Temple Grandin is more well-known to professionals/autistics I think when a lot of normal people think autism they think of the movie "rain man".

<dd>I'm an Asperger autistic, I've been reading about autism since '84, and I never heard of Kim Peek. When <i>Rain Man</i> came out, I read that the character was based on several people including a pair of autistic savant twins (George and Charles, Oliver Sacks wrote about them) and Joe Sullivan. Hoffman actually got to know Sullivan and a couple of other autistics as well as Kim Peek. As Peek is not autistic I agree that the picture should be changed, and I agree with the suggestion that Temple Grandin's picture should be used since she is autistic, a public figure, and as ar as I know, non-controversial. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 18:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I ask: in whose estimation? Peek is perhaps the most notable example of what is <i>called</i> "autistic savantism," though that was a sort of PC modification of the prior term, which was "idiot savant." But savantism is exceedingly rare in autism, though it has the most interest among the great unwashed masses. <i>Rainman</i> is a very good movie concerning autism, but in real world terms, Temple Grandin is an actual autistic, was perhaps the first to be able to give insight into autism from the POV of one with a severe case of the disorder. She helped raise autistics from the status of freak-show curiosity, specifically using her autistic skills to create revolutionary (and widely used) methods for the human treatment of food animals. Fame by Hollywood should not be encouraged. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 07:47, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added a brief etymology of the word "autism" in the history section of the article using a hard copy of the Oxford English Dictionary I happen to have handy. I wanted to make clear that the word "autism" comes from the Greek word for "self" (from which we also get "automatic", "autonomy", etc.) However, in the interests of accuracy, I would like to type the Greek word "autos" using Greek script. However, I have no idea how to do this. Would somebody more familiar with using Greek script on Wikipedia care to do this? The OED's etymology gives it as thus:</p>
<p>alpha - ypsilon (with apostrophe accent above) - tau - omicron (with acute accent) - sigma</p>

<p>Are there any more concrete or reputable references for the alleged redefinition of certain autistic spectrum disorders as falling under 'crypto sensitivity syndrome?' A PubMed search turns up nothing referring to such a syndrome, and the only references found via Google are to two webpages published by laypeople, both of whom cite essentially the same relatively unprofessionally written document, and neither of whom provides any reference whatsoever to any discussion within the actual psychiatric community.</p>

<dd>I was around, years ago (late '90s), right around when this "cryptosensitivity syndrome" was first being promoted by someone who frequently trolled autism forums trying to stir up trouble. It is his invention. No professionals have ever seriously considered it to my knowledge, to replace autism or Asperger's or anything else. I do not have a reference for it unfortunately except my own blog entry on the topic, <a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=11" class="external free" title="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=11" rel="nofollow">http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=11</a> that I wrote during the time when Crypto Sensitivity seemed to be making a bizarre comeback. It's like an urban myth that's gotten out of control. The person's name, who invented it, was variously Mike Hack or Mike Hackett. Anbuend 17:39, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutism_History_as_of_2006_June_5_16ee.html" title="Edit section: The Neanderthal theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Neanderthal theory</span></h2>
<p>I see that the reference to the Neanderthal was removed a couple of month ago. Looking at the discussion for this it seems like some people obviously with a pro-disorder view of autism wrote in favor of it's removal.</p>
<p>Here are some of the misunderstandings:</p>
<p>1. Autism is present at the same levels in every ethnic group. Not true. Autism is very uncommon in black Africans. It is not uncommon in AFROAMERICANS, but this is another discussion altogether. Asperger's syndrom, which is high-function autism, is very rare in Afroamericans, and everyone basically knows about this. There is NO study of prevalence of AS in the US categorized by racial origin. However, the fact that virtually nobody knows a black Aspie speaks for itself.</p>
<p>2. Neanderthals were disordered if they had autistic traits. This claim of course is nonsense. Neanderthals didn't "have" autism, they originated the differences in social behaviors, the differences in non-verbal communications and the differences in mating and sexuality. This of course did not make them disordered! It is when these traits are out of their original environment that they cause trouble. For instance, in IRL meetings between people with asperger traits there is no evident problem with social behaviors, communication or anything else. They seem to get along pretty well.</p>
<p>3. The single-gene versus multiple-gene reasoning. If autistic genes entered human populations by hybridization, it is clear that it couldn't have been a single gene. It must have been many genes, and these genes are expected to have been diluted into the entire population. The only reason we have higher concentration of these genes in autistics is because of asortative mating. The social differences will lead to asortative mating, and the autistic population is very much involved in asortative mating. The result of the Aspie-quiz, obviously also removed from wikipedia, clearly is indicative that most of the 100 traits surveys show a common feature. They are at their highest in the diagnosed AS-group, lower in self-identified Aspie, end intermediate in AD/HD. In no case is a trait universally present in one group but not in the other. This supports the theory that autistic traits are not something only autistics have. Basically *everybody* has these, and this is exactly what we would expect from ancient hybridization. <a href="http://www.rdos.net/aspeval" class="external text" title="http://www.rdos.net/aspeval" rel="nofollow">Aspie-quiz evaluation</a></p>
<p>So, in conclusion, about the only viable reason why the neanderthal theory were removed is because some people didn't like it. I have no idea why far more implausible theories like Simon-Baron Cohens "extreme maleness" are still there. Aspie males are certainly not at the extreme of the male spectrum. Extreme maleness involves building hierarchies, participating in wars and violence, none of which Aspie males seems to want to indulge in.</p>

<dd>I'm tired but (2) is COMPLETE NONSENSE - <i>many</i> autistics get along better in IRC or whatever but there are a bunch who get along better in real life. And to say that even those who IRC " there is no evident problem with social behaviors, communication or anything else" is.... just plain wrong. The only verifiability is a shaky website with the theory on it by a layperson - which does not make it credible (there has to be some actual scientific backing behind it, ESPECIALLY for a subject like this). If you are going to make the argument here you are going to need references to back up EACH of your claims. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 09:29, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't particularily see what is nonsense about this. I suppose you have the scientific papers to back up that the problems that exist between autistics and non-autistics are general and apply to both autistic/autistic relations and autistic/non-autistic relations? AFAIK, researchers studying autism does not do this in groups of autistics but in laboratories like they are studying rats!</p>
<p>Besides, we've had a gathering here in Sweden three years in a row targeted for *only* autistics. Close to a hundred autistics participated. I've not yet heard anybody claim their social problems remained in this environment.</p>

</dl>
<p>And if you cared to study the Aspie-quiz, which also have been banned, you'd notice the questions aren't particularily targeted at disordered behaviors. Most questions concern preferences. Can you perhaps explain to me why behavioral preferences are linked to autism? Does any of the featured theories actually explain anything more than a tiny bit of what autism is? How is it that explaining a tiny bit of autism could be considered scientifically sound? Isn't this a typical example of ignoring evidences?</p>
<p>As the Neanderthal theory is just a theory, it doesn't need massive support to back it up. The usability of a scientific theory to a large part depends if it can predict unknown facts. There are several significant predictions that follows from the Neanderthal Theory:</p>
<p>1. It predicts that autism is linked to probable Neanderthal origin traits like red hair, freckles, RH factor and more</p>
<p>2. It predicts that facebilnd people will do better on Neanderthal faces.</p>
<p>3. It predicts that Neanderthal culture was not typical of modern hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>4. It predicts the origin of animal domestication</p>
<p>5. It predicts that autistics will get along much better amongst themselves, and will tend to find a partner that is also autistic</p>
<p>6. It predicts the function of various sexual deviations and that these are linked to autistic traits.</p>
<p>7. It predicts that autistic genes will have a peculiar profile. When meassured for within haplotype variability the age will center around 30,000 to 50,000 years. When compared to other haplotypes they will be several 100,000s of years old. This profile is created as Neanderthal DNA went through a bottleneck as it entered modern humans with low-level hybridization. This bottleneck almost eliminated it's diversity, but left it's differences from Hss genes intact.</p>
<p>8. It predicts the reason for low-functioning autism. According to another autism theory, autism is two-factor. One factor is random in nature and creates low-functioning autstics. The other factor is related to the Asperger-profile which creates high-functioning autistics. Using the Neanderthal theory as a basis, it seems rather likely that autoimmune disease and low-functioning autism is related to genetic admixture between different species. When certain genes comes together they will cause disease. This also explains why Afroamericans have high levels of autism and low levels of AS. Afroamericans still posses a lot more of the offensive genes that mostly have been selected out in Eurasian populations.</p>
<p>9. Because it predicts that low-functioning autism is related to genetic admixture between species, it also predicts that the rise in autism, apart from increased awearness, also is related to racial admixture. It would predict that this rise is related to amount of blacks in western countries.</p>
<p>Theories are meant to be disproved, and I haven't seen you or anybody else disprove it. You are just expressing your bad feelings about what the theory implicates.</p>
<p>Finally, you claim I should be able to prove all my points but how could anybody prove points that haven't been researched?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Problem #1 - <b>zero</b> solid evidence on Neanderthal ancesntry in modern humans. All evidence that exists (like mtDNA) are resoundingly against Neanderthal ancestry. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:02, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for problem #1, there is no consensus on this yet. The strict out of Africa theory postulates that there were ZERO input from archaic Eurasian humans. This means *no* gene should show an age above 50,000 years. There are already several genes that are much older than this and that are rooted in Eurasia. Additionally, there is the probable hybrid from Portugal, the "sudden" appearance of the Upper Paleolithic *in Europe*, and not in Africa. There is not even a consensus if the all the mtDNA lineages really are of African origin. Recent back-migration into Africa is never taken into account when trying to prove the African origin of mtDNA. The M lineage now is believed to be of Asian, and not African origin.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And what about the Neanderthal DNA samples a couple years ago? Didn't they represent haplotypes nowhere near what was found in Europe? Do you have a citation challenging the results?</dd>
<dd>As for the "no gene older than 50,000 years...huh? How does a strict African origin hypothesis mean <i>no</i> genes should be older than 50k? The out of Africa hypothesis does not postulate <i>creation</i> 50k years ago... As for backmigration - of whom, and when? I assume from what you are saying is that there is evidence of backmigration from archaic hs populations back into Africa? Again, can you provide some refs for this?</dd>
<dd>As for where the Upper Palaeolithic first appears - I fail to see your point. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 19:22, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Neanderthal DNA samples that have been extracted are all from the control regions of mtDNA. While it is true that the Neanderthal sequences have a lot of differences from modern human sequences, it is also a fact that almost every mutation in the Neanderthal sequence can also be found in modern human sequences. You can observe this yourself in this comparison: <a href="http://www.rdos.net/mtdna/homo.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.rdos.net/mtdna/homo.txt" rel="nofollow">mtDNA sequences</a>. The other objection to relying too much on mtDNA is thar in a species of crickets that is know to have hybridized, there is no sign of this in mtDNA, while it can be observed in nuclear DNA (see reference in <a href="http://www.rdos.net/eng/asperger.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rdos.net/eng/asperger.htm" rel="nofollow">Neanderthal theory</a> section "Could Neanderthals really be a true species?"</p>
<p>The out of Africa theory postulates that no Eurasian gene could be older than the original migration from Africa, which is placed at 50,000 to 85,000 years ago. Clearly, if there are older genes in Eurasia they must have entered modern humans from archaics. In Africa, genes could be older of course, but not outside of Africa.</p>
<p>There are several known sources of backmigration into Africa. The most recent ones are from the arabic expansion and the colonization. Other probable back-migrations are of Berbers, which show a close relationship to Iberians. This migration probably occured at the last glacial maximum. Even older occurences are more speculative, but the oldest, indisputable evidences of modern humans are from LiuJiang, China and Israel. In Isreal modern humans were pushed back into Africa, as is evidenced by Neanderthal types here at a later date. Refs for this are part of the Neanderthal theory.</p>
<p>THe point of the Upper Paleolithic as an European phenomen is that an inbred, African, population couldn't possibly in a short period of time do all this technology advances when they had been in statis for 100,000s of years. This clearly is the result of "hybrid vigor".</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you please supply a <i>real</i> ref, not something off your web site, for the mtDNA stuff? DNA sequencing isn't about looking at any given base pair, it's about sequences. Bp's in isolation are meaningless.</li>
<li>I realise that mtDNA does not show up if the introgression was male neanderthal/female amhs. But the it would show up in the Y-chromosomal geneologies, and again, these are as narrow as mt trees.</li>
<li>Ok, so by "no gene is older than..." you mean, no gene restricted to Eurasia. This is not actually true - not with nuclear genes. Anyway - what genes? Please supply a ref.</li>
<li>As for the backmigrations...can you supply refs? "<i>There are several known sources of backmigration into Africa</i>" is meaningless. Known by whom? The Berber backmigration is <i>recent</i>, amhs, <i>not</i> archaic.</li>
<li>Inbred? Statis? "<i>This clearly is the result of "hybrid vigor"</i>". Clearly? Clear to whom? Where has a role for heterosis in cultural change been established...or even <i>suggested</i>? Who has controlled for a far more obvious driver of cultural change - <i>new environments</i>? There is nothing <i>clear</i> in this conjecture. Far more importantly, <i>if</i> these hybrids were the basis of a new, superior population, that <i>hybrid</i> population would have left an overwhelming genetic footprint. The debate is between whether there is 0% neanderthal contributions to amhs, or whether there is &lt;&lt;1%, an undetectable signature. The difference between 0 and undetectable is real, and is interesting, but if there had been a hybridisation even of <i>any</i> significance, it would be very clearly detectable. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:08, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Besides, your claim that there is 0% or &lt;&lt;1% Neanderthal contribution is clearly not based in reality. Genetics doesn't work like that. If an gene like mtDNA is gone, you cannot use it to calculate Neanderthal contribution. There are numerous reasons why mtDNA might be missing even if Neanderthal contribution for different genes range from 0 to 100%. You cannot gain better figures for Neanderthal contribution simply by sequencing more modern mtDNA. If Neanderthal mtDNA were lost by genetic drift, you can sequence the entire humanity and you will still not find any Neanderthal mtDNA. This does not mean Neanderthal genetic contribution is 0%. We really need relevant Neanderthal nuclear DNA instead, like the DRD4 7R allele, the CFTR gene, the PDHA1 gene, the MOXA1 gene. Until we have those your claims about &lt;&lt;1% contribution is just speculation.</p>
<p>As for the mtDNAs on my site. These are SEQUENCES and not BP. All of them were imported from a large gene-bank. I then estimated a "reference" sequence for PAN, and to make it more readable only differences from the reference sequence are shown. The point is that changes in the control region of mtDNA are not random. Certain sites are "hot spots" that frequently mutate. This makes genealogies only based on partial mtDNA sequences problematic. Basically all the differences between AMH and Neanderthal sequences are in hot spots.</p>
<p>There is a couple of possible scenarios for genes introgressed from Neanderthals:</p>
<p>1. Negative genes. All of these would be gone.</p>
<p>2. Selective neutral genes. Since Neanderthals are minority contributors, most of the neutral genes would also be gone. Mostly genes that are linked to positive genes are retained.</p>
<p>3. Selective positive genes. These could be of 100% Neanderthal contribution (and introduced to Africa by back-breeding with a selective sweep). They could also be involved in balanced selection with Hss genes.</p>
<p>I think we have gone beside the point. I don't need to prove Neanderthal contribution. As long as there is considerable controversy on this topic among professionals, argument #1 simply is not a problem for the Neanderthal Theory.</p>

Before coming across this bit of the discussion, I did a Google search and after a few minutes' searching couldn't find any refs to this theory that weren't just references to RDos's site. Hence I deleted the Neanderthal Theory refs. From a quick scan, the above discussion seems to me to be discussing the merits of the theory, which is beside the point. If it's original research, however promising, it shouldn't be included in the article. If I shouldn't have done this, please reinstate the links. <a href="../../../b/f/i/User%7EBfinn_cf83.html" title="User:Bfinn">Ben Finn</a> 21:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is there a link to the exact definition of 'original research' in Wikipedia? If something is discussed as much as this theory obviously is here in this talk page, then perhaps it ceases to be 'original research'.

<p>It seems a shame to have the son-rise section in there under treatments and not mention that it has NO empirical evidence to support it, or that the diagnosis of the son the program was named for was questionable.

<p>Rdos-- "can make autistics feel better" is actually a big claim, and unless there's any data to support that claim it might not be the right information to put up on this page. And I'd argue that gluten-casin diets do have side effects for some kids, like gastrointestinal distress (diarrea, etc). And what about the "side effects" of parents and families wasting time and energy on treatments that don't actually make their kids feel better? Show me some data...</p>

<p>You've been on other pages saying things like " I disagree as to the NPOV of autism related pages" and "The norm is that questionable treatments are presented in central parts of the articles while anti-cure ideas are at best mentioned in "passing"". So let's address these things here rather on other pages and AfDs, ok?</p>
<p>Here's what you said:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>SID has been retained, and there is absolutely no research supporting this "disorder", neither is it included in DSM. THe only reason it is there is because it supports the negative view of autism</i>
<ul>
<li>SID has <i>not</i> been retained here - the only mention of it is that autism has "symptoms like those found in SID".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The vaccine theory, although thoroughly discarded in every study, is also retained.</i>
<ul>
<li>And why should it be discarded? At WORST its very historical like the extreme-male brain theory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Simon Baron Cohens "extreme maleness" theory is also feature, even if it has zero support in research. About the only supportive evidence is that psychiatry think the male-female ration is 4:1. AFAIK, this is only because the diagnostic criteria is centered around men. IOW, this is circle reasoning.</i>
<ul>
<li>Again - it doesn't really matter because its a historical theory that was popular a while long ago but not today....</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>All the disorder-based research has been retained while every other POV has either been deleted or delegated to small sections outside of the main article [...] you are required to add material that is in disagreement with this view, whether it is onl hearsay in the autistic community or not</i>
<ul>
<li>Could you please specific? Much of the "disorder-based" research here is historical and even the ones that arn't have many verifiable and peer-reviewed backing them up. I thought the anti-cure perspective was well-represented here. Please give me specific examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>OK, I guess I will have to defend myself then?&#160;;-)</p>
<ul>
<li>SID. OK, I suppose the current state is ok. However, it is also mentioned in the "Autism as a spectrum disorder section".</li>
<li>Vaccine theory and extreme maleness. If you read those sections <b>carefully</b> you will problably understand that they are historical, but they are not presented in historical sections of the article. Causal readers will probably think these are serious and still relevant. Cohen's theory is presented under "models" section, which reads as the current state.</li>
<li>Disorder perspective. In the "Theories of the etiology of autism", there are a long row of disorder theories, including viral infection, vaccines, brain damage and some others, but the pure difference "theory" is <b>not</b> presented! In the "remedition" section, ABA, son-rise, diet and computers are suggested, but <b>no</b> intervention is not presented! The "autism culture" concept is instead presented in the sociology section. I find this quite problematic, especially for Swedish readers where there is a sociologist named Eva Kärfve that is disputing all neuropsychiatric conditions, and instead blame parents for being bad. This is what I meant when I wrote that disorder-based research were presented in central parts (models, etiology, remedition) while non-cure ideas are in the "sociology" section. Maybe the problems aren't as bad as I presented them, but historical theories should be presented as historical, and the anti-cure perspective should be part of model, etiology and remedy sections. If that is fixed, I guess I will be content&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 15:33, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>While I'm at it, I suppose I should mention that not everybody believe that the main symptoms of autism, like social differculties, non-verbal communication differculties and theory-of-mind abilities are general. Some believe these are confined to autistic - non-autistic relations only. There is certainly no support for them being general because there is no research on this.--<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:24, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>As a note -- although I think Baron-Cohen's work is EXTREMELY problematic and I don't really buy the "extreme male brain" stuff, I don't think it makes any sense to call it a "historical" approach -- he's out there pushing it NOW. There was a B-C NYTimes full page editorial about a month ago proposing that autism is caused by too much prenatal testosterone (without, of course, much testosterone data, and only the vague "autistic kids are kinda like non-empathetic boys, right?" stuff). His autism as extreme mail brain book is only a few years old. He's submitting and publishing articles on this -- and people are listening. It may not be rigorous, or right, but it's hardly done and over with.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose this is the research methodology that Ryan advocates. As long as it describes autism as a horrible disorder, it obviously doesn't matter if the theories have any substance to the or not. Besides, the only maleness in autism is in diagnostic criteria, which of course is not the truth about autism. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 07:55, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think Baron-Cohen needs to explain this (from Aspie-quiz I):</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you dislike or have difficulty with team sports and other group endeavours? (highest correlation, 63%, and typical <b>female</b> trait to dislike this)</li>
<li>Do you feel stress, panic or have a brain malfunction in unfamiliar or demanding situations? (46%, apparently anti-male)</li>
<li>Do you have difficulties judging distances, height, depth or speed? (45%, anti-male)</li>
</ul>
<p>He will need to do even more exlaining in the new version, where many new questions have received relevance. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:04, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

*sigh* Please stop quoting that inane aspie-quiz. Anyway, I do agree you have some good points up there. First give me a chance to response though please:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Autism as a spectrum disorder section" - I'm not exactly sure what the problem is here but I can reword it to point to the symptoms of SID rather then it itself</li>
<li>"Vaccine theories not historic et al." - that's what NPOV is though - as I said before many people don't consider these historic, so we can't just we say they are. I could try to emphasize that negative points a bit more, maybe in some cases saying that many professionals consider it historic, etc...</li>
<li>"Disorder perspective" - well, I guess I could. My thought though is that it was just inferred by previous text.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, your assertion about me trying to advocate it as a "horrible disorder" is ridiculous - the only reason I haven't responded/changed anything in the article is because of time. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 09:44, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The extreme male brain theory does NOT HAVE A SINGLE FUCKING THING TO DO WITH MEN. The extreme male brain theory is based on systemising vs empathising comparasins. It was named the extreme male brain theory because men often fal in systemisizing. Arguments both for and against the theory seem to focus on masculine v feminine traits not the theory itself. <a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESymmetric_Chaos_0a64.html" title="User:Symmetric Chaos">Symmetric Chaos</a> 12:49, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. The theory has to do with neurological and innate skill differences. Masculinity and femeininity (gender roles) are cultural constructs, and really have little or nothing to do with neurology. The most notable aspect of Baron-Cohen's theory is that it neatly explains the differential diagnostic rate in males vs. females. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:15, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To rely on the perceived diagnostic gender prevalence of AS is not sound. The theory simply falls apart with this fictive construct. For instance in the thousands of answers I've received to Aspie-quiz, women with a dx have 10-15 points *higher* score than men. This difference have been persistent in all three version, it did not change much as I wrote more questions (and proposedly added more male traits). It also survived attempts of gender-based correction on questions. It is not very true either that Aspies are not empathic. It seems like highly sensitive and empathic Aspies get big problems. Also, special interests seems to be a male thing, but it only makes up a tiny bit of the traits correlated with the autism spectrum. The typical female problems are simply not part of the dx. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:51, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We can't draw too many conclussions from something like that. It's not a randomized sample. Furthermore, I'd bet that the number of males who take the test is much larger than the number of females, correct? (I'm guessing about 4:1?) With those who actually are preocupied enough to take such a test, I wouldn't expect to see much of a difference in scoring across sexes. As to why females score higher, I can only guess that for a female to go and take that test, the severity of the condition needs to be greater (in average). <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 21:18, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely not. There is no 4:1 relation as to who takes the test. Version I: AS/HFA: 70 males, 84 females. Version II: AS/HFA: 335 males, 236 females. Version III: AS/HFA: 1133 males, 696 females. Version II: Total: 738 males, 724 females. Version III: Total: 3335 males, 2335 females. This gives relations of 1:1.2, 1.4:1, 1.6:1 for AS/HFA and 1:1, 1.4:1 for total. None of these are even close to the proposed 4:1 relation. It is also notable that version III has most answers from people outside of the autistic community (it hasn't been announced there). --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:00, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, that's counter-intuitive, and I'm not sure how it can be explained.

<dd>Another indication that "self-perception" means a lot is the score distribution. Even though version I was highly experimental, it seems got better selectivity on various questions than follow-ups. It is also interesting that in the first releases, the self-identification group scored higher than the diagnosed group. In later versions this was reversed. I think this is at least partly due to that the first quizes being mostly answered by highly self-aware people, and the latter to less self-aware.

<dd>Neurodivergent, I'm interested in your idea that "for a female to go and take that test, the severity of the condition needs to be greater (in average)". What are you basing this on?

<dd>That's just the only explanation I could come up with for a greater female score. In other words, some males may go because they're curious.

<dd>I could offer some other explainations myself. It might be that females and males have different levels of "self-perception". Females might more easily recognize their own problems, possibly because they are expected to be more social. I don't think the hypothesis that females needs to be more worried holds. There seems to be equal proportions of answers from both diagnosed and undiagnosed, with a slightly higher male-to-female ratio for diagnosed. I think because the dx is geared towards typical male problems, parents will more easily seek diagnosis for a male. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:45, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking at the referer statistics for version III, there is another indication that dx is gender skewed. For (self/real) diagnosed AS/HFA males score 121 on AS and 82 on NT while females score 129 on AS and 73 on NT. These results are after correction for gender-bias in questions. If you look at the non-AS/HFA, males score 79 on AS and 109 on NT while females score 81 on AS and 111 on NT. IOW, there is a tiny 2 point difference in the "NT-group" while the difference is 8-9 points in the AS/HFA group. The difference in the NT-group also is only that females get 2 points higher on both scales, while in the AS-group females score 8 points higher on AS-scale and 9 points lower on NT scale --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 15:10, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems worth adding in some of the face processing abnormality in autism in the characteristics section, probably under social development. The lack of normal eye contact is such a big diagnosis indicator for autism and one of the big things that gets people into doctor's offices. There's also really great eyetracking and imaging data on abnormal face processing in autism -- i.e., kids with autism fixating on people's mouths when speaking to them rather than the eyes, lack of normal brain activation to faces, etc... This seems like a big part of the social deficits of autism, and right now it isn't even mentioned.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Here are traits with higher correlation:</p>

<p>I actually do agree with you that face-processing might be a major *difference* that cause many of the social problems. What I didn't like in your argumentation earlier was the argumentation that this necesarily represents a deficit. We actually don't know why autistics prefer not to look other people in the eyes, and why prosapagnosia exists. I have my own ideas as to the background of prosapagnosia, but I guess Ryan don't want to here it as it is described on my web-site without proper references&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 15:48, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To clarify, then -- what is the difference between "a difference that causes many of the social problems" and a deficit?</p>
<dl>
<dd>A whole lot of difference. A deficit is something that is independent of environment, while a difference might potentially not be. If it is a difference, there is every reason to believe that people with the same difference will not have any "social deficits" among themselves. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:17, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just wondering, there are symptoms that are shared by autism and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_phobia.html" title="Social phobia">social phobia</a>.

<dd>One pronounced way is the sensory issues an autistic has. There are other ways too but I imagine that's the easiest. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 02:49, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sensory issues are not required for autism, though (as with anything in autism it seems). One sure way to distinguish is that autistics don't just avoid socializing, they generally lack the skills to do so. For example, in a group conversation the autistic has very little idea of when is a good time to chime in or of what things to say would be considered acceptable/relevant in that social situation. As a result, the autistic person could develop something equivalent to severe social phobia. I'm sure many autistics just don't like to socialize, period. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 17:33, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd be careful about calling that a diagnosis difference, as a lot of kids and adults with autism don't have pronounced sensory issues. In social anxiety, the anxiety caused by social situations is primarily driven by a fear of embarrassment -- fear that you will do something in a social situation that will make others laugh/think less of you etc. DSM criteria for social phobia:</p>
<p>A. A persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be embarrassing and humiliating. B. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally pre-disposed Panic Attack. C. The person recognizes that this fear is unreasonable or excessive. D. The feared situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety and distress. E. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared social or performance situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational (academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobia. F. In individuals under age 18 years, the duration is at least 6 months. G. The fear or avoidance is not due to direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drugs, medications) or a general medical condition not better accounted for by another mental disorder...</p>
<p>In autism/autism spectrum disorders, although anxiety in social situations may be present it is not the defining symptom of the disorder. And while social situations can tend to cause distress, in many kids social contact is in itself aversive -- not aversive because of embarrassment fears. Autism criteria: (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: (gaze issues, lack of peer relationships, lack of social/emotional reciprocity, etc.) 2) qualitative impairments in communication, as manifested by at least one of the following: (lack of speech, inability to sustain a conversation with others, idiosyncratic language use, lack of make-believe play, etc.) 3) (3) restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities as manifested by at least one of the following: (inflexible routines, preoccupations with parts of objects, motor mannerisms, etc.)</p>
<p>I'm curious about the reference to autistic individuals having "imaginary companions." I've never heard of this before and, just speaking from experience and intuition, it doesn't seem to fit with an autistic person's seeming lack of interest in social interaction. Why would a person who is basically not a social being have to compensate by internalizing an imaginary companion?--Leftymn 23:08, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not being a social doesn't mean you don't want to be social and hence imaginary friends are created for this role. (Though I know nothing.) <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 01:53, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There are also reasons for having imaginary friends other than compensating for social loneliness. And yes, autistics who communicate report having imaginary friends and even their own worlds (not to be confused with the "in her own world" stereotype often used to describe an autistic who seems not to perceive reality -- the operative word being <i>seems</i>). There have been several overgeneralizations made about autistics through the decades; first it was that we were <i>trapped</i> in a fantasy world and could not perceive reality. Then, it was decided that we did not fantasize or daydream <i>at all</i> and were incapable of it -- still the prevalent view, <a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=103" class="external text" title="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=103" rel="nofollow">as evidenced by this article</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the feedback on the idea of imaginary companions. I don't believe, however, that the prevalent view on <i>daydreaming</i> is as you've suggested. Perhaps an ignorant minority believe this, but I would wager that the vast majority of those having an interest in autistic individuals are quite aware that much daydreaming goes on. As to listening to autistic persons being the "key" to understanding, I think that is obvious. There's still a gap, however, and that's why I asked the question.

<p>I reverted a MASSIVE edit by 128.233.153.48. There is a lot of good stuff in there, but for the most part it is largely POV, uses inspeak (neurotypical), and is inaccurate and does not cite sources (" Approximately 50% of people described as "savants" are autistic, although only 10% of autistics are considered savants").</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to fix this:</p>
<p>"Despite the mention of delays in imaginative play, autistic people are just as imaginative as <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> people. However, they tend to show it in different ways, such as sitting and quietly imagining a different world without acting it out, or "becoming" a different person rather than having an imaginary friend."</p>
<p>The first sentence is POV since it asserts that "autistic people are just as imaginative as <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> people". It is also defensive and there is no need to do that here. Also, don't use <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> - most people won't understand it and it itself is somewhat controversial - just use non-autistics. As for the second sentence while it may be true it is completely unreferenced which is unacceptable for an article here (and I do not remember this in the current references).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am strongly in favour of emphasizing and including everywhere I can that autistics possess imagination. (suppressing my urge to rant briefly on perception of autistics as lacking emotion, imagination, etc.) There is plenty of anecdotal evidence supporting what 128.233.153.48 said, what we have to do is cite articles where autistics describe their imaginary play.</dd>

<p>From the introduction: "Although the specific etiology of autism is unknown, autism most likely results from genetically mediated vulnerability to environmental triggers." This is quite a bit POV. This is a belief, speculation, and if included, the article should mention that it is speculation, not "most likely." Has "most likely" been proven? Identical twin studies put the heritability of autism at 90%. Why not 100%? I truly belive that can easily be explained through human error in the studies (after all, the diagnostic is subjective.) No significant difference has been found between studies of fraternal twins vs. other sibblings. That in itself is a good indication that we're talking about something that's purely genetic. So I could easily say that "Although the specific etiology of autism is unknown, autism most likely results purely as a manifestation of genetic variations." And this would be a very fair evaluation, where "most likely" can be backed up. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 17:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the statement cited is POV. This particular sentence caught my eye also. The article mentions that the heritability of autism may be as much as 100%. So even if someone knew nothing about the autism literature, that person should question whether it is "most likely" brought on by environmental triggers. My understanding, however, is that the consensus opinion among researchers in the field is that autism is essentially genetic; a genetic contribution may be as much as 100%, but that even if it is less, the difference may be due to the fact that some interventions seem to work to some degree, so the contribution of environmental triggers may still be 0% (environmental interventions may be able to help an autistic but this doesn't mean that some detrimental environmental factor contributed to autism being manifest). The statement cited should be changed. As is, it defintely represents a minority view. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>Do</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DoctorW_9e6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorW"><font color="#007040"><b>c</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoctorW_8300.html" title="User talk:DoctorW"><font color="#800040"><b>t</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>or</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><i><b>W</b></i></font></a> 07:13, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is widespread agreement that genetics plays a role, but to say it is 100% genetic is patently false and well, stupid. The truth is, mainstream scientists have absolutely no idea what causes, contributes to, or mediates autism. They don't even know what autism really is. We should present all these explanations as theories, but to make it seem like there is a consensus in the medical or scientific community (whatever that is) is absolutely unacceptable. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 13:54, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why would it be false and stupid? Both the belief that it is 100% genetic, and the belief that it is partly environmental are both simply beliefs. There's no conclussive proof either way. As far as I'm concerned researchers can keep looking for environmental triggers all they want. (I do think that one environmental trigger, stress, could in theory make the symptoms of autism more noticeable). When a twin study puts the heritability of autism at 90%, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone's autism is 90% genetic and the other 10% was caused by the environment. It could mean that there were errors in evaluating 10% of the twins, in one of the following ways:</dd>

<li>At the time of the evaluation, there might have been enough developmental differences between the twins for one of them to cross the diagnostic threshold. One of the twins may have simply been behaving in an unusual way during that time.</li>

<p>Reset tab: I think the underlying hypothesis is that something like 80%-90% of people who are diagnosed "autistic" (whatever that means anymore) have certain genetic markers not commonly found in typical people. But this can be easily confused with the hypothesis that autism can be 80-90% explained by genetic factors. In other words, scientists are struck by the fact that autistic individuals often have relatives who are also autistic, but that does not explain why autism occurs. Nor does it explain why most autistic individuals have parents and grandparents who are typical. This is not as simple as hemophilia, so the genetic component takes a lot more explanation than simply throwing out "80%-90%." So when I hear medical doctors and the like say "oh, it's hereditary" as an explanation, they're being stupid. There are plenty of conditions for which there is a hereditary predisposition, but there's an environmental triggering event - cancer may be an example, or heart disease, and probably diabetes, alcoholism, etc. Nobody would shrug at a case of lung cancer and say "it's hereditary." --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 18:49, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As to why parents and grandparents are typical, that's easy. I'll give you a possible model (not saying this is <i>the</i> model). There are 3 gene variations required for autism. If you only have 2, then you're not autistic (maybe you're ADHD or something). Each of the 3 alleles has low prevalence, but not that low, let's say around 15% in average. So an autistic child could be the result of parents where, for example, the dad has 2 alleles and the mom 1. Clearly, a child could also inherit "normal" alleles from either parent in each case, so the child has little odds of being autistic. In this 2-1 example, I'd say the odds are rougly 12% for any of their children of being autistic. Couples where both parents have the 3 alleles would be very rare due simply to low prevalence (but clearly also because autistics are not good with relationships). I think the example is clear enough, but I can elaborate if needed. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clearly there are conditions that are 100% genetic (<a href="../../../d/o/w/Down%27s_syndrome.html" title="Down's syndrome">Down's syndrome</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fragile-X_syndrome_cbe2.html" title="Fragile-X syndrome">Fragile-X syndrome</a>). Are doctors being stupid when they say "ok, it's genetic" in these cases? (In these two particular examples I wouldn't argue they are not pathological, but I digress). In other words, your analogies do nothing to address the question as to whether autism is 100% genetic or not. We already know conditions which are partly genetic but environmentally triggered exist, and conditions which are totally genetic exist.

<dd>Well, those conditions that are a result of chromosomal abnormality (as those you mentioned) are different from those that are hereditary. The point is that almost every disease and condition have some hereditary factor, but many are also triggered or aggrevated by environmental conditions. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 12:58, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As to the cancer analogy, I'm wondering if cancer studies on identical twins would yield 90% co-occurrence and 5-10% on fraternal twins. Clearly, if there's a known range of heritability for cancer (which I'd venture is fairly low) I'd say that's notable enough to be mentioned in the Cancer article. With cancer, specific environmental factors have been proven, which is not the case in autism. (Notwithstanding Wakefield, which I understand has not been replicated and has been largely discredited). <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd also note that propensity to allergies or to intestinal problems does not answer the 100% genetic position.

<dd>It depends on what you mean by the percentages. I think it is obvious that hereditary factors play a decisive role in at least some cases, but that doesn't mean that the mere presence of certain markers can be used to diagnose autism. To repeat the point above, someone may have the genetic marker that enables "autism," but that the condition only manifests itself if the person is subject to certain environmental shocks. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 12:58, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll argue it a different way. With 7 alleles linked to autism (that's just the ones found so far) it's obvious we're dealing with many different conditions which are now under the umbrella "autism". Arguably, several of those have already been found: Fragile-X, <a href="../../../r/e/t/Rett_syndrome.html" title="Rett syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberous_sclerosis.html" title="Tuberous sclerosis">Tuberous sclerosis</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenylketonuria.html" title="Phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a>, and even <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubeola.html" title="Rubeola">rubeola</a> (4 of those I understand are fully genetic). So there could be an autism-i condition which follows a model similar to my example, and there could be an autism-j condition, which as you suggest, is environmentally triggered. But given twin study results, it's obvious the vast majority of these sub-conditions are fully genetic, and a small minority environmentally triggered. So I'll grant you that given any kid labeled "autistic", there might be a 80%-90% chance his condition is 100% genetic and 10%-20% of the time environmentally triggered (which is important as some kinds of environmental causes imply brain damage and may be treatable.) <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:29, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fragile-X and Rett syndrome have been decyphered because their etiology is relatively simple. I predict that some autism sub-conditions are the result of the combination of high-frequency non-pathogenic alleles (which will baffle researchers). I wonder if researchers are focusing on low-frequency alleles, in which case they would be going down the wrong track and are never going to figure it out. I could come up with a 4- or 5-allele model where each allele has more than 50% frequency when on its own; in other words, the neurotypical alleles could be the non-normal ones. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:29, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the issue of the wording in the second sentence ("most likely," "researchers believe," or "growing suspicion"): Although Neurodivergent intended "researchers believe" to solve the POV problem, I do not believe it does; "researchers believe" may very likely be read as a consensus view among researchers. There's no need to exclude minority views, but an encyclopedic entry should not imply that a minority view is a majority or consensus view, even if it is just a belief. I myself know for a fact that children who were correctly diagnosed (according to the current diagnostic) as autistic can "recover" to virtually normal functioning in every area of life, as I have seen it myself in several cases that I have followed very closely from diagnosis to the present over a ten-year period. The majority view in the field is that this can't happen, so I think it would be inappropriate to use the venue of an encyclopedia entry to make my argument. The encyclopedia needs to represent minority views (if they do so at all) as being held by "some researchers" or, more generously, by "many researchers." -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>Do</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DoctorW_9e6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorW"><font color="#007040"><b>c</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoctorW_8300.html" title="User talk:DoctorW"><font color="#800040"><b>t</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font><b>or</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><i><b>W</b></i></font></a> 23:45, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As to the view that autism is incurable, I think it's more a debate as to whether someone can really stop being autistic. They say that as a cautionary statement, i.e. your child can reach a pretty good functioning level, but don't expect their neurology to become non-autistic. I understand what you mean, from personal experience. My dad was likely HFA as a child and now functions so close to NT that he would not be diagnosed. But it's likely that he does remain neurologically different to this day, with notable advantages. A famous example is Raun Kaufman of the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son-Rise_e4d0.html" title="Son-Rise">Son-Rise</a> program who is claimed to have been autistic and now says "there's no trace" of his autism. In the autistic community those are referred to as Uncle-Tom Autistics if I'm not mistaken. The question is whether autism is a behavior or a neurological profile. I think it's the latter. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 00:36, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've found other papers on PubMed that conflict with these findings. Details in the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritability_of_autism.html" title="Heritability of autism">Heritability of autism</a> article. The problem here is that while a single allelic variant of HOXA1 or HOXB1 is probably insufficient to trigger the developmental cascade resulting in the brainstem differences found in both humans and transgenic mice, multiple allelic variants combining may provide a satisfactory model. Indeed there is redundancy across HOXA1 and HOXB1, demonstrated courtesy of the fact that transgenic mice with variant alleles in <i>both</i> genes exhibit a much more profound spectrum of developmental differences than those mice expressing variance in alleles in one of the genes alone. Again, relevant papers linked in the heritability article. Given that the HOXA1 relation to the brainstem relates to diagnostic criteria derived independently of genetic research (e.g., the auditory brainstem response test alighted upon by Dr Simon Baron-Cohen <i>et al</i>), I suspect that further work in this area will prove enlightening. Additionally, Rodier opened up the possibility that these allelic variants interact with as-yet undiscovered teratogens&#160;: valproic acid studies with transgenic mice produced similar brainstem changes. The fact that these candidate genes govern a developmental mechanism that is sensitive to the effects of a range of known teratogens (namely valproic acid and thalidomide) suggests that a search for a combination of variant alleles and teratogens coupling with those variant alleles would be fruitful. If someone supplied me with the research funds, I'd jump at the chance to investigate this! <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalilasseia_7ac2.html" title="User:Calilasseia">Calilasseia</a> 00:13, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps, but it looks like there are a number of other loci which are much more promising. I suppose it's possible for someone to have HOXA1/HOXB1 and appear autistic, but given current findings, this is not how most cases come about. In reality there doesn't appear to be an "autism gene" or even a number of genes. There could be hundreds of genes which contribute slightly one way or another. It doesn't look like they will ever be able to come up with a genetic test that can accurately predict that someone is autistic. The best possible test might give a result like this: Your child has a 10% chance of being 'normal', 30% chance of being 'high-functioning', and 60% chance of being a classic autistic. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since yours is a new article, I feel somewhat more confident about my edit contributions there than in the full-blown featured article on autism.

<dd>I'm in school for occupational therapy, and one of the things we learned is that we refer to patients in 'patient-first' terminology. Hence, we say a person with autism, as opposed to the autistic person. The latter version is more demeaning. Imagine saying "Get the autistic person to help us!" vs. "Get the person with autism to help us." It ends up putting more of a label on the person with autisim.--<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAishel_170f.html" title="User:Aishel">aishel</a> 00:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In these cases it's advisable to see what the actual affected persons think. In the case of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, for example, persons with epilepsy will tell you they prefer person-first terminology.

<dd>One would think that if a system of reference were to be used to refer to a person or a condition, then it should be held for all conditions. Thus, the question is whether a person suffering a certain condition should be defined by that condition, i.e. <i>an autistic person</i>. There is difficulty with this method in situations where the title might be deemed derogatory, such as a person with mental health problems might be referred to as a mental person. Furthermore, if we were to choose the method of defining a person by their condition than we might come to difficulty with people with multiple conditions- for example a person with asthma, autism and mental health issues might be a mental, autistic, asthmatic person. There might also be cases where a definitive -ic is confusing, such as a person with primary sclerosing cholangitis, who might be a primary sclerosing cholangitic. Surely rather than making an exception in this one case (as we so often do in the English language) we would be better off preserving a common system for referring to patients with conditions- i.e. <b>person with autism</b>.</dd>

<dd>The difference between autism and many other conditions were "patients" prefer the <b>person with</b> terminology, is that autism to a large degree is your "self" and natural way of being. That's why many people don't want their personalities to be identified as diseases, which <b>person with</b> terminology essentially do. Autistic describes a persons autism as something inherent in his/her way of being. Person with autism means the way of being is something that should be eliminated and cured. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:04, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another pending issue in this article as well as in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> article is references to decrease in 'new cases' of autism in California. Looking at the data itself <a href="http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/FactsStats/quarterly.cfm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> (it's quite informative, btw, and I might post an analysis) what the articles refer to is a decrease in the increase of total caseload handled by the state. From one quarter to the next, some new kids enter the system, and others obviously leave. Kids leave because the state cannot keep them indefinitely (I think age 18 is the cap) but I'm sure some are deemed recovered, some move out of the state or leave for other reasons. So the difference in caseload is not just kids going into the California system ('new cases'); it's kids going in minus those leaving. I'm guessing close to 4000 per year are entering the system, i.e. about 1.25% of all kids born in any given year. This is rather high, considering that we're not talking Asperger's. I'm guessing kids are entering the system at different ages, and awareness hasn't totally caught up. Clearly, the increase in caseload every quarter cannot itself increase indefinitely -- pretty soon everyone in California would be in the DDS. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 01:25, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find myself itching to make changes to the article, but it all comes down to one problem with it: the premise that autism is a single condition the way Downs syndrome, Turners syndrome, etc., is. If one is willing to question that premise and assume that the broad term "autism" in fact refers to a number of different conditions with different etiology but vaguely similar manifestations, all the theories and ideas about etiology, treatment/remediation, etc. may or may not be true. I'm not sure how to resolve this in the article, but we'll continue to have unnecessary disagreements if we continue to act on the shaky premise that it's all one thing. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:35, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With all the gene loci identified so far, findings which seem to vary depending on the region looked at or family sample, I'd say the evidence is pretty conclussive that there are many different conditions that fall under the umbrella "autism". (Many of those conditions arguably are already known). Unfortunately, the science hasn't caught up with that fact, and we can't document conditions we don't know about. What this article does really is document an entry in the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM-IV_1fd8.html" title="DSM-IV">DSM-IV</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:51, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually find it more objectionable to categorize autism as a psychiatric disorder than a communication disorder, and many don't think the term "disorder" should apply at all. Having said that, the main problem is that the definition and diagnostic criteria are lousy for this condition. We might want to consider the purpose of categorization for this article as well.

<p>As for the discussion above as autism as a seperate condition - the problem is that people believe they are seperate conditions (well, less and less now) but it definately is easier to treat it as one condition for the purpose of this article, and it tends to make more sense to keep it in the spectrum-articles. As is I think it does a good job of "differentiating" (if that were possible) the conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, as for Liefern's comment "in the meanwhile, I'm reverting" - the point of removing that cat was to avoid revert wars. Incidentally it would probably be better off to have those listed as "conditions", rather than "disorders". But I digress, my theory of it preventing revert wars has proven mostly incorrect in the past so it is a moot issue.</p>

<dd>With the way blogs have been turning up news and becoming a force to be reckoned with by CNN and others, maybe they're not considered something that can just be tossed off and dismissed any more.

<dd>Let's not beat up on Scorpionman too much. It was initially a question on categorization. Medical classification, that is, diagnosis, often deals with illnesses that share symptoms. Cough can be present in both pneumonia and congestive heart failure, and you would be surprised how hard it can be to distinguish the two even with a chest x-ray. The antisocial personality disorder is where there are a pattern of behaviors that hurt others. The brain is funcitonal, but the choices of behavior that are made include several of the following problems: failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest, deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure, impulsivity or failure to plan ahead, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults, reckless disregard for safety of self or others, consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations, or lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another. In contrast, in Autism you have a brain that is dysfunctional, with inability to organize incoming communication or sensation and inability to express themselves normally. In both cases the presence or absence of emotion are not really an issus. Even in the antisocial personality disorder there may be emotion even with no remorse. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 16:20, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't emphasizing on the lack of emotion, as you've just said. I was just using it as an example. There are a host of symptoms that may be shared, as the above website said (although I doubt that the kid had asperger's; he probably had a form of personality disorder that was confused with autism). I was diagnosed with Asperger's myself; it actually runs in my family. My grandfather has it, my dad has it, my brother has it, and I have it. Generally, I don't lack emotions. But when hanging around social circles that I usually am on the outside of, I can't stand them showing positive emotions. My biggest symptom of Asperger's is outbursts of anger (which are common to autistics <i>and</i> those with personality disorders). But I'm not really malicious; I do have a strong sense of regret after having done something bad or stupid, which is usually what keeps me from doing such things. I've also pointed out similarities between social phobia and autism; please see the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutism_49be.html" title="Talk:Autism">autism talk page</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 19:55, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These were really timely comments. Just yesterday a patient presented to my clinic with a long history of digestive complaints. They were vague, but triggered by milk or sugar. I then got out of him that his mom used to cook with special grains, milk free, and sugar and food dye free. I had just read about that diet approach in Asperger's syndrome, and asked if he had trouble in social situations. That got quite a surprised reaction from him. He hates social chit chat and people around him get uncomfortable with him in those situations. His father was the same way. I'll be doing an EGD and colonoscopy and will see what he has.

<dd>Yes, autism does have several links to the gut. I've been diagnosed with this disorder myself and I don't do well socially. When I'm standing in a room full of people talking and laughing, and no one is paying any attention to me, I feel very uncomfortable and sometimes get angry because I'm not recieving any attention. But I do all right when someone starts talking to me. I mostly rely on others to help me into social situations; if I go by myself I'll have a panic attack! I was listening to Dr. <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Attwood_7bf5.html" title="Tony Attwood">Tony Attwood</a> awhile ago and he was talking about symptoms that I definitely have. I actually had a friend once who had <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspergers_syndrome.html" title="Aspergers syndrome">Aspergers syndrome</a>, and he met all of the criteria. He and I would play and he would basically be the boss. I tried to suggest what to play and he often didn't agree with it. Also, we went to the same school, and he was very sensitive to the noise there. He also got unreasonably irritated at me and other students and it would get to the point where we wouldn't talk to each other for the rest of the day. But we would usually get back together eventually and we still make contact with each other. I read the big discussion on the Aspergers syndrome talk page and I am also a big science fiction buff (although I haven't memorized any <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Who_c85f.html" title="Dr. Who">Dr. Who</a> episodes). I am an Aspie but I don't agree that all Aspies are science fiction buffs, and not all science fiction buffs are Aspies. Some may be interested in literature, and some may be into actual science (as opposed to the fictional literature). My dad is a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfan.html" title="Railfan">railfan</a>, and my mom does get irritated at him for it.

<p>This may be a tangent to a previous discussion, and I was going to place it in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_savant.html" title="Autistic savant">Autistic savant</a>, but this article seems to get more attention&#160;:-) Is there any research that demonstrates that savantism is more prevalent among autists than in the general population?

<dl>
<dd>I understand it's 10% of autistics and 0.5% of the general population. Rimland I believe made the observation first. I've also heard 30%. Judging 'savantism' is a bit subjective. For example, an extraordinarily good computer programmer may be said to have 'savant skills'. Also, recent research by Mottron-Dawson is challenging the notion that autistics are cognitively impaired. It would appear that, at least based on the Raven IQ test, autistics as a group are cognitively above the general population. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 19:01, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would that be Rimland's chapter in the (1978) book by Serban? If so, I'm afraid that would considered to be a bit dated now. Mottron, to the best of my knowledge, only does research into the abilities of autistic savants, not into its general prevalence. I could be mistaken of course (this is from memory), but a reference to a peer-reviewed article would be nice. I 14:15, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, neither of those seem to be relevant to savantism. I'm aware of studies regarding autistic task performance (and have designed one or two myself), but what I'm looking for is evidence that *exceptional* mental abilities are more prevalent among autists than the general population. If it isn't, then much information about autistic savantism may be misleading, as it implies a connection between autism and savantism which may be spurious. <a href="../../../1/3/4/User%7E134.58.253.114.html" title="User:134.58.253.114">I</a> 9:40, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, I want to say what an excellent article this is and I am really grateful that so many people have spent a lot of time and effort in producing it. It seems a little mean that I should edit it, even a little, but I have and will explain my reasons here.</p>
<p>My son is autistic, and is determined as moderate to severe on the Spectrum, and his diagnosis was based on behaviours that I also manifested less extremely at the same ages. I amended the Theory of Mind as it seemed too definitive, that any diagnosis of autism included an absence of ToM. From my own observations, and I will happily admit to bias, is that my son has perhaps a diminished or abstract understanding of ToM - but can judge likely reactions by other people to events, he just cannot seem to do it intuitively. If there is a study giving a 100% result of a lack of empathy, and it is cited, then I would have little argument in reverting to the previous text. As I also said before, I manifested mild autistic behaviour in my developmental years and I am fully aware of the potential reaction to both my edits and this discussion topic.</p>
<p>I also made the social alienation aspect less definitive. If there is anything I can do as a parent, it is to promote social interaction from my son. This does not mean he is not often solitary, and usually within a crowd, but he can interact with some of his peer group and does not unduly appear to be withdrawn or anxious. A lot of this can be credited to the children (especially his cousins and other family children) who are aware of but do not make anything of his condition. Whilst this is an ongoing situation, I would comment that my son does not manifest any indication of social exclusion. Again, my experience is that whilst I can be solitary, I am rarely lonely and can forge relationships.</p>
<p>I welcome any comments, and will answer non-pervasive questions about my son. I would also suggest a quick look at my userpage might be useful.</p>

<dd>The nursery was provided funding to finance the provision of one to one support during the schooling element of the care. When he entered regular state education we sought, and were eventually granted, full time one to one assistance both in the and out of the classroom. As part of his "Statemented Needs" he also receives regular assesments from a visiting Speech and Language Therapist. He is also seen by an Educational Psychologist, a Behavioral Support individual, a Communications team, a Child Development Consultant and a Neurodevelopmental Psychiatrist at various times in a school year. The aim is to support him within the mainstream education syllabus - although at the end of the last school year it was considered that his development was not such that he should "move up" with his peers, but repeat the school year.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the detailed response. So your son has been in "the loop," as it were, for about two years, and the authorities seem to be forthcoming with services. My experience is in the US, with my younger daughter, an autistic friend of my older (not autistic) daughter and a number of others. A few more questions occur to me: Does you son speak? If so, at what age? Do you have much decision-making ability as to what therapies your son receives? Are you satisfied with the course of therapy thus far?

<dd>The authorities are forthcoming with services because we took them to a Tribunal after they offered only 12 (later 15) hours support in a 30 hour school week! The Tribunal required that the Education Authority supply support for the entire school day, including breaks and lunchtime, which was more than we thought we would get. The level of support is to increase as the school week does. It seems that we presented a very good case.</dd>

<dd>My son does speak, and at his last assesment (when aged 6) was deemed to speak at a level of 3 to 4 years. This "delay" in speech has been consistent during the assesment period. As you may know the 3-4 age of speech development is a crucial one, he just got there late.</dd>

<dd>We do not have a decision-making role in the matter of therapies. We are included in all aspects of discussion regarding therapy, and all decisions - and alternatives - are explained to us, but we are content that it is the experts in the field who decide on the course of therapy. Since, as you will have noted, there is quite a few inputs into the decision making process we realise that any policy will be concensual under current practice. As such, we are satisfied with the course of therapy our son has received. We see he is progressing, and that he is not unduly frustrated or anxious as regards the effect of his condition. People WILL be made aware should we ever feel that best practice is not being followed with regard to his therapy.</dd>

<dd>Can I ask you a question? Is your interest professional as well as personal? I have noted some differences in the US perceptions and attitudes toward Autism - indeed I am thinking of asking some of "our" people if they would like to contribute to this article if they are familiar with Wikipedia/the Internet/computers - and am wondering how our experiences may inform your thoughts regarding your daughters treatment/therapy. If it is personal only I would be happy to continue this discussion on "my talk" page (or yours). I don't want to clutter up this page with specific details on just one or two individuals which is not germane to the subject matter.</dd>

<dd>You may say that my interest is personal, since I am not a practitioner but, as my daughter was diagnosed nearly a decade ago, I've seen vast changes in the perceptions and therapies for autism, so some of what I say here may be of more general interest to readers here. If you wish to chit-chat about more personal issues of our autistic children, we may discuss those on your talk page, if you like.</dd>

<dd>Just to set out one point: it would seem the US experience is much different than in GB. The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990, I think) requires that all children with a disability receive a "free and appropriate education." In plain terms, this doesn't mean that they are entitled to the absolute <b>best</b> education available (the magazine TV shows notwithstanding) but that they receive an education appropriate to their disability: i.e., they can't simply be "warehoused," nor should you put all handicapped kids in a "disabilities class" where the methods may be appropriate to one kind of disability but not another. But beyond that, the level of service is heavily dependent on the individual school district.</dd>

<dd>Autism is one of the named disabilities that are automatically entitled to special ed support, so it is very important to get a diagnosis and, in the US, this can only be done by a Medical Doctor. In the case of autism, this is often done by a neurologist or psychiatrist. A therapist, psychologist, etc., can't give a diagnosis unless they are also MDs.</dd>

<dd>The one thing that you mentioned that made my ears perk up was that your son is mainstreamed but is being left back a year. I am not a doctor and I don't want to encourage you to seek a change if you're happy with your situation--you're a lot closer (about 3,000 miles and several degress of separation) to your sitution than I. Where I am, a child will generally not be left back because of a disability. If the child is not able to keep up with his/her grade level the child will not be mainstreamed but will be put in one of a series of special education situations. We had a hard time even getting a diagnosis for our daughter. She was placed into special ed at a private school when she was 3 and they didn't do much for her. She didn't speak, she didn't socialize, she was fairly docile (unless crossed) and would not even notice your presence unless you literally got right in her face. Despite the fact that she presented with classic autistic behavior, noone (except me and then my wife) considered that she might be autistic. She stimmed, she had echolalia, she drew away if you tried to touch or hold her, and she spent endless hours examining individual grains of sand. When they were able to give her a specialized IQ test, she scored a 64. Finally, when she was ready to transition to the public (state) school system, we brought her to a psychiatrist skilled in learning disabilities and he gave a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (not Asperger's) after spending two hours with her. He also predicted a good outcome with appropriate therapies.</dd>

<dd>Now while the school district has the ultimate say on what services are provided, our district is willing to yield to parents' wishes where possible. The local cooperative education service (multi-district) had just begun a pioneering ABA program and she was placed in it at kindergarten age. To make a long story short, they advanced her as she was able. She started on a 1:1 program, then added some 2:1, then this become almost all 3:1. She then "graduated" after several years to a guided program at a host school where she had one or two mainstream classes with an aide. As of this school year (she is in 8th grade), still under special ed guidance, she is fully mainstreamed. She almost made an A+ average and her last measured IQ was 124. Next year she will probably return "to district" for high school. She is still quite definitely autistic, but most people wouldn't have a clue to this.</dd>

<dd>My point in all this is both to express a hope and a caution. Some parents we know are anxious to have their child mainstreamed, and sometimes this seems to be at least partly motivated by the natural human belief that if you treat a person in a "normal" way, they will be "normal." We didn't want our daughter to be mainstreamed one minute before she was ready. She has progressed more dramatically than any other autistic child I personally know of, so what I am saying is: perhaps you may just consider whether you might enquire as to whether mainstreaming at this point is the very best thing.

<dd>Thank you for your full and considered reply and, on the basis that we are discussing general considerations which may be affected owing to our different circumstances, I am more than happy to continue this correspondence here (and I apologise if my tone indicated that I thought our personal experiences may be in the nature of "chit chat".) To answer your last point first; my wife and I absolutely believe that exposure to mainstream education is the preferred option, since "normal" society is where our child is going to spend all of his life - within it or seperated from it.</dd>

<dd>Not only are there some differences in our cultures generally, but also local issues informed our choice. We live in a low population density rural area, where most of the social services are centralised. There is only one alternative available to our child if he is not placed within an assisted mainstream school, and that facility takes all children with special educational needs not provided for within mainstream schooling. We feel that the special educational facility has difficult choices in applying its resources across the spectrum of educational need, and that the more passive needs of some children with comprehension difficulties may be obscured by the overt behavioural characteristics of other children. We are also fortunate that our local school already had an inclusive policy, and that staff were familiar with dealing with Statemented children. Had we been living in another type of area we may have come to a different conclusion, and we are aware that the specialist facility is an option that will remain open throughout the educational process.</dd>

<dd>As with yourself, we are unable to demand the best education for our child. We can, however, expect (and demand) appropriate access to the National Curriculum. Where this is not possible owing to a disability manifested by the child, then that child must be provided with a Statement of Needs detailing the assistance required to provide that access. It was this Statement that we successfully challanged at Tribunal, resulting in the fulltime one to one support he now enjoys. Since the behaviours he models are not in the more extreme range, and he appears to have some social behaviour functionality, we hope that in adapting to his current environment he will reap further benefits in an ability in dealing with society generally in the future. That is, we feel that he is learning more than just educational subjects in being schooled with a cross section of society. We do not believe that his condition denies him any opportunity that would be better allowed within a specialist environment.</dd>

<dd>It also appears my brain disconnected regarding my son being held back a year... in the small village school my son attends different age groupings are taught in the same class. His immediate peergroup did join another class, but he is familiar with many of his now current class. He is not the only child "held back", as this is a policy within the school to sometimes delay progression to the next class if circumstances demand. Pupils need not wait the entire year before moving on. The reasons were explained to us, and we agreed. In that our child has one to one assistance in learning, it was also felt that the classroom agenda could be modified so that he was not merely repeating the previous years study programme. It is expected that he will be able to participate fully with his peer group when he does attend the next class.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:02, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
