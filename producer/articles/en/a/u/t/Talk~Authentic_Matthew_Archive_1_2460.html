<p>If you guys pause to think for a mathematical thought moment, you will realize the words of Christ are too important to the World to resolve into stationary categories determined by Wikipedians.</p>
<p>You folks do a fantastic job, but this must use certain mathematics to be done correctly.</p>
<p>I do not know how your computer system sorts, but in this case we have an evolving concept that is currently a “probability system” that is quickly collapsing into one concept … one wavefunction so to speak.</p>
<p>It is mathematical requirement for the quantum mechanical collapse of the World’s understanding of the True Words of Christ that you create a focused, forever-branching (you should probably use a Binary Tree Sorting System) and forever-evolving Wikipedia Category called something like:</p>
<p>“Authentic Matthew, showing all translations from Aramaic into English for discussion threads” or perhaps you can suggest a better title that keeps evolving.</p>
<p>At your service if I can be of help,</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">-a compromise?</span></h2>
<p>This is Professor Peter the Gardener. I just found this commentary on Feb 10,and I wanted to thank you all for your precision thoughts. [I am just learning how to add to Wikipedia correctly, so thanks for your patience.] These are important issues, and I love your minds. I have many comments that will post in a few days .. thanks again.</p>
<p>I believe by NOT creating a category called "Authentic Matthew" we <b>lose a major research tool .... Wikipedia Itself</b></p>
<p>Perhaps I should explain my theory behind why a category called Authentic Matthew should exist... If one assumes that a person called Matthew actually existed and wrote anything about Christ, then in fact at some point of history there were actual sentences and concepts uttered by Matthew. That accurate history is in fact Authentic Matthew. I firmly know that Wikipedia itself is the mathematical vehicle by which Authentic Matthew can be discovered by Worldwide debate. ALL facets of Matthew must be brought to the discussion ... AND NO ONE AUTHOR can bring all facets to this deep a discussion. Therefore, I think that we can use the "Public Editing" vehicle of Wikipedia itself to CREATE the body of COLLECTED knowledge to determine Authentic Matthew.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia licenses their technology, I would be glad to host a Wiki style colletion of knowledge at the University of Destiny (my web site). I believe Wiki technology can answer many of the World's questions that no one author could possibly address. Wikipedia is essentially becoming the modern day equivalent of the Great Library of Alexander (all knowledge of the world literally in one place ... get it today ... on Wikipedia).</p>
<p>It seems to me the 'structure' of an Authentic Matthew research site on Wikipedia (and please, I would like to mirror or host at University of Destiny also) would start with whatever raw evidence (letters, manuscripts) we have on Matthew and post actual photos of these objects so we can ALL do the thinking we want about the raw evidence.</p>
<p>Then, theories would be split off by timeline over history about what these letters, etc meant ... 'Authentic Matthew" is NOT a concept that is stationary for just 2006 ... How people understood Matthew has changed over time and only with Wiki technology of public editing can we collect the tidbits of information from all over the world, embedded in thousands of minds, into one spot. Then, we can all think about how Matthew evolved in our minds over the centuries [there would have to be a posted history timeline in this article]</p>
<p>If this concept works, at the University of Destiny I had planned to then publish the raw data on every part of the Bible and use the public commentary to literally re-think, then re-write, the Bible starting from the raw documents of 2000 some years ago.</p>
<p>The number of mathematical loopholes in the current logical structure of the Bible is staggering ... particularly when you include the lying strategies of Roman Generals. How do we know, with 100% certainty, that the "Jews" that betrayed Jesus were not a hired assassin team secretly sponsored by the Roman Generals? This is not at all a 'conspiracy theory" since lying at that time was a standard part of an Emperor's Moral tools ... their morality was 'do whatever it takes including lying to win'.</p>
<p>My best start so far is with Newton's "Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms" which you can find at my web site Garden of Destiny.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. Peter.</p>

<li>I recognise that there was no consensus to delete this article – and that it is unlikely to change. I did warn –Ril- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A-Ril-&amp;diff=19363402&amp;oldid=19361330" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A-Ril-&amp;diff=19363402&amp;oldid=19361330" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that his involvement in the second re-listing was likely to be counterproductive - but getting this article right is more important than personalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am firmly of the opinion that <i>no article should exist by this name</i>. Commentaries on Matthew do discuss various theories of its origins - and even reference Jerome (in passing, and invariably to reject), but there is no discussion of a hypothesis of an actual early document called 'Authentic Matthew'. I have checked some specialist academic dictionaries, and cannot find this even cited in an index. The original article took all sorts of (disputed) asides from the Church Fathers, added them to several unrelated scholarly theories about synoptic origins – to produce what is a piece of original research. Notable proto-Matthean theories can be, and are, discussed under <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> or <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a>. But links from here to other Biblical studies articles, are worryingly giving the impression of a prominent scholarly theory that simply does not exist.</p>
<p>Looking at the last vote <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Authentic_Matthew_8546.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew</a> 21d , 12k, 4m – I note that 4 of the ‘keep votes’ expressed a desire for a renaming. So that would indicate a 29-8 feeling, not for deletion but, that it was undesirable to have this article at this name. Is there room for an acceptable compromise? I’d like to move it to Possible origins of Matthew’s Gospel and place it the context of the real scholarly debate on Matthew. There would some overlap with both the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a> – but that I for one could live with. I could just ‘be bold’ and do this, but it is likely to be reverted, and I’m likely to get abuse, – so I’m looking for some agreement that this has a consensus – preferably from some of those who didn’t vote ‘delete’.

<dd>As I mentioned when voting "keep" on the second VfD, I think a renaming might indeed be in order. "Possible" origins seems unnecesary, though. The document exists so we know it had some origin or other. Perhaps we could call the article simply "Origins of Matthew's Gospel" and begin it with something along the lines of "There are different theories about the <b>origins of Matthew's Gospel</b>." At any rate, I'm not knowledgeable enough about this subject to add anything more, so I'm wishing the rest of you the best of luck and dewatchlisting the page. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 21:51, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would suggest renaming this to Hebrew Matthew or Hebrew version of Matthew. The most common name for these ideas is <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>, and that article contains a fair amount on this subject. However <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a> is also a name given to other texts, so having a separate page might be useful. <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_primacy.html" title="Aramaic primacy">Aramaic primacy</a> is also closely related, though it again covers a much broader subject. We could also turn this into a general article on Pre-Matthean material, but this would cover far more than the current one, and this subject is probably best covered in the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> article itself. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:35, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thant there was ever a Hebrew language verion of Matthew is a theory very few scholars embrace. Whilst the debate merits mention on WP, I doubt it alone merits a full article. Even this article (as bad as it is) is working with an Aramaic thesis. I agree that the various pre-matthean material hypotheses would best be covered in the Gospel article (although they are perhaps a little technical for a general browser there) - but I was trying to find a solution for this article. It is being linked into others as if the existence of something called 'Authentic Matthew' was a given, or a notable concept - which it simply is not. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 00:50, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand the vote tallies. There should only have been 11 to keep, since #12, quote "very good" end quote, was the user's 8th edit.

<p>Whether it is understood or not, that was the conclusion of the closing admin (on the second nomination). I don't want to brown nose the admins - but I think we need simply to accept it and look to see for what there is a consensus.

<dd>Thank you for your response. I'd like to point out that this was the second nomination only because the first vote was flawed. I had supported the revote, if you'll notice, because a clear decision doesn't give either side excuses to whine.</dd>
<dd>When I say that I don't understand the vote, you're correct to assume that I don't agree with it, of course, but more literally, being new to Wikipedia, I don't understand it. If it's supposed to be subjective, then do comments like "seems to be legit" carry as much weight? If not subjective, I was particularly worried that my vote wouldn't be counted although I had invested some time in arriving at a conclusion. And does this three-way split with merge votes ever accomplish anything?</dd>
<dd>That the vote isn't supposed to be transparent wasn't the answer I was expecting, but it does do a pretty good job of explaining why I don't understand it. And if you are correct, then that's about the best explanation I could hope to have.</dd>
<dd>I'm not as knowledgable on this stuff as you (and others here... nor are they as you). Work with the man and see what you can do with the title, at least.Davilla 06:03, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the content seems to have all been merged I think the best way to get rid of this issue is to merge it again, possibly even protecting the page to force those wanting unredirection to give their rationale for doing so.

<p>I'm going to suggest a modified approach here. The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> article (which is the most important one) currently is filled with a very disproportionate section '#Lost Aramaic ("Hebrew") versions of Matthew' - which is of very minor interest, and may well have been caused by earlier merges from here. I'd like to split that section off into an Origins of the cannonical Gospel of Matthew - we can then redirect 'Authentic Matthew there' and at least keep all the idiotic theories in one place, and away from the mainstream article. I'm willing to do this (and rewrite) if other agree, and defend me against any 'sock attacks' --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:06, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could do, but you'd end up with a lot of fairly specialist and complicated stuff in what should be a fairly general overview of the gospel, its contents, origins, socio-historical backgound and significance. I think you'd also end up with a POV war in a fairly important article. I'd like to do some work on Matthew - but I don't want bogged down with all that - especially if our POV warriors return. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 21:35, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Did Jerome actually use the words "authentic Matthew"?</span></h2>
<p>I don't think the term "Authentic Matthew" should be used unless the supposed citation from Jerome in which he gives it that term can be produced, in which case I think said quote should be given verbatim. Anyone have access to the Latin of the Commentary on Matthew?</p>
<p>Can I propose an idea? If we are discussing a Hebrew/Aramaic text of Matthew, then we have to drive the article from the statement of Papias, because it is the only unequivocal reference to such a thing (even though it is not clear what the relation of the text he describes is to the Greek Matthew). Then we link to separate pages on the Gospel of the Hebrews, Gospel of the Nazoreans, and Gospel of the Ebionites which then contain the patristic citations we have for each title?</p>
<p>In order, lose the opinion stuff altogether and hunker down behind a "the ancient texts say this, this and this -- there are disagreements as to what this implies."</p>
<p>We could then extend the last part by specifying the various differing analyses of the data, using quotation and reference. If anyone knows what the current consensus of scholars is, of course we don't just have an assertion, but rather a verbatim and referenced citation by a current scholar (who holds a teaching post specialising in the subject) stating "the current consensus is..." (whatever it is).</p>
<p>Just a suggestion. I didn't think it contains wild and obvious falsehoods as it stands.</p>

<p>Problem is, I don't think any scholar is discussing something called 'authentic Matthew' either to support or deny its existence. The existence of an Aramaic original to Matthew is discussed (mainly discounted). The hypothetical 'M source' is discussed, but no-one is calling this 'authenic Matthew'. Scholars were being cited in the original POV verson of this article - but not for the theory itself - only for the component parts (weaved together in original research). Problem is, having NPOV'd this article - and removed the OR, there is simply nothing here to discuss, that is not discussed somewhere else (<a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a> or <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historiographical issue</span></h2>
<p>No matter what, this topic has a long and interesting historiographical tradition. I ran across the term while reading a scholarly text and came to Wikipedia to learn more about it. Redirecting the article is akin to deleteing it. Is Wikipedia not able to discuss this like adults? See <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ages_1e14.html" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">Feudalism</a> for how one deals with controversial topics in a NPOV manner.

<p>It is possible, if the term (as opposed to other discusions of a proto-Matthew which are discussed elsewhere) can be shown to have had any usage other than of Jerome. You mention 'a scholarly text', what was it?

<p>Right, now I get it, only I don't. If there is a 'translation' of Authentic Matthew in Old English then it is obviously spurious, and has nothing to do either with patristic debates or modern scholarship on Matthew's origins. Medieval apocryphal gospels are quite common - but Biblical scholars would not even bother to debate whether they shed light on First Century texts. It is possible that some Anglo-Saxon writer has picked up on Jerome’s remarks and done some invention - but I'd like to see some scholarship making that connection before I would want it mentioned in Wikipedia. I’m not even that clear what Jerome actually said (as opposed to how he’s being translated here). Anyway, the university library beckons in the next weeks or so. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 22:59, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is unilateral here??. The 'keep no consensus' debate had many keep voters who were suggesting 'merge' (and everything had been merged) or 'rename' - i.e. were unhappy with an article here by this name. Further, if you check above, you will see a fairly extensive ('calm and composed') debate, in the wake of the vote (and -Ril-'s stupidity), and over a number of days, concerning the possibility of a redirect. A number of people contributed with different ideas - but <i>all</i> were in favour of a redirection - and not one for keeping the article as it stood. My action was not unilateral, nor hasty - quite the reverse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I might add, your protection is highly questionable. There is <i>no</i> revert war here. I redirected two weeks ago - and no-one has challenged it. Now one editor, has <i>unilateraly</i> reverted it - without any discussion or seeking any concensus - and you have protected that position, when no-one was yet reverting it.

<dd>All of the above disputes have involved either -Ril- (who, fortunately, isn't likely to cause trouble right now) or the 'creator'. The last four edits were 1) a redirect (two weeks ago) 2-4) a revert, which the editor immediatly undid himself. 4) Another (unilateral) revert by one party.

What abuse is happening or likely to happen? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> wants things to 'calm down', but they have been calm for three weeks now - I see no recent agro until today - and that is all accusations from one party.
