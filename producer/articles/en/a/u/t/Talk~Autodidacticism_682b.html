<p>One can not literally be described as "self taught" by mostly limiting their learning to reading books (as opposed to attending conventional schools), given that books are written by others. By reading they are being TAUGHT, just indirectly through the medium of writing. ---</p>
<p>My impression is that an autodidact is a self-taught SCHOLAR, or someone in scholarly pursuits. I do not think Uma Thurman or Phillip K Dick should be on the list. They simply left school to pursue a career.</p>
<p>Otherwise, any in a career who dropped out or skipped college (including Peter Jennings, Bill Gates) would fall into the category. That misses the spirit of the term.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Second. Indeed! We have to add only the greatest autodidacts, e.g. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_Da_Vinci_ce34.html" title="Leonardo Da Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a>. Feel free to change the list in any way you feel will suit.
<dl>
<dd>That sounds like a good differentiation. Though, even though PK Dick wasn't a scholar, he was a professional intellectual who apparently educated/trained himself. And Uma Thurman, if she educated/trained herself how to act, could be seen as a kind of autodidactic artist, which seems much more relevant than an 'autodidactic businessman' or 'autodidactic journalist'. We could have a main list of autodidactic scholars, and an ancillary list for autodidactic intellectuals and artists.--<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectarflowed</a> 01:18, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about any successful person, especially if in the public eye, who happened to start but not finish college?</p>
<p>The strict sense of autodidacticism is <b>self-teaching</b>. Self-directed education is a weak meaning of the word, because virtually everyone self-directs unless they are an indentured servant, or are psychologically manipulated. I attempted to soften the text somewhat in this regard. Feel free to help clarify (or refute) this distinction. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 19:55, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I think that's part of a larger point. Many of the people on our list probably wouldn't think of themselves using the specific term <i>autodidact</i>, even though their biographies clearly meet the definitions of the term.--<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectarflowed</a> 01:18, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you check the Friedman link, you will see he has been at University of Santa Clara since 1995. As the son of Nobel economist Milton Friedman, he would hardly qualify as an autodidact, even if he never took an economics class (unless he was not raised by his father). --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 18:56, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even though the page is huge, the actual information on autodidactism seems small. The statement "Inquiry into autodidacticism has implications in learning theory and educational theory, educational research, educational philosophy and educational psychology." seems like it <i>should</i> lead into a very detailed discussion.

<dd>Agree. Anyone who wants to do some research for this article (which appears to be a popular one) might start with the book <i>The Passion To Learn: An Inquiry into Autodidactism</i> by Joan Solomon. The product description writes: "The final chapter addresses the implications of autodidactism for educational theory, research, philosophy and psychology."--<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectarflowed</a> 23:49, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I felt like it should be removed so I took it out. Autodidacts are people, so it seems illogical to list a <i>method of learning</i> (Autodidacticism) under a classification of people.

<p>I've removed two subsequent sentences:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Autodidacticism, it must be stressed, is a highly unusual pedagogic phenomenon whereby a subject will develop a skill without external stimulae.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suspect this lacks meaning as long as "external stimulae" remains undefined. Motivation has its roots somewhere.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Consequently, learning physics from books borrowed from the library cannot be considered autodidactism, but rather an alternative, and often less common, means of approaching the core material.</dd>

<p>I believe that if Joseph Campbell had been reading about physics, he would still have been an autodidact. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConf_f25c.html" title="User:Conf">Conf</a> 11:16, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The page says Joseph Campbell is seen as a foremost authority on methodology, shouldn't it be mythology instead? I'd guess one could argue that is work was on the methodology of mythology but still that seems pretty weird to me.</p>

<dd>I'll change it to "autodidacticism", which is the methodology itself, however there is also methodology (methods) of autodidacticism, but that is probably not the point. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConf_f25c.html" title="User:Conf">Conf</a> 10:08, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Howdy, does anyone know if there are ways to earn advanced degrees through this method? For my part, I feel like I've wasted my time and money earning the BA I have. I've learned more on my own than I have going to my school. Unfortunately, if I want to get into public administration or foreign affairs, I seem to need a degree. So again, does anyone know if there are higher education programs that recognize this method? Somehow, knowing how much of a racket education really is, I doubt it. If there is, maybe we can include information about it on the article page? <a href="../../../j/j/4/User%7EJJ4sad6_b970.html" title="User:JJ4sad6">JJ4sad6</a> 23:42, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jacotot 'discovered that he could teach things he did not know (for instance, Jacotot taught Flemish students to speak French without speaking any Flemish himself).' Jacotot taught French, not knowing Flemish, but knowing French. Therefore, he taught something he DID know! It's like, I can't speak Korean, but I can get a job teaching Koreans to speak English. Does this strike anyone else as slightly odd? If I could teach these self-same Koreans (or anyone, for that matter) to speak Urdu, THAT would be amazing. FlyBang 23:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rather absurdly <i>odd</i>. Way back in 1965 I learned Vietnamese from an ARVN sergent who didn't speak english - in a standard military language school in Danang. I'd say it was the way a whole bunch of Marines learned the language, nothing unusual about that. Our ARVN teacher no doubt learned quite a bit of English from us too, therefor we must have been truly geniuses or ...</dd>
<dd>Point is: Jacotot was teaching something he did know very well ... so, that section has nothing to do with the subject and should be removed - or just use a better example as that one totally fails. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 03:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
