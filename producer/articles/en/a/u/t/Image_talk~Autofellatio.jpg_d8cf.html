<li>Comment: If it's a copyvio, it obviously should be deleted. However, I'm curious as to what exactly leads people to believe it is. Perhaps someone could provide a link to another instance of the image on the internet? As for illustrating autofellatio with an illustration, I'd be fine with that too. There are some good illustrations at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sex_positions.html" title="List of sex positions">List of sex positions</a>. However, until an illustration comes along so as to make this picture obsolete, it shouldn't be deleted. I don't think the existence of illustrations on wikipedia precludes the existence of accurate photographs such as this one. (Note also that there is a replacement image of poorer quality now on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a>, but that this one does a better job of illustrating the subject matter.) <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">Timbo</a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><small><font color="black">(&#160;t&#160;a&#160;l&#160;k&#160;)</font></small></a> 19:06, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My primarily reason for believing that it could be copyvio is that it looks like something you would find on a porn site (which are usually copyrighted).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The image was uploaded by the user who said that he was the creator and correctly granted use under GFDL. Is there any reason to doubt this? On a pornography website it may well be considered pornography, but the purpose of an encyclopedia article is to inform. This picture illustrates the act well and adds considerably to the utility of the article. There is no suggestion that it is illegal under Florida law, so it should be kept. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:55, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I've made up my mind. I vote <b>keep</b> unless (a) someone can provide any evidence that the image is a copyright violation, or (b) someone can provide a better image to illustrate the article. Many people have asserted that the image <i>could be</i> a copyvio (as any GFDL image <i>could</i> be), but no one has provided any evidence. Some have called the image tasteless, but it's not a tasteful subject. If anyone provides a better image, such as a drawing, I'd be happy with the image being replaced. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_Request_for_assistance_8d8c.html" title="User:Quadell/Request for assistance">help</a>)</sup> 23:20, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. agree with Timbo; "pornography" isn't a reason to delete. further, in the case of the subject, if i hadn't <i>seen</i> somebody do this, i almost wouldn't believe it. it's extreme, unusual behavior, and it merits a photo. i strongly oppose any attempt to censor wikipedia on mere grounds that something's "distasteful", "shocking", or whatever. all of this pro-delete argument sounds like one thing to me: "i don't like it." tough. go read some other article. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyPig_21a4.html" title="User:SaltyPig">SaltyPig</a> 03:20, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a> is not likely to ever be a featured article, your kids are safe unless they specifically try to look up the article on the topic. And if they do, Wikipedia is a good place for them to find honest, accurate, uncensored information on the topic. Note the policy on the matter: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored_for_the_protection_of_minors" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a>.</li>
<li>This "policy" was inserted by one of the proponents of the pr0nification of Wikipedia. Articles <i>can be</i> censored if the community wishes it. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:55, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It certainly can. However there is no presumption that it will be. The section that Timbo cited, by the way, is based on policy stated in the disclaimer. It was no "inserted" into policy, like most of the rest of the document it's a handy summary of policies and guidelines expressed elsewhere. I note that you also had a hand in drafting that section, Dr Zen. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:27, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>An 11-10 vote Keep vs Delete is being cited as reason to keep this image - that is not realistic - this image is of sufficient importance that a vote of so few editors is really not indicitive of the community (over 100 votes are on the image vs inline vote - that is more likely to reflect a concensus) . <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 00:57, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually IfD votes are usually much, much smaller than that. Even VfD often does not get a lot of votes. In any case the prescribed procedure was followed and no consensus to delete was reached, so the picture was kept. If you think the policy is wrong, propose a change in the appropriate forum. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:27, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that in most cases votes of this nature are easily made and the concesensus is quickly reached 5-0 on VfD to delete or to keep, etc quickly show concensus and I don't bother to read the article and make an informed decision on whether I should vote and what that vote should be - just not enough time in the day. However, on a vote as close as this - and on an issue on which it is obvious there would be strong feelings both way - a longer vote time and more visibility would be wise in future situations.</dd>
<dd>I am a little calmed down on this issue today so I am going to think about this some more before I take a final position. I must say, however, that the intransigence of some on the inline compromise vs pushing the "everyone must see everything" POV has motivated me to be a more vigilant.</dd>
<dd>Wouldn't the talk page be the proper forum to start discussing whether the IfD vote should be reconsidered? I really am still pretty new and sometimes the formal and informal processes are difficult to navigate. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 14:57, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Additionaly, IMHO, one of wikipedia's great strenghts (and a potental source of weakness) is that decisions are very much decentralized (those that care about a topic know and vote on it due to the watch pages etc.) They are then quoted as precedent and, whether the logic was good or bad, is quickly revealed as it becomes more widely discussed. Weakness comes because those that are using the encyclopedia (or editing on a more sporadic basis) rarely vote or particpate on matters on which we really should have their input. What is the proper forum for bringing an issue that has potentially far reaching effects to a larger audience? The mailing list? Meta? Wikimediafoundation? <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 14:57, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was a little curt and dismissive in my comment earlier today, for which I apologise. I suppose the reason I'd oppose discussion of IfD reform on this page is the general principle that hard cases make bad law. Effectively we'd be looking at the few cases where a pretty good process arrives at decisions that some people decide is not appropriate.</p>
<p>I am sensitive to your concern about the fact that only more motivated people would be watching for deletions and whatnot, and that the more motivated people are anti-deletion on this issue (but not all-see Cantus and others, and of course it does take some considerable motivation to nominate an image for deletion in the first place). One of the reasons I gave for asking for Sannse's original poll on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> to have a decent deadline (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, six weeks in the future at the time I proposed it) was the possibility that the poll would be skewed if it had a shorter deadline, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a> had immediately previously been fussing around trying to create new policy pages with a view to marking certain images as objectionable by a VfD-like process. This got a lot of anti-censorship people interested.</li>

<dd>Thanks for this history - I need to review this to talk more intelligently <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 15:53, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The people who had <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> on their watchlist would probably be used to the image and not inclined to delete it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I wouldn't be adverse to a wider poll on the autofellatio image, in principle. As long as the deletion policy current on IfD was followed, requiring a rough consensus for deletion, I'd probably find such a poll acceptable. It should probably take place on IfD but be listed on one of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Wikipedia:Village Pump</a> pages.

<p>I agree that if Jimbo wants it deleted he will do so. He doesn't need people running around inventing new criteria for speedies. We had an IfD (see above) and this one survived. I was surprised. It's up for IfD again. I kinda think it would be nice to see if it survives a second time. Meantime Jimbo can do what he likes with it, but it isn't for us mortals to go around doing stuff because of our impression of his opinion on something. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:08, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The same vandal which made me accidentally delete the image - and the worst is that such double language redirects don't show in any "what links here" list. I know the image survived IfD, but I would have voted delete if I noticed it (I rarely monitor the delete discussions, too much traffic and too many trolls) - and am I the only one who suspects this porn image is actually a copyvio from an adult website?

<dd>the first time I saw this image, it was thumbnailed on AUtofellatio. I realize it is now linked to from there. Well, it is still illustrating what it's supposed to illustrate. Anybody caliming it must be desktop size to make its point is imo making clear that this is not about the image's information value at all, but for some sort of weird satisfaction to have WP host porn images. The vandalism we are talking about is not minor at all. People clicked on Gary Kasparov's article, and found their screen filled with this image.

For the record, I would be just as opposed to porn that I find appealing than to porn that I find disgusting, on Wikipedia, that's not the issue at all. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 20:13, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Can we stop talking about Gary Kasparov! I wouldn't want to see a picture of autofellatio when I clicked on <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Kasparov_66df.html" title="Gary Kasparov">Gary Kasparov</a>, nor would I want to see a picture of a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Caterpillar.html" title="Caterpillar">caterpillar</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>. There are some images that may be offensive out of context but are nonetheless relevant to a particular article. (I think some people would be much, much more offended to find <a href="../../../h/i/t/Image%7EHitler-car.jpg_8c22.html" title="Image:Hitler-car.jpg">this</a> adorning the Main Page as a result of vandalism.) The image is not the problem – if they don't have the autofellatio pic, the vandals could use a <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Flaccid_and_erect_human_penis.jpg" class="external text" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Flaccid_and_erect_human_penis.jpg" rel="nofollow">penis pic</a> or even <u>upload an offensive image of their choice</u>. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 20:21, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not sure why you're referring to relativism, dab--I'm no relativist. I'm just saying that in my opinion a few people getting worked up about a vandal putting an inappropriate picture on <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Kasparov_66df.html" title="Gary Kasparov">Gary Kasparov</a> doesn't seem to me a good reason to get rid of a perfectly useful, detailed picture illustrating autofellatio. I don't think Wikipedia is in danger of being regarded as a porn site. It's an encyclopedia. As to your opinions of pornography, they're neither here nor there--they don't really explain why you seem to be so dead against this picture. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:05, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
ok, so Gary Kasparov was beside the point. Nevertheless, this is where <i>most</i> people, numerically, have seen the image, because that's how it was linked to from the Main Page. I understand that the image illustrates autofellatio, and I'm not opposed to having an image doing that. the points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the image is also cheap porn. even this subject could be presented slightly more aesthetically</li>
<li>the image is a probable copyvio. its origin is unknown. yeah, some sockpuppet uploaded it, claiming to have made it himself, but such a claim is worthless. Usually, an image would be deleted on this ground alone</li>
<li>the image is very large, larger than it needs to be to make its point (even when it was inline on autofellatio, it did not appear in its full size</li>
<li>the image is used as a shock image in vandalism</li>
</ul>
<p>considering these points, we have to <i>weigh</i> the interests of Wikipedia. We are weighing illustrating an obscure article with a cheap, unaesthetic, copyvio'd image against having prominent articles vandalized with porn. Reducing the size of the image would be a <i>compromise</i>, both to address the copyright issue (fair use??), and the vandalism issue (less prominent shock value -- yeah, it could be blown up though), while still fulfilling its function. Maybe even if I am interested in an illustration of autofellatio, I don't care to see the penis at 300dpi, ever think of that. Additionally, the image could be converted to grayscale: the illustrative value will remain the same, while the shock value would be reduced. These are <i>suggestions</i> for <i>compromise</i>. You can argue the images benefit, but you <i>cannot</i> honestly ignore the problems it is causing. WP cannot be held hostage by your encyclopedic eagerness to illustrate autofellatio: you should be prepared to <i>compromise</i>: there is no reason the image has to remain in the exact same format in which it was uploaded. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:10, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>You're still talking about destroying the current image and replacing it by an inferior one. That isn't a compromise. As someone else pointed out, it won't achieve the object you think it will because the image can still be resized as large as the vandal wants. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:33, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm still suggesting replacing it with a <i>less offensive</i> one, and possibly a legal one. Your continued refusal to take the concerns over this image seriously, and your refusal to compromise seem insincere to me. This is not how Wikipedia works: good-faith editors should take each others priorities seriously, and attempt to work on a compromise.

<p>this has to stop, <i>now</i>. No matter how encyclopedic it may be, we are really shooting ourselves in the foot with this image. We need some sort of monitoring system telling us when this image is added to any article or talk page (as it is, we can watch articles, but we can not watch images being added.). Furthermore, this image particular image has to go, <i>now</i>. Host it somewhere private, and we can link to it in all its glory from the Autofellatio article, no harm done. It just won't do to keep it here to harass users away from WP. This is serious, people.

<dd>I'm trying to understand your logic, Hyacinth, so please correct me if I'm mistaken. Your premises are that 1) vandals want the image removed, and 2) we must do the opposite of what vandals want, even if it's not to our advantage. Your logical conclusion, therefore, is that we should not remove the image. I propose that your argument isn't entirely <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cogent" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cogent" rel="nofollow">cogent</a>, because 1) vandals clearly <i>love</i> the image, and if it is deleted will have to think of some other way of harassing us (which will no doubt be less effective), and 2) doing the opposite of what vandals want is acting on pure spite, and is by definition illogical: we need to do whats best for wikipedia, and ignore them entirely. That being said, I propose that (in part) because the image in question has made the lives of trolls a virtual field day lately, and because we should do what's best for Wikipedia, we should delete the image. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 00:21, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a> background: It's no secret that there are people who hate this image, whether or not it's useful in an article.

<dd>The vandalism, from what I've seen, has been almost exclusively on User_talk pages, with perhaps a couple very visible Main Page attacks. The vandalism has used some relatively sophistocated tactics, so the vandal is familiar with wikipedia. From my experience, vandalizing user talk pages is not the run-of-the-mill vandal's MO. It's obvious he/she wants to personally upset individual users. What would those people do when being exposed to an explicitly sexual picture out of context where they expected to find a comment for them? Obviously many would be surprised, angered, etc. I would be too.</dd>

<dd>Thus I think it's not a very large leap to say that the vandal is trying to get this image removed. Why should we not remove it? Because it has not been my experience that we should take vandalism into account when weighing pros and cons. The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> pictures are quite explicit too, should we delete them preemptively? How about <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>, <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulva.html" title="Vulva">vulva</a>, etc. Evaluating the merit of this image out of its context isn't appropriate, IMHO. This is a wiki, and there will be vandalism, and it angers me to no end – but we should try to stop the vandalism, not censor ourselves in the hopes of having less vandalism. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 00:54, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Another possibility is that the vandal wants to <i>keep</i> the image. So, he makes us think that he wants to make us <i>delete</i> it, and then out of spite we keep it.

<dd>In fact, IMO it's most probable that he just wants to make fun of us, and doesn't care <i>at all</i> whether the image is kept or not.

After all, what's so complicated about that particular act that isn't already conveyed both in the textual description and by the other drawing? This image is not exactly clinical in its nature, it adds very little to Wikipedia (very little that we want, at least), and is clearly a copyvio. The reasons for deleting it are plentiful, the reasons for keeping it are scarce: exactly the reasons that "goatse man" isn't keep here. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 01:51, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heya, Timbo. The only VfD I saw was a 9:9 tie back in January; was there another later on (I genuinely don't know). Now that this image has seen a broader audience, I think we have a more representative cross-section of the Wiki population interested. Perhaps we should just have another VfD, and see if the original results are repeated? Once its over, maybe we can finally put this thing to bed? – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 04:42, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I understand it fully, but I'm saying that it's not simply that this image is being used by the GNAA for trolling, it's (among other things) the degree to which it can, and is, being used. Plus, it's a copyvio. Plus, it's an illegal image in many nations. Plus, it's an image that many people reactly strongly and negatively to, in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> style. Plus, it contributes nothing to the common discourse that isn't already conveyed more than adequately in the parent article.

<dd>the image is not <i>necessary</i> for vandalism, but it <i>facilitates</i> vandalism. a vandal uploads goatse, it's deleted within the minute. But with this image, we have to grit our teeth and let the vandals have their way with it? I think not. You want to illustrate autofellatio? Provide a legal and less obtrusive image. We are not talking about kids writing PENIS on random articles. These are vandals doing us, and other Wikipedias, serious harm. I cannot at this point take seriously any editor arguing that <i>this</i> exact image should be kept. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:47, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>A vandal uploads goatse, we delete it (a click, a checkbox, type in reason, hit delete).</dd>
<dd>A vandal links this image from a page, and generally makes it obvious they're a vandal. Go to their contribs list, hit rollback, click special pages, scroll down, click block user, copy-paste their name, type something about autofellatio.jpg vandalism, click block. go over to their talk page, give them the test5 message. Either way, it's not <i>that</i> much of a pain to deal with. Especially since in that kind of blatent vandalism, when shock images are involved, they can't claim they aren't a vandal.</dd>
<dd>Note that none of the above applies to other potential reasons to delete this image, e.g. that it's a copyvio if it turns out that it's not the original work of the author. Those issues apply no different than to any other image of uncertain copyright status. <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pak</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">aran</a> 15:30, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, even if the image is a copyvio or not, the image is still being used for vandalism. My page was hit, and so was 30 others on the 25th, and this is not the first time it was done. I am not going to say wether or not this image should be gone, but this image needs a close eye on it. Plus, (this is my POV) if the image was deleted, I am sure someone on here or the GNAA or whoever they are will just add it back again. This is going to be just one fight in this never ending war. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 04:07, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This image would be a clearly pornographic image in Germany (where I am from) and it would be beyond question illegal (and Germany is not a country with very restricting laws regarding sexuality). I am much wondering how it can be that in a land, which considers something like "Nipplegate" as a big scandal, there is so low opposition against an image like this. It adds nothing to the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a> article what can't be imagined by the people reading the article or can be shown with a schematic drawing (for people with very low imagination). It just affects people protesting against the image and I can not imagine that this ever will stop, because there will always be people being offended by this image. It's a Pandora's box of protests. Even if you feel there is no compelling necessity to delete this, consider if it is an essential information without which the article looses completeness. Offending people is not a thing, which is positive or a goal of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlomox_be02.html" title="User:Slomox">::Slomox</a> <a href="../../../s/l/o/User_talk%7ESlomox_5638.html" title="User talk:Slomox">&gt;&lt;</a> 01:42, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is really shocking that such an image would be in the Wikipedia. I am a user of the Spanish Wikipedia, my user page was vandalized yesterday and I found myself suddenly in front of a porno image of some poor guy trying to suck his own dick. I am gay and I do porn, so don't even try to call me prude. But there is a time and a <b>PLACE</b> for such things and Wikipedia is <b>NOT IT</b>. What kind of encyclopaedia is this? Would this picture be in the Bitish Encyclopaedia? Should it? This picture has not the quality and probably is copyrighted. Don’t you have any <b>TASTE</b>?</p>
<p>I have been reading the discussions about the picture and have the impression that most people that are in favour either don’t care about the opinion of others or want to shock. Even a fork or an alert to avoid seeing the image directly is not acceptable. Well this is a <b>COLLABORATIVE</b> encyclopaedia, not a place to shock people nor to ignore the sensibilities of other.</p>
<p>For the people defending this picture as <i>illustrative</i>. Should we put also some porn pic on the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a> article? A small porn film would be even better! And now that we are on this road, why don’t we illustrate <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> with <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Stryker_240e.html" title="Jeff Stryker">Jeff Stryker</a> bumping the shit out of Paulik? That would be ILLUSTRATIVE. But why stop here, we have loads of articles without pictures… what about <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">zoophilia</a>? Yes I’d love to see some chick bumped by a dog! What do I say a dog, by a horse! People need to see it is possible! And next? Child porn, torture, cannibalism, scat? Where do you stop? How far do I go until you are shocked?</p>
<p>Now the argument will be: <i>the image was voted and it stays!</i> OK, so a small majority didn’t find it offensive? Well, I’ll tell my friends from the "Bump Your Dog Club" to come here and vote on the bestiality thing. We NEED a small film to illustrate the article. And if someone doesn’t want to see it or is offended, he shouldn’t come to the Wikipedia!</p>
<p>And then there is the <i>censorship</i> thing. Freedom of speech is not absolute. If I say that the vandal that redirected my talk page is a S*O*B, that is not freedom of speech. It is not even accepted on the Wikipedia. There is a thing many people forget or even laugh at: <b>RESPECT</b>. You should respect other peoples beliefs and sensibilities. If you think autofellatio should have an illustration, so be it, but try to offend the smallest number of people. See <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">zoophilia</a> for example. And that is just <b>COMMON SENSE</b>. It looks like if there is no law against, it’s allowed and even should be done! And don’t try to stop it, you nave no right. If people had more common sense and more RESPECT for the opinion of other we might need a lot less laws. We wouldn’t need all those laws prohibiting porn and stuff because they wouldn’t be necessary. Everyone would be doing their stuff without offending the rest. Download the image on your hard drive and j.o. on it, but don’t make me see it.</p>
<p><b>If you don’t abuse your rights, you might keep them</b>, the important part being <b>ABUSE</b>. How long do you think will it take until enough people are offended by this image and delete it, and maybe not just that, but delete all images that have remotely to do with nudity or sex and even ban them from the Wikipedia? Then of course I'll see you crying about censorship and so on. I hope you know most countries in the world (including USA) have laws against porn. Are we risking the whole project because of an ugly image? And you want to distribute this encyclopaedia in Third World Countries? <b>How self-centered can you get?</b> Of course, there will be people saying it is worth the risk, we have to fight, but think about what we (the world) could loose because of a petty war (Free porn??) that’s not Wikipedia’s to fight.</p>
<p>It is really pathetic that some <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a> has put a porn image on the Wikipedia and we have to spend our time discussing if this is the place for it. Have a nice day and to all those voting to keep the pic, I hope you have fun with your image. You won't be seeing me here in a looong time --84.161.52.94 08:56, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK again, I've changed the image to a neutral Wikipedia image. The original image is not available to me, nor do I care for it. Somebody vandalized the Wikipedia home page by putting the original image into the Vanilla Ninja featured article blurb.

<dd>The cat picture should be deleted entirely. It does not belong on Wikipedia, and most certainly not under this name or in this place. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonito_3133.html" title="User:Monito">Monito</a> 2 July 2005 20:27 (UTC)

<dd>sure, I was saying that "Autofellatio.jpg" was deleted by IFD, and I protected because people kept uploading nonsense and/or pornography under the name. Anything uploaded to this title should be considered a speedy, unless there is some really good explanation. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 5 July 2005 15:15 (UTC)</dd>
