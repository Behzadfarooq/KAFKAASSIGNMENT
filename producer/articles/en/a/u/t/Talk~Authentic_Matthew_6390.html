<p>I am seeking to find an agreed solution to this article. The last VfD had a delete majority, but narrowly no consensus to delete. That must stand. However, according to precedent that still leaves merge, move or redirect as legitimate options. I am thus canvassing the views of interested editors.</p>
<p>Please note. Much of the original material has already been merged elsewhere. Origins of Matthew's gospel are discussed under <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a>. <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a> has its own article. No New Testament commentary or Bible Dictionary, to my knowledge, refers to a document called 'authentic Matthew'. The name is POV.

<dd>Quite right, and as I said. The result of "no consensus" is "keep (no consensus)" as there is never, at present, a "delete (no consensus)." My point is that discussion can continue. Moreover, the point is that the VfD <i>considered deletion rather than the proposal of merging</i>, so it does not represent a substantial discussion on the proposal, made by Doc and me, of merging this article's contents with <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Kirby_9469.html" title="User:Peter Kirby">Peter Kirby</a> 07:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has been pointed out to me that this is a poor translation.

<p>That is, the text that Jerome says many consider to be the original one of Matthew is the same as the "Gospel of the Hebrews," is it not?</p>
<p>I found the Latin text. "In evangelio quo utuntur Nazaraeni et Ebionitae, quod nuper in Graecum de Hebraeo sermone transtulimus, et quod vocatur a plerisque Matthaei authenticum, homo iste qui aridam habet manum caementarius scribitur istius modi vocibus auxilium precans: Caementarius eram, manibus victum quaeritans. precor te, Iesu, ut mihi restituas sanitatem, ne turpiter mendicem cibos." Translation: "In the gospel which the Nazoraeans and Ebionites use, which we recently translated from Hebrew speech into Greek, and which is called by many the authentic [gospel] of Matthew, this man who has the dry hand is written to be a mason, praying for help with words of this kind: I was a mason, seeking a livelihood with my hands. I pray, Jesus, that you restore health to me, lest I disgracefully beg food." I do not believe that <i>Matthaei authenticum</i> is presented as a title but rather as an assertion, i.e., that Jerome reports that many people believe this to the original text written by Matthew. This text is commonly known by scholars as the "Gospel of the Hebrews" (<i>evangelium quod Hebraeorum</i> in Jerome, On Isaiah, preface to book 18 and Jerome, on Isaiah 4, commentary on Isaiah 11:2; <i>Hebraico evangelio secundum Matthaeum</i> in Jerome, commentary on Psalm 135; <i>evangelio quod iuxta Hebraeos scriptum</i> in On Isaiah 11, commentary on Isaiah 40:9; <i>evangelio quod appellatur secundum Hebraeos</i> in On Matthew 1, commentary on Matthew 6:11; <i>Evangelium quod appellatur secundum Hebraeos</i> in On Famous Men 2). My first preference is to merge this page with <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>, since <i>Gospel of the Hebrews</i> is the term used in English-language scholarship.

<p>Great work, Peter. As you probably know <b>Epiphanius</b>, who was born about 300 C.E. and was Bishop of Salamis, published the following in the Panarion: They have the <b>Gospel of Matthew</b> complete in Hebrew, for this gospel was preserved among them as it was first written in Hebrew script. . .They too accept the <b>Gospel of Matthew</b>, and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the <b>Gospel of the Hebrews</b>, for in truth Matthew alone in the New Testament expounded and declared the Gospel in Hebrew using Hebrew script.</p>

<dd>If he is right, then there is only one Hebrew Gospel and that would mean Authentic Matthew is the Gospel of the Hebrews. Care to comment Peter.

Jerome writes in <i>Illustrious Men</i> that Matthew, also called Levi, who used to be a tax collector and later an apostle, composed the Gospel of Christ, which was first published in Judea in Hebrew script for the sake of those of the circumcision who believed. This Gospel was afterwards translated into Greek (and the Greek has been lost) though by what author uncertain. The Hebrew original has been preserved to this present day in the library of Caesarea, which Pamphilus diligently gathered. I have also had the opportunity of having this volume transcribed for me by the Nazarenes of Beroea, Syria, who use it.</p>
<p>In <i>Against Pelagius</i> Jerome writes "In the Gospel of the Hebrews, written in the Chaldee and Syriac language but in Hebrew script, and used by the Nazarenes to this day (I mean the Gospel of the Apostles, or, as it is generally maintained, the Gospel of Matthew, a copy of which is in the library at Caesarea)..."</p>
<p>Thus what the Church Fathers are saying is that there is only one Hebrew Gospel which was written by Matthew and often called the Gospel of the Hebrews, because it was popular among Hebrew Christians. This was different from the so called Greek Gospel of Matthew that made it into the canon.</p>
<p>Even I have trouble believing them, but I do believe that what they wrote should be reflected this article ( and if necessary rebutted). (Note the French scholars J.Carmignac and M.Dubarle have contributed to this thesis.) --<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoorman_c727.html" title="User:Poorman">Poorman</a> 07:01, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that the references from Jerome and the other patristic writers suggest that the title of this work was commonly the <i>Gospel of the Hebrews</i>, and, moreover, this is certainly the title current among scholars today.

Can we have page refs, so that those with access to the literature can verify or otherwise?

<dd>wayyyyy ahead of you! I've found an Amazon Search Inside for the one, and some more info for the others. I've also added a "critique of" book which will no doubt be worth checking out as it will challenge that other writer's facts. So you can check the one book right away. I couldn't find "<i>The Gospel Before Mark</i>" on Amazon, and that strikes me as very suspicious as they list a million fragillion rare and out-of-print books, even ones without ISBNs. I'll have a look around some other places for it later, but I'm wondering if the name is either wrong or, heaven forbid, it's fake. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 00:46, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a>, this is useful, but you are slightly missing my point. That these books exist, I don't doubt. In fact, I've read both Streeter and Brown in the past. My question is, what do they actualy say about Jerome and 'Authentic Matthew'? Do they metion it at all? Do they back up all the assertions of this article? This is one of the weaknesses of WP - you can chuck a lot of refs to books at the bottom of things - and it is unlikely anyone will ever check that they actually back up the article. These are not books on 'Authentic Matthew' not even on 'real canonical' Matthew, so if they say anything it will be an aside. We need chapter and verse - and we need someone to get down to a university library and confirm it. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 01:04, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to the library tomorrow and can check both Brown and Streeter. Pierson Parker's <i>The Gospel before Mark</i> exists and was published in 1953 by the University of Chicago Press, but no library I currently have access to has a copy. I read through <i>Birth of the Messiah</i> in its entirety only a few months ago, and it certainly does not agree with the ideas advanced by this article. Brown might have something to say about Jerome's authentic Matthew theory. Ideally it would be good to know exactly what parts of this article are based on which books, and specific page references would also be helpful. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 01:19, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No I saw the point, but my solution is the best I can do without travelling out to Massey and reading the books myself (no time). With the Search Inside you can probably find that info right now, but unfortunately it's only the one book.&#160;:( <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:46, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Reply:</b> Good point! R.E. Brown, 1997 <i>Introduction to the New Testament</i> N.Y. Doubleday studies both sides to the debate. On pages 208 to 210 he explains that the majority of Biblical scholars agree that Canonical Matthew was not written by Matthew but is a much later composition written in Greek.</p>
<p>Brown makes three observations that point to an origional Hebrew Gospel of Matthew:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) In antiquity there was a Hebrew Gospel used by Jewish Christians. Jerome and others believed it to be the Semetic origional.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Although contested, some scholars firmly believe in <b>Matthaei authenticum</b> (see G.E. Howard 1987 <i>The Gospel of Matthew according to a Primitive Hebrew Text</i> GA:Mercer)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) Still other scholars say they can reconstruct <b>Matthaei authenticum</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yet Brown points out problems with <b>Matthaei authenticum</b> and ends by saying, whether some where in the history of Matthew's sources, one of the twelve [Matthew]played a role we cannot know. However it would not be prudent for scholarship, 1900 years later, to facilely dismiss as complete fiction or ignorance the affirmation of those ancient spokemen of long ago.</p>

<p>I checked several of the references and found about what I was expecting. Brown's <i>Introduction to the New Testament</i> on page 209-10 reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The canonical Gospel exists in Greek – was Papias referring to a Semitic original from which it was translated? Three different observations point us in that direction. In antiquity there was a Jewish gospel probably in Aramaic used by Palestinian Christians and associated by the Church Fathers with Nazarean (or Nazorean) Jewish Christians, especially in the Aleppo area of Syria. References to this gospel related it closely to Matt; Jerome claimed that he translated it into Greek and at times he treats it almost as if it were the Semitic original behind Matt. … The vast majority of scholars, however, contend that the Gospel we know as Matt was composed originally in Greek and is not a translation of a Semitic original.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Brown here is quite clearly talking about the theories already well covered in the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a> article. He nowhere uses the phrase "Authentic Matthew" or "Matthaei authenticum." In <i>The Birth of the Messiah</i> Brown does not even mention Jerome's authentic Matthew statement, and nowhere mentions a theory of an "Authentic Matthew." He does go into a detailed discussion of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_primacy.html" title="Aramaic primacy">Aramaic primacy</a>, but again only links these theories to the notion of a <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a>.</p>
<p>I then went to Howard's <i>The Gospel of Matthew according to a Primitive Hebrew Text.</i> The primitive text in question is a fourteenth century Hebrew version of Matthew by Shem-Tob. Howard's thesis is that this version is not a translation from the Greek or Latin, but rather a copy of an original Hebrew version of Matthew that had been passed down through the centuries. On page 197 he does compare this text to Jerome's writings:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jerome makes reference to a Hebrew Matthew and to a Gospel according to the Hebrews in such a way as to be unclear as to whether these are one and the same. … Jerome writes: “In the Gospel…which is called the authentic text of Matthew by a good many”… There are many other references in Jerome and elsewhere but further citation of these would be of little benefit. The fact is that the quotations from the so-called Hebrew Matthew, the Gospel of the Hebrews, the Gospel of the Nazoreans, the Gospel of the Ebionites, or the Gospel of the Twelve Apostles mentioned in early church writings, yield little evidence of relationship to Shem-Tob’s Matthew.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Howard mentions a comprehensive list of five different names that have been used to describe primitive Matthews, and Authentic Matthew is not one of them. Based on these references I think that merging and redirecting is the right course. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 14:55, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
