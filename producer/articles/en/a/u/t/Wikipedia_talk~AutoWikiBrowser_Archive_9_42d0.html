<h2><span class="mw-headline">%%key%% in Add New Category</span></h2>
<p>I noticed this feature in the latest version and wanted to comment on it. I edit primarily ship articles, and a feature like this would be extremely useful for me. Is there a way to configure it to do things other than reversing names? If it's not configurable I'd like to suggest that in future versions, it recognize and format common ship article names.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Quadrant_%28G11%29_1a92.html" title="HMS Quadrant (G11)">HMS Quadrant (G11)</a> should be categorized as <i>|Quadrant (G11)</i> and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Enterprise_%28CVN-65%29_23c2.html" title="USS Enterprise (CVN-65)">USS Enterprise (CVN-65)</a> should be categorized as <i>|Enterprise (CVN-65)</i>. For countries other than the US and UK, ship articles generally have titles like this: <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_battleship_Dunkerque_a4bd.html" title="French battleship Dunkerque">French battleship Dunkerque</a>. In those cases, they should be categorized as <i>|Dunkerque, French battleship</i> or simply <i>|Dunkerque</i>.</p>
<p>I imagine the latter would be harder to implement, but if a future version of AWB could format HMS and USS in categories, that would be very helpful! <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 14:45, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find myself notifying around a user per week to not use AWB for trivial things. I would suggest that one should make the text at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html#Rules_of_use" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser#Rules of use</a> a bit more specific when refering to trivial edits. How about:</p>

<dd>I tried to modify it a while ago. I would like new users to have to make a statement that they agree not to use AWB to just move stub tags. A popup at the start would be great too.

<dd>I can't explain how annoying this is for me, I work so hard to make the software, then a small number of people just use it for such stupid things. I don't think putting lots of examples of things not to do is a good idea, as it makes it seem like everything else is ok (plus, sometimes just converting html to unicode is ok, when there is a lot of it). When I have warned people not to use it for trivial edits most of them do just change thier behaviour, and on the 2 occasions they haven't I have simply removed their name from the list of users. I was considering a zero tolerance approach, but I thought that might be a bit too tough. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 09:34, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not so sure about the 500--&gt;1000 approach, but I agree something must be done. <b>I think education is the key.</b> I think these users signed up for AWB...and they're not sure what to do with it. I have been thinking of setting up some place, like a job fair, for work that needs AWB. Any user can go there and post their job. An AWB user can select a job, put in <b>Accepted</b> and work at it. I'm not sure how popular this would be, but I like the idea =P. Perhaps then we can implement the 1000 edit thing. Wikipedia needs AWB, and we need to make it easy for people to get work done with it, even if they're not the ones behind the controls. --<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 10:16, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree that decentralization is cumbersome, but you've got to realize that people are using AWB <i>like a bot</i>. Like "oooo, let's increase my edit count by moving whitespace on all of Wikipedia." Let's increase the requirement for AWB to 1000 edits, and make them state one (just one) legitimate use they plan (that'd force them to read about AWB, which would force them to read about whitespace moves).</dd>

<dd>Thanks Martin. I monitored it for the rest of the run, and what seemed to happen was that it went up to 650MB mem usage, then purged some of its cache or whatever and settled back to about 500MB. When it reached 650 again, it purged again, and so on. Still horrendously greedy, but at least it wasn't growing forever!

<p>This is a different perspective, but I feel I should express it. It is my strong opinion that nobody <i>should ever</i> modify my non-article posts in any way (asides from legal and matters of the general community), whether they be my userpage or my talk posts. If I spelled something some way in a post, that's probably the way I meant to say it. Please think first before running around and making spelling corrections to non-mainspace. A lot of people really don't appreciate it.

<p>I want to tag talk pages with WikiProject templates so that the articles will be listed in the unassessed categories for Wikipedia 1.0. An example run is on <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the talk page has no {{<a href="../../../b/i/o/Template%7EBioWikiProject_aff8.html" title="Template:BioWikiProject">BioWikiProject</a>}} template, or is currently a redlink, add {{BioWikiProject|living=yes|class=|importance==}}</li>
<li>If the page contains {{BioWikiProject}} or {{BioWikiProject|.*}} but not "living=yes", add the "living=yes" parameter</li>
<li>If the page contains {{<a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp_8ef7.html" title="Template:Blp">Blp</a>}} remove that template, because {{BioWikiProject|living=yes}} is a replacement for it</li>
</ul>
<p>The net result would be all Living People articles would have the {{<a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp_8ef7.html" title="Template:Blp">Blp</a>}} warning and would be in <a href="../../../u/n/a/Category%7EUnassessed_biography_articles_2b2d.html" title="Category:Unassessed biography articles">Category:Unassessed biography articles</a> from where Mathbot can pick them up.

<dd>Yes, indeed, absolutely tremendous, thanks mate. There's one slight issue (probably more of a design feature than a bug) - when selecting multiple categories and then running "Add selected to list from category" the operation gets aborted if one of the selected categories is empty. It would be helpful if AWB could distinguish between an empty category and an unpopulated category, and simply ignore the latter. It's not really an error and it's a bit annoying having to cancel the make list operation and deselect the offending category, then run the operation again.

<dd>You can't…this is deliberate, the only thing that can affect that pane is AWB itself. If it were possible to lock it down completely to avoid random clicks and stuff, that would likely be even better.

<dd>Sometimes, it would be convenient to copy text from the "current revision" side that has been changed by automated processing and isn't in the edit box any longer. Example: I saw a typo fix suggested and it looked like the word that was going to be replaced might be correct in British vs. American, so I was going to copy it and paste it into a dictionary to check. (Of course, I was wrong anyway.) The other thing is just me being lazy, if I want to copy the name of the article to paste into my regular (non-AWB) session, it is just tempting to grab it from the top of the preview, but yes, I could get that another way. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian_G_f919.html" title="User talk:Brian G">Talk</a>) 15:27, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bug when recovering settings file</span></h2>
<p>AWB fails to recover certain items from a settings file properly. If you set up an advanced replacement with a single space in the "with" field, the space gets saved but is not loaded:</p>
<pre>
        &lt;rule name="underscore fix" type="0" enabled="True"&gt;
          &lt;regex /&gt;
          &lt;replace&gt;_+&lt;/replace&gt;
          &lt;with&gt; &lt;/with&gt;
        &lt;/rule&gt;
</pre>
<p>For some reason this appears to inactivate the replacement, so instead of replacing the "from" text with nothing, it is just ignored.</p>
<p>Oh, and before anybody says, replacing it with &amp;32; is <b>not</b>acceptable in this context (templates and links).

<dd>Hacker info: .Net Framework object System.Xml.XmlTextReader in Rule.ReadFromXml() has WhitespaceHandling set to WhitespaceHandling.None, XmlTextReader.ReadElementContentAsString() thus ignores the space. XmlTextReader must be set to WhitespaceHandling.All. I'm currently looking into how that's best done. It can be fixed locally by doing something like:</dd>

<pre>
          WhitespaceHandling saved_wh = rd.WhitespaceHandling;

          rd.WhitespaceHandling = saved_wh;

<p>Firstly, this problem happens when I bring up the find and replace page – I don't know what the problem is (to do with the checkboxes not showing), and it could well be me and not the actual software – any idea how to fix it? Secondly, would it be possible to make an option to turn the auto-mode (bot mode) delay <b>off</b> completely?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Skin</span></h2>
<p>I have made a skin that makes awb browsing easier. It is at <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeMoney_AWB.css_e624.html" title="User:GeorgeMoney/AWB.css">User:GeorgeMoney/AWB.css</a>. It removes a bunch of useless links and stuff (why have navigation links, etc.. if you can't click them? ). To use it put the following in <a href="../../../m/y/p/Special%7EMypage_monobook.js_193b.html" title="Special:Mypage/monobook.js">your monobook.<b>js</b></a> (if IE isn't your default browser):</p>
<pre>
var isIE=((self.navigator.appName).indexOf("Microsoft"));
if (!isIE) {
document.write('&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;@import "/w/index.php?title=User:GeorgeMoney/AWB.css&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/css";&lt;/style&gt;');
document.write('&lt;body onselectstart="return false" ondragstart="return false"');
}
</pre>
<p>.</p>
<p>I would like to make this skin a public AWB project to make developing it easier.</p>
<p>Also, there brings up the problem of people who actually <i>use</i> IE, because they will have the AWB skin as default. I think AWB should modify the info into something like "AutoWikiBrowser" and then for the code we can have "((self.navigator.appName).indexOf("AutoWikiBrowser"))" instead.</p>

<dd>Inuyasha redirects to InuYasha. So, unless the redirect is going to be deleted, I would suggest to leave it. I read somewhere (I think on a page about popups fixing redirects) that it takes 10,000 clicks of a redirect link to be equevilant to the server load of fixing the redirect. If you are also doing other stuff like cleanup and <a href="../../../r/e/t/WP%7ERETF_8b67.html" title="WP:RETF">retf</a> then you can fix the redirect.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feature Request: Scheduled Bot Mode</span></h2>
<p>I realize that this might be controversial. My AWB bot does some really basic functions that might be better achieved on a routine schedule. To be honest, it's getting a bit annoying to go through the routine series of clicks that I need in order to run my bot. That's not to say that I won't continue to run my bot, but I'd like some way to keep it running during a vacation or the like. Obviously, it could easily be blocked (or stopped via a talk page message) if it started acting up. Here's what I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to click the "Start the Process" button at a scheduled time on a daily basis.</li>
<li>The ability to create some sort of a macro to automate a series of routine clicks.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problem creating list of dab pages</span></h2>
<p>I think I am having trouble getting a complete list of {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}}. I am trying to see which disambiguation pages are not in {{<a href="../../../h/n/d/Template%7EHndis_2459.html" title="Template:Hndis">hndis</a>}} with the thought of then going through and changing some of them from disambig to hndis where it is appropriate to do so. I tried to make a list from <a href="../../../d/i/s/Category%7EDisambiguation_7fff.html" title="Category:Disambiguation">Category:Disambiguation</a> and another list from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_ambiguous_human_names_5f95.html" title="Category:Lists of ambiguous human names">Category:Lists of ambiguous human names</a>. I saved them both and launched list comparer. I expected that there would be many names which were only in disambig and a smaller number that were in both lists, but none in hndis only, since the hndis template puts it in both. Oddly, almost 800 of them show up as being only in hndis. I checked some of them manually, and they show up in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Category%7EDisambiguation_7fff.html" title="Category:Disambiguation">Category:Disambiguation</a>, but are not being added to the list by AWB. Am I doing something wrong? I can give more details or examples if you want.

<p>It would be great if there were a page on which folks could list spelling mistakes that are frequently made, e.g. paticularly ... particularly so that AWB could regularly be used to start at the top of the list and hunt them down and change them. Of course it should only list DEFINITE errors, not humour/humor etc. The list would become ever longer and would have to be subdivided every so often (eventually by first letter I imagine). - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 11:00, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self Checking Mode</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Would it be possible to implement a mode in AWB, that you can leave it to check articles for changes automatically, then save it into a second list that the user can go through and check the edits? (Not to make the changes - this would be 'BOT Mode')</p>
<p>As it would be useful for it to go through and do all the relevant checks, and then be presented with a list to work through. this would be good for when you want to leave your pc to say check 2000 articles</p>
<p>Would it be possible?</p>
<p>I think from a coding point of view, that it must only be a case of having a second list box thing, and that if a change is detected, then the article name is added to the 2nd list. This list could be hidden, and then at the end of the process, this be added to the main list for the user to go through</p>

<dd>Running the database scanner on my computer for the full database takes 12 minutes to search for articles containing a text string so it is certainly a very useful tool. Can the RegexTypoFix checking capability in AutoWikiBrowser be put into the Database Scanner to find articles that FIRST match other criteria but then fail RegexTypoFix? The list can then be imported into AutoWikiBrowser. Also, it would be useful if articles can be identified in Database Scanner that can be corrected by the "General" section in the (2) Set Options tag (in "or" mode, not "and" mode). I know that AutoWikiBrowser is not supposed to be used for simple fixes on articles that can be cleaned up by the "General" section only. However, it is usually the same articles that require that automated cleanup that require a lot of other work and it would be useful if Database Scanner can be upgraded to find those articles. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkapur_f77a.html" title="User:Skapur">Skapur</a> 20:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Martin: Here's what I discovered about your image commenting out/replacement:</p>
<ol>
<li>It works great for all images with no or one wikilink in the caption, and images with no captions.</li>
<li>It only replaces the first instance of a picture on the page.</li>
<li>Once you try to comment out or remove an image with two or more wikilinks in the caption, you can't use the image feature ever again, even after reinstalling AWB, as every time you try to comment out or remove an image a message pops up saying "startIndex must be less than length of string. Parameter name: startIndex".</li>

Putting stubs at the very end has a number of advantages; It means the stub category is listed last (least important categories should go last), it means the stub tag is less likely to become adjoined to the preceding text (as stubs need a double space before them, not sure why), it is a good idea to put maintenance tags either at the very beginning or very end of an article (i.e. out of the permanent text/meta data), and stub tags are meant to be unobtrusive, after all, they are on over half of all articles, I think they are most unobtrusive at the very end of an article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AWB library?</span></h2>
<p>Martin, I was wondering - since you're apparently undertaking a major rewrite of AWB internals anyway - how much work would be involved in exposing AWB functionality as a library and if you'd be willing to do it? Or is it already done?</p>
<p>I was thinking that if I could write my own bot around an AWB framework I could do such cool things as place properly parameterised WikiProject templates on article talk pages based on what categories the article is in. {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}}, for example, has parameters for workgroup (royalty, politics, etc), whether the person is living or not (<a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a>), and the class of the article (i.e. stub categories). Thoughts? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:07, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The WikiFunctions.dll file exposes a lot of the functionality I have made. Though rather than writing your own bot, it would probably be easier to write a method/class to do the job you want and then insert it into the existing code, it would be pretty simple to do, I do it quite often to do a complicated task. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 18:27, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Prepending to talk pages</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, me again, but as my bot (<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingbotk_68c3.html" title="User:Kingbotk">Kingbotk</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKingbotk_d00a.html" title="User talk:Kingbotk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kingbotk_e154.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kingbotk">contribs</a>)) has now done over 130,000 edits with AWB I guess it's inevitable I should have a few things to say :)</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to add parameterised {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}} templates to talk pages</li>
<li>Some talk pages won't have the template, or will be redlinked</li>
<li>Some talk pages will have the template with no parameters at all</li>
<li>Some will have it with empty parameters only</li>
<li>Some will have set parameters</li>
</ol>
<p>I can probably handle cases 3-5 with regular expressions. The difficulty I'm having is in case 2. There's no conditional statement for the append/prepend feature, is there? I can skip articles, of course, if they contain a certain regexp, but that necessitates a second run.</p>
<p>So, I'm thinking, we need one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional code for the append/prepend feature (append/prepend if contains/doesn't contain a regexp) -- probably best</li>
<li>The ability to manipulate the append/prepend text using the find/replace feature and tokens -- e.g. if the talk page already contains WPBiography|living=yes, add living=yes to the prepend text)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thoughts? Am I missing a should-be-obvious way to achieve my goal? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:46, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The advanced find and replace does selective ignore if does/deosn't contain as well as other stuff, combined with regexes it could possibly be done using that. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Another possibility which is really quite easy to implement - there's plenty of examples on the web - is plugins.

<dd>Well it wasn't <i>that</i> simple but i have made a plugin feature now. To use it you need to make a class library project, reference the WikiFunctions.dll file, implement the IAWBPlugin interface, add your code (the values available at the moment are the article text, title, and a referenced value indicating whether to skip the article or not), then compile it and put the dll in the AWB folder. I'm not sure if that sounds simple, but from a users point of view it really couldn't be much easier. I'll upload an example project tomorrow that can easily be changed. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 23:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

Interestingly, I didn't need to do such a thing yet again. Therefore I wasn't yet so inclined to describe everything. But you could take a look at the code. However, writing code is sometimes easier than understanding code of others :). --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gulp - you sound like you might be offended. My sincere apologies if you are! I really didn't mean to cause any offence. I can see that the advanced/find replace is a very powerful feature, it's just that the docs are a bit hard to follow :) As for understanding other people's code, I sometimes have trouble understanding my own :) Advanced template migrations, by the way, are exactly what I'm wanting to do. For example:
<ul>
<li>If {{<a href="../../../b/i/o/Template%7EBioWikiProject_aff8.html" title="Template:BioWikiProject">BioWikiProject</a>}} exists, replace it with {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}}</li>
<li>If neither exists, add {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}}</li>
<li>If living= parameter exists retain it, otherwise add empty param</li>
<li>If class= parameter exists and has a value, retain it, otherwise set class=Stub and add auto=yes</li>
<li>Set military-work-group=yes</li>
<li>If other set params exist, retain them, if they're empty remove them</li>
</ul>

<dd>Not yet mate, but I'm planning too - VS is open right now :). I'm hoping I can code all of the different scenarios in (it's worth doing as the biography articles on Wikipedia are in 6 figures) and then be able to save the settings along with the AWB settings. (Which reminds me, I'm not sure if this a job for the plugin author, for AWB, or for both (probably for both), but being able to turn the plugin on and off (and save that in the settings) would be convenient. Then the same installation of AWB can be used for multiple jobs concurrently. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:29, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;- reindent. I've added VB instructions to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_Plugins_9efd.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Plugins">Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Plugins</a>.</p>
<p>A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>My first reaction when loading up the AWB DLL in the Object Browser was "where the hell is the plugin interface"? :) I'd recommend using namespaces. A great thing about namespaces is that they can span multiple libraries and executables, and even span programming languages. I'd put the .exe and the .dll inside a namespace of e.g. AWB and then have something like the following:
<ul>
<li>AWB</li>
<li>AWB.DatabaseScanner</li>
<li>AWB.IRC</li>
<li>AWB.API</li>
<li>AWB.API.Plugins (put the plugins interface and any code intended for plugins to call here)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Import those namespaces and the code should compile without any further changes (unless you've been using fully qualified references).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It would be handy beyond belief if the plugin had access to settings: if it got notified of changes in settings and if the plugin's settings got stored along with AWB's settings. Scenario: I have two instances of AWB running, both using my one-plugin-does-all DLL, but doing different jobs based on the settings I've stored in the AWB XML settings file. This might be implemented by events, perhaps? However it's done ought to be fairly trivial, it's simply passing objects around.</li>
<li>Access to the menu bar or at least a plugins submenu (would work a treat if the plugin has access to settings too). It would be very nifty if the plugin could add a tab to the set options/more options/start area, that way it could display it's settings and status and the operator can be comfortable that everything is going as it's intended :)</li>
<li>Display the plugins installed in the About Box. Details can be acquired through reflection or through mandatory properties in the plugin interface</li>
<li>All the above are quite trivial. A bit harder, but tremendously useful, would be if the AWB library file exposed any useful worker routines it has so that the plugin can tap into the power of AWB. (Maybe they're already exposed and just need to be organised into namespaces).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pretty good at object model design so I'll endeavour to get the source downloaded today or tommorow and see if I can help with any of this stuff. Unfortunately I don't use C# but I don't suppose it will be too hard to pick up as I can write Unix shell scripts/PHP/a little Java.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm going to have a play. This is all quite exciting and it promises to be a killer feature :) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:27, 26 August 2006 (UTC) (edit conflict)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The wikifunctions.dll already exposes loads of stuff, it's just not very well organised, I've improved it now. I had already made a menu option that can enable/disable and display the installed plugins, i hadn't enabled it just yet. Also, I have added a method called initialise to the interface, and takes a form, a menu item and a context menu as parameters. It will be called once when the plugin loads. hhhmm, all this should be enough for someone to make a really cool disambiguation tool. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 10:22, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I was thinking that you could cast the form as the awb form and then have access to everything, but on reflection it's probably not such a good idea, and requires another reference to the awb exe. What i will do is pass more objects, such as the list maker and the webcontrol (so you can then access the html directly, which would resolve your problem below). What other objects would be useful? maybe the textbox. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:11, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The exe is awb specific stuff, the dll is stuff that can be shared. I decided that exposing the exe members would be asking for trouble, and certainly pretty poor OOP practice. I suppose that part of the problem is that AWB was not designed from the ground up to do certain things, i.e. accept plugins, so some things are not always done in the best possible way, but i think over all just passing a few object references to the plugins is fairly satisfactory, and safe. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 14:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not good practice for a traditional executable/shared libraries scenario, granted, but this is kind of different. A plugin kind of latches onto the application (some folks call them "extensions" after all) so I don't think there's any great harm in having it reference the exe if that would be helpful :) That said, it's perfectly fine to have the application be in charge of the plugin, and for the DLL to ask the plugin what services it needs (as you've done with that new init routine) or indeed for the interface to define events that the plugin can raise when it wants something.</dd>

<li>Give the plugin access to the settings</li>

<p>Have the values be passed by reference. Let the plugin create the menu item object (and other objects where applicable), just have AWB check it's not an empty reference (don't throw an error, just ignore empty objects). Looks like you're sending the Plugins menu to the plugin, then creating a menu item for the plugin locally, without giving the plugin a reference to that object? Instead, let theplugin supply you with a listmenuitem object, and you add it to the menu and enable it if the plugin is enabled. Then the plugin can <i>trap its own events</i>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:58, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was looking at the C# code and I see that you call the plugins before calling AWB's code. I wonder if it might be better to call the plugin last? The idea, of course, is for the plugins to do what <i>AWB can't do</i>, not for them to reinvent the wheel. So, if AWB has already decided to skip the article, for example, the plugin needn't be called, or the plugin can receive the article text as already processed by AWB. Thoughts?</dd>

<dd>My rules zoo thing has the benefit that rules can be sorted by the user. A plugin rule would in fact be a class of rules (a new type of rules per plugin). The user could then instantiate multiple rules as needed (with differing settings). Rules can be subrules, which means they are only applied to the article text if the conditional criteria of all parent rules are met. So the rules dialog is a bit like a reciepe. I don't think storing/reading to XML would present much of a problem as long as element names can be agreed on over all plugins (no plugin should have the same name as any other plugin). The rules are stored like the rule tree of the dialog and each rule in the XML forms its own compartement. But the whole rule thing might well be overkill anyway ;-). Maybe I should finally start doing some server side coding. PHP is just not my home turf. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 15:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thank you Martin for moving the plugin call to after AWB has done it's work. I'm wondering now if ProcessArticle() ought to have a boolean argument which tells the plugin whether AWB has changed the articletext in any way? Otherwise the plugin might tell AWB to skip an article which has been changed. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:40, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not know if this could be accomplished by a plug in. I really like Google toolbar spell check. If AutoWikiBrowser can invoke this, it would help a lot when cleaning up articles.

<dd>It would probably be a good idea to think of this as an alpha feature for now. When the interface is stable and somebody (hopefully me!) has got a plugin running and doing good work, we could probably set up a plugin section where people can share their code and ask for plugins to be written. It might help free up Martin a bit too!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tip - Disappearing space on C:</span></h2>
<p>This might be worthy of a mention on the project page.</p>
<p>Since I started using AWB in anger, free space on C: has become an issue. I cleared 2GB of space and soon that was gone too. I searched for large files, cleared my internet cache regularly, but still the drive would be full. Well, exploring in Cygwin it would seem that IE creates a sh*tload of files in the Temporary Internet Files folder which <i>don't get cleared even if you tell IE to clear it's cache</i>. What's more, they're hidden in Explorer even if you have it configured to show hidden files. Why they would do this I don't know - it's slightly sinister if you ask me - but, anyway, if you find that C: is gobbling up the gigs with no apparent cause this might be it.</p>
<p>It's covered in more detail <a href="http://www.mcse.ms/archive56-2004-5-718712.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mcse.ms/archive56-2004-5-718712.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The best tip seems to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start, click Run, type the following command and click OK:</li>
</ul>

<dd>Shell:Cache\Content.IE5</dd>

<dd>I haven't noticed a problem, but if it does does exist for some people it will only become noticed if they were doing 10s of 1000s of edits. The cache would probably clear itself after a period of time anyway, unless there is a massive flaw in how internet explorer works. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 10:49, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd call 386,156 files in <i>just one</i> of the subfolders - having clicked "clear cache" multiple times - a massive flaw! I'm only part of the way through clearing this crud and I've clawed back <i>gigabytes</i>. This is insane!

<dd>But it should be noted that your bot has made enourmous number of edits in a relatively short period of time, for the average user doing a few 1000 edits this will never be an issue. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 11:09, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not that I'm blaming you Martin (unless you work on the MSIE team :)) but I think that a "clear cache" button which leaves several gigs of cached files in place, to the extent that a user's C drive is full and programs start crashing, is quite manifestly broken. Perhaps we'll have to agree to disagree on this point :) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:38, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For me clearing the cache of IE (in IE) clears "Shell:Cache\Content.IE5" (accessed by the procedure you've shown above). On a second note, AWB just uses the BrowserControl which is shared with IE. So we are rather bound to that with all the drawbacks/bugs. If you can provide a better control for browsing (or refer to one) or a tweak to the AWB code, you are of course very welcome :-). --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 08:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">(Hopefully very easy) feature request</span></h2>
<p>Hi Martin: can you create a way to add the contents of first-level subcategories to the article list? For example: when you make a list from a category, you get all the pages in the category plus the subcategories as part of the list. Do you think it would be possible to be able to double-click on the category in the list of articles to add the contents of that category to the list? Or something of the like...? It would be much easier than copy/paste, especially if you wanted the pages in all the subcategories of something with a huge amount of subcategories, such as <a href="../../../s/a/i/Category%7ESaints_by_country_0414.html" title="Category:Saints by country">Category:Saints by country</a>. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets<small>501</small></a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 21:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reading and writing AML settings is a possibility, actually changing the AWB settings in a definite no. Having the "HasChanged" variable would be tricky, I know things like that look easy but they are not, largely because it is fundamentally against how AWB works, i.e. if you are doing job x, then the article either needs job x doing (so save it) or it doesn't (so ignore it), also, anything that is done with find+replace wuithin AWB can be done easily in the plugin anyway. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:50, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm going to be a pain in the arse now and suggest that - given your (well argued) line about moving all work to the plugin and not using AWB's skip/find/replace features at all, the code which calls the plugin ought to be moved back to where it was :) i.e. AWB gets article text, sends it to plugin for processing, and if plugin says skip that's the job done. What do you think?</p>
<p>I took your advice by the way and moved my "skip this article" regex into the plugin. I hardly need worry about AWB settings now, it's all blank settings except for "make from file" and an edit summary of "Bot". --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:51, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you're the only person making a plugin, so i don't see the harm in moving it back. Also, I have added 3 methods to the interface for reading/writing XML and reseting the settings.

<p>When categories have been foolishly placed in the middle of text it seems that their removal leads to extra carriage returns being inserted.

<p>1) can this be implemented: change from i.e. [laser|lasery] to [laser]y ? to simplify the links</p>
<p>2) why can't general fixes/unicodify (like removing underscores) be done (by AWB) before "find and replace" ? this causes a need of consideration all unicode/special characters into the regexes used into "find and replace" (special wikipedia's characters can't be matched by "find" until you know them exactly, but it's hard to cosider them everywhere!) <a href="../../../../pl/g/r/e/wikipedysta%7Egregul_f03c.html" class="extiw" title="pl:wikipedysta:gregul">gregul</a></p>

<p>I thought my plugin had a bug, because it was skipping red-link talk pages. However, in debugging mode I found nothing wrong... then noticed that when I click "Auto save" AWB then automatically checks "Skip articles when no change made", which for some reason is causing those pages to skip.</p>
<p>I've no idea why AWB would auto-check "Skip articles when no change made" but if there's no vital reason for doing so could you turn that off pse Martin? :) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could your bot also stop being 'helpful' with categories? I am getting sick of reverting that three or four times a day. To get categories sorted alphabetically you often need to place them above templates, but your bot keeps moving them back to the bottom (which ends up giving me a mish-mashed order). <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 23:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well it's done for now. I understand what your saying about categories, it raises two interesting points a. how should categories be ordered, and b. what to do about transcluded categories. The first has been thrashed out, and the conclusion reaced that alpahbetical order is not necessarily best (AWB used to order categories). The second is more probelmatical, I believe, for example that <i>in general</i> maintainance categories (and hence templates) should go after normal categories - and I thnk this is widely supported in principle. On the other hand it is common practice to put cleanup and wikify right at the top of articles. One off the things that AWB does in its general options is to put interwiki at the end, and non-trancluded categories immediately before, so I will copy part of your comment and this reply onto the AWB talk page for discussion. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 09:43 <a href="../../../3/1/_/31_August_0960.html" title="31 August">31 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</dd>
<dd>Alphabetical sorting isn't best in my opinion, sorting by relevance/priority is better. Yes, that does raise the point that transcluded maintenace categories will be first if the template is at the top of the page but c'est la vie... convention is to put those templates at the top of the page and that's not AWB's fault. It's quite simply not an AWB issue. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
