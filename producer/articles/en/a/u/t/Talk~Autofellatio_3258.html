<p>On <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Phuc_Phan_Thi_2b98.html" title="Kim Phuc Phan Thi">Kim Phuc Phan Thi</a>, we have a picture of a little girl fleeing naked her firebombed village, having sustained horrific burns. I really think that this would, and should, be more shocking to children than a drawing of a guy sucking his own penis.

<dd>I don't know about him, but I'D suggest that this is just as an important, if not MORE important picture for illustrating this article as a girl fleeing a bomb is to evidence an article like that.

<dd>I reckon that pornography, as defined by US courts, implies that the drawing (or film, etc.) is meant to stimulate sexual desire. In which way is this drawing meant to stimulate sexual desire? Do you really think that many people would get sexually excited by looking at it?</dd>
<dd>When it comes to "little children", my appreciation is that most little children are not interested in sexual drawings. Interest in such matters seems to come later. So, if one is frank, one should say "think of young teenagers", but not "think of little children". Then, whether or not young teenagers should have access to material describing sexual acts in a non-pornographic manner is another problem. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 16:16, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The definition of "Pornography" seems to be a very blury line. If a very good sex-related image can be provided, it might certainly be as valuable as an hisotircal photograph, yes, why not ? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 16:19, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could we agree on something? You seem to say that shocking photographs may be included on Wikipedia if they have some redeeming character — like, if they are informational, or illustrate some point poignantly. (Note: on the strict aspect of being informational, the photo on <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a> is more informative than the photo of the little girl fleeing the firebombing — it's near impossible to imagine what a clitoris/vulva looks like without having seen one, whereas one can imagine a running little girl pretty easily. This photograph's redeeming character should rather be its poignant. But, being poignant is being shocking in a certain way, isn't it?) Am I correct? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 16:56, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently no, we can't agree on something. It is shocking that this particular self-suck photo has such a devoted coterie of protectors, unashamed to advance the most peculiar sophistry in their desire to safeguard it. But that's the way it is. I don't think Wikipedia is particularly well-served by those unable to distinguish between important and unimportant illustrations. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 17:02, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're discussing a <i>drawing</i>, not a <i>photograph</i> here. Besides, I'm personally not a big fan of the autofellatio drawing (since autofellatio is something that can be easily imagined; there does not seem to be as much of a need of a drawing as, say, a photograph to illustrate <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>). I'd thus be happy if you did not lump me with people supporting the inclusion of the photograph.</dd>
<dd>However, I'm trying to see what the rules should be. Clearly, we already have non-sexual material that could be shocking to little children (I'd say that a naked little girl crying because of large and nearly fatal burns is much worse in that respect that a drawing of a fellatio, but maybe that's me). I'm trying to see the criteria that we should use.</dd>
<dd>One thing I'm concerned about is that different cultures have different definitions of what constitutes inappropriate content. If we begin to cater to the conservative Christians (and, specifically, American Christians), who seem to have a problem with sexuality (and, especially, sexual acts outside of straight intercourse), we will have a problem later when trying to explain why we won't cater to the prohibitions of some other groups. For instance, <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faithfuls</a> are opposed to us having a picture of their prophet <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> — because it shocks <i>them</i>.</dd>
<dd>Sticking to the legal norms applicable in the jurisdiction where the servers are located is one good method. We cannot be accused of unfairness if we ban content that could expose us to litigation. And, according to those same legal norms, much, if not all, of what is denounced as "pornography" on Wikipedia isn't pornography. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 17:20, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was discussing the photo. You may be discussing the picture. I am glad that you do not equate that particular photo with that of Kim Phuc. We cater a great deal to various groups: we have, for example, no drawing of the Prophet Muhammad on his page (apparently we care more about Islamic norms than Bahai sensibilities); we do not reveal sacred Mormon words such as "Pay Lay Ale" — and we could count on them being excised rather quickly if we added them. Legal norms are not designed to build an encyclopedia, and while trying to get the most offensive images one can while staying within the law seems to have become a rather fun WIkipedia sport of late, it's not the way to build a good reference work. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 17:42, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>YOu seem to think that there is something inherently negative about this particular sexual subject, and that this negativity takes the form or either insignificance, or potential harm for children (note that the two are on the erge of being contradictory).

<dd>I respectfully add that while the drawing is tasteful and was produced with the intention of instruction, the photograph is gratuitous. Though I am very liberal when it comes to pornography, I don't think it belongs in this particular venue. The drawing is sufficent to illustrate the article. -- 70.59.113.223 01:16, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is an old debate, but I just read it. Mostly for the benefit of others coming along I would like to note that of course Nunh-huh's above views represent the majority feeling on matters of this kind in Wikipedia. If you are newish to the project, don't be misled by the fact that debates like this are usually stacked against the reasonable voice. These topics attract their own set of boosters and the impression will be given on a Talk page like this that their view is dominant throughout the project.

<dd>I don't see anything arrogant about it. JDG does not seem to be dismissing anyone's opinion, he is just expressing a belief that the pool of people debating any particular article is not necesarily representative of the entire communities views. He is also asserting that the community-at-large would tend to have a less favorable opinion of the image/photo than those that participate in the discussion here.

<dd>I want to see the photo deleted, but only because I think it's a lousy representation of autofellatio. One could argue that *any* representation is better than none at all, and we don't really have people lining up offering to pose for a new photo, but that doesn't change the fact that the photo really isn't that great. Also, I'd like to oppose any placement of the drawing on the basis of "decency". That's, IMO, always a bad reason to do things in articles. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 07:27, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I didn't want to clutter up the voting page with this, so I figured it would best be discussed here. The following arguments for deleting the picture (as I understand them) are:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It's pornographic</li>
<li>It's unnecessary and unencyclopedic</li>
<li>Someone could stumble upon it at the work place</li>
<li>It is being used to vandalize</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to point out that Merriam-Webster's definition of pornography is "material that depicts erotic behavior and is intended to cause sexual excitement". It further defines erotic to be "of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire". The image is clearly not intended to cause sexual excitement, and it is not devoted to arousing sexual love or desire. Conclusion: It is <b>NOT</b> pornographic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the second arguement, I will counter-argue that Wikipedia shouldn't be running on necessity — nothing should. If we have the opportunity to a <i>non-copyrighted</i> image, then we should take it. It is not unencyclopedic either, because this is a contortionist act that some believe to be impossible. Having an image (rather than a drawing with unrealistic genitals), shows that it can be done and further shows how much contortion is involved (the man's back bends incredibly!). Conclusion: It is indeed an encyclopedic asset to Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No one in their right mind (unless having the intention of getting themselves or a coworker fired) would search for autofellatio on the internet at the workplace. Even if they somehow stumbled upon the article accidentally (which is a near impossibility), they would have to click on the link to view the image in question. Conclusion: No one that doesn't want to see the image will see the image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many images are being used to vandalize Wikipedia. Removing valuable media from the encyclopedia because of vandalism only encourages vandals, and hurts the encylopedia even more than the vandals do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons to keep it:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It is a well-done image of a healthy and handsome man performing the act. The man doesn't have unusual genitals either, making it even more realistic.</li>
<li>It is free of copyright problems</li>
<li>It is indeed encylopedic because it proves an act of contortion to be possible and further exhibits how it is done</li>
<li>You have to click on the link to see the image. This means that people who don't want to see it, <b>will not see it.</b> For those that are curious as to how it is done, they can have access to it. When people find something useful on Wikipedia that isn't found elsewhere (i.e. a tasteful, non-pornographic image of auto-fellatio), it gives Wikipedia a better reputation—something that I believe is very well needed. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserk798_e247.html" title="User:Berserk798">Berserk798</a> 02:48, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, well put. I'm astonished not just by the homophobia, but by the male-centeredness in the discussion at IfD. Several people say "who needs it, it's obvious!"

<dd>These very silly homophiles are going to bring down Wikipedia if left unchecked. I devote time here because I believe we are building a serious reference work. If this seriousness continues to be undermined by this childishness you can be sure most of the best contributors will drift away. Is there a current effort to delete this and similar junk? If so, where? <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 08:05, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've read the newbie tutorial, "Be Bold". But you have a nice article here, and a lot of people discussing an image show how great is their investment in the topic.</p>
<p>So I have put an opening remark, an advert of radical ideas about the religious significance of autofellatio, by a long experiencer in the domain, a primary source, me, off in a user:GlennScheper page, twice removed from the article I would influence; and will set this note here only once removed. My personal web page has more than a few attempts to start a thorough exposition, especially the one in web page .../oldword.htm</p>
<p>Some of you who watch this topic, let me know which parts of my concepts would be welcome here. Indeed, perhaps the bizarre religious twist, akin to David Lorton's article, and the Ouroboros speculation, deserve removal to some sub-topic or side-topic.</p>

<p>"Few human males are both sufficiently "well-endowed" and flexible enough to perform the extreme front bend required -- though increased flexibility achieved via various activities such as gymnastics and yoga might make the difference for some."</p>
<p>Well, after quite a bit of training, I can now perform auto fellatio. However, with a penis size of below 6 inches, I could not by any stretch of the imagination describe myself as "well-endowed". I don't use a "front-bend" method either. I lie on my back and bring my body in towards me, so my legs are often going up almost vertically against the wall at my back. Its the position you'd take if you wanted to, for example, ejaculate down into your own mouth.</p>
<p>The part about being "well-endowed" seems factually wrong, or at least a poor (ie very subjective) choice of words. Flexibilty is the main factor. Also, the topic seems to imply that this front-bend method is the only way. I've tried the front-bend but cannot quite do it. Bringing my penis in towards me from above, with my neck and back extremely curved, I can. I don't know if I'm an exception here.</p>
<p>Cheers though. A nice article to find, but I think it needs some clarification.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm no <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contortionist.html" title="Contortionist">contortionist</a>, but I think the position you describe is still a frontbend. You've just rotated your body. Perhaps some rewording would be helpful though, since I've also found that a position with the penis coming down to the mouth is more successful than one with the mouth coming down to the penis. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 03:22, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If it's still called a front-bend in that position, fair enough. You're right, it's mostly just a case of rotation and getting gravity to assist a bit.</p>
<p>As for the other point, I wouldn't consider myself well-edowed, and I can still do it, so that line at the start just seems wrong unless I'm just the "exception to the rule". I doubt that I am, though.</p>

<dd>I'd say people's flexibility varies just as much as the length of their penis.

<p>Look, this is absurd. We're building an encyclopaedia - the only relevant question should be "Is it of encyclopaedic worth?". The photo clearly adds value to the page and should be included.

<dd>Speaking to its encylopedic worth, we already have an illustration that depicts autofellatio perfectly well. In my opinion, the photograph is un-necessary, gratuitous, and obscene. It does nothing to enlighten on this subject matter, especially given the illustration, and has no inherent noteworthiness, as some "famous" photographs do. Mulling it over, I can find no reason for the image to exist on the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathogen1014_60b5.html" title="User:Pathogen1014">Pathogen</a> 08:12, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you are referring to the drawing, I have to disagree with you on this point. All drawings which we have seen on this page so far looked like there was simply errors in proportions, and I have reasons to think that making a convincing one will prove extremely difficult. A photograph does not have these drawbacks; I also fail to understand how a photograph should be more "obscene" than a drawing. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 08:38, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that's just it, you fail to understand. Whittling it down to an "error in proportion" is an oversimplification of the issue, which in my view happens to be quite laughable. I suppose I had better get to work providing photographs that illuminate the issue of castration, projectile vomit, Tubgirl, and bullet exit wounds, in the name of accuracy. Inquiring minds want to know, after all. In my view there is such a thing as good taste when it comes to the encyclopedia, which in my opinion the photograph leaves far behind, not to mention intrinsic encyclopedic value, of which this photograph has none.</dd>

<dd>I am perfectly fine with the entry and the illustration, though I find the fact that the article uses a commercial pornography website as an authoritative site on the issue to be very telling as to the spirit and intention of the article on the whole. I hope you'll at least agree that most people would find the photograph outrageous, even for an open content site. Pretending there's no difference between a drawing of something and an actual photo of it also seems extremely weak on a logical level, also. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathogen1014_60b5.html" title="User:Pathogen1014">Pathogen</a> 19:06, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you need to step back a bit. Wikipedia contains all manner of images, and in general we don't censor them. Good taste is a whole different matter, and what you see as distasteful and "outrageous" will not be the same as what others see as (dis)tasteful or "outrageous". The spirit and intention of the article are to inform encyclopaedically, no more and no less. We don't censor images here because kids might see them, or because they might be offensive to some of our readers. We discourage outright pornography or gratuitous depictions of sexuality and nudity, neither of which covers this image. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 19:14, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could've fooled me, judging by this situation as a whole. Also, addressing what I think of things and what other people think of things; if I want to see photographs of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_mutilation.html" title="Genital mutilation">Genital mutilation</a>, that doesn't automatically make my opinion worthy of being respected above others. I think YOU need to step back a bit and realize that the photograph is really pushing the line. I can tolerate a lot of stuff, even the photo of fellatio on the according page, but I, and I'm willing to wager a lot of others, find the idea that this photograph has encyclopedic value to be as close to ludicrous as this site ever comes.</p>
<p>I guess I'd better get to work cataloguing photographs for the shock site section, in the interest of accuracy. What's that you say? Un-necessary? Then how will we ever know what tubgirl really is? I need to know specifics!

<dl>
<dd>The difference is that there is at least some historical context behind the photograph, dating from a time when society was much less sexually open. Meanwhile, the autofellatio photograph provides no context whatsoever, and has no value as an inherently special photograph. To be blunt, it's just a guy sucking on his own cock. I don't believe it educates or informs in any encyclopedic way. Especially, again considering that there is already an illustration. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathogen1014_60b5.html" title="User:Pathogen1014">Pathogen</a> 20:44, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

From what I read above, I would have to take it as you think that an illustration has to talk of several things at the same time to be a good one, and that something dealing specifically with the subject is not. No "context" is needed for a photograph of autofellatio, but a convincing showing of the position and movements certainly would have some value.</dd>
<dd>As for the present illustration, once again, I a not satisfied with this drawing.

<p>Meh. Personally, I'd say the image at fellatio is less encyclopaedic than this one. The fact that it's black and white doesn't make it any less blatantly sexual. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 22:39, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Much of what I am seeing here is merely a concentrated effort to dodge the issues I have brought up. Quite frankly, I see nothing other than my own self-restraint preventing me from posting a tubgirl pic on the appropriate article, and moreover I see no consideration of the fact that my posting of such a picture would lead to Wikipedia being used as a shock site in and of itself, for one additional problem--as has occurred with this picture, thanks to vandals within Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not arguing that the fellatio image is less sexual, but at the very least it provides some purpose. For another thing I could easily see where someone would be offended enough by it to campaign for its removal, much as is being done here time and time again. Personally I would be willing to entertain such a campaign, but that's beside the point.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what is your position on an attempt to photographically document genital mutilation, explosive diarrhea, or any number of other similarly graphic subjects? Quite frankly, I see no attitude here that can prevent me or someone else from doing that, while still defending a photograph like the one we are talking about. I would like to know what constitutes this photograph as being non-obscene in nature. From what I am seeing, using the same standards I could defend a photograph of a cum-shot or a Cleveland steamer.</p>
<p>My main point is that the photograph is highly graphic and by just about all recognized standards obscene, and to compound that problem, is not needed, nor is it particularly enlightening in any special way (aside from the miniscule particulars of positioning, which in my opinion hardly warrant the photograph to begin with). Combining this with the circumstancial evidence of the article linking to a simple commercial porn site, it seems to drag down any pretense of encyclopedic legitimacy that the article currently clings to.</p>
<p>Further, it is a favorite of vandals, and speaking frankly, is an easy piece of ammunition for trolls to cause trouble throughout the internet. Do you think it is worth having this picture, if it might well lead to libraries, ISPs, and other access terminals blocking some or all of Wikipedia? Do you not have any concerns that Wikipedia's ascendance as a serious piece of academic work will be halted and slowed by material of the photograph's nature, when people see it and react accordingly? --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathogen1014_60b5.html" title="User:Pathogen1014">Pathogen</a> 00:00, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

We may have a problem later if 50 other sites get linked, but for now, I think the link adds to the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 16:09, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with the sentiment -- (expanding on my edit comment): whether AC is hypothetical or not is for the AC article to deal with, whether AC is hypothetical or not, it is the analogue for women and so nothing is being lost by removing extraneous adjectives. Furthermore it is slightly more neutral if we simply state the fact that AC is the analogue on this page, and leave out the speculation. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 03:35, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't tried it myself, but he gives what appears to be good advice. It's easier to do if you're flexible and have a larger penis. Do yoga and work out, be careful not to strain your back when you're in the throes of sexual excitement. He gives some links to mostly non-sexual resources on flexibility and contortionism. Oh, and he reckons it might help if you buy his videos to see how it's done. :)</dd>

<p>It's been pointed out repeatedly that people who come to this page are researching autofelatio.. I was not. I came to this page following a link from a wikipedians against censorship page. I got there from a user page, and there from the talk page on the wikipedia page on the Shiloh Shephard Dog...</p>
<p>I was a bit shocked there was even a drawing, much less a link to the photograph.. Admittedly, that probably speaks more to my culture and expectations of wikipedia than to the actual encyclopedic value of the images.. Unfortunately, i do think it can be used as amunition against wikipedia etc..</p>
<p>All those who have sought to remove it tho, should take note of one thing. I would never have seen it, if there hadn't been any effort to remove it. And if I was in fact researching auto-felatio, i suspect that I would have been all the more grateful(considering my culture) that the information is accessible.</p>
<p>My experience demonstrates a wider phenomenon. If you really want to minimize the exposure of any particular content on wikipedia, consider that the most effective way is probably to say nothing about it at all.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.110.114.227 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.110.114.227_cbff.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.110.114.227">contribs</a>) 23:08, July 23, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>In my opinion the Autofellatio image box looks terrible, since it overlaps the "References in fiction" box. I think the photograph does add something to the article, in that it is fairly solid proof that the act can be acomplished, but the "naughy image box" wrecks the layout.

<p>As far as I can tell, this "bad image list" was created in order to prevent certain images being used to vandalise user pages. As far as I can tell, this system was created with little or no discussion, and is now being used to censor Wikipedia. Removing an image from the list will eventually cause it to reappear in place of the inline link--I did this with the image on Prince Albert piercing, which was placed on the list against consensus on the talk page to leave the image in the article, and without telling anyone. I strongly suggest that as many people as possible strongly object to this "bad image list." <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:24, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The consensus was to link it because displaying the image is needlessly shocking. Serious general references works do not tend to display photographs of sexual acts. We want to be considered a serious general reference work. Showing the image would be harmful to our mission, simple as that. It is not "censorship", it is simply an editorial decision. No government or dictator has forced its removal, so the term censorship is misleading. Putting the image behind one single click harms no one. People who wish to read a mainstream article about the practice can do so without having the image thrust upon them. People who wish to see it may click to do so. I strongly suggest we accept the wisdom of this, stop arguing about it, and get on with making improvements. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not shocking in the context of an article about autofellatio. Keeping it as a linkimage is simply prudish and appeases people with certain <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_of_the_children.html" title="Think of the children">moral/religious</a> objections to such content. Let me ask: Do you object to the pictures in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a>, <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulva.html" title="Vulva">Vulva</a> etc? The fact of the matter is that it is not our responsibility to look after the children of others. If kids can't handle the images they shouldn't be allowed by their parents/school to browse wikipedia, or the web in general (which is often far more graphic) unsupervised. People reading an article about autofellatio at work are old enough to know what kind of risks they are taking.</dd>

<dd>A far more elegant technical solution to the vandal problem would be to make a special category of images that can only be used in specified articles, requiring an admin (or a user in good standing, not in the newest 2% and with over 200 edits) to add to the list of articles allowed to use the image. This could be done with minimal server load increase by using a special image template with the check builtin instead of complicating the standard image template. // <a href="../../../n/n/p/User%7ENnp_9b58.html" title="User:Nnp">Nnp</a> 22:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The image can be shocking even in an article about autofellatio for two reasons. The first is that some people will hear or see the term and not know what the term means, and they will look it up here to find out. Therefore, they cannot know in advance to expect a photo. The second reason is that most people have an expectation that a serious reference work would not show such a picture. To answer your question about pictures at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> and <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulva.html" title="Vulva">vulva</a>, I do not personally find photos there offensive if they are clinical in nature, However, if they are shown in a titilating context, then I would find them offensive to include in an encyclopedia. Others may find even the clinical photos offensive. They should be able to express that view wihtout being called prudish. You go off on a tangent about protecting children. No one claimed it is our responsibility to protect them, but that doensn't mean we have to shock them or their parents deliberately. Just because we can't guarantee that no vandal will upload objectionable content does not mean we should deliberately chose to include objectionable content. We have control over our own actions and we can use our own editorial judgement. Again, your point about people knowing what they are getting into is not valid since not everyone will be familiar with the term beforehand. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say a lot closer. However, that is based on my opinion that sexual preference as presented in both academic and popular lore is grossly misrepresented. I consider the object capable of arousing sexual feelings to reside on an axis of perceived ontological proximity:</dd>

<ol>
<li>Object much different from self - heterosexuality</li>
<li>Object less different from self - homosexuality</li>
<li>Object not different from self - autosexuality</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As fellatio is a more encompassing and intimate sexual practice than manual stimulation (of one self or a partner), it takes more in respect of capacity for self-loving to autofellate than to masturbate. People with a diminished capacity for self-love will, this is my guess, be prone to phantasizing when masturbating, thus distancing themselves from their own self. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 22:09, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>thanks for the POV, yes you're pretty right, this one is a common view. actually i was thinking about the extreme (final) purpose, refering to automasturbation, I think selfloving/autosexuality (or narcissism) is entirely part of homosexuality since homo/self/auto are synonyms (and the same entity in this particular case). also self/auto love/sexuality excludes the other side (male/female) -just like in the Narciss myth- but contains the own (homo/auto are the same here) side that's why i think automasturbation as well as autofellatio are (phantasizing aspect apart - homosexual act can be done with hetero phantasizing i guess, and phantasizing about the other side's organ can be possible in autofellatio if you know what i mean) true "physical homosexuality". don't you agree meco? 213.228.0.86 22:24, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apart from a prominent contamination of most sexual behavior with neurotic content, which tends to obfuscate the picture, I'd say you highlight some highly significant correspondences. However, I'd go beyond your wording of describing autofellatio/automasturbation as "true 'physical homosexuality'", refering to my previously outlined threestep evolutionary scheme. Meaning auto, when realized in a trancendent experience (altered state), would to some extent integrate the opposite gender identity with the single-gender self (where <i>homo<b>s</b></i> would not). Glenn Scheper also elaborates on this aspect of the phenomenon. (And, btw, I assert the resident neurotic content was what triggered Scheper's psychoses when he entered a higher level of consciousness for an extended period.) __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 23:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>the information has been suppressed by whom? oh, right, the victorians. here's the thing: to make a claim like this, one needs some evidence that such vandalisms did in fact take place. if the diary of some victorian egyptologist records the destruction of a painting of autofellatio, then there are grounds for supposing that there were more; without something like that, this is no more than empty speculation. 65.95.37.193 20:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do respect the viewpoint you profess, however, I believe it may not be that simple. I quote from the introduction to the <b>Entheogen</b> article:</dd>
</dl>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The word <b>entheogen</b> is a modern term derived from two Ancient Greek words, ἔνθεος (<i>entheos</i>) and γενέσθαι (<i>genesthai</i>). <i>Entheos</i> literally means "god (theos) within", more freely translated "inspired". The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. <i>Genesthai</i> means "to cause to be" or <i>becoming</i>. So an entheogen is "that which causes God (or godly inspiration) to be within a person".</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<dl>
<dd>Normally the word <i>entheogen</i> is applied only to psychoactive substances, however, the article itself lists a notable exception of the Christian Eucharist often being named an entheogen by some. Also, I have aired my use of the term in the current article on the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Talk%7EEntheogen_cb20.html#New_section_proposal_-_.22Modern_Entheogens.22" title="Talk:Entheogen">Entheogen talk page</a> some two and a half months ago having heard no objections or comments to this use thus far.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, while you may argue that the way the term is used in the current article is a watering-out of the term, I find it the best describing word for the spiritual applications and the results that allegedly may arise from them which are being elaborated on in <b>Autofellatio</b>. I cannot see any alternative term that would provide an equally meaningful emphasis.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having written the above I now read your second paragraph which I more strongly disagree with. A religious practice <b>does not</b> have to be linked with any organized or labelled religion. A relgious practice may be an intensely personal, private experience, with no links to peopled organizations. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 08:09, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entheogen.html" title="Entheogen">entheogen</a>: Ethymology cannot be taken for definition (example: "demagogy"). An encyclopedia is not a proper place to practice "my use of the term"; we should stick to well-established use. An encyclopedia may <b>mention</b> exceptional uses of terms (your example of Christian Eucharist, that meaning a substance for ingestion is less exceptional than your use), but it should <b>use</b> their normal meanings. If you want to modify common use of the term, use it your way in your published works - if you do it well enough, maybe this will change the common use and make its way to secondary sources and encyclopedias. But you should not insert "your use" (which differs from normal use as you admit) directly into Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a right place to propose a new usage of a term.</dd>

<dd>About <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>: religion is always a social phenomenon; it is more than a personal conviction no matter how deep. See the article about religion - no one of religions mentioned there practices autofellatio. A notable "religious behaviour or experience" should appear in at least one notable religion. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 07:27, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article we have on <i>religion</i> emphasizes the diversity of definitions and perspectives one may take towards this, and although "a religion" certainly is contained in your definition, "religious behavior and experience" most certainly isn't.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for your opinion on the use of the word entheogen in the article, I can see the rationale of your argument, but, this word is a neologism and again, I will assert that "an entheogen" narrows the possible uses of the word when contrasted with its application as an adjective which is how it is used in this article.</dd>

<dd>What do you mean by "is contained in your definition"? I do not propose "my definitions", I insist that Wikipedia should use words in their established meanings. "Religious behavior and experience" should occur in context of some religion - you should prove that such a religion exists.

<dd>But that is exactly where we disagree. You assert that use of the adjective "religious" must be traceable back to an organized (and named) religion whereas I claim that a person may very well exercise religious behavior and have religious experiences without these being derived from the community of <i>a religion</i>. I also claim that my interpretation is supported in our article on <i>religion</i> which you have previously called in reference. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 06:57, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article on <i>religion</i> does not support your view that can exist a personal and private "religious practice" which is not practiced in any religion. On contrary, the article reads: "Religion is a system of social coherence based on a common group of beliefs or attitudes concerning an object, person, unseen being, or system of thought considered to be supernatural, sacred, divine or highest truth, and the moral codes, practices, values, institutions, and rituals associated with such belief or system of thought. It is sometimes used interchangeably with "faith" or "belief system", but is more socially defined than that of personal convictions."</dd>
<dd>No matter how seriously one can take any of his activities, these are not religious activities if these are not connected with a religion. Example: a person is extremely interested in knitting, practices it often and considers this the most holy and meaningful activity. Nevertheless this does not justify saying "knitting is a religious practice" in Wikipedia article about knitting. There are many people who are very fond of football, collecting stamps, automobiles... whatever, but we do not label these hobbies "religious" in respective Wikipedia articles. Why should a kind of masturbation be an exception? <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 12:41, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"In summary, it may be said that almost every known <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> involves the religious in the above sense of a depth dimension in cultural experiences at all levels — a push, whether ill-defined or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscious.html" title="Conscious">conscious</a>, toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behaviour are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form.

<dd>1. I do acknowledge individual's relationship with God, but in every religion there are also social and cultural aspects. You can see the cultural aspects also in the quotes you chose. Without these cultural aspects there is no religion, just personal beliefs, behaviours and feelings.</dd>
<dd>2. My quote was not "out of context", this is the very beginning of the article on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> and a summary of it. It does not exclude the New Age movement which is also a social phenomenon. Note that no similar movements of autofellators exist. Instances of individual spirituality are "religious" if they are connected with a religion.</dd>
<dd>3. You did not answer my question: why should a kind of masturbation be called religious if other activities of similar significance for some people are not called religious?</dd>
<dd>4. You have not found any reliable sources which would mention autofellatio as a religious behaviour or experience, or would apply the adjective "entheogenic" to it. Some university textbook on religions, a scientific monography, a peer-reviewed journal would do. Wikipedia is not a place to express unsupported personal opinions. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 19:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for references to this highly esoteric perspective, Glenn Scheper's web is linked. When you describe this practices as "a kind of masturbation" comparing it to "other activities of similar significance" I would like to see some relevant examples before I can consider your argument. You have previously named knitting, football, collecting stamps, automobiles and I have asserted these examples as spurious and arbitrary with no relevant significance to autofellatio in the context of achieving a heightened level of consciousness or a sense of "God consciousness". __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 07:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia should use reliable published sources, a personal web is not enough. See <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, it says:"A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." Also, you still did not answer my question. It is you who should prove (with references to reliable published sources) that autofellatio is a religious or entheogenic activity. Labelling my examples with pejoratives does not help you. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 19:11, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have stated that your so-called examples are spurious. Without any realistic examples your question dissipates. Since you insist I will elaborate on the matter of qualified sources. Here we have an example of a practice (autofellatio) which is linked with religion and religious practices both through its prevalence in ancient Egyptian religion AND creation myths according to scholar David Lorton (referenced as footnotes 2 and 3 currently-- I added the second one now to make previous wording of that paragraph clearer). Furthermore the documentation comes additionally as an elaborated self-published anecdotal testament and analysis through Glenn Scheper's lengthy essay. As you have quoted, provision for use of such a source has been established. You may insist it is inapplicable in this case whereas I assert that this is prima facie instance where it must be applied. The two of us alone cannot settle that dispute. Nevertheless Lorton alone would suffice. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 02:01, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also they do not say a word about autofellatio as an entheogenic practice or achieving altered states of consciousness through it. 2. Note that not everything a god is claimed to have done is a religious practice - e.g. god Hephaestus was a blacksmith in ancient Greek mythology, but this does not mean that smithing should be categorized as a religious behaviour in Wikipedia. 3.

<p>I removed from article the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scheper likens what happens to the phenomenon of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_regress.html" title="Infinite regress">infinite regress</a> known in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> as a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strange_loop.html" title="Strange loop">strange loop</a> or Von Neumann's catastrophe of the infinite regress <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> where the mind loses its grip on the subject-object relationship and one finds oneself at once being receiver and giver of fellatio. This could be comparable to an experience of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apotheosis.html" title="Apotheosis">apotheosis</a> <sup id="_ref-Scheper_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scheper" title="">[2]</a></sup> which Scheper compares with the surmised <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment_%28concept%29.html" title="Enlightenment (concept)">initiatory</a> states of consciousness attained by religious icons such as Enoch, Moses, Buddha and Jesus. The literature history is, according to Scheper, replete with esoteric references to this act. He gives for instance the following example from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> involving <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>And the LORD said, Behold, [there is] a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:<br /></i></dd>
<dd><i>it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:<br /></i></dd>
<dd><i>I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</i> (Exodus 33:21-23)</dd>
</dl>
The exoteric significance of this section becomes very obvious when one sees the rock as Moses' skull; the glory as Moses' phallus, that also being his standing aspect. Scheper points out that for this metaphor (and other that he enumerates) to be recognized it is essential to realize that the classic autofellatio discovery position is inverted, "when body weight flexes one's neck to yield a sudden advantage. Thus upside-down"<sup id="_ref-Scheper_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scheper" title="">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>This text is not properly sourced. The reference to Robert Anton Wilson does not say anything about autofellatio and the reference to Scheper is a dead link to a personal webpage. Also I am convinced that this article should not belong into Category:Religious behaviour and experience <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Religious_behaviour_and_experience" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Religious_behaviour_and_experience" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and autofellatio should not be called "an entheogenic practice" in an encyclopedia.

Some of the elements of the discussion above have eluded me, so for the sake of clarity, meco, could I get you to state the sources you're using? The Scheper article has been removed from its original location, but I found a backup <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050215082441/http://home.earthlink.net/~glenn_scheper/oldword.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050215082441/http://home.earthlink.net/~glenn_scheper/oldword.htm" rel="nofollow">here.</a> Unfortunately, it's positively huge. Forgive me for being obtuse, and I do respect an individuals choice of religious expression (I'm a Deist, by the way), but two questions come up for me:</dd>

<ol>
<li>Is autofellatio as a religious experience solely espoused by Scheper? Meco mentions other references, but as far as religious experiences go, I only see the one. The definition of religion doesn't count. I've had a long day though, and I may have missed it. Sadly, a single person's source for religious ecstasy isn't notable, and we can't change notability standards because something relates to religion and not, say, business. We really need to apply the same standards to religious experiences as boring things like sports and manufacturing. I know some will find that offensive, but Wikipedia is what it is.</li>
<li>The Scheper quote is full of simile and metaphor but never goes right out and <i>says</i> that autofellatio is used as an entheogen by anybody out in the real world. The article the quote came from is 183 pages (!) long, so there may be something in there, but I'm not going to be the one to find it.</li>

<dd>No, in the section <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html#History" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio#History</a> there is sourced evidence stemming from ancient Egyptian religion. I thoroughly agree that Scheper's testimony alone could not be used to source any religious claims, not because they don't support such claims, but due to the non-reliability of him being a private person of unknown standing. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 07:44, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It says nothing about autofellatio being related to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_regress.html" title="Infinite regress">infinite regress</a>, entheogens or Old Testament. Only properly sourced statements can be included into article, you should not claim more than your reliable sources do. You wrote: "The statements that you seek relieable sources for have already been sourced — independently of Scheper's website." Where they have been sourced? The source by David Lorton does not contain such claims, neither does the anonymous article at www.sexinfo101.com <a href="http://www.sexinfo101.com/as_autofellatio.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sexinfo101.com/as_autofellatio.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which is not a reliable source anyway. There are no more references in the History section. There has been enough time to find the sources, so I think these statements should remain out of the article until good sources are found for them. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 09:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no idea what the proper term would be; "self-fucking" is the colloquial.</p>
<p>Yes it's possible; viz. these PornoTube videos [soooo NSFW obviously]: <a href="http://pornotube.com/media.php?m=21107" class="external text" title="http://pornotube.com/media.php?m=21107" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://pornotube.com/media.php?m=51295" class="external text" title="http://pornotube.com/media.php?m=51295" rel="nofollow">2</a>. Presumably spinal flexibility isn't an issue, though penis configuration (size / flexibility / direction &amp; curve when erect) would be. Possibly perineal size also - not sure how much this varies.</p>

<dd>There really is no need for saying things like "Shame on those [who disagree with you]." If you will treat your fellow editors with respect, they will treat you the same way in return.</dd>
<dd>To answer your question "...who are we to decide what should be one more click away and what should not?" The answer is that we, as the editors of the article, decide these things all the time. What level of detail about <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Scout_489c.html" title="Eagle Scout">Eagle Scouts</a> should be in the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a> article, and what should be split out to anohter article or disregarded entirely? How much should be said about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>'s war-time service controversies and what should be split out? Which ones of the dozens of freely licensed photos of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> should go in that article and which ones should be one click away at the commons? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 18:04, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason for the image beeing linkimage now is that part of the users of Wikipedia is offended by the display of the image. What you mention is totally different, in these cases the choice made is one of prioritizing, you need to put some stuff into subarticles to make the main one more readable. These two cases cannot be compared.</dd>

<dd>I agree the examples are not exactly the same. However, in a larger sense I think they are all a question, as you say, of priortization. The <i>priority</i> of some people to view the image directly is balanced against the <i>priority</i> of certain other people who would prefer to read an article on the topic without a sexually explicit image being in plain view. We have to remember that our goal is to help the reader, not to prove some sort of point. In that spririt, we have tried to prioritize such that both types of readers get a little something. In that sense, the examples are relevant. To return to the John Kerry article example, putting things in sub-article does make them ever-slightly-less-accessible. In fact, one could argue that finding this image here is much easier than finding a fact on a sub-page.
