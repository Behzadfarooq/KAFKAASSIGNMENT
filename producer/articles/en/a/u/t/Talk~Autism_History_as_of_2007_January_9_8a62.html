<h2><span class="mw-headline">Increase in diagnoses of autism</span></h2>
<p>In the last paragraph of this section it is mentioned "Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses."</p>
<p>This is the case with myself, although I have not sought a professional diagnosis. As part of the diagnosis of my sons condition it was remarked that some of his behaviours had not been considered by his parents and grandparents as unusual, as I had done similiar at the same age and that it was simply considered part of a family trait. The care worker assigned to my son considered it inappropriate that I should test for autism, as my "coping strategies" or whatever behaviour models I now expressed would render any result meaningless. However, other adults having a child (or that of a relative) diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder may also find a familiar pattern of behaviour in their own development. Again, this may be a subjective self assesment as they have learned to interact within society to an extent that some behaviours may have been (publicly) suppressed or unlearned - so much so that a diagnosis is not possible.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 14:04, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I note that very few seem to be seeking a diagnosis of LFA!<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 14:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A good balance citation would be Lisa Croen's article on the increase observed in California. She demonstrated a parallel decrease in certain "mental retardation" diagnostic categories, suggesting a diagnostic shift rather than a true increase in incidence. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 18:00, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can anyone mention in the caption to that prevalence graph or near it somewhere, that the earliest year on the graph happens to coincide with the year that autism was introduced as an IDEA category? There is more data (including other "rapid increases" in categories in certain periods of time after there are introduced) on this in this report <a href="http://www.autcom.org/Epidemic.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.autcom.org/Epidemic.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.autcom.org/Epidemic.pdf</a> which can be cited in any information about this.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Autistical</span></h2>
<p>The word "autistical" is valid. The base word is "autos" for <i>self</i>. Then the suffix "-ist" is added, to become "autist," to mark an action or skill of <i>self</i>, which becomes a noun. Next, the suffix "-ic" is added to signal a character of an action or skill of <i>self</i>, which becomes an adjective. Finally, the suffix "-al" is added to denote the relationship itself, which becomes a noun. These are all valid suffixes found in the dictionary. All base words with all possible prefix and suffix combinations are not listed in common dictionaries, which would be not pratical if an attempt was made. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 00:27, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would, however, be practical to do in a digital format if that were truly the case. Which it isn't. The word does not exist. "Autistic-like" is the appropriate term. English is not Build Your Own Lexicon.</dd>

<dd>I'm sure a software program could be written to automatically combine all possible prefixes and suffixes. Consider that a dictionary lists recognized suffixes and prefixes, it assumes one knows how to combine them with root words to expand ones vocabulary beyond the dictionary itself with recognized elements of words contained within it. With the expressions used in the article, the diagnoses is austical, which makes sense. The diagnoses is not "autistic-like" because the diagnoses itself does not have such autistic property. The diagnoses isn't even "autistic," which still refers to such non-existent property. Consider the words "topic" and "topical." Another example, "topic sentences" and "topical guides" are common, but it would be quite different to find "topic guides" or a "topical sentence." Even "topic-like guides" doesn't make any sense. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 23:50, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term is "autistic" because that is the term that used. If english made sense then I'm sure you are right that it would be "autistical", but english isn't good at sticking to rules. The correct term is the one which is used. If you were creating a new term then you would be right to build it up in the way you describe, but often people don't and you end up with something that doesn't make sense, but it is still the word, whether it makes sense or not. The diagnosis is definitely "autistic". "Autistical" isn't in the dictionary or in usage so it is not a word.</dd>

<dd>Your example is irrelevant for the simple reason that you are talking about a completely different word. It's like looking at the word "through" and "cough" and assuming that "cough" should be pronounced "coo" since the "ough" in "through" is pronounced "oo". If english made sense it would work like that (it is possible there is a good, though not very obvious, reason for the difference in this case, but there are plenty of other examples that could be chosen in any area of the language, this is just the first that came into my head), but it doesn't work like that, demonstrating that you can't just take a rule that works on one word and apply it to another, because there might be some pointless or illogical difference for the word you are applying it to. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 18:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand you disagree. However, the amount of trees killed to produce enough paper for everybody to have their own copy of a dictionary and to agree the word exists is illogical. That is the basic argument presented here why such words don't exist. There are no written rules that state that the word "autistical" can not exists. Likewise, there are no rules that state words like "autistic" can exists. Authors only wrote dictionaries, but they did not define the extent of the English language. They never have and never will be able to define such dimension of language. They can only present popular choices. If you wanted to argue that "autistic" is more of a popular word than "autistical," I would agree. That is not the case you presented however. The case presented is against "autistical" is that "we should use only popular words and not ones that are derived technically correct." I understand. It is common to derive words and not new terms. The word "autistic" is a derived word as much as "autistical." No new term was invented, which if it was your point would be valid. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 00:07, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current state of the autism mercury article is absolutely ludicrously in violation of NPOV. We don't put disclaimers at the top of articles and then state the beliefs of organizations.

I'm just saying this person needs to check his facts and be certain they understand what belongs in a Wikipedia article and what doesn't.

<dd>The claim that it is the fourth leading cause of poverty in the world needs to be cited, or it will be consigned to the dustbin. There is another strong relationship between poverty and autism, however, that shows up in demographic analyses. Although the relationship between environmental factors and autism is hotly disputed by opinion leaders in the medical community, where most of the emphasis is focused on an expanding array of known genetic vulnerability factors, there is little doubt that exposure to mercury and heavy metals contributes to the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular those children who do not excrete heavy metals efficiently. Sources of heavy industrial pollution, often containing high concentrations of heavy metals such as mercury and lead, tend to be concentrated to low income neighborhoods. Heavy pollution in blue collar neighborhoods, in turn, compounds other environmental risk factors for children living in poverty, which include nutritional deficits and the mercury and aluminum preservatives and <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjuvant.html" title="Adjuvant">adjuvants</a> contained in vaccines. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 06:53, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I have been even bolder and put it back there is no reason to believe poverty causes autism (WHERE ON EARTH did that come from?) but ample proof that autism causes poverty (try living with it as a parent or Autie some time) though I am going to whip out the "fourth greatest" thing now, THAT seems unlikely there aren't enough autistic per capita to even come close --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 10:32, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your point is valid in a sense. Disabilities *in general,* of any kind, are correlated with poverty because many people are unable to obtain adequate services; not all disabled people can work in conventional job environments, and many who can are unable to find a job which guarantees a living wage. It's just not specific to autism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, there are a number of autistic people who have difficulty obtaining a diagnosis *because* they are seen as 'too successful' or 'too functional' to be autistic. There are people who fit the criteria for autism or Asperger's but go unrecognized their whole lives, because they're successful in their chosen line of work and so are seen as just being 'eccentric' or 'strange.' --Sethrenn 02:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Before getting into the debate over the subject matter, I would first ask why it has been included in the <i>Other pervasive developmental disorders</i> section anyway (and in the middle. too)?</dd>
<dd>As for the premise that it propounds... even if there were cited references and sources I would still regard it as a sweeping statement that could not be true for a large percentage (perhaps a majority) of cases. Whilst there is an argument that profoundly autistic individuals may not have the financial/economic opportunities of many neurotypicals, this would be true of anyone affected by a debiliating disability. Since the autistic spectrum covers a variety of conditions, behaviour models, communication abilities, and the like, then it is difficult for any one statement to be deemed to be true for all cases. Even the diagnosis (and existence of) autism is a matter of dispute within the medical profession!</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I see no reason why such a comment is relevant within the autism article. In the cases where it is true, then it is no more a hinderance to financial security than other physical, mental, psychological or other condition. It is not peculiar enough to justify inclusion in this article. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 19:50, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With only 12% of people with Asperger's Syndrome able to sustain full time employment (the figures for High Function Autistics must be similar, and lower function autistics will be even less), I'd say it's pretty obvious that poverty is guaranteed for the vast majority of adult autistics. In addition, as yet, there is no country in the world making adequate public provision for child autistics and the overwhelming cost of making up that deficit from private resources guarantees relative or actual poverty for most families that include an autistic.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 20:22, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no knowledge of Asperger's, and thus the peculiar obstacles to gaining entry to the workplace, but I am familiar with the difficulty that those on the Autistic Spectrum may face. As I have argued elsewhere, there may indeed be a high percentage of individuals who may have otherwise been diagnosed as higher functioning autistic within the spectrum whose coping stategies and behaviour suppression have allowed them to participate in society to such a degree that the diagnosis has not been sort or considered. On that basis I would contest the assumption that HFA individuals would return the same figures for those with Asperger's with regard to employment.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:16, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My son has ASD, not Asperger's, and there is not yet a definative finding in where he falls in functionality (since he tests severe, moderate and mild across differing catagories and some are still in flux).

I am aware that Asperger's is on the spectrum, it was a case of my not writing "...those <b>others</b> on the Autistic Spectrum..." by omission.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 12:49, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another thing that's bothering me is the un-backed-up assertion that "autistics are (or can be) vulnerable to any form of deception". That must be backed up. By itself it's just the writer's opinion. Maybe an educated or considered opinion, perhaps from personal experience, but you'll have to cite something that shows that gullibility is an intrinsic feature of autism. A lot of my problem as an autistic is that because of my personal presentation, people throughout my life have <i>assumed</i> that I was a patsy who would fall for anything, and have spent a great deal of energy warning me against those who would "take advantage" of me. In fact, I have always been deeply suspicious of other people's motives, largely because of the way I was treated by my father. He believed that I would neither notice or remember, because he thought I did not perceive reality; that I was "in my own world" as he said. (One reason I detest that phrase as applied to autism.) --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 02:40, 6 June 2006</p>

<dd>My edit, that was a mellowing of a rather peculiar previous assertion, in preference to total removal, not a big deal, retained for discussion and expansion into something fuller and more accurate. It's very true that where Autistics can be more gullable in some ways they can be less gullable in others. As far as I can see they can be almost immune to many common forms of emotional manipulation simply because their literality of thinking prevents their knee from jerking on cue. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 08:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Profoundly autistic persons may be as capable of observation and critical thinking as you are, but have the same difficulties with people who either seek to warn them of danger as if they didn't know it existed, or who actually try to defraud or con them. A.M. Baggs, who is about twenty-five and profoundly autistic, writes about being approached on the street with the whole "want some candy, little girl?" line. You can't judge an autistic's ability to comprehend and think critically based on whether or not they can talk, move, or otherwise conduct themselves as a non-autistic would. My guess is that autistics who are that gullible are ones who have been made overly dependent on others on the assumption that they cannot learn to function independently; who are actually taught not to think for themselves. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 02:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The special vulnerabilities of autistics have a great deal to do with how we are perceived by others, many of whom presume to speak for us and decide for us what we need or want. Unrealistic expectations are foisted upon autistics from a very early age, and it all has to do with the fact that we perceive, behave, learn, and acquire language differently from non-autistic people. The language thing in particular is a major issue. I think that many of us are made to be more disabled than we need to be by programs that are based on a presumption to help us, but approach us from the perspective of disorder. The idea that autism requires "treatment and intervention" implies that autism is sickness rather than difference. We may internalize that message and come to believe ourselves to be broken and in need of fixing. Compounding the problem is the assumption by other people that we are broken, that we cannot speak or think for ourselves. This is what has to change. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 12:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To include in this article a separate section entitled "Autism and Poverty" is to suggest that there exists an established connection between autism and poverty. The discussion above supports no such established connection. While it may not be unreasonable to suggest that some with autism may suffer a financial disadvantage, without an established connection it is POV. To draw an analogy, we might just as well add a section entitled "Autism and Celebrity," inasmuch as some people with autism garner special attention. Clearly this would be POV, and so is this section on "Autism and Poverty." It should be deleted.--Leftymn 09:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I regret that I find the specifics unreliable, since the data is sourced from interest groups with no indication of independant analysis. Moreover, the examples are from respondees to a questionnaire - only 38% of questionnaires were returned, which would indicate that the majority did not believe that their concerns were being addressed and/or that the respondees were particularly motivated. As such the survey is not representative. Plus, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Autistic_Society_f78b.html" title="National Autistic Society">National Autistic Society</a> - whilst an admirable group, who have been very useful in regard to my son - is a charitable rather than a statutory organisation (meaning that its members are those who identify that they have a need for its services, and do not represent all of those with, or care for those with, an ASD) with an advocacy policy. Wonderful people who do a great deal of good, but not independant enough for encyclopediac consideration. Lastly, this survey was UK specific and as autism is a medical condition then social/economic considerations should not form (a major) part of the article unless it can be shown that the same is true cross-culturally (I imagine it could be very much worse in some societies, yet less so in others).</dd>

<dd>Exactly...unless they all have "rainman" type abilities which I somehow doubt...currently independent adult autism is a ticket straight into poverty unless you are very, very lucky.

<dd>Yes.. the eternal child myth, which is applied wrongly to both autistic people and other disabled people, especially cognitively disabled people of all sorts. It comes in part from the assignment of "developmental ages" to people whose development is different from the norm, such that, for instance, someone could try to claim that I had the developmental age of a small child in terms of self-care skills. Which is more about comparing a skill to a particular norm than about anything else. Unfortunately, that is how we are portrayed and viewed by most people, and we are treated as if we are children, even though we are not. "Adult child" was probably used in terms that it would be used even for non-disabled people, but to suggest that the other interpretation (of 'little person') would be okay, is kind of like saying that a high quad is really an infant because they require constant physical assistance for most things. It's just an abstract analogy gone really bad, and used to justify all kinds of awful policies. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentmiaow_ab11.html" title="User:Silentmiaow">Silentmiaow</a> 15:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Celebrating Autism"(npr)</span></h2>
<p>I'm not saying the link doesn't belong, just that the story is disturbingly delusional. Its an uncritical puff piece about self delusion, aspergers and autism is something to be proud of? Thats just absurd, having social deficits making navigation through society and life much harder is not something to be proud of or to shield from treatments. you can't put a positive spin on just anything.

<dd>User:71.141.107.4 must be autistic as he thinks he knows how autistics should feel about themselves. And he further seems to think that shame and not pride is the appropriate feeling. There's a reason why the vast majority of autistics you find on the internet are anti-cure. And people who want to learn about autism would do well to listen to autistics. They instead prefer to take in the unsubstantiated interpretations of outsiders looking in. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 13:15, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>From Mike D. - I don't believe in both sides: pro-cure or anti-cure, because autism is a major part of my personality, but wish to be treated efficiently to react "neurotypically". In fact, autism is 100% UNCURABLE and this seems fatalistic for many people to accept, then I can be wrong and most medical diseases or disorders are probably curable right now or later. I don't think ever in my lifetime or my children's (I don't have any) there's a discovery of a cure or measure to end autistic behavior. This is why we need acceptance of autistic people/persons with autism by society, just like we've learned over 40 or 50 years to become tolerant of homosexuality, multi-culturalism (opposed to cultural uniformity), women outside gender roles, and now older people live more like younger adults. Society is always changing its' mind on ideas of what's normal or morally right, thus the social definition of autism as a "illness" is not P-C to say, but not an educated opinion. Any of you remember 20 or 30 years ago when any autistic child was institutionalized or abandoned at the street? And how come my French-born father told me autistic people were treated harsher in France (not just when he was growing up, but as recently in the 1980s). Everyone in his family, like my mom divorced him when I was 7, now believes he has a degree of ASD (16 out of 24 associated traits) and he learned at a later age on this possiblity while he functioned like a "normal" adult through his life. I don't wanna get personal or discuss family problems, but autism is definitely inherited and ran in families and most cases of autistic children are in these families with a long history of relatives had neurobehavioral/ developmental disorders. My nephew who's age 6 is learning disabled, so is my brother (his dad) and for sure my half-sister exhibits mental illness and learning problems, proof positive of our father passed on genes linked to autism, mental disorders, learning difficulties and the like. I never knew why his parents or family history didn't want to deal or talk of these issues, either had to do with the times (mid 20th century) or the attitudes back in Europe, but I knew my mother's side and American society (late 20th century) encourage parents to really check on children's mental/behavioral condition. I don't wanna sound negative or assume certain people refuse/ignore the issue on family-inherited autism, but we must pay close attention on our children today and wherever you are, examine how the culture on childrearing and social development has on affected children. If everyone decides not to negatively react on autism, maybe the worldwide situation on autism will catch up with the times for the better. + <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.65.html" title="User:207.200.116.65">207.200.116.65</a> 03:03, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it is valid to have a seperate article. Much like Deafblindness, people on the ASD with congential blindness have a distinct set of issues not common to either ASD or VI on its own. 82.25.23.38 23:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having a "distinct" set of issues is not a valid reason to have a whole new article. "Autism and blindness" would fit in perfectly as its own subsection, say after "autistic adults" in the sociology section.

<dd>What the guy is doing looks very similar to vandalism to me. He put John Kerry, for example, in the list of autism rights advocates. (I think it was the same guy who did that under a user name Falconleaf). Anecdotally I can tell you that anti-cure advocates can be liberal in their views about civil rights, disability rights, tolerance, scientific skepticism and so on. Curebies, particularly the mercury militia, seem to generally be religious conservatives who are anti-science or scientifically illiterate. An example is John Best Jr., owner of the Hating Autism blog, who says homosexuality is a perversion, calls women "dumb broads" and others "smart for a girl", believes the Illuminati rules the world, and thinks his autistic son would be better off dead because he'll go the heaven.

<p>Personally, I don't like "people-first language". First of all, it's bad writing: It sounds awkward, especially when used in phrases like "people with autism community" for "autistic community". Second, as the cited essays illustrate, a good percentage of those with conditions meant to be described with people-first language don't like it. It was created by government bureaucrats in the U.S., and doesn't solve whatever problems it was intended to solve. I'm not autistic, so I'm not coming from the "autistic rights" perspective.

<dd>It's an interesting situation. As far as I know, most national organizations of people with disabilities (I know, forgive me) prefer person-first language. There are some exceptions - like the blind, for instance - but I think that many people won't necessarily respect the wishes of the autism community because it is a cognitive disorder (i.e., "they can't properly speak for themselves"). It's a little ironic, but that's gray area for you. Basically, for those who want their disability/handicap/etc. to be transparent, person-first language is where it's at (regardless of how linguistically awkward it gets); for those who want to embrace it as part of their identity and culture, then a good old fashioned label is the right way to go. <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim</a> 04:38, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The cite given by Falconleaf (btw, a much shorter URL would have been http://www.unlockingautism.org/testimonies/index.asp?action=14 ) for bullying and poverty doesn't mention bullying, and barely mentions poverty, so I removed it.

<p>The citation (#15) "for autism can be a poverty trap for adult and young autistics" does not provide evidence of poverty among people with autism. It is a quote asking if autism should be covered by Canadian health insurance. Since I do not have better information, I did not edit the article. Perhaps someone else may have this information.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About that new study about older fathers</span></h2>
<p>I think it is important to note in the references to that study that while it was a large population, multi-center study, the ethnic group of the participants in study was Israeli Jews. Not that it enhances or detracts the group's findings, but it cannot be considered definitive until a similar study is done across other ethnic groups. I'm not sure referencing the study in the first few paragraphs of the article is a good idea, either. -Hahnsoo</p>
<p>Also, the study was based on young adults who were recently evaluated for induction into the Israeli army - that's why it addresses births that took place in the 1980s. I don't know whether Israel has seen the same growth in autism diagnoses that has occurred in the U.S., but consider this scenario: one thousand 20-something fathers would have one autistic child while one thousand 40-something fathers would have six autistic children, in the 1980s. But in the present, two thousand randomly chosen fathers would have twelve autistic children. Are 40-something fathers still producing six times the autistic children than the 20-somethings, or is there another factor?</p>

<dd>As a person with high functioning autism diagnosed at age 4, I can share a few of my own experiences. I believe educational therapies like playing music with teachers involved in the activity, picture cards attached with words to pinpoint what the items are, and behavioral correction methods (i.e. rewards for proper behaviors at school and in society) has worked most of the time for me. 20 years ago, My mother co-founded the Riverside/San Bernardino area (Cal. US) chapter, originally 6 to 20 members, in at time when no reliable services available to autistic children. Today, the chapter is divided into six local/regional chapters with each nearly 100 members. I never allowed my autism to overwhelm me, such as I've graduated high school despite the fact my psychiatric doctor told my parents I won't be able to do that. But it's true autism has put me in a difficult position from the entire world, then I feel this is a big part of me and cannot be cured of autism. I encountered a degree of social isolation at school or work, struggled with behavioral issues in a younger age, and used to self-stimulate...until recent medication for anxiety/ depression might put an end to that. I manage to communicate like "regular" or neurotypical people, manage to hold a part-time job, attend some college courses, have my own apartment through income subsizided housing, able to ride a bicycle and can purchase foods/necessities in a nearby grocery store. I dealt with other minority identities like ethnoracial (white/AmerIndian with a French father), income status (lower-middle class, but managed to attend a mainly "preppie" high school) and generational (it ain't easy to be in generation X/Y when to be young puts me in a hard place). Also to note I wasn't able to have a strong romantic relationship, so I've remained single most of the time, but had a number of love interests and they knew what autism is. I admit to stay within social boundaries in that too much, at other times my lovers had to turn me away. But as a 26-year old man with autism and other behavioral disorders, the strongest identity I hold myself in is the autistic community. I truly hope my post on personal experiences with autism can inspire and bring hope for millions of autistic children/adults and for parents today with autistic children, whom grow up in a more kinder/gentler and tolerant world with more advanced educational-behavioral therapies. +<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 15:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criminals on the autism spectrum</span></h2>
<p>A recent addition referred to a "groundbreaking" study connecting criminal behavior and the autism spectrum. Since it's a pretty strong and potentially controversial statement, I think that it really needs a citation right off the bat. If it can't be provided, I suggest that it be removed until we have one.

Sorry MikeD, but I'm in favour of reverting pretty much everything added to the article. The criminality one should definitely go (strong statements require strong proof, or something similar). Many of those statements need backup with at least website. Fortunately I don't think they'd be too hard to find. Many of the additions, though they may reflect your experience (I think you said you were diagnosed as autisitc? Could be someone else) don't have any source material, which I think they need. In particular, the statements about Stallone, Gates, Raye and Gore <b>need</b> to be cited, otherwise it's just libel or unuseful speculation, and I think wikipedia could be sued. Do a couple quick google searches, see what turns up, then start adding the content back. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 18:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From Mike D. - I apologize for my sloppy research on the removed statements, but I wish to kept or announce the resources. The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_Society_of_America_273e.html" title="Autism Society of America">Autism Society of America</a> Advocate magazine, a monthly newsletter on autism research, had several articles on "celebrities suspected of autism/ASD" and the scholarly studied connection between criminality and undiagnosed autism. There are so many cases of suspects who appeared autistic in criminal cases involved in theft, arson, trespassing, sexual assault, and even home burglaries or store robberies, there's a new emphasis on educating law enforcement, prosecutors and court defense on handling individuals under arrest or tried at court who may appear autistic. I sought other reports on a link between rates of poverty among autistic adults and/or families with autistic relatives, and there was one on alcoholism rates among Asperger's syndrome patients are controversial or not yet fully established. I went to AOL Search for a long time to find where the heck the proof is...the results are "criminality and autism": So far, I've got one out of 395 pages <a href="http://aolsearch.aol.com/aol/search?encquery=bb455fd159e7e351eff663bfa90fd7b2203f0438da951a2c&amp;invocationType=smartbox_search&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://aolsearch.aol.com/aol/search?encquery=bb455fd159e7e351eff663bfa90fd7b2203f0438da951a2c&amp;invocationType=smartbox_search&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and it's hard to find which one to revert for Wikipedia. I selected one link to use as the article's reference on the connection of vaccines, autism and criminal behavior, for now:<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x455666016v337v4/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x455666016v337v4/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and here's another <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/1283/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/1283/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> on how biographers attempt to identify famous people (scientists, artists and CEOs) to have autism. I hope to clear up the mess and please restore my edits now I got the links I should thought about, other than typing "citation needed" to receive help from others. +</p>

<dd>Mike D, unfortunately that reference that you used for the criminality stuff is no good, at least from what I could tell.

<dd>Okay, after a little bit of looking, I found that there doesn't appear to be any good research done on the topic, so conclusions cannot be made. Up until now, there's only been speculation. However, here is a recent article that tries to shed some light on the topic:

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The authors admit that the study is not perfect, but here is a summary of the results, taken from the abstract...
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Unexpectedly, both self-report and 'official' data indicated that the rate of lawbreaking, including offending, was very low. Indeed, it was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than that of a stringent non-ASD comparison group (N = 20). Despite similarities, however, there were some striking differences between the patterns of illegal behaviours in the two groups. The participants with a diagnosis of an ASD were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) less likely to report that they had engaged in illicit drug-taking; in contrast, they were significantly more likely (p &lt; 0.05) to report activities which could be categorised as 'criminal damage'. Moreover, they tended to have a greater history of violent behaviours.</i></dd>

<dd>Re: Mike D. - Thanks Tim...I don't want to stay up all night, but wasn't able to find a decent article on criminality and autism. Was I too quick on AOL search or I need to look at google, yahoo, lycos, etc. to prove my point? The Aspergers' syndrome article had speculations on Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton, might have autism, according to steep research on their personalities and their great contributions to science. Autism and poverty statistics have been removed in the article, because of this rule on edits in wikipedia of "no resource was provided", however I agree on the high percentage of autistic adults are either unemployed, or under-employed, and in some cases, full time employees in occupations do pay minimum wages provided by their vocational developers. The U.S. census.gov data on the socio-economic health of adults with disabilities (finally, one sheet about those with autistic spectrum disorders), may place them like me in the "poorest" or least-paid segment of the U.S. population, in terms of every demographic group known by the census (race, age, gender, marital status, immigration status, education level and geographic location). Their close analysis of each group's pay rates to find who is underpaid and the representation of a minority group in poverty, but only recently accepted the data on autistic adults at the U.S. workforce. The U.S. government wants to assure economic equality among all "minorities", as the Autistic Rights movement demonstrates on the lack of financial stability, isn't only from the inability of achieving independence alone. I suggest that our governments (America and elsewhere) need to be further aware on a possible crises, in what more autistic diagnosed people (they are children under age 18 today) in certain employment will have on the U.S. economy. + <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.65.html" title="User:207.200.116.65">207.200.116.65</a> 02:38, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted an edit tonight that referred to the occurrence of synesthesia and micropsy in autism. I have no idea about either of these, or the prevalence, etc. - mainly because I haven't seen anything anecdotally or in the academic literature. I reverted it because it was uncited, had messed up formatting, was in the wrong section, and needed a good amount of writing work. I'm skeptical, but if someone has information out there, the topic might be able to sustain in the article (or an offshoot) in some form. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 02:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think there is any. The only place I've read extensive speculations about a connection between autism and synaesthesia was in Paul Collins' <i>Not Even Wrong</i>, which I regard as well-researched but anecdotal. There has been no formal scientific study on this supposed connection, to the best of my knowledge, and nothing published in any peer-reviewed journal. Just because a few autistics report synaesthesia doesn't mean there is a connection. A handful of people who display a certain set of behaviors and/or excel in mathematics, music, or art, and are thus <i>speculated</i> to be autistic, also report synaesthesia, but again that does not mean there really is a connection. I'd say wait to put it in until there is something more formal about it. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 21:38, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Autism is not primarily a neurological disorder. Autism is primarily human diversity with some genetic vulnerabilities that sometimes causes mental retardation and other problems.

<dd>Sure it is, but for those who function highly with it and have the right skills, it may not necessarily be a big handicap (at least in their eyes) - and that's an important distinction. Autism is more than a "human diversity" issue, and if the symptoms lead to no loss of function within the world, then you're really <i>not</i> talking about autism. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 00:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Significant</i> loss of function, to be exact, where it keeps someone from doing what they want or need to do. Say there's a person who feels a little anxious when he leaves the house - he might just be an "anxious person." If these feelings keep him from <i>ever</i> leaving the house, that's agoraphobia. Most disorders are defined by a critical point on a continuum, and autism is really no different. Someone who doesn't like to talk may just be quiet...someone who doesn't talk and doesn't understand others - to the point where communication is heavily impaired - has something else going on. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 07:16, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't find it correct to describe CAN and others as "advocacy". Both the autistic community and CAN could (and do) claim to be involved in "advocacy".

<dd>There certainly is a good amount of overlap between the "community" and "advocacy" groups. Perhaps they all can go under an "advocacy" heading and then separated into a couple other subheadings?

<p>i dont know but for osme strange reason ive been thinking about this and ive been wondering if autism could maybe in some cases be the expression of intelectual brllience to such an extent to which is obscures all else. thats just the way i think bout it, maybe these so called Low functioning autistivs are actually he most extremely intelegent they just think on an alternate mental level tha other people cannot relate to. naturally with their intelect they couldn't care less if other people understand the way they think, they figure no one else can understand anyway. im not a psycologist but this concept intrigues me.</p>

<dd>Tim, you are a big joker. "the good academic journals out there that publish the stuff are completely independent". I don't think so. Perhaps you can name one of them so I can send them an article? They will not publish controversial research, very likely because it threatens the revenues of the "poltically correct research" they are dependent on for new articles. At least this is my experience after three refusals to send controversial, multi-disciplinary, autism research on peer-review. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 19:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My problem with aspie-quiz is not the idea of it, but the fact that it comes off as having something of a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forer_effect.html" title="Forer effect">Forer effect</a>. Questions like "Do you _____ more than most people?" requires a degree of subjective judgement on the user's part. What I think of as "most people" is not going to be what someone else thinks of.(Unless you've changed that -- it's been a while since I took the quiz.) Another problem I have with it is that its very name puts difference between Asperger autism and non-Asperger, or Kanner autism -- a distinction which was artificial to begin with. Some autistic writers have called for an end to this distinction (autism is autism, in other words.) There is also this pop culture myth that Asperger = ability to speak. I realise that aspie-quiz contains a lot of questions and that you've revised it over the years as more is discovered about what autism really is. I think it's a good idea, I just think it needs some more updates and changes. I don't think there's a conspiracy, I think they're saying you need more statistical information. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 19:50, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand. I guess that's where you and me part company because I have a lot of trouble believing that autism is a psychiatric disorder -- in fact, I have a lot of trouble believing that most of the things that are called psychiatric disorders (ADHD, social phobia, etc.) really are, as opposed to ordinary differences or variances in thought and learning style, shyness, etc., which have been pathologized. (For those who might reply "But they've been clearly labeled as such by modern psychiatry" I'll add that the way things are today, if modern psychiatry labels something a pathology, I'm <i>less</i> inclined to believe that it is. (viz. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a>, etc.)) Anyway, maybe instead of aspie-quiz when you next revise it you could call it autie-quiz? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 09:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

IMHO, the quiz could just as well be called "neurodiversity quiz" or even "neanderthal heritage quiz", especially the later since scoring is not in any way related to autism or ASDs. The quiz is entirely scored on the primary axis of factor-analysis of the traits. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
