<h2><span class="mw-headline">International data</span></h2>
<p>I think we need better international chart and sales data outside of the U.S. For individual songs too, but primarily for the album. Currently there's only the peak U.K. chart position for Pieces of Me (#4). If anyone knows how to find this, or can give me advice on where to look, I'd appreciate it. Possibly it hasn't charted anywhere else, but I doubt it. I'm going to do some more hunting, I'll mention here if I find anything. I'm going to start trying to keep a better record of my work on the article here. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:52, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zen, I swore to be nice from now on, and I have to keep that pledge. So I'll just remind you that the only times I've reverted are when information has been removed or "summarized" in a way that I feel causes information to be removed. Now, I think that's understandable, and doesn't make me any sort of dictator. Here on Wikipedia we don't generally go around removing information unless it's clearly non-notable or false, or at least unverifiable. Besides, all I've ever really asked is that we discuss major changes here on talk before implementing them. I <i>want</i> people to edit the article. I just want people to be <i>constructive</i> about it, to <i>improve</i> it, not do <i>what I consider</i> to be reducing its scope and quality. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:27, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tsk. What <b>you</b> consider to be reducing its scope and quality? It's almost as though you didn't believe in consensus. But how could anyone accuse an editor who has reverted every single change to an article as not a fan of consensus? I believe the "informational" value of your Canadian chart data can equally be conveyed in a single sentence. Want to bet whether you'd "allow" it to stand? Shall we have an experiment? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:47, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can think of no way the chart data could be conveyed in one sentence. It needs to retain all the information currently present—the position of the album on the chart in each week—and I don't really think it's possible to reduce it much further. Perhaps a few extraneous words could be snipped here and there, but then there's the risk of disrupting the flow. It needs to be written neatly and clearly. If you really can think of a way to reduce it without losing any of the info, post it here on talk and we'll see if we agree on it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:55, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also got rid of the meaningless quote. You said she was stunned at getting to number one. A blow-by-blow account of how she received the news adds absolutely nothing. I expect you'll now explain how this has diminished the "quality" of the article. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:57, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>See? You simply are not willing to allow anyone else to edit this page. I'm going to wait until you're asleep before I give it any more attention. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 03:04, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look, I don't think it'd be any good for either one of us to be in a revert war, Zen. Obviously we can't just delete a bunch of detail like that. I suspect this is something personal against me, and if it is, you should know that I don't have a problem with you and I don't want to fight over this. Don't worry about me going to sleep, I already took a little nap, and I can stay up all night if need be. I've got the day off tomorrow anyway. So why don't we just drop this whole thing? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:08, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Yes, why don't you drop it for a while and allow others to work on it? Very good idea. It's nothing personal, man, just the desire to make a good article even in the face of such huge odds. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 03:37, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zen, if I keep talking to you when you're so rude my temper's going to get the better of me, and then you'll be able to use any nasty comment of mine against me. So I just won't respond to anything that includes an insult from now on. Instead, I ask the reader to compare Zen's version:</p>

The album returned to number six in its eighth week, despite selling only about 89,000 copies, fewer than in the preceding week. In its ninth week, it remained at number six and sold about 75,000 copies; it fell to number nine in its tenth week, although it still sold about 75,000 copies. The album fell much further on the chart in its 11th week, slipping to number 19, but in its 12th week it moved up to number 16. From that point it fell steadily: back to number 19 (week 13), then to numbers 22 (week 14), 27 (week 15), and 34 (week 16), before briefly dropping out of the top 50, to number 51, in its 17th week (in mid-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2004.html" title="November 2004">November 2004</a>).

<li><i>now anyone can judge which version is more informative</i>. Sure - Dr Zen's. The most important facts, condensed, instead of a mish-mash of eye-glazing detail, the sort of thing I would give as an ESL exercise in how to draw a chart. Not that I'm suggesting you do such a thing, but this is exactly the sort of thing that charts are used for. Quantity does not equal quality. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 07:56, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, just to confirm that to me, and I suspect to most non-fan readers, Dr Zen's versions are much more readable and useful. Sorry, Everyking, but your blow-by-blow descriptions of the chart movement, while undeniably factual and detailed, are <b>not</b> good encyclopaedic writing. Wikipedia is not supposed to contain every single known fact.</dd>
<dd>You know, what I think you should try with this article, Everyking, is leaving it alone, ignoring it completely, say until January 31st. Leave it to the rest of the community to do what they want with, and edit some less contentious articles for a while. See what happens. I wouldn't try to dispute the fact that you know a lot about this album, but I would dispute the suggestion that you know best what the disinterested reader wants to know about it. That's best determined by disinterested readers, and you certainly couldn't be described as one of them! <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:07, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Assume good faith: remember the vast majority of people edit because they want to make articles <i>better</i>. Interpretations of better differ, but people have good intentions. And when interpretations differ, we try to find consensus. In this case, the consensus is that this article needs to be trimmed down - many editors agree that the interesting, useful information is swamped by too much trivial detail. Unless you step back and let others edit this article, you'll spend your whole life reverting edits, which could be considered vandalism of good work. Let other people edit.

<p>I haven't been rude to you and I'm not sensitive about nasty comments, so have at it, big boy. Anyone with eyes can see that both versions are equally "informative".</p>
<p>It's of absolutely no informational value whatsoever that Simpson said she was "freaking out" when she got to number one. It's not even a memorable statement. If she matched "Eureka!" or "One small step...", I'd wholeheartedly agree on its inclusion. If she had even made a comment that was illuminating, you'd have a case. But no. It's exactly what you'd expect, and so, no "information" is conveyed. Simpson has doubtless been interviewed thousands of times, and her views on every small part of her life are not jampacked with information. I don't suppose that will stop you from including them though, and reverting any edits made to what you include. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 03:59, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's impossible to edit this article properly without condensing some of the bumph. For instance, it simply is not "informative" that an album was at number 326 in its 18th week on the Canadian charts. It doesn't say a thing about the album. I'm allowing that its debut position and peak might say something very small about it, but that's a stretch. I am hoping that an admin will come and give you the block you deserve so that I can work on this article without your reverting my every edit.

<p><br />
You have yet again struck out perfectly reasonable changes. I have already explained all of them, I believe, but once more won't hurt:</p>
<p>"debuted at number one in sales" means nothing. You must give the source for this; which chart it was number one in, and where this happened. It's too Americocentric as it stands.</p>
<p>The "according to Simpson" thing is mainly an editorial fix. It was poorly structured, so I fixed it.</p>
<p>"notable contrast". It is your opinion that it is notable, nothing more. There is no way this could ever be anything but POV. It should be excised.</p>
<p>No one has compared Ashlee's music with Pink's. They compare her approach. I even allowed <i>you</i> to make the comparison in the article. It should be noted that none of the artists in question are "independent". All are products of major labels, in Ashlee's case through the medium of a reality show! Furthermore, Pink switched styles from R&amp;B-tinged pop to rock-pop because her label told her that her demographic wanted the latter, so it's not even correct to compare their music. You could at least correct your usage from "compare to" to "compare with". The latter is correct for comparisons of qualities.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 06:48, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Debuted at number one means a great deal, of course...how could it not? Shouldn't the reader know right from the start how successful the album was? I don't agree that it's necessary to name the chart, either. It says U.S., and U.S. general album sales are measured by the Billboard 200. This is mentioned later in the article, but it's an unnecessary detail for the intro. I disagree that's it's U.S.-centric, it's just that the album debuted first in the U.S. and is primarily a U.S. release by a U.S. artist, and has sold by far the most copies in the U.S., so I figure the U.S. sales deserve a mention in the intro while other countries' sales can be mentioned later. They have compared Avril and Pink's music with Ashlee's, didn't you see my AMG quote I added? I can add many more if necessary, because people say that all the time, but I don't see why the section should be bogged down with quotes on that one issue. "Notable contrast" isn't just my opinion; people are always saying how her image and music are distinct from her sister's. That's why I called it "notable". <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:55, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The incredible irony is that I set to work on this article tonight meaning to shorten it by summarizing the promotion section, since most of that info is already in other articles. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:00, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>More obstructionism! What's the use? You simply revert all changes any editor makes. How is a nonYank supposed to know that the Billboard 200 is the chart you're talking about? I thought American charts charted airplay not sales, anyway. The comparison thing is wholly bogus. "People are always saying" is exactly the kind of weaselly nonsense I'm trying to strike out. What is the point of trying to work with an editor who continually pushes not just a POV but the POV that only he knows what is "right" for his article. This is entirely antiwiki.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 07:13, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why does it matter to an nonYank? It's enough to know in the intro that it debuted at number one in sales in the U.S. That's the really important info. The chart can go later. One shouldn't bog a reader down with detail in an intro. The Billboard 200 is an album sales chart. The comparison thing is not bogus at all. Tons of sources say that—I've already given two in the article—so why in the world should we not mention it? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:25, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks OK, I'm getting an annoying little bit of white space between the section header and the first paragraph now, but I guess I can live with that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tightening</span></h2>
<p>I must say I don't understand why some of my changes were reverted:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>a hit in many countries in <b>mid to late 2004</b></i> -- why is the time period necessary? The paragraph already says when the album was released, so we already know the approximate time-frame. If anybody is interested in more specificity, there are links to the appropriate articles with that info.
<ul>
<li>The lead is relatively short and the time context "mid to late 2004" is useful, in my opinion. It also helps broaden the intro to a broader international context—it was a hit in most countries somewhat later than it was in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>she has described the process as being similar to keeping a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diary.html" title="Diary">diary</a></i> -- this is followed by a direct, sourced quote which imparts the same info to the reader; keeping both is redudant, and the diary comparison is neither direct nor sourced.
<ul>
<li>I think the "diary" thing helps the reader to understand things better. She has said that before, at least on the Capital FM radio interview I cite elsewhere, but I'm unsure what the best way to go about citing radio interviews is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>I write non-stop... It's a great way for me to express (my feelings)</i> vs <i>"I write non-stop from my house or in the studio or wherever I can write. It's a great way for me to express it and get it all out</i> What info is added by using the whole quote?
<ul>
<li>I worried that the more concise version was taking too much liberty with what she said, and it looked kind of clumsy to me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>When asked to describe the music on</i> Autobiography<i>, Simpson said: "I think my music is rock/pop. [When recording], I didn't try for a certain sound. I just wanted the music to sound like me and to be an expression of myself."</i> vs <i>Just before the album's release, when asked to describe the music on</i> Autobiography<i>, Simpson called it "rock/pop", but she said that she did not focus on making the music conform to a certain <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a>: "I just wanted the music to sound like me and to be an expression of myself."</i> Why note when this quote came from? Has her opinion changed? Why give an interpretation, even (especially) an obvious one -- she explains herself pretty concisely in the quote?
<ul>
<li>I thought my version explained things better, more clearly, and I don't like doing things to quotes like putting in [when recording] if it can be avoided. I also think giving the time context is better, because it makes what I've written timeless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>"I felt that [the album] was my baby and I wanted to be hands-on</i> vs <i>I was extremely involved in everything cos I felt that it was my baby and I wanted to be hands-on.</i> Given that the rest of the para already goes on about how she was involved, what purpose do those extra words serve?
<ul>
<li>The rest of the paragraph goes on about the other people she worked with, not about her. It's important to note the degree of involvement she had, or at least that she says she had if she's the only source we have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>half the album ... feels self indulgent and lacks substance"—but that "in between the formulaic, innocuous songs are a smattering of catchy pop-rock tracks."</i> vs <i>half the album ... feels self indulgent and lacks substance"—but it conceded that "in between the formulaic, innocuous songs are a smattering of catchy pop-rock tracks."</i> NPOV -- that claim of the review doesn't really feel like a "concession" to me, and calling it such implies that catchy pop-rock tracks are de facto a good thing, to be contrasted with the self-indulgent and formulaic bits. I am sure I am not alone in feeling that Simpson's ability to make "catchy pop-rock tracks" is anything better (or indeed, different) than self-indulgent and substance-lacking tracks.
<ul>
<li>The tone of the review suggests it is a concession—generally we don't like it, but there are these few tracks... But OK, it's just one word, I'll "concede" the point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>it is rock-flavored pop (or pop-flavored rock) sung by young women who incorporate rebellion and independence into their images.</i> vs <i>it is similarly styled rock-flavored pop (or pop-flavored rock) sung by young women who incorporate rebellion or at least independence into their images.</i> What does "similarly styled" mean in this context? This seems to be concluding for the reader that there are stylistic similarities here. This is a reasonable conclusion, but one which the text already gives enough info to reach; let the reader make his own conclusion. Why add "at least"? Does anyone dispute that both rebellion and independence are an important part of all three artists' image? I admit that I am only passingly familiar with Pink and have never heard any of the others' music, but from what little I do know of all three, this seems uncontroversial.
<ul>
<li>I think it's useful to say it's similarly styled, and I went on to cite quotes supporting that. Rebellion isn't necessarily independence, or vice versa. An independent woman may not need to rebel, she may not have anything to rebel against. So it would have to be rebellion <i>or</i> independence, and adding "at least" shows that it is a matter of degree and that therefore they can possibly go together.</li>

<ul>
<li>I just think it's more clear. I like to be as clear as possible.</li>

That it is self-titled and a release is obvious, and the year is not relevant here. The name of the album is <i>Hilary Duff</i>, and it should be called precisely that.

Is it relevant that <i>America's Sweetheart</i> is her solo debut? Would the quote be less relevant if it was a Hole album, or her second solo album?
<ul>
<li>No reason except that I thought it flowed better in the context of the quote.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>"Pieces of Me", the first single <b>(which preceded the album's release)</b>, is</i> Why put the parenthetical here? The single's release date is already given elsewhere, and has nothing to do with her relationship with Cabrera or the song's upbeatness.
<ul>
<li>OK, I'll concede this point. There may be a need for a degree of reworking along these lines—maybe the singles section should just <i>describe</i> the songs and accompanying videos, and the other info should go in "promotion" or somewhere else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The <b>song's</b> lyrics</i> Since it's already clear from the context which song is being referred to, what is the point of this word?
<ul>
<li>OK, "its lyrics" or something like that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>comfort and happiness she <b>finds</b> with him</i> I had changed this to the past tense, since they are apparently broken up and she presumably no longer finds comfort and happiness with him. Even if they have gotten back together, or she otherwise continues to find comfort and happiness with him, it still should not be in the present tense: <i>The song's lyrics describe</i> is quite appropriately in the present, since the lyrics continue to do so, but those lyrics do not describe comfort and happiness she felt some time after the song was released (i.e., in the present).
<ul>
<li>Yeah, you're right there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Although the song has somewhat dark and melancholy lyrics</i> vs <i>Although the song is noted for having somewhat dark and melancholy lyrics</i> Who notes this? Why? It's hardly the first song to have such lyrics, nor does it seem to be particularly notable in this regard.
<ul>
<li>The reason is that the song got a lot of people talking about how dark it was—people asking her about her relationship with her sister, etc. I'm flexible on this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>has a positive message, as Simpson sings that "everything's cool now" and "the past is in the past"</i> vs <i>it has a positive message, and towards the end of the song Simpson sings that "everything's cool now" and "the past is in the past".</i> Why does it matter when in the song these lyrics appear? The important part is that they do appear, and impart a positive message.
<ul>
<li>OK, truth be told it's really more like the middle of the song anyway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>In the video<b>, which includes considerable <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolism.html" title="Symbolism">symbolism</a>,</b> Simpson plays</i> This is just bad English, especially since no symbolism is explained (some is implied, but encyclopedia articles shouldn't imply). In what way is the symbolism considerable?
<ul>
<li>It says symbolism, and then it goes on to explain it: she plays different versions of herself living side by side, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>arguably the album's most rock-oriented and energetic</i> vs <i>arguably the album's most rock-oriented song, which has been described as "energetic"</i> That it has been described energetic is already supported by the link, where it is thusly described. Why add those extraneous words?
<ul>
<li>The link says it's energetic, but not that's it's the most rock-oriented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Simpson has described them as tongue-in-cheek: "every silly thing that was sexual... I put into the song."</i> vs <i>Simpson has described them as tongue-in-cheek: "It was one of those songs where every silly thing that was sexual that I could think of I put into the song."</i> Aside from adding eleven words, what do the additional bits of the quote do for the reader? Are we concerned our readers will think she added silly things that she couldn't think of? Do our readers need to know that she apparently has a class of songs in which every silly little sexual thing was added? The important part of the quote is that she added every silly little thing that was sexual into the song. The rest is just verbosity.
<ul>
<li>It's important to say "that she could think of". Not every silly sexual thing went into the song, only the ones she could think of.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Simpson said light-heartedly that "you can take ("La La") how you wanna take it.</i> vs <i>Simpson said light-heartedly about the song that "you can take it how you wanna take it."</i> Why make it longer? Again the important part is that you can take "La La" how you want to take it -- both versions impart this info, but one is shorter.
<ul>
<li>I just don't like chopping up the quote like that. I think it's clumsy and bad writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The music video for "La La", which debuted in late November, features Simpson and her friends hanging around a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburban</a> town</i> vs <i>The music video for "La La", which debuted a few days after Simpson's November</i> TRL <i>appearance, takes place in a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburban</a> setting; it features Simpson and her friends hanging around town</i> Why does it matter that the video debuted a few days after she said the above quote? What useful information is lost by changing "takes place in a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburban</a> setting; it features Simpson and her friends hanging around town" to "features Simpson and her friends hanging around a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburban</a> town"? The long version takes five extra words to impart the info that the town is suburban.
<ul>
<li>I like "suburban setting". It seems to say something that "suburban town" doesn't.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>serves to introduce Simpson, who says she has "got stains on my t-shirt, and I'm the biggest flirt".</i> vs <i>serves to introduce Simpson at the beginning of the album: "Got stains on my t-shirt, and I'm the biggest flirt," she sings.</i> That it is the beginning of the album is already explained (because it's the first song). The rest is just more verbosity. It doesn't matter that she sings those lyrics (as opposed to rapping them, or speaking them), because the important part is the info they relate to the audience.
<ul>
<li>Does it already say it's the first song? If it does, it's not such a big deal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>she responds to people talking about her by singing</i> vs <i>she responds to people talking about her—"you think you know me"—by singing</i> What purpose does "You think you know me" serve?
<ul>
<li>More detail, more context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>about emotional turmoil and conflict in a relationship, but Simpson concludes that "I'm over the drama of you.</i> vs <i>about conflict in a relationship and the emotional turmoil that comes with it, but it concludes with Simpson singing that "I'm over the drama of you."</i> Do we need to tell the reader that emotional turmoil comes with conflict in a relationship? It is neutral to claim that emotional turmoil aways comes from conflict? Is it worth the extra words? <i>it concludes with Simpson singing</i> -- this bit is unnecessary, since the important part is that Simpson concludes something. In addition <i>it</i> is ambiguous, and does not clearly refer to the song. <i>It</i> should only be used if the noun it refers to is the previous noun used, and the previous nouns are <i>turmoil</i>, <i>relationship</i>, <i>conflict</i> and then, finally, <i>track</i>.
<ul>
<li>Maybe we can find something in between our two versions, then. Suggestion?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>She explained the song's meaning <b>in an interview</b>: "I was at the stage where I got really sick of my ex-boyfriend's dramas and this song says it all. <b>At the end, you know</b> I've reached the point where I've had enough of these dramas; I'm finished with him."</i> Does it matter that she said this in an interview? (keep in mind that the quote is referenced for anyone who cares when and where she said it) The important part is that she said it. The least important part is "at the end, you know", which is vague -- I honestly have no idea what she means -- at the end of the song, or the relationship, or the stage in her life? Ultimately, does it matter? The important part of the quote is that the song refers to her lack of patience with her boyfriend's dramas. We don't need Simpson's ambiguous asides.
<ul>
<li>Sure we do. She means at the end of the song.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>she recorded the song just after their breakup, and <b>although it took her a little while to get over her ex-boyfriend,</b> by the time she finished recording "Undiscovered", she was over him</i> Once again, the important part is that she recorded the song to get over her ex. That this took "a little while" is already explained, and so vague as to be useless ("a little while" could be a few days, a few weeks or even a few months).
<ul>
<li>Well, she said it; I think it's useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>I think... it's very true to my emotion... people like to hear when somebody's being real, and you can (tell) if they're being real or not..."</i> vs <i>"I think that it's an album that's, like, very true to my emotion; I think that, you know, people like to hear when somebody's being real, and you can, like, tell, if you listen to an album, if they're being real or not...</i> Surely this is self-explanatory... We don't need to repeat that these are her thoughts (we don't even need to include it at all, since it's a quote, but more than once is totally unnecessary). Words like <i>like</i> and <i>you know</i> are just wasted space. Why not cut them out?
<ul>
<li>Well, maybe. I just didn't like chopping up the quote.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>"<b>I was in the car.</b> I just finished a show, and my dad called me, and he <b>was like, "Guess what, baby?" I was like, "What?" He was like, "Your album went number one!"</b> So I was freaking out. It was awesome!"</i> Who cares that she was in a car when her dad told her the album was #1? Who cares that he was vaguely coy about it before telling her? The whole quote could be removed, as far as I'm concerned, but we certainly don't need all this.
<ul>
<li>Well, I think it's important. I'm not going to deprive the reader of this information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Simpson has said</i> vs <i>For her part, Simpson said</i> Aside from the length, what is the difference?
<ul>
<li>Clarity and eloquence, I guess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>she did not want to meet with Jessica's record label (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia</a>): "I wanted to be signed because of my</i> music<i>". She eventually signed with Geffen instead. At the beginning of</i> The Ashlee Simpson Show<i>, Simpson is shown signing the record deal.</i> vs <i>he eventually signed with Geffen instead: "You find the people who believe in you—and it works." At the beginning of</i> The Ashlee Simpson Show<i>, Simpson is shown signing the record deal (which also occurred about three months before November 2003, according to the</i> Late Late Show <i>interview).</i> What does the first quote mean? If she meant that the people at Geffen believe in her, say that; what is it that "works"? If you must give a date for the signing of the record deal, why not "about August 2003" instead of "about three months before November"? That's just silly... And since the date of the record deal is not so important, nor controversial, why cite it to a specific interview?
<ul>
<li>I'm reluctant to go beyond her own words. If she said three months before, I prefer that to August, because it seems safer. It could've really been July, or September, who knows? This is our only source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I really do think this article is ready to be featured, but it won't happen unless it is considerably shorter. It may be wrong of people to demand a shorter article, but... In any case, terser prose is always better (assuming neutrality, informativeness and clarity are not sacrificed), so the article should be shortened as much as possible. <i>Arbitrarily and capriciously snip ever other adverb</i> and all that... <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 00:21, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm thinking about splitting things up into subarticles, but I'm not sure. If I do that, I can probably shorten the article considerably and also open room for a great deal of future expansion. It would be good to get Autobiography album design through VfU first as a precedent. Another thing: those are way too many points to cover at once. It wore me out.

<p>Fine. I take your point about not wanting the article to contain an inaccurate statement, but the solution to that is to <i>correct the statement</i>, not roll back the whole edit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, what is the inaccuracy in the first sentence?</li>
<li>Secondly, I agree that I made a typo, so why didn't you just correct the typo?</li>

<p>I don't want you blocked, but I do want you to become a cooperative editor. Your current behavior, which others have remarked on in the past, is suggestive of someone who is attempting to act as sole author of a work. Please cooperate. The fact that you have reverted three times in less than two hours today should be a warning sign to you: learn to work with other editors. The errors and problems you have pointed out are all valid, but the solution is not to revert but to correct individual errors. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:50, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tony, to hear you tell it, I'm the worst thing that ever happened to Wikipedia. But truth be told, I love nothing more than to see a good edit; it is, however, equally important for a responsible editor to revert bad edits. Why don't we talk about the actual article instead of all this ridiculous lecturing? Why don't you make some argument to justify your version? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:21, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't claim that you're "the worst thing that ever happened to Wikipedia", but I'd like you to edit to improve bad text rather than reverting. Reverting to an earlier version is not being bold, it will never get us from the admittedly imperfect present version of any article. That's what "be bold" means, edit the text as you see fit. Your behavior in the past has hampered this process, although you have produced a lot of good edits, too. It is <b>absolutely not</b> (and this should be stated clearly) the duty of a responsible editor "to revert bad edits." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:30, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony, will you please revert your changes and discuss matters with me here first? I am on the verge of abandoning this article completely and taking it off my watchlist, and then I suppose you can do what you want with it.

<dd>You accused me of abusing Wikipedia and said I wasn't a cooperative editor. As for the changes, I consider them radical and I believe they should be discussed prior to being implemented.

<p>I asked you <i>not</i> to abuse Wikipedia, but I take your point. You aren't being very cooperative, as quite a lot of people have told you. The changes are not radical. If you continue to revert reasonable edits you will soon find yourself before the AC. Take the existing edits and improve them. What have I done that could be improved? This is the kind of editing question you should be answering, not "when do I get another three reverts so I can have the old version back?" --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:19, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why do you keep threatening me, Tony? Be civil. Don't use a threat of arbitration to get your way. I will of course revert back to my version next time I get a chance, excluding any helpful changes that were made, because that's the only way I can see to improve them. Can an honest person not believe that, Tony? I want to discuss, but you are making radical changes that I disagree with and then expecting me to just deal with it, and I won't. You need to discuss and help me hammer out a compromise, not just try to win through brute force by getting me to use up my reverts before you do. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:32, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where we go from here</span></h2>
<p>OK, I think if we're going to break off subarticles, the most obvious to start with is the sales and chart data section, because that's the one people have been complaining about. Promotion: I'm not sure, it could be a subarticle, but then again most of it is already mentioned in the singles articles...but there's still something to be said for having it all together in one place...reviews/critical reception could also be a separate article, but I'd really hate to trim any of what's already there, it all seems pretty essential. Any other suggestions? I don't want to implement anything until the whole situation with Tony gets worked out. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 17:16, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really think that you can write an article about the sales and chart performance of an album in an encyclopedia. In a book about the album, perhaps, you could devote a (very boring) chapter to it. Same goes for pretty much all your suggestions above--another attempt to split off data would crash and burn at the VfD stage. What I suggest we do with sales and charts is go through it carefully and decide what pieces are needed. I'd suggest that the tabular data speaks for itself and much of that section is just padding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the article as it stands really could do with having some of the fat trimmed. There is a very large section on Promotion and another very large section on The Making Of the Album. As I understand it, the making of the album was documented on her reality show, so we can condense the information (boy does it need condensing!) and put it in that article. The promotion section can be condensed to a brief paragraph, much less wordy than the current version, describing the shows she sang it on. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:49, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More seriously, you need to understand that just because something is unimportant to you doesn't mean it needs to be deleted. I don't go around saying notable things need to be deleted just because they bore me. We are supposed to include far more detail than a paper encyclopedia, but it seems that deletionists like you don't think we need half as much content as a paper encyclopedia. Before I blanked my user page, I posed the question there: Should a featured article be useful to the serious researcher, or is it good enough that it helps out a high school student writing a two page paper? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:52, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have stated the problem clearly. The problem is that you regard someone who would oppose an article about a three-day-old single in an encyclopedia as <i>radical</i>. That isn't radical at all. It's just a view that you happen to oppose. I accept the vote and would not support a further proposal to delete the La La , but this doesn't mean I have changed my mind about the suitability of the La La article. How did it do in the charts? A week or so at number six?

<dd><b>Some have compared Simpson's success in album sales favorably with that of her sister Jessica, who</b>, despite having several hits since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, <b>has never had a number one album</b> (the closest she came was with the release of the special edition of <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_This_Skin_5428.html" title="In This Skin">In This Skin</a></i> in early 2004, which debuted at number two). <b>Simpson herself has said that she never expected the album to do so well: "I just hoped my album <i>charted</i>. I didn't expect it to be number one in the country! It was a huge shock."<sup><small><a href="#References" title="">6</a></small></sup></b> According to Geffen President Jordan Schur, the sales of the album in such a short period of time were exceptional: "It's unheard of in this business—even for a superstar—to sell this number of records." He also emphasized Simpson's relative obscurity until not long before the album's release, making her success that much more impressive.<sup><small><a href="#References" title="">6</a></small></sup> Simpson had, however, received a great deal of exposure in the period immediately prior to the album's release through <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i>, which debuted in the U.S. on MTV on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>.</dd>

<dd><b>Discussing the appeal of <i>Autobiography</i>, Simpson emphasized its emotional sincerity in a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_FM_3b82.html" title="Capital FM">Capital FM</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>) radio interview: "I think that it's an album that's, like, very true to my emotion; I think that, you know, people like to hear when somebody's being real, and you can, like, tell, if you listen to an album, if they're being real or not..." (September 15, 2004) She also said that people of many different ages could enjoy the album; it is, however, commonly thought that it appeals primarily to teenagers.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Some observers have viewed Simpson's reality show and association with her sister as more responsible for <i>Autobiography</i>'s success than the music itself. In July, Geoff Mayfield, <i>Billboard</i>'s director of charts, described the album as the "right thing at the right time" and said: "The MTV show is a huge catalyst, radio jumped all over the song, and her famous sister opened the door. If Jessica never happened, then Ashlee doesn't get her own show and this album doesn't happen." Zena Burns of <i>Teen People</i> was willing to attribute more of Simpson's success to the quality of the first single, "Pieces of Me": "Ashlee has an amazing promotional machine, and it doesn't hurt to have Jessica and MTV behind you, but she also came out with an insanely catchy pop single."<small><sup><a href="#References" title="">7</a></sup></small></b></dd>

<p>The above is for us to work out what in this section should stay here, in this article, with the entirety going to a subarticle. Proposals for possible expansion are also welcome.

<p>OK, what I think is very important is in bold, the rest I'm much more flexible about and can be restricted to the subarticle. Of course, we can discuss any of it, but I'm going to much more stubborn about what's in bold. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:04, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. I'd much rather see some of the information that you haven't bolded kept - for instance the information about how it charted around the world, which is very relevant to an article such as this. Of the bolded information, I agree that much of it needs to stay. The only things I'd probably suggest removing are the Schur quote (and more importantly the POV conclusion that comes after it) and the Burns quote (which is getting more into reviews, and we've already got enough of those).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think it's questionably wise to spin this off into a subarticle when the odds of it withstanding VFD aren't very good. I won't nominate it, and I give my word now that I won't vote, but I think it's fairly likely to happen. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:13, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, isn't that what people do when articles get too long: break content off into subarticles? Why is <i>Autobiography</i> different from anything else? Just because some of the content isn't bolded doesn't mean it should go totally, just that it's too detailed in its current form and needs to be significantly summarized. What's bolded I think should be kept more or less verbatim, with perhaps a few minor tweaks. I'd like to get this section down to about 50% of its current size, and then be able to continue further expansion of the content in the subarticle. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:58, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I think you may be right about the Schur quote. The Burns quote I'd really like to keep, though, as it helps to balance the Mayfield quote. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:01, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not all too sure that most of this information isn't fancruft, though I do agree with Ambi that a lot of the unbolded information is important. However, I don't see the need to spin this off to a subarticle yet. I suggest you write articles for the songs and link to them instead; I'm not sure where all the 40+ kilobytes of this article are coming from, though.

I certainly see things in those ways—don't I have a right to express my opinion, to complain if I feel I'm being threatened? Would you like to mediate this, Tony?

<dd>The edits to the first paragraph alone were massive, Tony. Obviously information was removed, I think one whole paragraph (the <i>Village Voice</i> one) was gone and many others had been briefly summarized. It seems to me none of you have tried to talk about anything. Instead of making massive revisions, why not just pick something and let's <i>talk</i> about it?

<p>Questions for you:</p>

<p>Brief summaries are the <i>the purpose</i> of editing. This is not a bad thing, it's intended.</p>
<p>"Bickering back and forth about whether or not I'm the devil doesn't constitute discussion."

<p>Well, you removed the exact date of release—not that I object so terribly strongly to that, but you never discussed it—you changed it to <i>was</i> her debut album, as if that can ever change, and you generally damaged the quality of the writing. To me, that's pretty massive, especially considering it's the intro. In controversial articles, just changing a handful of words can be massive. That's why we have talk pages. And brief summaries are not the point of editing, Tony. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:08, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The exact date of release is contained elsewhere in the article. This is not, or at least should not be, a controversial article. I'm sorry, but we'll have to agree to disagree on the purpose of editing. The tense does not matter, clearly it was not a massive change since either tense can be used in English in this context. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:01, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've gotten a bit worked up at points in this discussion. For that I apologize. But no one likes it when they feel like they're being personally threatened and attacked, and it's not appropriate to remove factual information without discussion beforehand. This sort of thing is why we're supposed to build consensus. Deletionism also scares the hell out of me, and sometimes I overreact when I have to confront it: I just see in my mind a day when the article on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> reads in total: "World War II was a war that was fought a while ago. Many people died." An exaggeration, obviously, but you get my point. I don't want to see Wikipedia move in that direction. I worry about it all the time; I probably would've never started contributing here if I'd known about that kind of logic, to tell you the truth. But I'm here anyway. I've asked <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">User:Ambi</a> to take the case against me to the ArbCom, because I want a verdict on whether I should stay or go. As for the article, I've created a subarticle and moved a considerable amount of content there; hopefully that will be acceptable to everyone. We ought to put the aggressive tactics behind us and just concentrate on positive discussion. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:18, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tony has nominated the subarticle for VfD. I do not understand why he will not try to compromise with me. I'm assuming good sense will prevail in this vote. Note that even though I strongly disagree with Tony on the notability of this information, I respect his right to an opinion. I regret that I have not always been shown the same respect. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:27, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have nominated the overspill article for VfD because I honestly think it is not an encyclopedia article. I will not participate in the discussion because I want to see if my opinion is a minority one or there are many others who think that articles like that are too trivial. Everyking, you have been shown every respect. I have declined to get involved in revert warring, performing only one revert to your own self-admitted total of at least four in a little over twenty-four hours and your past history of aggressive reverting on this article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:01, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Huh? Self-admitted? I reverted three times, and at one point I restored a single paragraph to my version but left your other changes alone. Don't accuse me of breaking the 3RR, because I made a pledge a few weeks ago not to break it again, and I take that pledge seriously. Why don't you pick something in the article and <i>talk</i> about it? I'm willing to talk about just about any of it. But you must bear in mind the inclusionist/deletionist difference regarding the question of notability. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:08, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, I thought you admitted in your revert this morning that you were admitting to reverting every single change since 12:31 the previous day except for two small edits that you yourself had done. It is a verifiable fact that this is what you did, so whether you admit to this fourth revert in the space of little over a day is a moot point.</p>

<p>What an odd question to ask. Please do re-read the copious discussions on this talk page. The article is too wordy. There is too much fluff.

<dd>I did revert four times in the space of 24 hours+1 minute, that's true, but I was careful not to break the 3RR. I said to bear in mind the inclusion/deletion difference. Because we fundamentally disagree on this question, we need to discuss each change individually and work gradually, because we've got a lot of differences to overcome. But not only do I permit people to compress, <i>I just went and did it myself</i> by creating a subarticle. I don't know what you expect.

<p>No problem. Could it be that you've been generally too hasty to revert that hard work of other editors? You wiped out two man-days of edits this morning,and you have not yet accounted for the necessity of doing so. Was it just that you got your three reverts back and decided "to hell with it! I'll show them!"? Doesn't work with me, I'm afraid. I won't use the revert as a weapon.

But you see my point, don't you. Your move was unilateral, although you had mentioned your intent earlier. We also mention our intent and make edit, but you abuse your editing powers repeatedly to restore the article to a state that contains only your own edits. This is not a good way to work. You cannot own part of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:39, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, have you noticed that nobody else is abusing their edit powers?

<p>I do not own this article, Tony. But I do have a certain self-imposed responsibility to make it a certain quality, and to clean up after anybody who makes a bad edit. Back when you made good edits to it, like the tables, do you remember me reverting you then? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 17:04, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Who will clean up when <i>you</i> make a bad edit? Wikipedia's decision-making process is based on consensus. That means that you and I must reach an agreement on article content. This cannot happen if, as you seem to want to do, you revert every single edit performed by anybody else every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><a name="A_truce_proposal" id="A_truce_proposal"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">A truce proposal</span></h2>
<p>I want to suggest a form of truce. I undertake to make <i>no</i> edits to this article. Instead I will work on Autobiography (album)/Truce and I will encourage edits by other users. I propose that the terms for editing this article are that no material reverts are to occur except in the case of simple vandalism (that's when someone writes "Ashlee is a poopyface" in the article, that kind of thing).</p>
<p>Then you can see the effect of editing without these constant reverts, and maybe you will find that it's as bad as you think it will be, or maybe you will see that it isn't such a big deal to just let other people edit as you do. Either way, you won't have me editing the main article and I won't have you reverting my edits. Win win, eh?</p>

<p>Tony, while I reject your edits to the "making" section, I want to say that I do understand there is a problem with that section. Much of the early info is very vague and weak.

<p>Your decision to go to subarticles is a symptom of your apparent inability to edit this piece properly or permit anybody else to do so. As I've got plenty of other things that I can edit more productively, and people who are far more cooperative that you are, I am abandoning my attempts to edit Autobiography. It isn't worth the bother.

<p>What are you up to, Everyking? Do you not see that this is extremely unreasonable behavior? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:35, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
