<p>Note: I have removed the image from the page, and I suggest that it remain so for now. This poll should continue to run in order to allow for full expression of opinion on this complex topic, but in the meantime showing such a photo absent overwhelming community support is unhelpful. I invite people to think carefully about this photo in the context of an overall view of our charitable, humanitarian, educational mission, and not be distracted by arguments about censorship and prudishness, which are very much beside the point here. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 05:24, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Suspending the poll doesn't seem wise. We need (as a community) to have some standards for deciding where the line is between educational (aka encyclopedic) and non-educational. I think this image is one that should not be included - and have been afraid to be too vocal because I didn't want to be seen as supporting censorship - however, as has been said recently, "It's only that we are so afraid of being accused of censorship that we let it go on this long, I think." And to fail to complete this - start setting this line will only cause a delay of the inevitable discussion. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 03:09, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Suits me. I changed it to inline on January 6th and have found it to be surprisingly stable in the month since then, given the controversial contents of the image. So I think I'd like to keep it <b>inline</b> as it's a lovely picture and he does seem to be enjoying himself so. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:19, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep <b>inline</b>. It's an illustration of the article's subject. But for seeing that picture, I might have thought it wasn't actually physically possible, but images (though possible of doctoring, of course) add substance. What reasons are there to not have the image that wouldn't also apply to not having the article? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 07:23, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)\

<dd>Would you still say the same thing if this debate was about the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a> article and a hypothetical inline image there? Would your criteria still hold? "Illustration of the article's subject"? You bet. "Might have thought it wasn't actually physically possible"? Yep. "What reasons not to have the image that wouldn't apply to not having the article"? Well, you tell me. Note that <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a> currently does not even offer a linked image. So it seems that Wikipedia as a community does occasionally draw the line... that is, it's not a question of whether to draw the line, but where to draw it. Sometimes (how do I put this...) "real world considerations" prevail over absolutist no-censorship-ever inline-all-the-way principles. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:28, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, I would not, because the goatse article is not about the guy's anus, but about the website as a part of internet lore. If hello.jpg was used to illustrate an article on anus stretching, then (assuming copyright isn't a problem), I'd vote to keep it inline. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 23:34, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're reaching a bit here. The "goatse" phenomenon is all about one specific image, yet that image is entirely missing from its page. It's comparable to not having a photograph of "the blue marble" at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Marble_af39.html" title="The Blue Marble">The Blue Marble</a>. The <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapruder_film.html" title="Zapruder film">Zapruder film</a> article also has a still frame from the film, although that article is mostly about the film's significance in history, and you wouldn't argue that the image is suitable only as an illustration for an article on presidential motorcades. Most of the images used in Wikipedia are far more peripheral: for instance, a photograph of a historical figure is just a nice-to-have accessory, not really needed to appreciate their biography and achievements. By contrast, the goatse image is far more central to a discussion of the goatse phenomenon, yet it's entirely missing. Copyright is not an issue, we could plausibly claim "fair use". I wish you could bring yourselves to admit that the real reason that <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a> has no image is simply because even strong no-censorship advocates sometimes have to draw the line somewhere... the only question is where. Perhaps this poll is part of answering that question. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think the goatse image is rather sickening and I don't enjoy looking at it, but is that a reason to not have it in an article that is primarily about that image? I certainly didn't go blind when I saw it, so I can't claim injury. All you did was imagine an image that was supposedly so offensive that no one would bother to defend it, but that's far from coming up with an explanation of why we should take note of offense, offense to whom, offense from what, and what we should do to remedy or prevent offense, <i>if anything</i>. I am absolutely against this kind of censorship in the real world, but I am open to the idea that different standards may apply in the wikipedia context, if someone could just <i>articulate a logical, NPOV standard</i> in favor of this censorship. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 08:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I expect that some people will defend it (please go ahead and vote in the <b>new poll at <a href="../../../g/o/a/Talk%7EGoatse.cx_31f8.html" title="Talk:Goatse.cx">Talk:Goatse.cx</a></b>) but others will agree that occasionally practical considerations trump pure principle. For instance, one of the absolutely fundamental Wikipedia principles is that anyone can edit anything, yet bowing to reality we have permanently protected the main page. How to set a standard for deciding on the rare cases when we might wish to permanently protect a page or de-inline or remove entirely an image? I don't have any ready answer... I think rare cases are inevitably decided on a case-by-case basis. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 15:54, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Inline</b>. As I've said before, linking would be POV, no matter how it is worded etc. The only pertinent and POV question is: does the picture add to/enhance the article? Yes, IMO, but the picture was also put up on IfD and kept. Any censoring because <i>some people</i> might be <i>offended</i> is illegitimate. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 15:50, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Inline</b>. Image blocking on the grounds of offensiveness <b>cannot</b> be done on the basis that says a specific image is or isn't offensive. Some sort of carefully thought out tagging system may work, but just majority-says-what-is-offensive is a bad idea. (The question is fine.) --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 16:42, 2005 Feb 3 (UTC)</li>
<li>If we're going to vote, I vote to keep the inline image. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 01:57, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Inline</b>. Doesn't matter if an image is considered offensive by some. I know a lot of people who think it's offensive to even see an <i>article</i> on some topics. The image is information; it is my belief that this encyclopaedia is in the business of <i>presenting</i> information, not <i>censoring</i> information. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 23:19, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Inline</b>. The image is no more offensive than the article itself.

Do you mean give you time to set up a sockpuppet and clean house?&#160;;) Otherwise I see no reason you'd be so sure, especially since the image has been on wikipedia for quite a while and no incidents, to my knowledge, have occurred. Additionally, anyone is free to upload any images they want. I remember seeing a spree wherein a pornographic pic was uploaded and inserted into random and nonsexual articles with abandon. It was dealt with quickly. So no, it doesn't matter that this image, inserted out of context, could be vandalism. Any image placed out of context across wikipedia is vandalism, although some images might be more shocking/offensive to certain sensibilities. That doesn't mean we don't allow pictures on wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 17:06, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Link.</b> I opine that this is not "POV censorship"; there are plenty of reasons why people might come to this page without expecting to see the image. "Random page" is the most obvious example. It's also possible that some people might not know what autofellatio is, and would click the link to find out. Remember, not all Wikipedia readers are mature adults; a child could easily see an unknown word, click for more information, and see a man sucking on his own penis. Besides, I know many network admins that would consider such an image to be a reason to block this entire site with a filtering service—<i>especially</i> if that image were put there by community consensus. Don't get me wrong—I really hate censorship—but there's no particular need to shove such images in people's faces to say, "look!

<li><b>Link</b> -- there is a real (although admittedly difficult to articulate) difference between censorship and an editor's care in effectively reaching an audience. I think that, to promote the larger goals of Wikipedia (which cannot be successfully summarized as "fighting censorship" in my opinion, although I may be wrong), we should offer our readers a link to this picture but not load it inline with the article -- this is not the action of a group trying to censor information about autofellatio (after all, we're presenting a reasonably detailed article about it), but rather the action of a community of editors that have carefully weighed the possibilities and realize that, for too many people, the inline display of this article would seriously deter too great a percentage of our audience from using us as a ready resource (because of their concern for children, workplace environment, etc.).

<li><b>Link</b> -- if someone follows a link from one of the articles which links to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a>, or does a Google search, or uses the Random page feature, they should not be exposed to this image immediately. It should be possible to read the article to find out what <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> might be without being subjected to the image. I have not, in fact, read the article because I don't want to see the image, and it isn't clear to me at present whether the image is there. There are a large number of people who are not comfortable with this type of image and do not wish to see them. Images of unusual sex practices are regarded as "shock images" and/or pornography by many. Others may be fine with this type of image. Wikipedia editors who think there is nothing exceptional about these images should not attempt to force their views on everyone else. This is not about openness; it is about respect for Wikipedia's readers. Personally, I think this type of image should not be in the Wikipedia at all. It discredits the encyclopedia with a large proportion of its potential readership, makes it problematical to use the Wikipedia in precisely those places where encyclopedias are commonly used (namely, schools and libraries) and it fights a battle that is completely at a tangent to the aims of the project. I don't expect to gain a consensus for that view. But at least lets keep these images as optional. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:40, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Link</b> this and <b>link</b> all pictures that <i>we know</i> are likely to be unacceptable to at least the average reader.

<dd>At least one person has called the image "inappropriate", and used that as justification for making it a mere link. I'd like to get to the underlying basis of this issue, but no one is directly discussing the values at play here, which is what we need to do. It isn't simply about headcounting, but rationale. <i>Why</i> is this an issue here?

<dd>Well, I can only tell you about my motivations here, and I think the image is "appropriate" as in "it adds to the article". I do prefer to link to the image because I think that the majority of the people who will have a look at this article (for whatever reason) will <i>not</i> expect to see it, and a part of these people might be offended by it. This alone is not reason enough to fight for the image to be linked tho, and if a clear majority of the users think that the image should be kept inline I'm fine with that, too. Another reason is that the inline image might make us look "unprofessional", but that's just my personal feeling and I don't think we can successfully argue on that. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 18:36, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Fair questions, and that is pretty much my point: Where should we draw the line? I'm sure that I can find pictures of sexual activities of which a great majority of wikipedians would vote to link rather than to keep inline, although every argument on this page for keeping it inline would count there as well. The only difference would be that <i>you</i> would feel offended by it. I think we should draw the line here and link this image, you think we should show it inline. We're having different opinions on this and that's fine, I just don't like the "we can't decide whether something is offensive or not" attitude around here. We <b>have</b> to decide that, otherwise I seriously don't see a reason why we shouldn't be able to richly illustrate every <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphilia.html" title="Paraphilia">paraphilia</a> article. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 15:37, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for continuing to respond. My point is more that we don't even know what line we're talking about, or whether there is in fact such a line or should be. Except for obviously illegal kiddie porn, why shouldn't we illustrate every paraphilia article? I don't know in fact how far I myself am comfortable in going, but I don't want any boundaries that are not based on some objective basis of harm, rather than a mere proxy for personal squeamishness or a sectarian view of morality that has no place here. I'm just looking for a rationale. So far I haven't seen any other than naked opinion (no pun intended). I do think the burden of justification is on those favoring less content rather than more. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 00:23, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It was about an image of a severed head, and the great majority voted to link to it rather than to show it inline.

<dd>"Obscene"? Meaning...? It's an article about a sexual act. Many would think that the text itself might be "obscene". There was a time in the U.S. when information about contraceptives was banned from the mails because it was "obscene". Once again, there are a lot of adjectives being bandied about without any discussion of why it matters whether something is potentially "obscene" or "offensive", what objectively qualifies as either, and why that should bring particular consequences. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 19:32, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>These relativistic comments strike me as disingenious. nothing can be defined? great! you would have enjoyed the postmodernist movement some, what, 40 years ago? An encyclopedia is inherently modernist, <i>not</i> postmodernist. An autofellatio image that is a notable work of art, say Ancient Indian or Greek, might be a different matter.

<dd>The uploader said he made it and offered it in GFDL. So far I have seen no good reason to doubt his word. There seems to be nothing in the picture (I've looked at the binary) suggesting origin. Amateur autofellators, pornographers and photographers use Wikipedia, too, and they are the kind of people who are likely to own the copyright to pictures of this nature. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:49, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Link temporarily</b> (within WP, not external lk) pending new mechanism for handling such cases.
<dl>
<dd>I hasten to say that
<ol>
<li>images cannot be inherently "pornographic" since the study of images used as porn can be a non-porn, and encyclopedic, purpose,</li>
<li>we should not suppress encyclopedic info just bcz some readers would use it with porn intent, and</li>
<li>we neither need to, nor can, accomodate needs created by users' belief systems: those who believe they would have "evil" thoughts or feelings in response to an image, that those with other belief systems wouldn't have, or would find normal and tolerable, have made a mistake in either blindly surfing or specifically linking to WP.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, it is plausible to me that relevant <i>inherent</i> harm, harm at what i'll call a gut level, may be possible from "shocking" images: it is a reasonable <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">evolutionary-psychology</a> hypothesis that (especially in females and concerning naked males) some images are inherently frightening enough to be traumatic to people with fairly normal psychology, and so inherently frightening that "knowing better" than to pay attention to the fear, or "knowing it's in the past" is irrelevant. But i can't reliably recognize such "semiotics", and votes are capable only of roughly gauging which images <i>might</i> be risks of that kind and justify evaluation by a competent professional.</dd>
<dd>IMO there should be a procedure in place whereby a psychotherapeutic professional is selected by the WM board thru interviews and placed on retainer. The pro makes a determination, if an image meets both of two threshholds. (The numeric threshholds are to be set as a standing policy by the professional in consultation with the board.)
<ol>
<li>One threshhold is an absolute number of experienced registered editors believing the image is harmful as described above.</li>
<li>The other is a percentage threshhold, for the ratio between the "harmful" votes and votes of experienced registered editors who believe professional review is a waste of effort.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Until achieving both threshholds, until the end of the voting period, the image stays subject to normal editing practices. From the point where both are met, it should be temporarily linked instead of left inline. (The length of voting would be set by the board). If either threshhold fails at the end of voting, it goes back to inline, and arguments for linking or removal, based on harmfulness (or similar concepts like porn), are off-topic; if both threshholds are met, the image stays linked and the case goes to the professional for arbitration.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>.
<dl>
<dd>(My vote for "other" is above.) The question of linking or inline should not have arisen, bcz the image is not relevant to this article. Even if the act is a mere fantasy, an article can be written about that, but such an article does not even need a drawing let along a photo. On the other hand, if the act is a verifiable reality, an article concerning both the fantasy and the act would be called for, and since seeing this remarkable act is fairly crucial to believing, an image that verifiably depicts it is desirable in such an article.</dd>
<dd>But <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutofellatio.jpg_1467.html" title="Image:Autofellatio.jpg">this</a> is not such an image:
<ol>
<li>The framing makes it entirely suitable as a momento of having seen the act performed in person, but as an effort at proof it fails miserably: there is no reason to assume that the thigh, the genitals (or <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dildo.html" title="Dildo">dildo</a>), the upper body, or perhaps even the hand were shot simultaneously or even originally part of the same body as each other: if the images were superimposed and edge effects fixed by a professional, framing like this to exclude the intermediate body parts would be the easiest way to solve the biggest problem of faking the pic.</li>
<li>In fact, it's hard to imagine reliable evidence. You or i probably couldn't afford to produce a <i>convincing</i> whole-body fake. But a Hollywood CGI wizard might own the company and its resources, or be permitted to use them to practice up for the next paying client, by making <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackalope.html" title="Jackalope">jackalopes</a> and autofellators in full body or in motion, so the best possible image becomes convincing only by your taking the word of someone credible who saw the image being shot from life. Of course, they can send people to jail for swearing to a lie -- well, as long as the <i>lie</i> can be <i>proven</i>, and is relevant to the <i>legal proceeding</i> in which the lie is sworn to! So what makes <i>anyone</i> credible in verifying something that like this? I can't even rule out <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Cronkite_3389.html" title="Walter Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Wallace_8a36.html" title="Mike Wallace">Mike Wallace</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> saying to themself "this is so implausible that my pretending to lend my credibility to it does no damage: it's a piece of performance art that simply demonstrates that no matter how absurd a thing you make up, there'll be people uncritical enough to believe it." (That is, i can see these potential witnesses taking that approach, assuming of course that they've never seen it done!)</li>

<p>A quick run through of the maths shows that if the linking option is to win it will have to get a total of 61 votes assuming (almost certianly incorrectly that inline gets no more votes). Inline by comparison would need 89 votes to atchive consenus (assuming once again almost certianly incorrectly that the number of link votes would stay the same).

<p>This is too complicated - whatever happened to simple polls that gauge the view of the community in a common sense way?

<p>Nobody has raised a serious objection to my proposal yet. Please do so if you want to, with an alternative timescale, or whatever. I'm not committed to these scales; if you think just ten days is better and we can all agree (I could) then let's go for February 20 instead. But (to make it clear) I won't accept an earlier date unless we can get a general agreement on that within the next five days or so (February 10).</p>
<p>I also understand a deadline to mean "votes with a datestamp after this date will not be accepted". So 23:29 on Feb 20 would make a Feb 20 deadline, 00:00 Feb 21 would miss it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:17, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems fairly clear to me that the "linking" position is now the default one, since it is the status quo created by Jimbo, and that the "inline" position is the one that is going to require the 70% consensus. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 03:17, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

We haven't achieved consensus on either linking or inlining. However it seems to me that the current situation with an inlined drawing by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> together with a linked photograph is likely to prove fairly stable. It is possible that consensus in the poll may be reached by <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, but it appears to me that the Rama picture has probably taken the problem away.. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:08, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The external reference (David Lorton) also mentions the two concepts together. So this isn't original research. The two concepts have been associated from time to time.

<dd>Of course there's no evidence of the ouroboros historically being a "symbol of autofellatio", because it isn't. That random writers in the 20th century have "associated" the ouroboros and autofellatio says something about those random writers, not about the ouroboros. The test for inclusion in an encyclopedia shouldn't be whether something is "implausible" or not, but whether it can be documented. If no one can find such documentation, we ought not include this "factoid", especially as it is taken up and mirrored, making Wikipedia the source and primary purveyor of this "factoid" on the Internet—see how many of the Goggled "autofellatio ouroboros" hits use our exact weasel words on this. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 23:37, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Lorton reference is to an interpretation of a single poem, in which he argues that because semen and spit are both mentioned, autofellatio is involved.

<p>I agree. However, that doesn't make linking any less POV. I think it says something that the image was deemed acceptable at Images for Deletion (presumably based on its encyclopedic merit) yet could possibly be linked now because of its "offensiveness."

<p>I think we all agree on this. However, even though I'm not thrilled with the picture, and seeing it once was more than enough for me, it's the trend I fear. If it is decided to remove this image frm the article itself, I fear that every time someone finds a picture they think offensive - say, a photo of a dead tree, from a _radical_ enviromentalist's POV, could possibly be offensive - they would pop it into a link rather than keep it inline.

<p>True. However, your route is more complex. In order for the (approx.) 30% of the population that would be offended by gay pornography like this image to avoid viewing it, they would have to visit an unrelated website and download and install software they haven't even heard of and must search for (including the Firefox browser for 95% that don't use it). This places it outside the realm of most computer users. In contrast, for people who wish to view the image, all it takes is one click. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_abf8.html" title="User:Vacuum">Vacuum</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vacuum_f424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vacuum">c</a> 00:52, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My solution is not in any way more complex. It involves Wikipedia doing precisely nothing and leaving people to learn how to operate their browsers <i>as they should have done prior to starting to use the web</i>. All browsers can easily be made to turn on and off image downloads, I simply gave a method of making it even easier (a single click) using the world's fastest-growing browser.</dd>

<dd>Even better: whenever people complain about the image and demand that we do something about it, we gently remind them that the fault lies with the person who connected them to the internet but neglected to teach them how to use the web.

<dd>I don't believe a "yes" vote is a vote for "simple majority wins." If it's near a 50/50 split, there is obviously no concensus. Which is what the poll is intended to gauge, presumably.

<dd>If there's no consensus, some decision still has to be made. Arguing for 70% is simply arguing that the image should remain. The vote is clearly going to be close. If linking it wins by only a few votes, it seems absurd to keep it as it is because there is no consensus - there is no consensus for <i>either</i> option in such a situation, so why should the non-consensus position that received an absolute minority be the one accepted? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 07:00, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And how do you expect such a large group of people to reach a consensus? People in congress don't use consensus to get laws passed; yes, they discuss, but they ultimately vote, and majority wins. Same thing here. Establishing some sort of consensus with such a large number of people will be impossible and a vote and a clear winner are needed in this case. On the other hand, if this was a small issue about two or three people disagreeing with each other, then a consensus could be well be possible to achieve.

<dd>"People in Congress don't use consensus." This is not Congress. On Wikipedia we make decisions by consensus.

In particular, I caution you against any attempt to hijack this attempt to build consensus and attempt to turn it into a winner-takes-all poll.

<dd>You are working under the premise that continuing to vote forever and leaving the image inline would constitute "not making a decision". But, in effect, that means that the image stays inline unless 70% say it shouldn't. But this means that all it takes to keep it is 30%+1. How is this fair? In situations where compromise is possible, of course consensus must be reached. But in zero sum situations, a clear standard should be set. For something like deletion, it should be a supermajority, but for content disputes a majority is the only fair way to resolve it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 00:07, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No. We make decisions by consensus on Wikipedia, not by majority vote. Contrary to your claim, failure to reach consensus is <i>not</i> an endorsement of inlining the image.

<dd>If we were to use a 70% on <b>this</b> poll, then we would be invalidating this very own poll. Oh the irony. You see now that the only way we will get anything done is by defining by mathematical terms who the winner is? —<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a>…<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECantus_e3f2.html" title="User talk:Cantus"><big><big><b>☎</b></big></big></a> 11:21, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't follow your reasoning. Why would using the same standard that you propose for the main poll invalidate <i>this</i> poll? I'm quite happy to wait for a deadline on this poll if you prefer. I propose that we run this poll on whether to have a deadline on the main poll, until <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">20 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, to see if we have a consensus (to be determined as &gt;=70% of all votes) to have a deadline on the main poll. If alternatively you wish to accept the current &gt;70% of all votes as a consensus, that is fine too.

<dd>We can't use any of the standards we're deciding about on this poll to decide issues concerning this poll, because the standard itself has not yet being decided.

<dd>Why do you think we cannot use any of those standards? I'm perfectly happy to agree to either standard for the sake of the poll, and I see nobody else objecting. So take your pick. We can go for first to 70% (or whatever number you want to use) or else have a deadline and see if we have a consensus (again, name your favorite number) after that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:54, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No. That would be like enforcing a law about enforcing laws to pass that very same law when that law has not yet passed.

<li><b>No</b>. The status quo is what we use when proposals fail. Consensus the other way (e.g. consensus to keep on VfD) isn't meaningful -- it's a one-way test, not a two-way. Of course, on VfD, it's somewhat more complicated because of the multiple outcomes, but they're typically handled in a tiered way.

<p>I do not object to accepting a 70% consensus reached before the deadline, but I do object strongly to abandoning the principle of consensus if the deadline is reached. If no consensus is reached we should continue to try to make a consensus.

<dd>We should <i>always</i> search for consensus.

<p>The idea that a consensus must be reached to change the status quo is absurd. This means that if you have a significant minority, you can put whatever you want to on any wikipedia page, and then say that it has to stay because there's no consensus to remove it. If a consensus is not possible, as it is not in this instance, and compromise is not possible, as it is not in this case, since we only have the options of having it inline or not (Linking is <i>already</i> a compromise between having it and not having it at all), then a minority shouldn't be able to trump the views of a majority simply because the current version of the page has their preferred version on it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 00:11, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John, I agree that the situation you describe would be absurd, but that is not the situation pertaining on Wikipedia. All the poll does (so far) is establish that there is as yet no consensus either to inline or to link the picture. It doesn't prevent anyone from doing either (although doing so at present is, as we've seen, likely to provoke a sterile edit war resulting in the protection of the article). If we wait and discuss alternatives a consensus may or may not emerge; if we edit-war no such consensus will ever be possible. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:53, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cantus replaced the image with a link with this text in the edit summary: "Current consensus is to link the image by 52 to 40. We cannot ignore this and keep showing the image inline. If you revert you will be going against the wishes of the community."</dd>

<p>Now I ask, why should the image stay inline when the majority wants it linked? If the poll changes to an inline majority, then it should be changed again. Yes, back and forth.

<dd>Perhaps you're sore because of what happened at <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>? The situations are different because there the <i>vast</i> majority was pro-pic. (As well as anti-disclaimer etc.) Granted it wasn't 100%, but the vast, <i>vast</i> majority was enough to warrant calling it consensus. Indeed, that majority was so strong that it got you blocked when you didn't comply. However, what we have here is nowhere near that.

<dd>As a close watcher of the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a> dispute, I note that the poll supported the original "pussy spread" picture overwhelmingly.

<dd>How do you figure? Is one vote more than enough on a case like this? I would think that there would need to be sufficient consensus or else it seems a lot of people will get their revert-fingers ready (such as, for example, the 40 who voted "inline", and then the 52 who voted "link" in retaliation, ad infinitum).

<dd>It is conceivable, as I noted earlier, that a determined majority of 57% could impose linking by edit-warring. But that kind of behavior would likely lead to arbitration.

<dd>There should always be more than a bare majority for the reduction of content on wikipedia. If there was a clear and explicit policy backing the vote, then the degree of consensus required would be more flexible, but that is not the case. The presumption is always that content shall remain, unabridged, absent a sufficient consensus or clear policy to the contrary.

<dd>This whole process has been a mess. Other articles have had polls regarding certain <i>editorial</i> decisions, which may remain contentious after a long period of time, but at least it is clear what is trying to be accomplished, because wikipedia has explicit standards of scholarship that are inherently bound with the purpose at which we task here—the disagreements for the most part are scholarly ones of fact and interpretation. That is not the case here. Instead we have an ad hoc vote based on gut feeling of "offense" or "appropriateness", without a serious discussion of what that means in this context, or any kind of assurance that this isn't merely a proxy for narrow cultural views of sexual morality and decency. Those who think that it is obvious that the image is offensive in some objectively identifiable way have obviously missed the fact that there has been a long debate about this. So without an explicit standard, without defined terms, without logical explanations of why the remedy must follow the "offense" of being "offensive", without a clear sense of what consequences would follow, if any, if the image isn't hidden, we've just had a fairly superficial head count on whether an image that illustrates the article should be removed on unclear reasons that have nothing to do with accuracy, NPOV, relevance, nothing bound to what wikipedia is about.</dd>

<p>Obviously, consensus would be ideal. Given the number of votes on each side at this point, there will not be a consensus. A consensus is absolutely impossible when 52 people feel one way and 40 feel another. Even if a hundred more people show up and all vote one way, that's still not a consensus - 152 to 40 is a large supermajority, but not a consensus. Consensus is already completely impossible in this binary situation. Obviously, there is no possible compromise (well - we could find another image that offends fewer people, but assuming we don't do that...). Which means that the question is whether, in the absence of consensus, a simple majority should decide; or whether the burden of proof is on those wanting to link, and thus a supermajority is required for a link. The argument has nothing to do with consensus. The issue at hand is whether or not the burden is on those wanting to remove something to provide a supermajority. Given that we are not proposing removing the image (which seems absurd to me, btw - it is pretty clearly commercial pornography, with no real redeeming value), I see no particular reason why the burden should be on those wanting to link it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 08:06, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A few days ago Cantus suggested 70% as the bar for a consensus, and there was general agreement to this (at the time it looked as if the link option would romp home on this criterion). Although I recognise that the current vote shows a clear majority for linking, this is not the consensus we all agreed to in advance. Indeed as time has gone on the initial high support for the link option has (to my surprise) tended to erode and it is not inconceivable that over time the positions could be reversed, with an equally high majority for inlining. See my other comments on your belief that the status quo would be supported by default--it simply would not. There is no inherent bias on Wikipedia, and it is quite possible that a 56% (or whatever) majority could impose its will (most of the time) on this page in the absence of a consensus, if all were willing to engage in edit warring. But that isn't the way we do things on Wiki. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:19, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So what are you arguing for as the basic principle here, Tony? Now, 70% would be nice. But if 70% cannot be achieved, what then?

<p>There was certainly no agreement from me to a specific value, in fact I said that I regarded all these extra criteria as far too complicated. I also see no reason why, in a split vote, the default should be to show the image - this is not the same as a vote for deletion where "keep" is the default. And, I'm afraid, all these votes on how to interpret the vote are just silly. Whatever happened to common sense? This really is turning into a candidate for silliest wars ever. My own view of how this should end is obvious, but I really don't see a point in being involved in this dispute at this point. I think this is an issue where a general policy needs to be worked out - if that's impossible, then maybe this is a case where a project-wide top-down decision is needed. I would hate to see that, but if we can't agree then I suspect Jimbo is going to have to do so for us.

<dd>Well 70% is on the low side for consensus (I think the lowest practical value I've seen is 2/3, applied by some admins on VfD duty). I still think it's perfectly acceptable. Far from being silly, I think this is turning out to be a very interesting poll. My earlier belief that we had the makings of a consensus on linking has been severely challenged; nor do we have consensus on inline display. I doubt that we would win consensus on *not* displaying the picture, but if we are still deadlocked after six weeks it may be worth a try.</dd>

<dd>I agree with your point on a split vote. If we don't get consensus on inline or link, there should be no "default".

<dd>Well, if the optimistic scenario I described above should come to pass, I'd not oppose an extension of the deadline. But that doesn't mean "wait forever until we get that 70%." At some point it may become clear that the 70% is extremely unlikely ever to happen. That point doesn't seem so far off now, but we have weeks to go yet and things could change. People could start to come back in great numbers and change their votes, even.

The removal in question is, IIRC, my 2nd here, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Autofellatio&amp;diff=10123105&amp;oldid=10123065" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Autofellatio&amp;diff=10123105&amp;oldid=10123065" rel="nofollow">the other</a> being also re a personal attack by you on a colleague.</dd>
<dd>(This is an effort by me to remove material in a category that, according to a clear consensus and formal policy, is harmful to this community, and as i just said, i do it in a way that preserves the <i>informational</i> content. You have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Autofellatio&amp;diff=10123607&amp;oldid=10123405" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Autofellatio&amp;diff=10123607&amp;oldid=10123405" rel="nofollow">now twice</a> labelled it "censorship", evoking a term that is <i>usually</i>, i.e. outside this context, contrary to WP policy. (By that you attempt to divert attention from your flouting of a rock-solid WP policy against personal attacks.) And you attempt, in contrast to my practice, to suppress all record on the page of that criticism of your behavior as personal attacks. You don't want your <i>personal attacks</i> censored into relevant comments, but you want to censor into virtual invisibility <i>criticism of your behavior</i> that violates WP policy. You have the right to complain about my removing your attacks (despite removal's wide acceptance by the community, and my extra care to limit its scope), but no right to hide off this page, by use of simple reversion, the implicit characterization of your edits as personal attacks.)</dd>
<dd>Your best strategy for stopping my removal of personal attacks by you would be ceasing your personal attacks.</dd>

<dd>I regret my use (in my last msg abv this one that is less indented than this one) of the word "here", which in context implied i thought Cantus was a still-ignorant newbie who recently wandered in off the Web. They have in fact been a notably busy editor for about a year, with some good-sounding work under their belt. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 20:42, 2005 Feb 10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I (Jerzy) replaced "Look up" in Cantus's (C for short) remark with (sig replaced here by the first ellipsis)
<dl>
<dd><i>[Personal attack removed by ...; substance was "I was using..."]</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>in accord with <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a>. C summarized their rv of that edit w/
<dl>
<dd>Jerzy, please stop removing my message // if that was ever a personal attack, it was an attack on myself. My OWN hyperbole. Get it???? Stop censoring.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Cantus does not understand, or pretends not to, that the personal attack on me was not the use of the word "<a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a>", which i left intact (and which IMO obviously referred to C's remarks not mine), but the sarcastic "Look up", which obviously was directed at me and which i replaced. Clearly C could not make such a mistake except by failing to consider my obvious assertion that "Look up" was a personal attack whose legitimate informational substitute is "I [C] was using ...".</dd>
<dd>C used that imperative in a way that implies that the source of our disagreement about C's earlier remark was ignorance on my part. (C neither denies doing so intentionally, nor has apologized for doing it unintentionally.) In fact, it should be obvious that no one in this discussion needs to look up "hyperbole", and implying that i am an exception to that is a personal attack in violation of WP policy.</dd>
<dd>C must tone down the rhetoric and avoid personal attacks, whether intended or not. An example of C's excess (especially egregious since in a summary (cited above in this contrib) and thereby unalterable) is, in the course of 26 words, the shouting of "own", the gratuitous "get it?", and the quadruple question mark: these constitute another personal attack on me, as being obviously dull witted on the evidence that i removed an attack <i>next to</i> something else that C and i agree was not a personal attack on anyone (unless on C themself). And C has been here long enough to be required to understand that although we don't censor encyclopedic material (even if it has potential pornographic value), we do censor personal attacks. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 20:42, 2005 Feb 10 (UTC)</dd>

<p>you guys really know how to make a poll confusing to the point of pointlessness. I agree that we should strive for consensus (this means, <i>compromise</i>), and failing that, at least for consensus of a large majority (like 70%). The question is, what to do <i>while</i> consensus is being built. At the moment we have 55 votes for linking the image and 41 for keeping it inline. It seems very evident, therefore, that <i>until</i> we come up with a more broadly accepted solution, the image should be linked to. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:28, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I would oppose this based on my many comments etc. It's POV no matter how you slice it. Be that as it may, there is not yet consensus to enforce this view (however clearly it is governed by existing POV policies, since people disagree). There is no consensus to enforce linking the image either -- there are two substantial and conflicting viewpoints. I hope we all try to build consensus, but while we do, mandating interim action based on slight majority is absurd. Everyone is free to edit the article as he/she sees fit, but I hope we will all realize that edit wars are the inevitable result without consensus. So go ahead, link the image.

<p>We do not have consensus to do anything. Until and unless we do, we stay with the status quo, which is to keep the image. It is unclear if the proposal to remove the images will ever go over the normal 70% to reach consensus, so there's a good chance that the image will stay for good, or at least until/unless at some later time someone manages to get enough of a force behind them to mandate their removal. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 15:03, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't delete the image, and I didn't decide the case. What I did was make a change to the article which is consistent with the ongoing vote. There is no reason (at all!) to have a disgusting and idiotic picture on the article until there is community support for keeping it. And that wasn't about to happen. And yes, SPUI, my edicts are still case law, at least, if they ever were then they still are. But in this case, the edict is just this: follow the will of the community, and out of respect for different opinions, follow the benevolent and inoffensive route while seriously discussing the merits of the image.

<p><i>(CC'd to talk:Jimbo Wales)</i></p>
<p>For the benefit of people reading this, I had a conversation with Jimbo about this a few days ago. Here's a small snippet which might help you to understand his reasoning:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[17:05] &lt;Raul654&gt; Ok, then *why* exactly are you deleting it?</dd>
<dd>[17:05] &lt;Raul654&gt; you aren't deleting it because it is a copyvio</dd>
<dd>[17:05] &lt;jwales&gt; Right.</dd>
<dd>[17:05] &lt;Raul654&gt; you aren't deleting it because it could offend people</dd>
<dd>[17:05] &lt;Raul654&gt; then why exactly do you want it deleted?</dd>
<dd>[17:06] &lt;Raul654&gt; I'm missing something here</dd>
<dd>[17:06] &lt;jwales&gt; Because it is a horrible picture. It adds nothing of value. It is unserious. It is demeaning.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Jimbo did not delete it for censorship reasons. He deleted it because it is his opinion that the article is not more informative because of the picture (I disagree with this asseration, for the record). As such, he would like it deleted. He also went on to say (although I could very well be misinterpreting him and he is free to correct me on this) that if someone could find a "clinical" photo to add to the article he would be fine by it. (By which, I assume he meant inlined, as with <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">Clitoris</a>, which he mentioned as a good example of how to handle a situation like this) <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 07:19, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He probably referred to a simple drawing. All in all, I believe this encyclopedia now has a much brighter future. Inline absolutists have been sorely defeated. They will now propose new less offensive photos (?!) and other naughty drawings of the act. But they will have to seek community support before implementing such changes.

<dd>Why don't you go to that page and vote then? If you vote for delete, I suspect many more will follow you. The logic that this porno picture should be kept apparently is that the picture supposedly "illustrates" the act and is "educational." Oh really? Should we also post child pornography for "educational purposes"? How about bestiality porn for educational purposes? If those can't be posted because they might be illegal, then this picture is also probably illegal in some countries. What is the policy then? You need to take the stand and clearly define the policy <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:32, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> would be voting so that people follow his lead, that would be an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>. Child pornography... what's "educational" about it? That's "pornography", pure and simple. This, however, <i>has</i> an educational value.</dd>
<dd>More to the point, putting pornographic pictures on a pornography article might be on topic, but it's still pornography, as its name suggests. Putting a picture of a man performing autofellatio on the autofellatio page might be disgusting to some people, but you can't consider it pornography more than you can consider the images on <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">Clitoris</a> pornography. Personally, I would consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Three.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Three.jpg" rel="nofollow">Image:Three.jpg</a> pornography more than this one, since it doesn't really add much to the article.</dd>

<dd>Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. Since I did not post any argument, how can there be a fallacy in anything I wrote? I gave a suggestion how he can get more people to vote for delete. I don't even think there should be a vote on this. As the site owner, he should define the policy on prono pictures and delete all porno pictures based on that policy (including the picture "three" you refer above) <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 11:00, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>rv to inline because no policy page or legal requirement cited. When Jimbo's statement is incorporated in policy, then his action may be acceptable, until then it is just North American double standards. I'd be content if there was a policy statement somewhere that stated what is and what isn't acceptable, but until that time, and I've had the opportunity to vote on the level of censorship to be applied, then a poorly argued action like this is not on. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 11:08, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>what absolute twaddle. it's not double standards, it's common sense. if you read Jimbo's statement, you will see that he takes into account that there is no community consensus to keep it. American relativism is just as bad as American double standards. If you expect that we're adding a paragraph to policy for every porn image people upload (such as "no images of men sucking their own penis"), you are a fool. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:40, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>But isn't that exactly the point? We're having an enormous debate here about a single image. Do we want to repeat this for every single image? Or every subject? Or every political point of view? What is "common sense"? What is "a horrible picture. It adds nothing of value. It is unserious. It is demeaning." if not a personal viewpoint? This debate will only end if Jimbo writes a coherent policy on the level of censorship to be applied across the Wikipedia, because – let's face it – we're not going to agree amongst ourselves. I don't have a problem with nudity, but an image of an operation would turn my stomach. That's my personal viewpoint. Every single one of us will have a different viewpoint. If there were a single view laid down by a single person, then there wouldn't be any argument. "No nudity" – fine. "No graphic depiction of the infliction of pain, unless a line drawing" – fine. "Vote on every single image that might cause offence to one or two people! – not fine. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 12:02, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, there are many opinions out there. I thought I'd bring this all to one place. This vote concerns whether to use an image on this article, and, if so, which one (or ones). Static versions of all images are used, so that if someone overwrites an image, it won't affect the vote. The images have been removed from the article, pending the outcome of this vote. This vote will end on February 20, 2005.</p>

<dd>This "illustrating the article" can't be a justification for uploading porn. There should be a clear policy. Should we allow people to upload child porn to "illustrate" (what a joke) what child porn is? And other graphic porn "illustrating" bestiality, anal sex, urolagnia, rapes, necrophilia? That's just a nonsensical excuse for allowing people to upload porn. The policy on this should be clearly defined, and all porno pictures should be deleted. I don't see what's the point of this poll anyway. The site owner should define the rules on porn. He has already said this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autofellatio&amp;diff=10210938&amp;oldid=10208889" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autofellatio&amp;diff=10210938&amp;oldid=10208889" rel="nofollow">image is completely unacceptable for wikipedia -- I don't even consider this borderline</a>.

<dd>You seem to be trying for a slippery slope argument, but that argument was lost the minute the first erect penis was posted on Wikipedia. Things that may be pornographic in one context are not pornographic in another. It is also the case that Wikipedia will always need pornography, if only to illustrate the article on pornography. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:45, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The minute the first erect penis was uploaded doesn't imply that I lost the argument. All porn should be deleted no matter when they were uploaded. I already defined above what would qualify as "porn." You have asserted that porn uploaded to an internet encyclopedia ceases to be porn. That's just an assertion, and I don't agree with that assertion <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 00:01, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're not required to agree with it, and you can't just go around redefining the meaning of pornography to suit your wishes either. A picture of an erect penis on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> serves to illustrate the article. If people want to get all funky over that picture, well that's fine too, but it's not what it's there for. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:10, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You are the one who redefined pornography by asserting that anything uploaded by anyone to an internet encyclopedia (child porn, bestiality, anal sex, necrophilia, whatever) ceases to be porn. That's pretty absurd and ridiculous assertion. Since this is an online encyclopedia open to all kinds of abuse, the policy should make it clear that porn uploaded to the site (see the definition above) should be deleted immediately without any debate <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 00:28, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is indeed a ridiculous assertion, but that assertion is yours. My assertion was this: <i>Pornography ceases to be pornography when it becomes encyclopedic, because then sexual titillation is no longer its sole purpose.</i> --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:42, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And that assertion implies that anything (child porn, bestiality, anal sex, necrophilia, etc.,) uploaded by anyone to this online encyclopedia ceases to be pornography. That kind of reasoning should not be allowed as a justification to keep this porno picture or any other graphic porn uploaded to the site by abusive trolls.

<dd>I'll leave you to puzzle out the logical fallacy in your reasoning.

<dd>You have tried to justify keeping porn uploaded to the site by some troll by claiming the picture "illustrates" something and so it became "encyclopedic." This kind of absurd reasoning to keep porn on the site can be used by abusive trolls to upload all kinds of graphic porn.

<dd>You're using loaded language. Someone uploads a picture of autofellatio and uses it to illustrate an article about autofellatio. There's no way that the picture would be retained on the article if it didn't illustrate autofellatio. You seem to be determined to describe this as an abuse but you to do not seem to be able to articulate in what way it is an abuse to illustrate an article about a sex act with a picture of the sex act. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:41, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Once again you are using absurd justifications to keep a porno picture uploaded by a troll. We have articles on child porn, bestiality, anal sex, urolagnia. Should we allow trolls to use those articles as a justification to upload all kinds of graphic porn to the site? Where is the limit? This just proves that the only solution to this kind of abuse would be to make it a policy to delete all porn uploaded to the site without a debate. Jimbo should take a note of that <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 01:59, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, I'm not using absurd justifications. I'm pointing out that you're using loaded language, calling people "trolls" and their actions "abuses". Now you ask a question: <i>Should we allow trolls to use those articles as a justification to upload all kinds of graphic porn to the site?</i> My answer is "No." However we should illustrate our article appropriately and without undue prudishness. Illustrations of many of the sex acts you list above are obscene in the state of Florida, so they could not be uploaded legally. The others, well it would depend on whether the article was better with them than without. You seem to be pushing for a draconian ban on all lewd images simply because of this idea that Wikipedia will fill up with objectionable material. Well, if you want that you're in the wrong place. Go to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_surveys_7ea5.html" title="Wikipedia:Current surveys">Wikipedia:Current surveys</a> and you'll find that there is an ongoing policy discussion on what to do about potentially objectionable images.

<dd>I just called a spade a spade. Someone without that much of a history uploads a picture of a man sucking his own penis. I would say that's a troll. The picture should have been deleted immediately. You are now arguing that since the picture "illustrates" autofellatio, that's a valid justification to keep the picture. My answer is that that's an absurd justification, just as it would be absurd to keep child porn on the site to "illustrate" child porn uploaded by a troll. What's so hard to understand about that? Jimbo apparently reads this, so he should note the problem, and clearly define the policy on porn uploaded by trolls <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 02:34, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, there should be some limit, just as pictures of child porn cannot be used to illustrate the article child porn, this picture cannot be used to illustrate this article. Where is the limit? What's the policy&#160;? Jimbo can make the policy here by deleting this picture. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 04:37, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the problem is that you don't yet realise that nobody is arguing that there should not be some limit, but in general everybody disagrees with the idea that there should be a rigid limit. Here's a proposal that got a very strong consensus in the discussion on potentially objectionable images:
<dl>
<dd><i>Do nothing now, as there's not really a problem now. Revist this if it ever becomes a widespread problem that can't adequately be handled on a case by case basis on individual article talk pages as it is now. Policy should only ever be developed on an as needed basis, as excessive policy is both wasteful and harmful.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That proposal got a clear consensus with 33 for and 5 against.</dd>
<dd>So what do you think the chances are that a rigid policy of the kind that you propose will be implemented?</dd>
<dd>I think our existing rather flexible policies work quite well. An image must be legal and should make the article it illustrates better. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:55, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, that policy obviously did not work because in this case clearly some porn was uploaded by some unknown person (most likely a troll), yet the picture was not removed from the site. Moreover, this case dragged on for months with useless debate about how the uploaded porn "illustrate" the article, until Jimbo removed the porn from the article. The policy was a failure, and there is no reason to believe why this kind of nonsense will not be repeated again in other articles (anal sex, bestiality, child porn, etc). Jimbo himself needs to define a policy. He should make it clear that admins can delete all porn right away, especially since as an online encyclopedia any abusive troll can upload all kinds of porn to the site <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 06:31, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case, maybe you could get thing started by listing the images at IFD. A few good sources for porn images in the encyclopedia would be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sex_positions.html" title="List of sex positions">List of sex positions</a> and subarticles, and many of the articles listed at <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexology_cf11.html" title="Category:Sexology">Category:Sexology</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Category%7EPornography_aa0a.html" title="Category:Pornography">Category:Pornography</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 08:16, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>None of the illustrations in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sex_positions.html" title="List of sex positions">List of sex positions</a> are graphic porn like this autofellatio picture. Potentially that article can also be a target of trolls who may try to disrupt Wikipedia by uploading porn and then justify their abusive behavior by using the same absurd arguments people used to keep this porno pictures on wikipedia. Wikipedia would be blocked by all child protection software, some ISPs, and countries where porn is illegal. It's harmful to wikipedia, and it opens the door to trolls to disrupt Wikipedia and then cry "censorship." A clear policy is needed to deal with the problem, as I suggested above <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 08:56, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are discussing it, yes, but I haven't seen <b>you</b> discuss it. When you revert to the previous version at least post some justification as to why you think that version is better. This poll was setup just few minutes before you reverted the page. Tony Sidaway and SPU (basically two people) want to insert a link to this site porn site: solosuck.com. If you go to the site, it's basically a site setup to sell video tapes for 50 dollars. Like all other porn sites, it has some sample pictures and video clips, but basically the site is a commercial porn site selling video tapes. Search the web and you will find thousands of other porn sites on this topic selling something. Why should we randomly choose one commercial porn site and give them free advertisement on Wikipedia?

<dd>It's <b>your</b> opinion that this spam site selling video tapes is good. I think it's a pathetic site. Who cares what I or you think? Every spammer thinks his site is excellent. You are linking to a site that is basically setup to sell video tapes. We have many sex related articles. Every spammer wants his site included in these articles because he thinks his site is excellent. Sorry, but they won't, regardless of how good they think their commercial porn is.

<dd>The only reason why we have to link to the commercial site is because of the people who won't allow a photo of the act to appear on the page. If the photo were kept, we wouldn't need the link.

<dd>You bring up a good point. Jimbo wanted the picture linked, not deleted outright. Then Rama drew an image, and I believe at some point the drawing was mistakenly saved on top of the original photo, Autofellatio.jpg. The drawing is also at Autofellatio_drawing.jpg, and the article uses that file. I've tried to revert back to the original photo at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutofellatio.jpg_1467.html" title="Image:Autofellatio.jpg">Image:Autofellatio.jpg</a>, but Cantus is emboldened by Jimbo's edicts and will have none of it. Since we're voting on whether or not to link the image, NOT delete it, I think the image should be reverted and linked in the article, perhaps under the autofellatio drawing. I'd be happy including that and dropping the gaybigdick link.

<dd>It's a quality material according to whom? I see the site as a poor commercial site that is selling video tapes. Why should we give that site free advertisement? Every spammer wants his site included, and every spammer thinks his site is "quality." By linking to google images, we avoid that problem. The sites are not chosen by us. We are not giving free advertisement to one commercial site. The argument that linking to google is risky is completely bogus.

Let's not pretend that the link-inclusionists are evil porn-pushers who are trying to make money off of wikipedia. Like I said before, there is no Wikipedia moratorium on linking to sites that make money. Until there is, please stop using that line of argument. Furthermore, as you say you weren't the only person getting rid of the link, but you appear to be the only person here arguing for its removal. I don't think wikipedia should be held hostage to the whims of one editor against all others. There is a vote here in progress and there are currently seven votes to none on having the link. Your arguments hold no water, as has been repeatedly shown above. You have also repeatedly insinuated that those of us who want to keep the link are somehow associated with "spammers" who are, in turn, associated with porn-pushers. These constant insinuations are getting a little beyond a boring agenda-pushing editor. Until it looks like more people are siding with you, please stop your personal crusade. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="grey">Talk</font></a> 00:50, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you or anyone else is offended by being called a spamer, then please don't link to a porn site that is selling porn video tapes. It's not true that I am the only person who is removing the spam or posting comments on this talk page. Cantus, Davenbelle, and jguk have posted comments in favor too. They don't have to argue as thoroughly because I have already debunked all the justifications used to link this site. What more is left to say? You have not responded to any of my arguments, so let me repeat. There are thousands of porn web sites on the internet. Every spamer wants his link added everywhere he can. Every spamer claims that his site is excellent, high quality with "free stuff." Should we allow the spammers to abuse Wikipedia by using it as an advertisement tool for porn sites? What valid justification will you have to remove porn spam added to this or other sex related articles when you link to even one commercial porn site? Why should we link to this commercial porn site and leave out thousand others? Why give this site special treatment and help it make money via Wikipedia? I am sorry to tell you but that can't be allowed. We should not link to any porn site that is selling products or making money in anyway.

<p>OneGuy, you're just going to have to accept that quality is something that one judges. In my personal judgement, having many stills of high technical quality showing the subject matter, and even some movie clips, and not have much in the way of obstrusive ads, equates to quality in this circumstance. Your mileage may vary.<br />
If you believe that exposing users to a range of unvetted links, some of which will <i>certainly</i> carry spyware, viruses and dialer software is "no more risky than logging on to the internet" (what ever "logging on to the internet" might mean) you're simply and categorically wrong. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:40, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion the quality of that site is of a cheap porn site that is making money by selling video tapes. We should not allow that cheap low quality porn site to make money by using Wikipedia. And yes, you can get hacked, ping bombed, and nuked just by logging on the internet. Your argument about risk involved with using google are completely bogus. It's also possible that the site that you link is a scam, and once you send your money, you don't get the tapes. Everything is possible if you want to use those kind of absurd arguments. It's also interesting to note that Tony himself proposed google solution as a compromise, but once he saw his favorite commercial porn site removed, he went back to edit war <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 02:23, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia links to a whole lot of commercial web sites. Not all of them are unique—for example, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_Beach%2C_Florida_1bd6.html" title="Daytona Beach, Florida">Daytona Beach, Florida</a> links to Mapquest, making them money, when we could as easily link to Yahoo maps. So what makes this link different? Only that they sell pornography? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz">foobaz</a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz">✐</a> 09:22, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though there may be thousands of commercial "porn" sites, the rub is this: we want to pick the best one. If it has some free, spy/mal/adware free, relevant content, then there is a very good case of including it in the external links. Rather than sending the reader off to wade through the muck of crappy, malicious sites, we can provide a verified, good one. If another site comes along by a "spammer" and is <i>better</i> than the one we've got, why not replace it? I see no ethical inconsistency to say that we put in one link but not <i>every</i> link. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 19:16, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, porn sites should be exception. I have never received a spam email from mapquest.com, but I do receive spam from porn spammers on how to make my penis larger. Given that kind of abuse by porn spammers, and given that porn spammers do abuse internet everywhere, we should not be giving free links to commercial porn sites when some spammer claims he really likes some commercial porn site he thinks we should link. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:37, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: There are three options so far in the poll: <b>No commercial porn sites</b>, <b>Only the one site (solosuck.com)</b> and <b>Other</b>. Timbo and SPUI have taken the liberty to cast a vote in the latter two options. I believe it is illegal to vote twice in a poll. Timbo and SPUI should make up their minds and vote for one option only, otherwise we will have to either, remove all four votes from them and let them vote again, or nullify one of the options in the poll. —<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a>…<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECantus_e3f2.html" title="User talk:Cantus"><big><big><b>☎</b></big></big></a> 15:50, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is not necessarily illegal to vote twice in a poll, though it's sometimes wise to make it plain whether, for the purposes of a particular poll, multiple selections will be considered. See <a href="../../../s/u/r/Wikipedia%7ESurvey_guidelines_ef72.html" title="Wikipedia:Survey guidelines">Wikipedia:Survey guidelines</a>. At least one voter has made the very sensible reason for his multiple selection known; he wants two external links but would settle for one. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:04, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that we're going to keep adding polls until, in the end, we find out that the first poll was in fact about the last we'd added... and the circle would be completed.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 08:02, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
