<p>I'm planning some restructuring for this article; I hate to do it, but I don't see any way around it considering that it's now at 33 KB. The plan is to give Shadow and La La articles of their own (Shadow at <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28song%29.html" title="Shadow (song)">Shadow (song)</a>), like <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieces_of_Me_d709.html" title="Pieces of Me">Pieces of Me</a>, and condense the info about them in the "singles" section. Possibly this might also enable me to condense the "promotion" section by moving some of that to those individual articles; I'm not sure about that. I'm also thinking about removing some of the info in the "Making of the album and the reality show" section and reworking that so as to remove the stuff about performances, and leave only the info pertaining to the writing and recording of songs. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:02, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

(Capital FM, London, September 15, 2004) Responding to a question from Charles Gibson on Good Morning America—"You're 19 years old; how can you have an autobiography at 19?"—Simpson said half-jokingly: "Yeah, you know, it's pretty dramatic being 19 years old; I mean, we have boyfriends, we get our hearts broken..."

<p>Let it be noted that Hemanshu had the gall to actually block me in order to win this dispute. I demand an apology first and foremost for this treatment. Secondly, I ask those pushing deletionist logic here to explain whether or not they agree with <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">User:Reene</a> that the singles from this album don't deserve individual articles. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:59, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another point. I disagreed with the peer review listing only because Hemanshu was clearly using it to push for deletion of large portions of the article, and because he was putting it on the article page instead of talk. Of course I have no objection to peer review in principle if it is used to better the article; I would love to see other people's input here; I nominated the article for featured hoping to see just that happen. I fundamentally disagree with Gentgeen's cleanup listing, however, and I find it utterly insulting and a waste of people's time to list an article that borders on featured status on cleanup, as if it was some unwikified block of incomprehensible English. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:12, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'll take a step forward and actually propose something constructive instead of sinking to Hemanshu's level. I believe the quotes above are very important and informative; they explain both the reason for the title and the lyrical inspiration. I could possibly consider removing the GMA quote if the article gets beyond 32KB and there's nothing else we can remove first. However, I have another proposal to make if we are looking to shorten the article: the "promotion" section includes no information that could not also be given in the singles articles (and in many cases already is). It could be summarized while all the specific information is preserved in the respective articles for <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieces_of_Me_d709.html" title="Pieces of Me">Pieces of Me</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28song%29.html" title="Shadow (song)">Shadow (song)</a>, and <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_6ab6.html" title="La La">La La</a>. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:11, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As an disinterested party who has never heard of this artist, or Everyking, or Hemanshu, but who nonetheless has a fondness for pop music, I believe that the quotes as presented above are closer to news reportage than illustration. They are undoubtedly accurate, but belong more to an archive than an encyclopedia. "<i>I wanted to have, like, that element of, you know, rock ... the cool thing about, you know, rock is just to be able to go in there and...be free, and just kind of do whatever you want</i>", in particular, seems to me to lack substance - what is Simpson trying to say? What is the core of her meaning? How does it illustrate the point which the article is trying to make? I believe that, instead of presenting Simpson's words in a literal fashion, they should be melted into the text; the phrase above could be incorporated as "The album combines elements of rock and pop. In interview (footnote), Simpson praised the freedom of the former, whilst (insert complimentary opinion regarding merits of pop)", or something similar. "In interiew (footnote), Simpson stated that each song was inspired by an incident in her own life - for example, the song (title) is a harrowing account of an (incident in life) in (year) which (effect on singer)". The criticism regarding her immaturity can be omitted entirely; there's no objective reason why a 19-year-old cannot write an autobiography, and it seems highly unlikely that Simpson was present during the writing sessions in any case. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 23:46, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>She wrote (or at least co-wrote) all the songs herself, so I imagine she was present, in the same way I was present at my birth. Anyway, the GMA quote is only in there because it helps to explain the subject matter of the album: boyfriends and broken hearts. As I said above, I won't rule out the possibility of removing that one. The quotes, however, do support the article's claims and add more context to them by giving Simpson's own words. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:53, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed this article in the Recent Changes yesterday for a while. I read the article and talk involving it. I'm sorry, but I partly disagree with your perception of the role that the quotes play. They do support, but including them into the article like that makes them more of a hindrance. In reading an encyclopedia, if someone wanted to know more about the article's support for claims they would look at the article's sources and judge for themselves whether or not the sources are reliable. This is standard in encyclopedia articles because the writer can possibly pull quotes out-of-context and give them a different meaning, something commonly seen in the media when only snippets of someone's interveiw is used. The footnote idea sounds like a compromise, it would direct readers to see where you got your support for the claims while giving readers the choice to judge how valid the claims are.

<dd>But they can't really do that, because they're from TV and radio interviews. I would be willing to consider removing a few of the quotes, if they can be shown to be redundant or unnecessary, but definitely not all. I believe good, informative and appropriate quotes play a vital role in a quality article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:57, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can everyone, as a starting point, agree that at least some of the quotes are good and should be in the article? Does anyone believe that all the quotes should be removed? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:15, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hell, no.

All are featured articles (and one was a runner-up in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Wikipedia%7EDanny%27s_contest_d74f.html" title="Wikipedia:Danny's contest">Danny's contest</a>). Let's not go overboard here. Getting rid of some of the quotes would be a good idea, but getting rid of all just takes it too far. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 05:49, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All right, so at least the two of us can agree that, at least in principle, quotes can be good for an article. I guess it's just that some of the quotes are superfluous? If I was going to identify any like that, I'd say maybe the GMA quote and the TRL UK quote, both near the beginning? As to the latter, I'd really like to have a quote in which she talks about her emphasis on having rock in her album, but I can accept that that particular quote is a bit cumbersome and doesn't impart quite as much info as I'd like. Could we consider simply replacing it with a similar, but better quote, provided that I can find one? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:05, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reworked things slightly and removed one quote (I decided the <i>944</i> quote and the Capital FM quote were redundant, so I removed the former, as it had less info). I also moved up the mention of the fact so co-wrote every song, so it could go alongside the stuff about her inspiration for the songs and their subject matter.</p>
<p>I have to say I don't like your reworking of the rock and pop paragraph, I feel it's misleading, but I see your point. I invite you to keep pointing things out to me; none of the other people griping about the article seem to have any interest in working <i>with</i> me, they just want to take over the article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:05, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, nobody owns this article — it belongs to everyone. If anything, I think they feel you've been exerting too much influence on the article. I think principally, everyone's at fault here. I would advise that people who find things they feel are POV should ask Everyking to explain. If they feel the explanation is insufficient, they can remove it and put it here for discussion. I urge strongly that everyone discuss before reverting — and don't be ashamed of asking for mediation. Anyway, how did you feel my reworking was misleading? I do hope you get my general point of refining the quotes' core points instead of just quoting them, as this works very well for quotes that aren't too concise, such as that "coolness of rock" quote. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 07:34, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely it belongs to everyone, which means Hemanshu, Gentgeen and Reene can't just storm in and disregard my opinion and start trashing the article. I have no desire to keep them from contributing to the article, but they've made it quite clear that I am not to continue working on it, and I'll face blocking if I do. Which is heinous on three levels: first, because I'm an editor like anyone else, with equal rights; secondly, because I wrote virtually the entire article myself, and so excluding my opinion is insane; and thirdly, because I'm more than likely the only one among them who is knowledgeable enough to write a proper article on this subject. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:48, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They did not disregard your opinion. They were bold, like all editors are encouraged to. Edits do not need to pass muster for consensus on the talk page. You seem to be overreacting. While Hemanshu blocked you (something I felt was very, very wrong), the others have made no indication of doing so. Also, your second and third reasons for not ignoring you are completely invalid. Writing an article gives you no special status. Neither does "professional knowledge". You are correct your opinion should be heard, as you are an editor, too. But your conduct has shown that you prefer that all edits must be approved by you or face reversion, something which I cannot stand for. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:17, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, it looks like I'll have a whole crowd waiting to block me next time I revert something. They have all made it quite clear that I am not to edit the article, on pain of being blocked, and I probably shouldn't be editing talk, either. However, I refuse to obey their prohibition, and I won't obey yours either. I am no less a Wikipedian than any of you. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:24, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>But it makes no sense to tell me this, because I have no objections to others editing the article, as I have plainly stated repeatedly. I am, in fact, the only one involved in this who has made the point that we should all work collaboratively in a spirit of compromise. Hemanshu has blocked me. Reene has said I should be blocked, or desysoped. You said above that my edits are prohibited, which more or less amounts to a threat of blocking, at least as I perceive it. If that wasn't what you meant, you should make that clear. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:44, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

I accept everyone else's opinions, nobody is showing the inclusive spirit of compromise that I am. Anybody who reads what I've written here can see that. I have repeatedly proposed compromises and I have repeatedly stated that the input of others is welcomed and encouraged. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:55, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I said <i>But your conduct has shown that you prefer that all edits must be approved by you or face reversion, something which I cannot stand for.</i> I specifically set a condition that I would not stand for your reverts <b>if</b> you insisted all edits must be approved by you. Don't hem and haw and say that's not what I meant. I clearly said I cannot stand for the specific behaviour I mentioned then. If you persist with that behaviour, I won't allow it. If you stand down, I have no bloody problem with your reverts, as long as they are discussed. Must I remind you that Jimbo has described a revert as a "slap in the face"? And a prohibition on reverting is still a far cry from my "prohibiting you from editing the article". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:14, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If someone adds something to an article I disagree with, or in this case removes something, of course I'll have to revert. That's why in cases like this we're supposed to use the talk page to work things out. I don't understand why that's such an issue.

<p>I have a question. Why does one song from one album by a random pop star deserve an entire (and rather lengthy) article? Shouldn't something like this go on the album's page? Reene (リニ) 08:49, Nov 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, because the album page is already filled to maximum capacity. Everyking 09:21, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please define "maximum capacity". There are much, much longer articles on Wikipedia. This could easily be put on that page. So I ask again, why does this have its own article? Reene (リニ) 09:27, Nov 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there are longer articles, but there aren't really supposed to be. It's a guideline that you don't let an article grow past 32KB (unless it's a list), and Autobiography (album) is at that size now. Everyking 09:41, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, where exactly was me doing something "very radical that (you) strongly disagreed with"&#160;? I was attempting to come to what I felt was a reasonable compromise by keeping the content (with some tweaks in favour of NPOV) while moving it to the main article where it belongs. You outright refused this without even seeing what my edit was going to be like (your "all that work for nothing" comment came before I ever edited the page). So I would like to once again repeat: Get off your high horse. I'm getting sick and tired of watching you climb up on some pedestal while placing blame on everyone <i>but</i> yourself. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">Reene (リニ)</a> 09:58, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That isn't where it belongs, Reene. I will carry on no further discussion regarding this issue of merging, because I am flatly opposed to it. I can compromise on matters of article content all day long, but not on the question of whether an article should <i>exist</i>. If you want it gone, list it on VfD and let the community consider the matter. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:02, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The article is protected or I would. And it's good to know you're still so for "work(ing) collaboratively in a spirit of compromise", as statements like "I will carry on <i>no further discussion</i> regarding this issue of merging, because I am <i>flatly opposed to it</i>". Well, I'm opposed to the article existing. So where exactly does that lead us? Your opinion isn't any better than mine or anyone else's.

<dd>I still fail to see the problem with merging it. The information will still be there (minus the POV), it just won't be on a separate article page.

<dd>The information in question relates <i>more</i> to "La La" and <i>less</i> to the album. Otherwise, you probably should merge <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle.html" title="Michelle">Michelle</a> as well, unless somehow notability ("'Michelle' will be remembered 30 years from now and 'La La' won't, so merge 'La La' with the album article but keep 'Michelle' in a separate article") comes into play regarding all this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:26, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
