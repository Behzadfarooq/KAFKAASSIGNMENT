<p>!Hello, the official name is "Bundesautobahn", short: "BAB". Maybe somebody can fix it, my english is to bead to do it, sorry.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article deals not only with the German BAB, but also with Autobahns in other countries, so no change there. IMHO it does not make sense to have separated articles for this. I'll add the official name somewhere in the article --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrysalis_7a31.html" title="User:Chrysalis">Chrysalis</a> 03:41, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Germany, Autobahn and Bundesautobahn are terms with different legal meanings. "Autobahn" (<i>motorway</i>) means that the road is marked with <a href="../../../z/e/i/Image%7EZeichen_330.svg_3099.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b4/Zeichen_330.svg/16px-Zeichen_330.svg.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" longdesc="../../../z/e/i/Image%7EZeichen_330.svg_3099.html" /></a>, which invokes special rules from the German Road Traffic Code (Straßenverkehrsordnung), e.g. regarding speed limits, no parking, etc. OTOH, "Bundesautobahn" (<i>federal motorway</i>) means that it has been dedicated as such, which invokes certain laws on construction and maintanance. Usually, both terms apply to given a strech of highway but there are some roads that are a Autobahn but no Bundesautobahn and vice-versa. -- <a href="../../../3/2/4/User%7E3247.html" title="User:3247">3247</a> 21:44, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Here we have it again: The myth that that Nazis invented the Autobahn...</p>
<p>The first Autobahn (called AVUS in Berlin) was completed 1921.</p>
<p>The term Autobahn was first used 1926 by Robert Otzen (the chairman of a Road constructiong company ?)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleted Paragraph ("10 km of every household")</span></h2>
<p>I deleted the following paragraph from the article, because it was a vast exaggeration:</p>
<p>"During the 1980s, a goal was set in West Germany to provide autobahn access within 10 km of every household, but with the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_reunification.html" title="German reunification">German reunification</a>, most of the construction and funds shifted from the west to the neglected east."</p>
<p>I am not aware of any plans to build "Autobahns" within 10 km of every household - especially not in the 1980s, when financing infrastructure projects in Germany was already a problem. Furthermore, there wouldn't even have been enough demand for so many "Autobahns". The most enthusiastic plans came up in the 1970s and can be seen here: <a href="http://www.autobahn-online.de/karten/" class="external free" title="http://www.autobahn-online.de/karten/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autobahn-online.de/karten/</a> - you'll notice that even those are nowhere near the "goal" of having Autobahns every 20 km. 195.226.183.31 12:22, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>AFAIK plans did exist to provide all households in West Germany access to an autobahn within 10 km. These plans were conceived when Georg Leber was minister of transport (around 1965). Wolf</p>

<p>The article freely mixes "Autobahn" and "autobahn". It would be good to pick one or the other. I'm not changing it because I don't know whether it's more correct to follow the German convention or the English one. Erics 04:00, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to be much more accurate to use English conventions. I'd go further and replace all instances of 'autobahnen' with 'autobahns'. After all, this article is written in English. If the article on <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser.html" title="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> users 'Kaisers' as the plural, then the same should apply here. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 23:38, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just realized that the German plural of Kaiser is in fact 'Kaisers', so please forgive my ignorance. That said, my argument still stands. A Google search restricted to <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> pages for 'Autobahns' yields 24700 results whereas 'Autobahnen' yields 11200 results --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 01:29, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, the plural of "Kaiser" is "Kaiser". "Kaisers" would be genitive singular. But you are right that the plural of "Autobahn" is "Autobahnen", so I changed it in the very first sentence. However, the argument that this is an english text and therefore you should use "autobahns" in the rest of the text seems plausible, so I didn't change anything else. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlosch_d6f1.html" title="User:Flosch">Flosch</a> 22:06, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As explaination that "Autobahnen" is german plural should be okay, in the text we can use "autobahns" as it has been taken into the english vocabulary. btw. "der Kaiser" is one "die Kaiser" are more, Google lies :D so long 84.129.46.149 02:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Autobahn is not a proper noun in english. It should remain autobahn.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bus speeds</span></h2>
<p>In Switzerland, buses are only allowed 100 km/h max on any Autobahn, anything else is plain illegal and if caught, costs way heftier fines than in Germany.</p>
<p><a name="Construction" id="Construction"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Construction</span></h2>
<p>I believe the "Construction" section of the article needs correction and expansion.</p>
<p>PAVEMENT DEPTH</p>
<p>The comparison of pavement depth between 'Autobahnen' and U.S. Interstate highways does not compare like to like. 95% of the pre-war 'Reichsautobahnen' were built with Portland cement concrete, about 8-9" in depth. Most U.S. Interstates built in the 1950's and 1960's using the same material also had slabs 8-9" deep (depending on subgrade conditions), though this has since been increased to 12" to secure a longer life cycle. The main reason so many original concrete 'Autobahnen' are in excellent condition is the Nazis' insistence upon good drainage and granular fill for embankments, combined with light traffic and mild winters in the first years after the roads opened. (It was not uncommon to go for ten to fifteen minutes without seeing another vehicle in either direction.)</p>
<p>The quoted 27" construction depth sounds more characteristic of the 'Autobahn' asphaltic concrete pavement cross-section which was adopted in the Seebohm years following the war. 20-22" is a normal depth for asphaltic concrete in the U.S.A. In actuality there is little difference between U.S. and European procedures for pavement life-cycle cost analysis, although it is true that Europeans tend to use a longer life cycle (typically 40 years versus 20-25 years) in the first instance. Americans will typically build for permanency if a road is expected to have slow traffic growth, but the shorter planning horizon is designed partly to prevent overinvestment in roads which will need radical remodelling due to traffic growth.</p>
<p>GEOMETRIC DESIGN STANDARDS</p>
<p>Nothing is said about design speed classes. There were three in standards published in 1937 and four in standards published in 1942. These classes, which were based on terrain, dictated criteria for maximum grade and minimum horizontal and vertical curve radii. It is not quite correct to say that the maximum grade allowed on 'Autobahnen' was 7%; instead it was 8% for mountain locations under the 1937 standards, and 6.5% for "high mountain" locations under the 1942 standards. The 4% maximum grade applied only to flat-country locations (both 1937 and 1942 standards). The maximum grade on U.S. Interstates, by the way, is 6%, though design exceptions can be obtained for higher grades if adequate justification is provided.</p>
<p>Further information can be found in this post by "J N Winkler" (me writing under a different handle) at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ukroads.plus.com/archive/MotorwayVsAutobahn.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ukroads.plus.com/archive/MotorwayVsAutobahn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukroads.plus.com/archive/MotorwayVsAutobahn.html</a></p>
<p>(Message 30). The information given in the tables is sourced from a Road Research Laboratory publication, 'German State Motor Roads' (H.M.S.O., 1946), which in turn references the actual standards documents.</p>
<p>Nitpick: in English jurisprudence, "mechanically propelled vehicle" can now mean a bicycle. It would be better to say "Motor vehicle" and to mention that motorcycles were forbidden upon the 'Autobahnen'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I'd like to see more of this. It's my understanding that part of the distinction of the Autobahn is the very high standards of design and construction that go into them versus the roads of other countries (at least, higher than those of the US) that make the higher (sometimes unlimited) speed limits feasible. <a href="../../../p/i/m/User%7EPimlottc_9150.html" title="User:Pimlottc">Pimlottc</a>`</dd>

<dd>Just to quickly explain this to those who don't know the background of this major rewrite, this is about a disagreement of the definition of the Swedish word <i>motorväg</i>, an English loanword which is a direct translation of "<a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway.html" title="Motorway">motorway</a>" used in Swedish since 1945 but. It is a general word for any kind of motorway in any country, but is not used as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_noun.html" title="Proper noun">proper noun</a> similar to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobahn.html" title="Autobahn">Autobahn</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autostrada.html" title="Autostrada">Autostrada</a> and is completely non-notable in English. All other definitions of roads in Sweden are merely Swedish language counterparts of similar roads in other countries.</dd>
<dd>E70 feels that since <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorv%C3%A4g.html" title="Motorväg">motorväg</a> shouldn't have its own article (as per the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Motorv%C3%A4g_ac7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Motorväg">VfD</a>), this argument should be extended to all other non-English words as well, no matter if their usage is notable and frequent in English or not.</dd>

<dd>I understand the situation. E70's position is rather silly because he fails to understand Wikipedia's notability policy. Motorvag was deleted because it is not well-known among English speakers, and it is <i>not</i> Wikipedia's job to make it notable. Autobahn is already well-known among English speakers, especially because English speakers find the concept of a freeway without speed limits to be quite fascinating. Autobahn, therefore, should continue to be the subject of its own article. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 12:28, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Contrary to popular belief, it is illegal to flash headlights or left turn signals at a car moving slowly on the left lane. However, this directive is often ignored by motorists in a hurry.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is wrong. Flash headlight or even pushing the horn (out of town) is in Germany an allowed overtaking sign.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Using the horn of flashlights (short use only) is only allowed to signal overtaking if it's possible (i.e. on a road where there is another lane left of the car to be overtaken, be it the same direction or two-way-traffic). If a car is moving in the left lane of the autobahn, it cannot be overtaken, so this could be considered coercion (<i>Nötigung</i>). On the other hand, using the left lane if the right lane is free is also an offense, so the slower car is also using coercion on the faster car. See StVO (German legal code for street usage) §5(5,6), §16 for (slightly unclear) details. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrysalis_7a31.html" title="User:Chrysalis">Chrysalis</a> 05:42, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is legal to flash headlight 'out of town' (ausserhalb geschlossener Ortschaften) in order to signal the intention to overtake. This includes the autobahn. However, flashing light or left turn signal can be understood as coercion when there is no possibility to pull over to the right lane. But normally this behavior goes along with tailgaiting which is fined anyway. Still, you won't get fined for a single flashing light while keeping your distance and free right lane. This is legal according to §5.</p>

<p>Generally, renting is possible by carriers of foreign drivers' licenses. If you move there, you have to go to the driving board and see if your license meets the requirements of International License (meaning they'll issue you a German one without test or lessons). This usualy works for people with other EU driving licenses, since the road signs and many of the rules are the same (not always). Maybe I shouldn't say this, because this is based on some research I did for getting a Dutch drivers' license, and there was some EU info in there that I'm applying to Germany.

Or is this a road with three lanes, and "left lane" really means the middle?? Because there isn't a lane next to the left lane, just a barrier usually. In the US, the right breakdown lane (or the left breakdown if there is one) is usually used by emergency vehicles, and during a jam no-one is supposed to drive in said breakdown lanes for that reason (although some people invariably do anyway).

<dd>The statement is, albeit confusing, absolutely correct. Typically German ;-) This is the clue: The emergency lane emergency vehicles has to be formed between the very left lane and the one to its right. That means: When there are only two lanes, it's simply between the left and the right lane. If there are three lanes, it's between the very left and the middle lane. If there are four lanes, it's between the very left and the second to left lane.</dd>
<dd>The reason why the shoulder lane is generally not used by emergency vehicles is that they would have to cross off-ramps which might be clogged by traffic wanting to leave the congested autobahn, or parties from minor accidents as a consequence from the congestion may have to use the shoulder lane. In short: The shoulder lane might be occupied. -- <a href="../../../u/b/_/User%7EUb_a2a4.html" title="User:Ub">Ub</a> 04:14, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
