<p>"A third and less commonly considered part of the autonomic nervous system is the enteric nervous system, which controls the digestive organs, and is, for the most part, independent of CNS input." - the CNwhat? --GrimRC 86.4.53.107 17:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The enteric nervous system is really a third division that's vagally mediated. It should have its own article Phdotcom 18:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>This page is totally useless. Can we remove the jargon? What the fuck is the splanchnic nerve? Also, is this an original article? Can someone translate this mess? If not, we should just delete it - it'd be easier to do it from scratch. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraft_fc33.html" title="User:Graft">Graft</a></p>
<p>In reality, the article is a concise summary of the ANS. "Graft" is simply over his (presumed) head.</p>
<hr />
<p>With regard to the information contained on this page, I found it very helpful in some research I was doing on particular parts of the nervous system in the lower part of the body. I had not been impressed with Gray's Anatomy in the past, but the way the pictures were presented (in color), along with some of the information here was helpful. Do you think the enteric nervous system should contain a link where it can be talked about more in depth?</p>

<p>A lot of work to be done here...</p>
<p>all of the anatomy and physiology-related articles need to be read and edited to reduce anthrocentrism.

<p>Hello. I added a link to an article by Dr. Gershon, Professor and Chair, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York. I felt it had useful information that helped strengthen the reference to the enteric nervous system made by the original author. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I did not finish reading the article, but just from the first line....it is wrong to classify the autonomic nervous system as the "involuntary" nervous system, and very few functions were listed in the intro. It is true that many autonomic functions are subconcious, but some can be controlled voluntarily, such as micturition. This misinformation is unfortunatly present all too often, even in some basic physiology textboks. I went ahead and changed the first paragraph,</p>
<p><br />
This really needs to be cleaned up, for example the paragraph"Between stressful situations, the body needs to rest, recover, and gain new energy. These tasks are under the control of the parasympathetic system, which lowers the heart rate and blood pressure, diverts blood back to the skin and the gastrointestinal tract, contracts the pupils and bronchioles, stimulates salivary gland secretion, and accelerates peristalsis. The parasympathetic system influences organs toward restoration and the saving of energy." makes it sound like the sympathetic system is not working between stress events when, in fact, it is at work all the time, or else nobody would ever be able to maintain the blood pressure to even stand up.</p>

<p>I think I can help get it into better shape, and I'll keep in mind to put the sources in the right places. I need to take a look at some of the information on Wiki format and procedures first. Would you allow me to take a look around and get a sense of how things work here; then, as soon as I have the time, I will try to move this article a few steps forward?

<p>The PNS is the prehiperal nervous system; not the parasympathetic nervous system.....</p>

..... or it might even refer to the peripheral nervous system. Presumably the prehiperal nervous system applies to the femur? (Only joking before anyone takes me the last sentence to task.) 8=P</p>

<p>I came here by accident and was about to leave when I started to read the artcile.</p>
<p>My first comment is that it ready like a medical textbook. My feeling this can be fine in a medical textbook but it becomes overly terse and inaccessible. Surely not the point of this article. I will come back and rewrite some of the simpler stuff later but for tasters consider:</p>
<p>"The autonomic nervous system regulates bodily functions and the activity of specific organs." Implies that it is the only system regulating bodily functions - which it is not. What is an unspecific organ? It should be some organs! Anyway, it regulates bodily functions through its effect on some systems and organs.</p>
<p>For example, the ANS plays a role in the diameter of blood vessels; heart rate and the force of contraction; pupil diameter; salivation; perspiration; bronchiole diameter; peristaltic movements in intestine; spinctor diameter; erection and ejaculation; parturition; and more." Rather heavy on the semi colon. The comma will do far better here as this is no need for a supercomma and this is not connected sentences. "Plays a role" in the diameter of blood vessels. Very unspecific."Heart rate and the force of contraction"? If it means the contraction of the ventricles it should say so!!</p>
<p>"Although the bodily functions that the ANS regulates are typically portrayed as being outside of voluntary control, they are not completely outside our awareness, and some schools of thought believe that one's state of mind impacts the functioning of the ANS. It remains open to debate whether the term "involuntary" nervous system is a precise description of the ANS. Many autonomic functions are beyond conscious control, but others are impacted voluntarily including the sphincters in urination (micturition)."</p>
<p>What is the point of this? Trying to sound clever? Some schools of thought? It might as well say schools of fish! Who, what, why? "Not completely out of our awareness? For goodness sake my heart jumps in my chest when I am scared! You think we are not aware?</p>
<p>Consider, "Much of the action of the ANS is under involuntary control. Humans are not conscious of many of the functions of the ANS although they become aware of some effects such as the "fight or flight" response (acute stress response). Specialist training can moderate the affects of ANS actions in humans such a a target shooter slowing the heart rate when squeezing the trigger the control of sphincter actions involving defecation and urination (micturation)."</p>
<p>Sorry, gotta hit and run ... so much to do, so little time to do it!</p>

<hr />
<p>It should be considered that the body, especially the ANS (consisting of Sym and PARA components) does not wish anything. It merely responds to the information it recieves. I believe that, although the content of the article contains the basics, it is riddled with teological sentiment. The article may be improved by removing repetition, clarification of tract origins and innervation patterns.</p>
<p>I'll can go along and try to clear up confusing remarks and attempt to clarify the logic in some places. The bulk of the article is anatomically orientated, I'm no anatomist, i'll concentrate more on the physiology.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the discussion and agreeing with most people here that the article was not very useful in its present state, I ventured to rewrite entirely the Introduction and Anatomy. Apologies for this massive intervention. October 22-23rd 2006</p>
<p>November 4th 2006: I changed slightly the structure of the "Function" section (which would really need to be entirely rewritten) and the Overview of Actions that I renamed "Neurotransmitters and Pharmacology".
