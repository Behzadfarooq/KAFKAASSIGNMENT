	    <p>RE: Merging article with Automobile design</p>
<p>I disagree that the articles should be merged. Automobile design is a sub-category of Automotive design as it is the design of a type of road vehicle. I have clarified the definition of Automotive design throughout the article. Automotive design should be a subcategory of Category:Road transport.</p>
<p>I do agree that sections of it could be merged.</p>
<p>The link to the article <a href="../../../e/x/t/Exterior_design.html" title="Exterior design">exterior design</a> is dubious. I feel that this article should be included as a section in Automotive design.</p>

<p>COMMENT:</p>
<p>I also disagree that they should be merged... Automobile design tends to be about designing cars...Automotive design is about designing anything that moves! ie an Automotive designer may design a motorbike or a flying saucer. Of course both words actually mean the same thing but it is more a question of how it is interpreted by industry. --<a href="../../../z/e/d/User%7EZed1_ec54.html" title="User:Zed1">Zed1</a> 11:45, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Zed1</p>
<p>There seems to be slightly differing definitions of automotive depending on what dictionary you use.</p>
<p>The American Heritage and Merriam Webster both have a wide definition like self-propelling vehicle. Which seems to be where you are coming from.</p>
<p>Oxford English Dictionary, Cambridge Dictionary and MSN Encarta all narrow the above down to relating to motor vehicles or more specifically road vehicles. Which is where I was coming from.</p>
<p>These differences are not a personal view for either of us but merely which English dictionary we happen to use. So we are stuck with a quandary about which one is most effective for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Could I suggest that your definition be better disambiguated (if that is a word) to be called transport design or vehicle design (like some of the course titles in links you added). This could be a category which could include a link to <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_architecture.html" title="Naval architecture">Naval architecture</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_design.html" title="Automobile design">Automobile design</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautics.html" title="Aeronautics">Aeronautics</a> (or a new article specifically relating to aircraft design). It could also have a link from the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Portal%7ETransport_0e38.html" title="Portal:Transport">Portal:Transport</a>. I feel this would be good for Wikipedia. Is this agreeable to you? Or perhaps you may have a better idea. Regards --<a href="../../../l/i/h/User%7ELihourj_8141.html" title="User:Lihourj">Lihourj</a> 15:18, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS. I know what you mean about it being more a question of how it is interpreted by industry. Aside from the dictionary definitions I am speaking as someone who works in the automotive industry&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Hi Lihourj</p>
<p>You are right of course, transportation design would be better. I started the automotive article because I was interested in the use of the word ( I also spent most of my life working as an automotive designer and trained as an automotive designer). However only a small percentage of that time was spent working on cars, the rest was on motorcyles, trucks, buses, helicopters etc. I was interested in the word <b>auto-motive</b> because it can be broken down into <b>self-motivated</b>, which then has more to do with art and cutting edge design...are you still with me??? Anyway as a new Wikipedian I had to write something:) Maybe 'automotive design' belongs in a dictionary rather than an encyclopeada??--<a href="../../../z/e/d/User%7EZed1_ec54.html" title="User:Zed1">Zed1</a> 12:04, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hi Zed1</p>
<p>Having done some research on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation.html" title="Transportation">transportation</a> in Wikipedia I have created a <b>Category:Vehicle design</b> that is a sub-category of Category:Transportation. This is a category that covers vehicle design in it's truest sense ie. the profession of creating a means of transportation. I'm sure you have plenty of ideas for pitching into this category. --<a href="../../../l/i/h/User%7ELihourj_8141.html" title="User:Lihourj">Lihourj</a> 16:43, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm an automotive designer (was 12 years with General Motors Design, working in 5 countries) and founder&amp;editor of the industry magazine Car Design News. I would suggest Transportation Design as a top-level category (covering cars, trains, boats, planes etc), with Automotive Design as a subcategory of that. (Automobile Design is an American term, otherwise expressed as Automotive Design internationally in countries that don't commonly refer to cars as 'automobiles'). The international automotive design industry refers mainly to automotive designers, vehicle designers or car designers, and possibly automobile designers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Schools offering courses in car design tend to use a range of course titles including Transportation Design, Vehicle Design, Car Design, Automotive Design. All of these are specialisations of Industrial Design. A manufacturer who is hiring will often require 'a degree in Transportation Design or equivalent...', this being the most wide-ranging description.</p>
<p>I think Automotive Design and Automobile Design should be treated as synonymous. If you are looking for a description of the wider aspects of vehicle development beyond design, then a title such as Automotive Engineering would be more appropriate, rather than using two terms that are so similar.</p>
<p>Concept Cars is definitely a subset of Automotive Design (as would be 'Production Cars' if someone wanted to talk about the other major activity of car designers. The distinction between concept cars and production cars is becoming iuncreasingly blurred as more manufacturers present pre-production cars as 'teasers', under the name of 'concept car'. There are however a lot of non-industry-professional car enthusiasts who have a special interest purely in concept cars, which may justify some special treatment of this category, perhaps under an enthusiast rather than industry-related top category? --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettpat_19e1.html" title="User:Brettpat">Brettpat</a> 19:07, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no clear distinction, and much overlap, between the two in the articles -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 14:10, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that there is a great similarity to the articles. However there <i>is</i> a clear distinction, with overlap, between the two topics. The distinction is that automotive design is for any road vehicle, automobile design is specifically for cars. So the overlap between the articles is car design.</p>
<p>Maybe the automobile design article needs to be edited to remove the overlap to only include unique considerations. The history is certainly unique to the article. --<a href="../../../l/i/h/User%7ELihourj_8141.html" title="User:Lihourj">Lihourj</a> 17:00, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that the focus of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_cars.html" title="Concept cars">concept cars</a> is on the vehicles themselves, while the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automotive_design.html" title="Automotive design">Automotive design</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_design.html" title="Automobile design">automobile design</a> are on the process and people involved. Perhaps there should me more on the "how to do it" in the design article. On the other hand, the concept cars page should also have a "category" listing of the various prototypes themselves. This would help those looking for specific cars -- and may not interested in how design is done. Therefore, I think these are two different approaches and should be kept separate, but linked as appropriate.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/t/Automotive_design.html" title="Automotive design">Automotive design</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_design.html" title="Automobile design">Automobile design</a> are similar and thus could be combined. Right now they have different points of view - more process in the first vs. history in the second.</p>

<ul>
<li>I say no, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_cars.html" title="Concept cars">concept cars</a> are different because while they are definitely related to automotive design they are made to test or showcase new technologies. Automotive design is more about how and what goes into cars to make them more efficient/useful, concept cars are usually showy, decorative and impractical cars.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086">James086</a> 03:26, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>They may have a lot of overlap but they are different topics and should not be merged. <a href="../../../m/c/o/User%7EMcornelius_5e67.html" title="User:Mcornelius">mcornelius</a> 21:34, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've removed the merge tags, consensus clearly being against it. I'd say myself that concept cars serve as teasers for future automobiles, future styles, and future technologies. Automotive design is more related to the styling, and can relate to both concepts and production cars. Much better as two discreet articles, as there's little overlap between the two. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 11:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>I was bold and merged automobile design here. The only unique information ended up being the section now called "History of automobile design in the US". I also cleaned up the rest of the text--there was a lot of repetition. Someone should probably go through and cull the external links--there are a lot of them now. I think off-hand that everything in the "Art &amp; Design schools with degree courses in automotive design" can be removed. <a href="../../../t/o/c/User%7ETocharianne_4249.html" title="User:Tocharianne">Tocharianne</a> 03:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
