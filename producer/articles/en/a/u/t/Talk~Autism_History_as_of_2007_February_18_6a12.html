<h2><span class="mw-headline">section on "Introduction"</span></h2>
<p>I have committed some of the text to related subsections and revised the introduction for synoptic brevity thereby, I hope, reducing the rather scattered approach in the introduction and making it an actual introduction for the remainder of the article. Text has not been deleted as such but relocated. There were some non-Wiki phrases (e.g. "most notably") that was rewritten to simply focus on the content rather than a POV that seemed apparent. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Edits by Q0</dd>
</dl>
<p>The section in Introduction changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Autism</b> refers to a group of <i>diseases or disorders</i> of the development of the human central nervous system that specifically impair social interaction, communication, interests, imagination and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>to</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Autism</b> refers to a group of <i>conditions</i> of the development of the human central nervous system that specifically impair social interaction, communication, interests, imagination and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I infer an attempt to address what is considered to be POV by some people with a vested interest—people who represent another POV in fact. However, the edit now renders the text incoherent and has compromised the facts stated in the original text which can not be considered a candidate for deletion simply because someone disagrees with the facts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A. The reference is to the DSM and the ICD. This is factual.</dd>
<dd>B. Conditions are like weather--everyone expects it to change and be different and there are web sites for day-to-day weather--not Wikipedia however which contains the entire subject rather than small variations. Autism, by comparison, is not an expected variant like daily weather or hair colour. This leads to--</dd>
<dd>C. Unlike the variations in hair colour and weather we see on the street every day and do not record in Wikipedia, diseases and disorders merit comment suitable for Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>D. “Conditions” just does not read coherently.</dd>
<dd>E. The edit is in fact a very definite POV-a POV is now replaced with a POV.</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about: In the scientific and medical literature, <b>Autism</b> refers to a group of <i>diseases or disorders</i> of the development of the human central nervous system that specifically impair social interaction, communication, interests, imagination and activities.</p>
<p>Conversely, <b>Autism</b> may be considered <i>conditions</i> that theoretically involve the development of the human central nervous system. The development may be perceived as a variant of what is statistically typical. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Footnote: We are not going to get into an edit war here. Q0 continues to make valuable contributions and I think everyone here wants to see this article brought up to Wikipedia's highest standards. However, if the above alternative text is not a problem, then I will change it back in the very near future--tomorrow for example--after folks have had a chance to read and ponder. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To start with, I think the new edit makes the header look a bit clumsy. While I'm not sure if I agree with the POV suggestions, I agree that it's fine the way it was before, but because it's easier to read. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#FF8233"><b>Buchanan-Hermit™</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#948663" size="1"><b>?!</b></font></a> 03:37, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"Diseases and disorders" is more specific and should be used. It's simply a more precise term. I see no reason to introduce ambiguities where none existed prior. Also, the usage of "conditions" doesn't really make sense logically. It's very ... odd wording and should be changed back. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><font style="color:blue"><b>.V.</b></font></a> -- <i>(<a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V."><sup>Talk</sup></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V."><sub>Email</sub></a>)</i> 04:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Autism Society of America defines autism as "...a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills." I've edited the intro section for readability, and modifed the first sentence to reflect this very mainstream and hopefully neutral definition. Please note that the first paragraph is shorter because redundancies were combined; no content was excised. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintersmith_afcf.html" title="User:Wintersmith">wintersmith</a> 05:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for showing up and providing your insight and contribution. Wintersmith's edit does make for a smoother read and is more precise.</dd>

<dd>My proposed addition to the opening line:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Conversely, <b>Autism</b> may be considered <i>conditions</i> that theoretically involve the development of the human central nervous system. The development may be perceived as a variant of what is statistically typical."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Would it add to the objectivity of the article and provide a more rounded approach? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 06:10, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have a bit of a beef with the opening line - I'm not positive, but isn't autism a single <i>developmental disorder</i>, and everything else is part of the spectrum? If this is the case, autism is not a group of conditions. I know it's a matter of degree to a certain extent, but there is a definite cut-off, below which it is considered PDD-NOS; Aspergers and Rhetts would not be considered 'autism' per se, but would be on the spectrum. Also, the intro (I'd have to check the policy to be more sure) should be in the intro, the first section of text, and should be a short summary of the article below. There should basically be no references, 'cause all of the information is sourced and referenced in the body text. Though I think the intro was far too long, it should be trimmed but right now it looks like a series of disconnected sentences. I might have a read through and ensure all the info in the intro is also in the text, then try a bit of editing. I'll give the talk page a read before I do anything major though. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 12:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi WLU,</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the literature that I have read thus far refers to it as 'a' disorder, in other words, the idea that it is a single disorder may simply be understood. The definition is, as others have pointed out here and there in Wikipedia, a bit vague. Autism, as you point out, is also a disorder in a class with others which may be different or simply variants of the same thing--that is definitely not established in the literature and is a hot topic of debate to be sure.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The intro formatting--It was getting very cumbersome to edit. If it is not the correct format, do the change. I was hoping to get it sorted out in a brief sentence at the top because the first part of the article was getting very convoluted, redundant and obtuse. If by reference you are referring to the WHO classification,, it does place it on the doorstep, so to speak, and in context while noting the definitive source that provides the definition. I say that because this really is a hot potato on so many levels and the language register Q0 has proposed is both objective and not overly authoritative. It is an important issue and I think it deserves a careful read and edit process. So, ta, WLU. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 08:17, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for bringing this issue to discussion. The reason I changed <i>diseases and disorders</i> to <i>conditions</i> is because the assertion that autism is a disorder or disease is disputed and therefore I did not consider it neutral. I have seen <i>condition</i> used in place of <i>disorder</i> as a way of resolving this issue in the past, so I didn't think it would be a problem here. I thought that the word <i>condition</i> simply means <i>state of being</i> and does not say anything about it being a good state of being or a bad state of being so would cover either perspective of autism. Actually, terms like <i>heart condition</i> are often used to refer to heart disorders, so the word <i>condition</i> has some baggage, but I couldn't think of a better word. Please note that there are two places where <b>autism</b> is introduced: both at the very top of the article, and the top of the section titled <i>Introduction</i>. I used the word <i>condition</i> at the very top but not in the <i>Introduction</i> section. I am less concerned about the <i>Introduction</i> section because it also mentions that some autistic people don't want to be cured, and because it asserts that autism is a developmental disability "... according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases." Even though the classification of autism is disputed, it is not disputed that the WHO classifies autism in that way. However, the way the article is organized, it seems that some people (such as those only skimming articles) might only read the very top sentence without being informed that multiple points of view exist. I would like to suggest the following sentences to be used as an introductory sentence at the top of the article, if people still have a problem with the word <i>condition</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nature of <b>autism</b> is controversial, but the World Health Organization classifies it as a developmental disability of the human central nervous system that specifically affect social interaction, communication, interests, imagination and activities.</li>
<li><b>Autism</b> is classified it as a developmental disability of the human central nervous system that specifically affect social interaction, communication, interests, imagination and activities by the World Health Organization. However, this classification is controversial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could either of these suggestions resolve the above dispute? <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 12:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. But you know, I feel compelled to note the limitation on the scientific definition. It really may mean a mere difference in how the world--human interaction specifically--is perceived. I think my second paragraph nails that. But, you have put a lot in this and I think you want this to be accurate. Let's go with the first one with a short clarification:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The nature of <b>autism</b> (its causes, symptoms, physiology and other issues) is controversial. However, the World Health Organization classifies it as a developmental disability of the human central nervous system that specifically affects social interaction, communication, interests, imagination and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need to delete the WHO ICD classification in the introduction we can make note of the two sides of the issue, possibly using the two paragraphs I have proposed, if that is agreeable. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 08:17, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurodevelopmental_disorders.html" title="Neurodevelopmental disorders">neurodevelopmental disorders</a> will not link to the article (stub actually) within Wikipedia. The article is there if you use the search function. I have checked the formatting and it seems to be OK. Any idea what is wrong? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 08:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The actual page name was <b>N</b>eurodevelopmental <b>Disorders</b> - apparently searching ignores capitals, but wikilinks do not. I moved the page to Neurodevelopmental <b>d</b>isorders and that seemed to fix the links.</dd>
<dd>Unrelated point and personal beef - I've only got experience with autism as a non-controversial diagnosis, where (within scientific literature) is it considered controversial? And I'm not talking about treatments that do and don't work, I understand that the etiology may be controversial, but isn't the straight-up diagnosis of language, social and interest 'impairment' pretty much understood as accurate? If not, could someone direct me to the wikipage so's I can read up on it before stepping in more fully? Thanks. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 13:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RE: unrelated beef. Much of the controversy is over the diagnosis and differentiating the PDD and the ASD (which by the way I am correcting since they are a set and a subset and not synonymous) from other problems. There are groups out there like OTR whose members are dealing with treatable symptoms, conducting clinical trials and lumping autistic people with Fragile-X, schizophrenia etc. The problem is not that they are garbling the message (although that happens) but that their readers are. Another problem is that the entire research as a whole will show a myriad cluster of related terms and guidelines, which are cut and dried until you start reviewing the literature. Autism gets lumped in with other syndromes and the message can become very cloudy. Then there is the degree to which a child shows the symptoms even if everyone is in agreement on what those symptoms are--How many times does a child have to do something to make it abnormally repetitive behaviour? What else might make the child do the same over and over again? Are they non-communicative or just afraid of people for another reason entirely. Much of this is about early diagnosis. Strangely, many autistic people seem to show amelioration of the malady as they age--is this due to the natural process or a misdiagnosis when they were very young?</dd>

<dd>So, not at all clear cut. Basically Einstein made it simple. He noted that no matter how many times experiments showed he was correct, it only took one to prove him wrong. The field is science to be sure, but incontrovertible certainty is surely not scientific. I have seen the definition of many things change in my lifetime and this is one of those things. It is controversial. It is also trivial for those of us who read and try to stay up with the literature in any field. But Wiki is an encyclopaedia and often the trivial (i.e. obvious) to one group is a revelation to another. My two cents. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just so you know I am not being pedantic, but the line in the introduction: "There are numerous theories as to the specific causes of autism but they are as yet unproven (see section on "Causes" below)." is a bit sophomoric. Might be OK for us here but very few diseases are "proven" in relation to cause. It is trivial to point this out. The statement does point out that there are numerous theories so the 'as yet unproven' phrase is redundant.</p>

<p>Ok, the intro is bugging me. It explicitly uses one definition of autism (from WHO and APA), which isn't exactly NPOV, as there are different ways to define it. There are plenty of sites that give introductory definitions of autism and I think it's best if we try and find a middle ground between them. <a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_whatis_home" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_whatis_home" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.autismawarenesscentre.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=42" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autismawarenesscentre.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=42" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/autism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/autism.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.centerforautism.com/whatisautism/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.centerforautism.com/whatisautism/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/autism/article_em.htm#Autism%20Overview" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/autism/article_em.htm#Autism%20Overview" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/whatisit/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autismspeaks.org/whatisit/index.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/autism/article.htm#1whatis" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medicinenet.com/autism/article.htm#1whatis" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>I don't completely understand what you are suggesting. When I looked at the websites you gave, the descriptions of autism were mostly the same as the WHO and APA's definition. I know that the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurodiversity.html" title="Neurodiversity">neurodiversity</a>/<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_rights_movement.html" title="Autism rights movement">autism rights movement</a> consider autism to be a healthy variation in neurological hardwiring. I know that <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Baron-Cohen_24c1.html" title="Simon Baron-Cohen">Simon Baron-Cohen</a> had a theory that autism is a hyper-masculinization of the brain. I realize that there are many more ideas and opinions about what autism is than the models I know about. The <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">causes of autism</a> writes about some models of autism. However, I think it might be worth having a models of autism article. What do you think would be helpful to make the introduction more NPOV? Should it describe more models than just the WHO/APA's definition of autism? Should it describe only the WHO/APA's model of autism, but mention that other models exist and/or that the definition of autism is controversial? Should a models of autism article be created and should the introduction link to that article? Should the article introduce autism as something with many definitions and much controversy about what exactly autism is and then describe how the different definitions are similiar and how they are different? <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 08:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure if V-Man737's comment is reply to my comment or to James Duggan's comment. The way I see it: experts can be factually incorrect and the opinions of experts are still just opinions. I believe expert POV is still POV. I believe it is POV for Wikipedia to assert a considered expert's assertion as a fact in cases where concerned parties have disputed the considered expert's assertion. I think the introduction is acceptable as it is since, however, since it asserts that the WHO and APA have made a particular assertion, instead of asserting the WHO and APA's assertion as fact. I think it is appropriate, however, to describe the WHO/APA's model of autism first since that is the most well known model, and Wikipedia's NPOV policy is to give priority to more well known POVs. However, I still think it should be acknowledged that not everyone agrees with the WHO and APA's definition of autism. I think the way the introduction is currently written is good enough since it says that a number of issues are controversial and mentions at the end of the introduction that some autistic people don't consider autism a disorder. However, if people feel that more sides of the debate need to be represented, I would be open minded to amending the introduction to reflect this. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 09:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Sensory diet is NOT about special foods, if you look at the page on Sensory Integration Disorder, sensory diet is about taking sensory breaks. This means taking the time to use a therapy ball, a swing, take a walk, other activities. "Snacks" are less intrusive ones such as chewing gum or using a chewy tube.</p>

<p>The text refers to a source with the statement: "The method that has been best documented to show positive results is Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA),[29] which systematically breaks down and teaches tasks.</p>
<p>The citation says " "This study corroborates earlier studies showing the power of early intensive behavior analytic intervention," said Howard, the study's principal investigator. "It is important because it is one of only a few studies in which the ABA intervention was delivered through a community- based, rather than a university-affiliated program. These results signal the potential for delivering effective intervention without the resources of a university-based clinic."</p>
<p>It does not say it is the best documented. In fact it says there are few studies like it. It goes on to say: " "The study is also noteworthy because it is only the second one to compare the common practice of combining multiple treatment approaches ("eclectic" treatment) with a cohesive approach based on the science of applied behavior analysis,""</p>

<dd>This has been brought up in the past (the <a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">author</a> is a Wikipedia editor).

<dd>I think there are a number of problems with this.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It relies on genetic analysis which has been done. That analysis shows--to date--that Neanderthals and humans are divergent species and that humans are not progeny of Neandethals (but see <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061116083223.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061116083223.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> "Neanderthal Genome Sequencing Yields Surprising Results And Opens A New Door To Future Studies").</li>
<li>The description of autistic behaviour and the comparison with Neanderthal behaviour is reliant on sheer speculation (which is the beginning of much scientific endeavour to be sure but . . ) and this speculation then becomes the basis for more speculation. The Neandethals have been dead a long time ergo no living examples with which to compare archaeological and paleo-anthropological data, This means using unproven premises for yet more unproven assertions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a fascinating idea. Would make a great movie. That is not a slam by the way.</p>
<p>There is also the idea that autistic people (specifically those with Asperger Syndrome) are and have been what would be called wizards, priests and bards in the old days. This makes me think of the theory--referenced in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> article-- that Henry Cavendish had Asperger's. Fascinating but in the end what we do know is limited to this--Asperger Syndrom people may be intellectually very advanced but they are not likely to want to communicate with others about their work and that means they remain hidden from observation which in turn means a dearth of information from which to derive descriptions. Given that alchemists and those labelled wizards were notorious for being socially isolated, this may be a fascinating idea but there is very little we can do with it until someone steps forward in a reputable forum to deal with it.</p>
<p>I have been trying to find a reputable source positing a link between autism and Neanderthals but so far no luck. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it will take some more time before anything is published by a reputable source, but it will be sooner or later. The Neanderthal nuclear-DNA project and large autism genomes will eventually provide the data to definitely prove (or disprove) it. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 19:11, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of info</span></h2>
<p>I removed: <i>By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words or turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is "no." It should be noted, however, that late language development does occur in a minority of neurotypical children.</i></p>
<p><i>Speech development in people with autism takes different paths than the majority of neurotypical children. Some remain mute throughout their lives with varying degrees of literacy; communication in other ways—images, visual clues, sign language, and typing may be far more natural to them. Contrary to the prevailing traditional stereotype of mute people with Kanner-type autism, around one third of people diagnosed with this type of autism will develop what is often viewed as dysfunctional verbal language, relying on rote learned stored phrases, songs, jingles and advertisements. The earliest published autobiographical account of this is Donna Williams first book, "Nobody Nowhere", (1991). Those with the autism spectrum condition of Semantic Pragmatic Disorder fall into this group.</i></p>
<p><i>Those who do speak sometimes use language in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat a mimicked phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong tonal sense, and can often understand at least some spoken language whilst others can understand language fluently.</i></p>
<p><i>Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining typical conversations. The "give and take" of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in "parallel monologue"—taking turns expressing views and information.[citation needed] Just as "neurotypicals" (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic body languages, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.</i></p>

<p>I went to the site. At the top it states, "Autism Spectrum Disorders (from NIMH) - Part 1," and "This brief overview of autism from the NIMH covers the symptoms, treatments, and research findings."

<li>B. attribute the source correctly--NIMH is a higher authority than Doctor's Lounge.</li>

RE: Spelling. Some one is going through this and changing the English to American. Now I have a great respect for Daniel Webster and his towering intellect but he was grossly misguided in this. This version of Wikipedia is the English version not American dialect version and, as a Yank of the old school, this is an issue upon which I suggest POMS and Commonwealthers not even waste their time. Anyone wants to spend their time and go through and change the spelling to follow this rather small detail is welcome--but I am not going to alter it to what is a regional variation with a very short history in comparison with the proper spelling. The article Kanner wrote, by the way, that kicked this off--it was published in Britain. I say leave it be with proper English spelling. And too, 'Z' is just damned ugly, the less we use it the better. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 00:16, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Not sure what they are saying, each occurrence of a year with a full date must be linked to the great Wikipedia database in the Sky? OK. Seems like a lot of effort for a puzzling and small thing.

<p>RE: Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was Ferdinand Magellan, instead of using the heading ==Magellan's journey==, use ==Journey==.[?]</p>

<p>Regarding the observation: “Per WP:WIAFA, this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long- consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per Wikipedia:Summary style.[?]”</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have noticed how long these things get. The single column style we are pinned to does not help either. Another aspect of the article is that it provides (it is our intent anyway to provide) well demarcated sections that can be referenced quickly from the TOC. Since this is not a book and the reader can not glance quickly at the subheadings (you see one frame at a time) the TOC helps expedite this with hyper-linking. Merging the different sections, though some may need it, will obscure the advantage this technology provides and the purpose of the entire encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 00:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the admonition to “Watch for redundancies that make the article too wordy instead of being crisp and concise. (You may wish to try Tony1’s redundancy exercises.)”</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We are trying to be sure. However, there is a cohesive aspect to redundancy that is important in any text so eliminating it entirely would compromise the cohesion as well as the coherence of the text. I refer to the work of, notably, MAK Halliday. I’ll run over to Tony’s place and see what I can see. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 00:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With reference to the assertion, “Vague terms of size often are unnecessary and redundant - “some”, “a variety/number/majority of”, “several”, “a few”, “many”, “any”, and “all”. For example, “All pigs are pink, so we thought of a number of ways to turn them green.””</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is good they said “are often unnecessary”. At some point the article could get bogged down with numbers and that would be a distracting thing, too. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 00:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been working on doing a minor copyedit of the article. However, I don't want to step on any toes, so feel free to change any of my edits you feel are out of place. I haven't read all of the comments here on the talk page, so I'm trying not to make any changes in content right now.</p>
<p>I did add that public awareness might be one cause among many for the increase in diagnosis, however this is from my personal thinking and is not a sourced addition. It just seems obvious that as people are more aware, they bring possible cases to the attention of doctors more often. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 02:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">photo in history</span></h2>
<p>Why do we have a photo of Hans Asperger and not Leo Kanner? Asperger syndrome already has it's own page and his picture should be on that page. This page, to my understanding, is about Kanner's autism, so his picture should be used, not Asperger's. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>James</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>Duggan</b></font></a> 20:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can't agree. It should be both of them. Dubhagan deleted Asperger in favour of Kanner. I think Dubhagan was half right. This is not at all uncommon, two or more people coming up with the same idea at nearly the same time. Asperger's work was hidden by a rather significant period of political turmoil and while that was going on, his work at home did progess although the audience was rather limited. I say put both in. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 03:41, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but Asperger's form of Autism has it's own article.

Imagine Issac Newton being pictured for say, his work in alchemy (which was the primary emphasis of much of his working life) and only a brief mention for Principia Mathematica, calculus etc.--he is in one so he can not be in both.

<p>Does the fact that the article continuously refers to people as "autistic" bother anyone but me? I am a special education major and the first thing we are taught is to refer to people first, and their disability second. It shouldn't be "autistic people". It should be "people with autism".

<dd>People with autism, kinda like people with AIDS. Just because you're told to say it one way doesn't mean that's the only way to say it. The people who believe that autism is a part of who they are prefer autistic people, while others believe it is a disability that can be cured prefer people with autism, as in it's not an integral part of the person. I'm with Malangthon on this in that since both are recognized (depending on who you talk to), both should be used. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>James</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>Duggan</b></font></a> 04:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, if it means anything, I have severe ASD, and I am high functioning in communication. If you want it from the horse's mouth, then here it is... We don't really care what you call us, we're just the same as anyone else. You can call a brick a diamond if you feel so inclined, it doesn't really do anything but make the intent more difficult to decypher. The best words to use are the simplest, and most to the point. "Autistics" is fine for all I care.

<dd>~points to what James Duggan said~ Yes. For the record, I am autistic, and I insist on being called an autistic person, not a person with autism. I agree with ReignMan that it should not matter as long as we are respected as people; I don't really care whether you call me an Indian or a Native American, for isntance. However, language shapes thought and right now there are an awful lot of people out there who would like to make us "persons without autism" by any means necessary. That's the politicized or power-dynamic reason for saying "autistic person". Look back a few years and you will see that there were people who honestly believed that Indians should be regarded as "persons with Indian" (they didn't say it that way), and that they could take the Indian-ness out of us <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlisle_Indian_School_0104.html" title="Carlisle Indian School">in those schools</a>. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 05:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Paragraph 1 no sources</li>
<li>Paragraph 2 is supported but is this the correct place for a comment on obsessive behaviour about food? Is ther a theory that explains this obsession with regard to the senses?</li>

<dd><i>Rolling Stone</i> in its landmark article "The Kids with the Faraway Eyes" (8 March 1979 by Donald Katz) mentioned that one of the families told of having visited by a Native American friend whose traditional background held that autistic kids were "inspired". It is true that many Native traditions respect mentally ill and retarded persons, but there's probably been tons of bilge written about their place in the actual society and culture.
