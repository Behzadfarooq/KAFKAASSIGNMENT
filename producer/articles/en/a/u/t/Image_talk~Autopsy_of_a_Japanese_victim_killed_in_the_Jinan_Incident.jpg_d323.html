	    <p>Chinese and Western sources I got from my library use this photo as the vivisection example. They made no mention that it was a japanese corpse lying on the table. Googling reveals only around five links had "山東省動乱記念写真帖" as the source. Care to explain? Stop orphaning images. --Waliwali</p>
<p>As I said before, the principle of the benefit of the doubt should be applied. There are many propaganda photos by Chinese that have wrong captions, are trimmed to mislead people, or are even manipulated. We have to suspect these photo by default.

<dd>Good. You listed the list of books calling it "vivisection". Then what supports your claim? Photos don't tell enough. It's easy to mislead people with wrong captions. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 23:06, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He only listed the supportes of his claim. He don't prove the reality of the photo at all. I asked "Who?" Of course, it doesn't mean, "Who supports your claim?" but "Who took the photo?"

<p>The image in question is already tagged as disputed. If you are trying to use it for some kind of demonstration, then you need more elaboration than this ungrammatical sentence:</p>
<p><i>Chinese activists show photos of unknown origin as that of Unit 731. Some of them have already turned out wrong and others remain doubtful.</i></p>
<p>Who are the "Chinese activists"? How are you so sure this photo came from these unspecified "Chinese activists"? Which photos are wrong? How are they doubtful? If these weasel terms are not replaced by facts, then I don't see how the sentence belongs.</p>
<p>It would benefit your little demonstration here to put up photos that have been proven by western sources to be false.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 01:17, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Every photo is doubtful by default, of course and Chinese activists include Iris Chang. Photos don't tell enough. It's easy to mislead people with wrong captions. The best way to solve the problem is to find the primary sources, and it's your duty!</dd>
<dd>This is the photo that was shown in a book by communists and become a focus of criticism about 20 years ago. It's impossible to access to 山東省動乱記念写真帖 but it's sure that the photo is of 1928. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 23:06, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You need to provide a credible source that shows all of these photos can be doubted, and specifically, the one posted on the page (not the vivisection one on images for deletion), is not by Unit 731. Once you provide this information, please then use it to expand the the sentence you added:</p>
<p><i>Chinese activists show photos of unknown origin as that of Unit 731. Some of them have already turned out wrong and others remain doubtful.</i></p>
<p>I told you that this sentence is overly generalized and not backed up by sources or examples and is therefore unnacceptable. What do you say of this? You didn't answer.</p>
<p>Again, you have failed to prove that these photos originated from "Chinese activists", and since you came up with Iris Chang, that these photos came from Iris Chang. If the photo on ifd is from a "book by communists", name the book and document any criticisms. Back your word with your own sources. You have the burden of proof. What you are advocating now is somewhere in the lines of "All Japnese people are imperialist propagandists. None of their edits should be trusted. We should revert all their edits by default and have them prove that they are telling the truth". That's not going to work. It is up to you to provide reasons for doubting certain images. Oh, and note, right wing Japanese websites will not work. The source must be unbiased. Dont make me quote the People's Daily. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 23:42, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You keep Chinese claims until they are disproved but delete Japanese claims until they are proved. Jiang's nice double standard! My sentence is valid until your claim is proved. And I've never said these photos "originated" from Chinese activists. The book is "悪魔の飽食". It has already been explained by Kadzuwo.</p>
<p>You failed to understand my pretty simple logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is far easier to fabricate photos than prove they are fabricated.</li>
<li>So you have first to prove it is real.</li>
<li>Then in my turn. I have to prove it is not real.</li>
</ul>
<p>You like to label people arbitrarily as "authoritative", "right wing", "imperialist" etc. I'm not interested in such a labbelling. What I want is evidences and reasoning. This time I focus on photos, so we are immune from long and boring debates. If they are concrete proofs, they must be clear to everyone, not only to the "authorities". --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 03:14, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not against you having adding commentary the the "politicization of history" section explaining how people have been manipulating photos and history to achive their aims. However, I will repeat again - the sentence you added was overly general and therefore cannot be accepted. If you want to show everyone that the Chinese are making stuff up, then cite a credible authority and provide concete examples - photos that have been proven to be wrong, not ones that you suspect are wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your claim that I keep Chinese claims until they are disproved but delete Japanese claims until they are proved, I don't see it. First, I am not keeping the Chinese claims, per se, and it was I who added "disputed" to the caption of the first image. I have no problem with images being tagged as disputed, only when images tagged as "propaganda" with no backing and no proof that they are indeed propaganda. Second, I am not against mentioning the Japanese claims, but if you are to mention them, do it right (see paragraph above) and do demonstrate why such claims can be considered reasonable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, we ask that you provide a source that should lead us to doubt these photos. Surely if this "propaganda" is a common phenomenon, commentary on this issue would surely be found. Are you having trouble finding this? As for the source of the photos, I agree that we need to find its original source. I suggest that Waliwali look up where these texts got these photos in the first place. However, this is no excuse for deleting them (as long as they're tagged as disputed and cited as unit731/100 in a somewhat credible published book) and no excuse for labelling them as propaganda. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 05:07, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, I don't say that they are cooked up by Chinese. It may be true and may not be true. I said, "Chinese activists show photos of unknown origin as that of Unit 731." This sentence is perfectly true until you find the origins.</p>
<p>There need some evidences to claim something is "disputed". One can "claim" everything: "The earth is flat." "Black is white." But it is unnecessary for Wikipedia to deal with these claims. Currently, I get no information except that these photos are "claimed" to be the truth.</p>
<p>I've already mentioned to its origin. As I said before, the book showing the photo was bashed in Japan two decades ago. The error was admitted by the communist writers, so it is never shown in Japan today. I don't see why Chinese still show this photo.</p>
<p>There may be people who are not informed that the earth is round and belive that the earth is flat. And they don't offer any evidence to support their belief or even don't discuss it because they take is for granted. Maybe Wikipedia should say, "Whether the earth is round or flat is disputed." --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 02:38, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You call the photo posted there and "example", therefore you imply that there really is a dispute over that photograph, with both sides providing arguments for their claims. This is not the case, but rather one where we just don't have the evidence either way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I repeat: if you dont expand upon that single ungrammatical sentence and provide details on these "Chinese activists," what exactly they have done, and evidence of their activites, then we can't accept it at all. What you have written there is completely unsubstantiated on that page. If you feel it is substantiated, then do substantiate it. <b>on the article itself</b> Do you copy?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It appears that you are the one failing to provide evidence as to why those photos are "doubtful". If it's a book, give the title.

<p>There are two photos. Do you need more? I show them here. Iris Chang did. So do other Chinese that run questionable websites. Do you need more?</p>
<p>Again. It's you who have to prove, and you failed. If you cannot prove they are real, then don't show them (even under the "disputed" tag). I get no information except that these photos are "claimed" to be the truth.

<li>Don't you see what I said? Unless adequate information is provided, we cannot check your claim. But, O.K. I cannot expect you to do so. It's my turn.</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~sus/horrible.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~sus/horrible.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, this photo was originally shown in 山東省動乱記念写真帖 by 青島新報社 (1928) as an autopsy on a Japanese victim killed by the Chinese, at Jinan Hospital in May 1928. And the magazine ゼンボウ reported it in April 1983 and June 1985. Since, unlike the Chinese claim, the source book is identified, this is convincing. And if that book contains the photo, it cannot be a photo of Unit 731 regardless of the validity of the caption because 1928 is too early for Unit 731. The only thing I have to do is to check them. Unfortunately, my neighborhood libraries don't have either. But I confirmed that the Toyo Bunko stocks 山東省動乱記念写真帖 <a href="http://61.197.194.9/Database/MC_JP_QueryResult.php?sw1=%E5%B1%B1%E6%9D%B1%E7%9C%81%E5%8B%95%E4%B9%B1%E8%A8%98%E5%BF%B5%E5%86%99%E7%9C%9F%E5%B8%96&amp;sw2=&amp;sw3=&amp;andor=AND&amp;iStart=1&amp;iStop=30&amp;iPage=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://61.197.194.9/Database/MC_JP_QueryResult.php?sw1=%E5%B1%B1%E6%9D%B1%E7%9C%81%E5%8B%95%E4%B9%B1%E8%A8%98%E5%BF%B5%E5%86%99%E7%9C%9F%E5%B8%96&amp;sw2=&amp;sw3=&amp;andor=AND&amp;iStart=1&amp;iStop=30&amp;iPage=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. So I hope someone who lives near Tokyo verify it.</li>
<li>Next. We can gain a certain level of information from the photo itself. First, she wears white socks and there seems a slit. Apparently, they are <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabi.html" title="Tabi">Tabi</a>, traditional Japanese socks. And the men bihind her. They don't look experimenters on a human body at all! Maybe a man in a suit with a hat openly performed a top-secret operation. Rather, it exactly matchs the description of the autopsy at Jinan Hospital. Quote from 済南事件を中心として by 小川雄三 (1928):
<dl>
<dd>...死体は済南病院に運び、我軍隊、警察側と支那側との立会いの上検死を遂げたが... (...[Japanese] corpses were carried to Jinan Hospital and were autopsied with the presence of our military men, policemen, and Chinese representatives...)</dd>
</dl>

<li>In fact, the man in the left dresses in military uniform but other do not.</li>
<li>Thus I conclude that this is an autopsy on a Japanese victim killed by the Chinese, at Jinan Hospital in May 1928. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a></li>
<li>Angela, don't move this discussion. Many multimedia stuffs have been uploaded to Wikipedia, but there seems no policy on their file names.

<li>I dont't think I have to get involved in your labelling game. It is unlikely that one makes reference to a real book that doesn't really contain what he says. After hard days, I fitted in a visit to a library and browsed the magazine ゼンボウ. It picked out the topic twice (April 1983 and May 1985). The former article was about mass killing of Japanese residents by the Chinese and the latter specifically dealt with the photo in question. Page 71 of the former shows the one. It isn't exactly the same with the photo in question, but the same men at the same place are shown. The victim also seems the same person. It seems to have been taken slightly after the photo in question was taken. And page 24 of the latter article contains the exactly the same photo. According to ゼンボウ, it was borrowed from 福田勝之, whose father 津次 had been a police officer of the Japanese Foreign Ministry residing in Jinan. Also, the first photo taken from 山東省動乱記念写真帖 at page 72 was of the same postmortem. Now the photo is identified.</li>
<li>Renaming. It should be renamed to something like: "autopsy_on_a_Japanese_killed_in_the_Jinan_Incident" (too long?). --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 04:56, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>What is the political bias of ゼンボウ? Can it be trusted? Trusted above Waliwali's sources? Should I doubt it with the same reasoning you doubted Waliwali's sources? Calling it "autopsy" is enough, given that what the picture is showing is still in dispute?--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 02:19, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have no idea how people can bias this kind of plain facts, and I don't see why you place importance on books without concrete info (yeah, your brazen manner amazed me). But I let you know that for your interest. ゼンボウ was an anti-communist magazine. But the article in May 1985 quoted an article titled "「細菌戦実験」の写真は疑問" by the JCP supporter 江口圭一 taken from Asahi Journal on December 14 1984.</li>
<li>I have new information about the photo. According to ゼンボウ, the name of the victim 東條孫太郎 is shown on the back of the photo. In the meanwhile I found a news report by 青島新報 on June 7 1928 at <a href="http://www.jacar.go.jp/index_e.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jacar.go.jp/index_e.htm" rel="nofollow">Japan Center for Asian Historical Records</a>. (You can access to it by: <small>Layered Search -&gt; The Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -&gt; Records of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -&gt; "A Politics, diplomacy/Category 1 Imperial diplomacy" -&gt; Section 1 China -&gt; [Search] -&gt; 15. Jinan Incident / Documents relating to Anti-Japanese Movement and Boycott, Vol. 1 -&gt; 5. 2. From May 4, 1928 to May 15, 1928 -&gt; 10th among 53 images</small>) And the 38th image is the list of the victims. You can see the names 東條彌太郎 and his wife キン. Apparently he was the same person with 東條孫太郎. Piecing all stuffs together, we can identify the victims. <a href="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~sus/seinan.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~sus/seinan.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> was 東條キン and <a href="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~sus/seinan2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~sus/seinan2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> was 高熊ムメ.

<hr />
<p>Jiang, haven't you read my comment? It was I who concluded that the victim in the photo was Tojo Yataro, and my conclusion was drawn from various sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>the website I mentioned</li>
<li>Zembo's two articles</li>
<li>Asahi Journal's article quoted by Zembo</li>
<li>news reports by 青島新報 right after the incident</li>
<li>MOFA's documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, the features of the three victims in the photos exactly correspond to the accounts of that news report (You can verify it by yourself in the procedures I explained before).</p>
<p>You only mentioned to ゼンボウ with the labbel "right-wing" and ignored the rest. Now your intention is obvious. I feel disgusted with your nasty labelling. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 04:01, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How did I ignore the rest? Are you denying that the publication mentioned is not right wing? You may label the sources that claim this photo is of Unit 100 if you can come up with a truthful term to use. Using ad hominem attacks does not excuse the truth. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 04:31, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't use sophistry. The main theme is that this photo is not of Unit 731 but of the Jinan Incient, which has already been pointed out by others. The identification of the victimes is an outlying stuff. Anyway, I don't think the 10th article bans research. If your edit is based on more than one source, then it needs some extra work to integrate them (and it's not a primary research). And I don't hesitate to reflect additional info I found.</p>
<p>And you missed the point again. You tried to make the plain fact look like just a claim that is advocated only by "right-wing" groups (as my list indicates, it's wrong). You did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Image:Autopsy_of_a_Japanese_victim_killed_in_the_Jinan_Incident.jpg&amp;diff=3697194&amp;oldid=3666796" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Image:Autopsy_of_a_Japanese_victim_killed_in_the_Jinan_Incident.jpg&amp;diff=3697194&amp;oldid=3666796" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, saying "balance it out." You have a different sense of balance. I can't believe detailed info about the photo itself is equal to the list of books that just "claim" without its source. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 02:38, 26 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You still don't get it, do you? I'm not reverting the photo. I removed it myself. I'm removing your overgeneralized and unsubstantiated additions to the article. If you want to support your view, illustrate it with details and back it up with credible sources. If the photo is about the Jinan Incident, then perhaps it is on the wrong page?</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fundamental problem you made is that you try to show these photo in the context of Unit731 itself. But as I said dozen of times, they don't have foundations adequate enough to be dealt with in Wikipedia.

<p>You tend to divert subject. You accused me of making the history section not so good when we are talking about whether to separate Tibet and the TAR.

<li>the content of the passage itself</li>

<dd>If you really had a case, you would be able to insert these generalizations without controversy. However,this topic is controversial. Controversial facts need to be attributed and alternative views given for there to be NPOV. It doesn't mean providing one part of the story as an universal truth.

<p>That's your task. Deleting content isn't what you are expected to do.</p>
<p>Once again. I clarify my requests. I hope you will answer one by one.</p>

<li>Do you have any opinion on where to put the passage, in other words, whether the subject belongs to the policial exploitation of Unit 731 or to Unit 731 itself?</li>
<li>Don't put another photo (the unidentified one) on the top of the page. Since it is much easier to fabricate such a photo than identify them, we need sufficient ground.</li>
<li>Do you have any opinion on the content of the passage itself?</li>

<p>Is this article (photo aside) actually disputed by anyone other than Nanshu? One person should not be able to just add "disputed" to an article and then start disputing it (as has happened in this case). As we know, anyone can dispute anything, but the "disputed" link should be added where there is dispute from a significant percentage of readers.</p>
<p>"An example of doubtful photos" is definitely unreasonable WP style. The article is about Unit 731, not about disputes over what a particular photo represents.</p>
<p>Quoting other doubtful photos is also not relevant to the article, and does not help with the dispute either way.</p>
<p>Ambiguous photos are not evidence, but a photo and a caption does carry a powerful message - so how about wording its caption along the lines of "image showing vivisection at Unit 731, claimed by &lt;insert best available source&gt; to be accurate, disputed by &lt;insert best available source&gt;". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMat-C_07e7.html" title="User:Mat-C">Mat-C</a> 23:41, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article about Unit 731 should mention political exploitation of it.

<p>Personally I find Nanshu's evidence persuasive, and I don't see any interesting contrary evidence given here. However, I still have a concern based on the photo itself. You can see that the victim's hands are tied by a strap to something outside the photo. If you look really carefully about 1-2cm up from the end of the trousers, I <i>think</i> that you can also see straps around the ankles. So the question is: if this person is dead, why is he tied down? I don't know anything about autopsies so maybe there is a reason related to <i>rigor mortis</i>. Just asking. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 03:40, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
