<p>This website outlines information that would be pertinent to someone wanting to know exact details about autism. It begins with a working definition of the disorder which includes the notion that each diagnosis falls along a spectrum. This is followed by a brief history of the disorder in which the reader can learn who introduced the term infantile autism and how many children suffer from the disorder. Finally, a list and explanation of symptoms is provided including social symptoms, communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors, and high versus low functioning.</p>

<p>This website is a resource for those who want to teach children with autism. Although it is geared towards <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">teachers</a>, it is also an effective website for parents of children with autism. After a brief introduction as to what the disorder entails, the site goes on to explain general guideline considerations and instructional content that would be useful (for example, providing structure in the environment, with clear guidelines regarding expectations for appropriate and inappropriate behavior). This is followed by both communication and motivational issues that need to be considered, and finally, the importance of Positive Behavioral Support (PBS).</p>

<p>This website explores how dietary intervention therapy can be used as a treatment method to reduce and alleviate the symptoms of autism. The author is a <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrition.html" title="Nutrition">nutritional</a> researcher who has an adopted daughter with the disorder and has chosen to implement this practice to help her child thrive. She goes on to explain about <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin.html" title="Vitamin">vitamin</a> deficiencies in our society and how certain foods, if eliminated from the diet of an autistic child, can help to improve his functioning levels. An example of this would be the successful results of a <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutein.html" title="Lutein">lutein</a>-free diet.</p>
