<h2><span class="mw-headline">Audiosparx</span></h2>
<p>Hi...did you delete the "AudioSparx" page I added yesterday and again today? AudioSparx was the very first ecommerce digital audio site on the Internet, so it has historical significance. While I am definitely affiliated with it, the information in the article is entirely relevant. If you think AudioSparx should not be present in Wikipedia, then please explain to me why SoundDogs is permitted to be present.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Quinn Coleman quinn@navarr.net</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I did mark those for deletion, though somebody else (I know not who) performed the actual removal. The page you bring up for <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sounddogs.html" title="Sounddogs">Sounddogs</a> seems to merit some review. I'm trying to wade through precendents right now on company deletion, and will likely mark that page to be deleted with discussion. Based on what's up there, I'm not sure it belongs either. If it is kept, then I suggest you re-create Audiosparx. Please be mindful of the format and content of the page if you do recreate, however. I do recall it sounding distinctly Advertising Material like... actually, from previewing I can see you've already re-created it. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 18:01, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Just thought I'd let you know: Having run across the Sounddogs page at random, I've nuked most of it (the POV-ish parts, at least). I have also removed the {prod} tag because of the rewriting. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai"><font color="darkblue"><b>Ourai</b></font></a> <sup><span><a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOurai_765c.html" title="User talk:Ourai">т</a></span></sup> <sub><span style="position: relative; left: -9px; margin-right: -45px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ourai_9e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ourai">с</a></span></sub> 22:17, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Autocracy, I'm still scratching my head about the deletion of AudioSparx page but the continuing existence of the SoundDogs page. I'm new to wikipedia so I'm trying to learn as quickly as I can how things work here. Now I see that recreation of the AudioSparx page has been blocked, however, the SoundDogs page has not been deleted. I based the structure of the AudioSparx page almost exactly like the SoundDogs page, since I'm just learning how to work Wikipedia and figured I would use an existing model only as a starting point. Can you help me? AudioSparx.com (aka UltimateSoundArchive.com) was the first ever site on the Internet to sell digital audio download content (Aug. 1996) - in the scheme of man's progress, that is a historically significant achievement worthy of mention in this encyclopedia of knowledge. <small>unsigned comment of User:Qdogquinn</small></p>
<hr />
<p>The user noted above did some cleanup on it, which removed my original reason for marking it for deletion. Right now, though, it is being discussed to reach a concensus about whether the article should be kept. My suggestion to you is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the article for Audiosparx sounding closer to the current "de-advertised" Sounddogs page.</li>
<li>Do whatever you can to find press articles, mentions by other websites, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sounddogs.html" title="Sounddogs">Sounddogs</a> survives its deletion review, or you have strong notable sources (newspapers, independent trade mags, "who's who" entry...), I'll try and step up to bat for you. Consider also that incorporation information, etc. may be helpful (must be filed so it can be verified with the record keeping source). Keep in mind I can't promise anything, but as you can see here, I do make all the effort I can to bring up an issue that I believe has merit of at least discussion. As you can also see, sometimes these issues get very heated... <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 07:06, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Based upon what to me was a clear concensus in "Steak and Blowjob Day" that it should stay deleted, I moved to discuss Internatlonal Talk Like a Pirate Day as the same logic applied to that as the previous article in question. In the short time it was in AfD, one user pointed out a tool from Google I wasnt familiar with which brought up relevant articles which should be cited in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day_2b40.html" title="International Talk Like a Pirate Day">international Talk Like a Pirate Day</a> page.

<dd>Citing your RfA is on point to my defense in a case of immediate blocking. It is also citing a pattern of action over a period of time. More than anything else, I still have no reason to believe that the block made was in anyway upholding the spirit of this site. Even blatant vandalism gets a first warning, and usually a shorter block than was given me. Talk first, block only to prevent clear intent to continue acting with disregard.

<p>Title: Wikibullshit</p>
<p>From wikipedia masculism talk: <i>In general, the preponderance of gender-balanced scientific and empirical evidence consistently finds no significant differences (i.e. &gt; 4%) between the sexes in any of human nature's most fundamental attributes. In other words, males and females are equally intelligent, achievement-oriented, emotional/empathic, compassionate/loving, phsically/psychologically violent, dominant/aggressive, and so forth overall. The sexes certainly tend to express these most basic underlying characteristics very differently on the surface, but these equalize themselves as well. Thus, every positive or negative quality exhibited in one of the sexes is inevitably offset by a similar trait in the other sex.</i></p>

<dd>Sounds like feminazi rant to me. Do we have a citation for this? I just read in TIME not long ago that men scored higher than women on standardized tests, etc. If the femo-communists that run TIME admit it themselves, then it must be true... <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalva31_5bf5.html" title="User:Salva31">Salva</a> 00:18, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've read that the average score was the same, however males are more likely to be on the extreme (geniuses or idiots).:: And I assume you're being sarcastic about TIME being communist....</dd>
<dd>Yes, Salva, you're right- it is poorly masked feminazi garbage. (How could you possibly prove something like that? I mean, how could somebody possibly measure the average skills and abilities of an entire population?) The "Genius Idiot" statement is also right, statistically speaking. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson0120_6cba.html" title="User:Robinson0120">Robinson0120</a></dd>

You are free to re-post it if you like. However, it is in direct opposition to the Wikipedia code of conduct.

<dd>It was reposted at the time I posted a notice on your talk page.

<dd>I find it hard to see what would be in such articles beyond a plot summery, and as per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> such articles are not good. I think that a long list of basically similar books such as this are much better served in a single central article rather than lots of tiny stubs.
