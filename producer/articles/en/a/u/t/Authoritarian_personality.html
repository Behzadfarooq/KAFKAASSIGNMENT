<p>The concept of <b>authoritarian personality</b> denotes a number of qualities, which according to the theories of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Adorno_ccac.html" title="Theodor Adorno">Theodor Adorno</a> and his colleagues predict one's potential for <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> and antidemocratic leanings and behaviors. These qualities are assessed by a coherent system--the "structure of personality"--which arises out of characteristic experiences in early childhood and the pattern of internal, psychic processing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian_personality.html" title="Edit section: History of the Term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of the Term</span></h2>
<p>Although the first usage of the term "authoritarian personality" goes back to <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Maslow_1cec.html" title="Abraham Maslow">Abraham Maslow</a> in 1943, whose work in turn rests upon <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Fromm_30e6.html" title="Erich Fromm">Erich Fromm's</a> theory of the authoritarian character, in its essentials it has been marked by the 1950 study <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Authoritarian_Personality_17bb.html" title="The Authoritarian Personality">The Authoritarian Personality</a></i> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_W._Adorno_4c25.html" title="Theodor W. Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/s/Else_Frenkel-Brunswik_35ff.html" title="Else Frenkel-Brunswik">Else Frenkel-Brunswik</a>, Daniel J. Levinson and R. Nevitt Sanford. Conducted at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, the study was part of a large research project aimed at examining the psychological bases of anti-Semitic prejudices. The researchers performed their work heavily influenced by <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, which had just ended, and these events strongly informed the direction of the project. A result of their research was the development of a measure for fascist tendencies known as the <a href="../../../f/-/s/F-scale.html" title="F-scale">F-scale</a> that is still in use today, but disputed.</p>
<p>In light of this background, it was the goal of the study to explain the onset of fascist and antidemocratic attitudes from a psychoanalytic viewpoint, and thereby to make a scientific contribution in the struggle against fascism. The theory of the authoritarian personality laid the cornerstone for a rich, extensive tradition in social science research that continues down to the present day, even though practically everything about the theory has subsequently been questioned.</p>
<p><a name="Theory_of_the_Authoritarian_Personality" id="Theory_of_the_Authoritarian_Personality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian_personality.html" title="Edit section: Theory of the Authoritarian Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theory of the Authoritarian Personality</span></h2>
<p>Those persons who admire fascist ideologies, according to the theory, distinguish themselves through their unconventional, prejudice-laden view of social and political relationships. From this background in their personal history arose the assumption that the emergence of certain phenomena such as anti-Semitism and ethnocentrism stands in close connection with this particular personality structure. Because fascistic groupings get support essentially from the right-conservative camp (although that does not suggest that the right-conservative camp invariably lends these groupings such support) parts of the conservative outlook are likewise judged as an expression of this personality structure. As an instrument to measure this outlook, the AS-scale (for "anti-Semitism") the E-scale (for "Ethnocentrism") and the PEC-Scale (for "political-economic conservatism") are used.</p>
<p>The instrument for assessing the underlying authoritarian personality structure was the so-called F-Scale ("implicit antidemocratic tendencies and fascist potential"). This scale consists of the following subscales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conventionalism -- uncritical acceptance of social conventions and the rules of authority figures; adherence to the traditional and accepted</li>
<li>Authoritarian Submission -- unqualified submission to authorities and authority figures</li>
<li>Authoritarian Aggression -- hostility toward individuals or groups disliked by authorities, especially those who threaten or violate traditional values</li>
<li>Intellectual hollowness -- rejection of the subtle, subjective, imaginative and aesthetic; little or no introspection</li>
<li>Superstition and Stereotypy -- ready acceptance of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> as truth, cliché, categorization; ethnic and religious prejudice; fatalistic determinism</li>
<li>Power and Toughness -- identification with those in power; excessive emphasis on socially advocated ego qualities; rejection of gentleness; contempt for the weak, unpopular, and powerless</li>
<li>Destructiveness and Cynicism -- general hostility, lust for violence, extreme pessimism, view of the world as a dangerous place</li>
<li>Projectivity -- belief in the overwhelming power of evil in the world, even in natural phenomena, and to project unconscious emotional impulses outward</li>
<li>Sex -- undue concern with the methods of reproduction and sexual activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors of the study expected a positive correlation between results on the F-scale and being marked by conservatism, ethnocentrism and anti-Semitism.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Altemeyer_b9b4.html" title="Robert Altemeyer">Robert Altemeyer</a> found that three facets of this authoritarian personality were important: conventionalism, authoritarian aggression and authoritarian submission. He has refined the concept of the authoritarian personality into the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_Wing_Authoritarianism_4cf9.html" title="Right Wing Authoritarianism">Right-wing Authoritarian</a> scale, though his conceptualization is in some ways more primitive than that of the Adorno group. The Adorno group did, for instance, try to keep the concepts of authoritarianism and conservatism separate (using different measuring instruments for the two) whereas Altemeyer considers the authoritarian personality as manifesting 3 traits, all of which are aspect of the unitary phenomenon "authoritarian personality."</p>
<p>Kreml (1977) found almost the same traits in the anti-authoritarian personality on the left side of the political spectrum, much like the old <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i> sitcom argument between <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Bunker_d610.html" title="Archie Bunker">Archie</a> and his son-in-law, "<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Bunker_d610.html" title="Archie Bunker">Meathead</a>".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian_personality.html" title="Edit section: Psychoanalytic aspect">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Psychoanalytic aspect</span></h2>
<p>Adorno and his colleagues regarded the fundamental basis of this presumed system of personality qualities and its linkage to certain attitudes according to a psychoanalytic viewpoint: experiences in early childhood and their internalization.</p>
<p>Freud's psychoanalytic theory suggests that values and norms that are first represented in the person of the father are internalized in the course of the child's development. From these the first unconscious stage of the so-called superego develop. The grappling with an authoritarian, very strict father leads to the development of a very strong superego. Thereby, from the earliest childhood onward, unconscious desires and drives (e.g., power and sexual license) must be thrust down and remain unsatisfied.</p>
<p>The unconscious conflicts that are unleashed thereby are solved when the person projects the "forbidden" drives and aggressions of his superego onto other people. As a rule, ethnic, political or religious minorities are selected as a screen for these projections, because this way there are no social sanctions to fear. Often, he can fall back on socially acceptable prejudices. Studies by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Eysenck_9a00.html" title="Hans Eysenck">Hans Eysenck</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Rokeach_13de.html" title="Milton Rokeach">Milton Rokeach</a> and many others go into this question.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Adler_4b3a.html" title="Alfred Adler">Alfred Adler</a> provided another perspective, linking the "will to power over others" as a central neurotic trait, usually emerging as aggressive over-compensation for felt and dreaded feelings of inferiority and insignificance. The authoritarian need to maintain control and prove superiority over others is rooted in a world view populated by enemies, empty of equality, empathy, and mutual benefit.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian_personality.html" title="Edit section: Extent of Validity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Extent of Validity</span></h2>
<p>Besides these problematic concerns, many have criticised applying the theory with too broad a sphere of validity--that the authors did not account for variables that reflect socioeconomic status such as class, religious indoctrination, and level of education. Some have argued that in these circumstances, these would offer simpler explanations, and increase the practical relevance of the study.</p>
<p>Despite some methodological deficiencies, the theory of the authoritarian personality has had a major influence on subsequent research. One criticism is that the theory of the Berkeley group insinuates that "Authoritarianism" is present only on the right of the political spectrum. As as result, some have claimed that political bias corrupts the theory.</p>
<p>In Germany, research on authoritarianism has been more recently carried out by, among others, Klaus Roghmann, Detlef Oesterreich and Christel Hopf. The most active researcher in the field today, however, is probably the Dutch psychologist J.D. Meloen. The most active critic of the theory has been Australian psychologist John J. Ray. Most academic journal articles that mention the theory, however, assume that it is at least largely true.</p>
<p>Three academic journal articles that may be useful in assessing the evidence for and against the theory are as under:</p>
