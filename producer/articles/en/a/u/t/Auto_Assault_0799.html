<p><i>Auto Assault</i> is centered on the story of an alien terraforming attempt that contaminates the Earth in the year 2030. People who came into contact with the contaminant spores were mutated and developed unhuman powers. These people's children, when and if they had them, developed more from their parents initial mutations. This people were shunned from societies and came to be called "Mutants" by "pure" Humans and "The Changed" by their peers. Civil unrest followed which lead to people preaching against the Mutants. The World Council, which was formed after the mutations were acknowledged by the world's governments, started to employ the TemperNet Police System (TPS). The TPS were deployed mostly in 3rd world countries where the contamination was more rampant than in developed countries, although they were also deployed in urban centers eventually leading to a global deployment of TPS units. TPS units could act without Human intervention to stop civil unrest in most cases with deadly effectiveness.</p>
<p>The Mutants were interned in camps and completely segregated from the general population. The Mutants, however, couldn't be completely contained and formed gangs, identified by the internment camp they were held in, which terrorized the general population of the world. This lead to the Mutants forming their own country and sovereignty based in The Citadel which was surrounded by harsh desert conditions and outside the control of all countries. The Citadel was the only country which recognized Mutants as equal members of their population. Most mutants managed to reach The Citadel before military forces surrounded it and stopped all entry and exit from the new republic. However the military units were not going to be able to win a lightning war, as soon as the units were shipped into the desert they suffered from the extreme climate and once weakened were attacked by gangs of Mutants. This caused appalling losses in the Military units.</p>
<p>The TPS units were found to be unreliable but a group called the Hestia Company funded research into combining the Human Central Nervous System with mechanical augmentations. These units were more reliable than the TPS units but could still combat civil unrest as well as the TPS units, these half-human, half-machine units became known as the 1st Biomechanical Raider Battalion.</p>
<p>When the BioMeks were introduced they had great success driving the Mutants back into The Citadel. The military in most cases couldn't keep up with the pace of the BioMek advance and so either pulled out of the area completely or watched the BioMek advance.</p>
<p>The World Council and the Hestia Company now felt that the world was not worth saving. The rate of contamination had overtaken the rate of reclamation and with more of the population ether dying or being Mutated by the alien contaminant the Earth's workforce was severely depleted. The Hestia Company constructed several massive underground "Arks" to contain thousands of people for an unknown amount of time and took the cream of the Human Race into those Arks. Almost overnight the very best of the Human Race vanished in preparation for the Final Solution. On one weekend in the year 2075 the code phrase GENESIS SOLUTION was given to thousands of families across the world and the entire worlds stock of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (<a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_%28weapon%29_f00e.html" title="NBC (weapon)">NBC</a>) weapons were deployed on the Earth in an attempt at complete sterilization of the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>After over a century in the Arks the Human race was suffering from over crowding, mental health problems and numerous other problems. The Hestia Board of Directors decided to start the Emergence Program and come "Upside" to reclaim the Earth. However they found that the Mutants and the BioMeks were not destroyed as their fore fathers had attempted to do. Hestia also found the International Negotiables Consulting (INC) still operating as they had when they had been formed even before the Hestia Company had been. The 3 races settled in for a drawn out war of attrition, probing each others weaknesses and attempting to exploit them. The INC was strained to the breaking point with the heavy losses all sides and suggested a cease fire to all three races who all accepted. After the discovery of the Ground Zero (GZ) site by the INC, all the factions have settled into a war of attrition over the GZ site and the alien space craft which crashed there.</p>
<p>The three factions are not the only races which can be found in Auto Assault, although the others are not playable. The Tempernet Police System's AI has concluded that to stop civil unrest the entire world's population must be destroyed. There also exists Scavengers whose sole aim is to survive the hardships of the Post Apocalyptic Earth. There are many more Non Player Characters which have survived.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_Assault_0799.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p>The game takes place in the 29th century, after the sterilization attempt that left the Earth in ruins. Players play as either one of a new generation of Mutants, a BioMek or one of the newly emerging Humans. Players fight in their race's area of control against Non Player Characters and eventually reach Ground Zero and can either fight against NPCs or Players in two different "layers" known as instances. One "layer" is the PvP layer, in which the player can go and fight against players of opposing races. The other "layer" is controlled by the faction you belong to. It is the non-PvP layer in which usually players complete their quests from GZ in. The PvP elements of the game are not avaible in this layer, since only other members of your faction are there. All NPC enemies are in both layers. The game centers on 3rd person vehicular combat using state of the art weapons to combat foes.</p>
<p>Auto Assault takes place in two settings; towns and the outside world. The town is experienced by moving the player's customized character around, interacting with NPCs, other players, and environmental objects. Upgrades and vehicles can be bought here. When the player chooses to exit the city he/she is in, they are taken to the outside world, where they traverse the terrain in heavily armed vehicles. Combat is reminiscent of a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_person_shooter.html" title="Third person shooter">third person shooter</a> game, with movement, aiming and firing being done in real time with the keyboard and mouse. There are also character skills, which activate special abilities.</p>
<p>Auto Assault differs from other Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games as it doesn't have a Death Penalty and the player can die without consequence.</p>

<p>In 2030, alien craft drop strange terraforming pods onto Earth's surface. They spread strange contaminations across the world. Although the elite learn to harness the strange forces associated with these pods, those less fortunate are left to suffer exposure to the contaminations released by them. Many die from the strange mutations that result... but a few are altered, changed. They gain strange new powers, green skin and glowing eyes. The children of the previous generation begin to be born with these mutations. Some view these as gifts from some higher power.</p>
<p>However, a vast majority, including the world governments, think this is some kind of plague and that the mutants are to be cured, or failing that, controlled. The mutant population continues to expand as they are herded into internment camps. Soon entire cities are quarantined as those who have escaped the mutations flee to safer areas. The government establishes an artificialy intelligent computer called TemperNet, designed to keep watch over the mutant populace, even as the military battles the omnipresent rioting.</p>
<p>Soon, a stronghold for the mutants arises, called the Citadel, and forth from the Citadel comes The Voice, a unifying persona that speaks for the mutants and says that they must rise up and overthrow the unchanged. Open war between those who have changed and those who have not breaks out. In an effort to combat the seemingly unstoppable united mutant force, the governments of the world (now united under the guise of a powerful international corporation called Hestia) create the biomechanical raiders, soldiers who have had their limbs replaced by cybernetic ones and have received mental and physical enhancements.</p>
<p>At first the Biomeks, as they come to be called, experience great success against the mutant forces. Their immunity to the contamination and their existing military skill combined with their enhencements proves a match for the stalwart mutants and their strange powers. However, the relatively small numbers of the Biomeks are unable to defeat the vastly superior numbers of the mutants.</p>
<p>In desperation, the Hestia corporation intiate a total purge program. Humanity's elite, the scientists, philosophers, craftsmen and so forth are to go underground in a number of massive Arks, while the planet's surface would be totally cleansed by a barrage of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) warheads. However, the elite who were going underground represented a very small percentage of humanity. The mutants, other peoples, and even the biomeks were left on the surface to be obliterated by the cleansing, or the "Night that was Day" as it was called by the mutants.</p>
<p>The humans live underground for a period of nearly eight hundred years, continuing to advance their harnessed alien technology, developing powerful energy shielding, among other advancements. All the while, they never know that the cleansing almost totally failed. On the surface, small numbers of mutants, biomeks, as well as groups of scavengers and gangs, and even mutated forms of plant and animal life; grew and thrived on the remains of the old world.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Hestia board voted for re-emergence, thinking they would find an empty world to reshape as they saw fit. What they found was entirely unexpected- a strange new world that was teeming with life. Though much of the surface was irradiated and uninhabitable, a sizeable region around Ark I was, as the Hestia board saw it, "salvageable". However, it would require either assimilation or elimination of all other people on the surface. The humans were chagrined to discover that their mortal enemies, the mutants, had survived the cleansing, as well as the biomeks, who were none too happy about being abandoned and left to die.</p>
<p>Thus, open war broke out between the three factions and the entire remaining world was almost wiped out. The three sides, depleted and exhausted, soon establish an uneasy truce under the auspices of a mysterious trade organization called International Negotibles Consulting, or INC for short. INC agreed to provide transportation and repairs to the vehicular operatives of the three factions.</p>
<p>Conflict between the three is reduced to small scale battles involving armored cars, trucks, motorcycles, semis and even tanks, armed to the teeth with advanced weaponry. This is where the player's experience begins.</p>
