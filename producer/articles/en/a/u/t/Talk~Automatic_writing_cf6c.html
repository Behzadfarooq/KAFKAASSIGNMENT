<p>Hi. I saw you wrote <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_writing.html" title="Automatic writing">Automatic writing</a>, and I wanted your opinion as to whether it is really the same thing as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_writing.html" title="Free writing">free writing</a> (which I was considering writing until I found Automatic writing). If you have a few moments, could you take a gander at <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~ohr/FreeWriting.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfsu.edu/~ohr/FreeWriting.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://web.umr.edu/~gdoty/classes/concepts-practices/free-writing.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.umr.edu/~gdoty/classes/concepts-practices/free-writing.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - it sounds pretty much the same as Automatic Writing (only without the martians!). If you think the two are the same (sounds like it to me) then I'll make free writing a redirect to automatic writing, and I'll add some more info to the page. Thanks for your time. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> 17:20, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello. I looked at the pages and it definately seems as if free and automatic writing are the same thing. I make a redirect and added free writing as a synonym on the automatic writing page - please contribute what you know about it, since, as you can tell from the article, my perspective on the subject it extremely limited! --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a> 00:26, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but free writing and automatic writing is not really the same! I will try to point out the differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>In free writing, the writer uses his free will to do the writing.</li>
<li>In automatic writing, the message is being written automatically by the hand.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Everyone who can write, can perform free writing, at any time.</li>
<li>Not all people can get perform automatic writing, and not on command.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In free writing, the handwriting stays the same.</li>
<li>In automatic writing, the handwriting sometimes (or always?) changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this reason, I have changed the article. Could someone restore the Free Writing article?</p>
<p>It seems a bit in family with Alien Hand, even though it doesn't require a brain damage. Gift of tongues and sleepwalkers could also get a mention.</p>
<p>I have also heard about a female writer who wrote a entire book with automatic writing. But I can't find the source.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeptics.html" title="Skeptics">Skeptics</a> believe that automatic writing claimed to be of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> origins is a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parlor_game.html" title="Parlor game">parlor game</a>. They claim, as with other <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a> phenomena, that the subconscious of those performing the writing is the only thing influencing their actions and that there is no solid evidence that any messages are coming from anywhere other than the minds of the person holding the pencil. This is referred to as the <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideomotor_effect.html" title="Ideomotor effect">ideomotor effect</a>.</p>
<p>To many skeptics, the use of automatic writing in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therapy.html" title="Therapy">therapy</a> is suspect as well, asserting that while <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconscious.html" title="Unconscious">unconscious</a> ideas are expressed in automatic writing, it is unlikely that they are any more profound than the writer's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness.html" title="Consciousness">conscioius</a> thoughts.

<p>The following paragraph was recently added:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Robert plant, along with Jimmy page, worked on stairway to heaven in Aleister Crowley's old english home. According to Robert plant, One night Jimmey was playing his guitar in front of the fire and Robert Plant held a pen and paper, and he didn't know why. He was in a considerable bad mood when he began to write, he has mentioned. He says that he just watched his hand write out the song. Some skeptics of this situation however are shown the backwards messages in the song (see backmasking) where some say that the song it self was written by not Robert Plant, but a demon or other spirit supporting satan, which is a reason for the appearent messages in the song.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This paragraph strikes me as highly dubious for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It cites no sources whatsoever. When and where is Robert Plant supposed to have told this story? Who are the skeptics referred to in the last sentence? Who are the "some" who claim that the song was written by a Satanic spirit, and when and where did they assert this?</li>
<li>I performed a Google search on "stairway to heaven" and was unable to find any corroboration. In fact, the story doesn't even seem to be repeated anywhere else.</li>
<li>In particular, the <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.straightdope.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Straight Dope</a> column titled <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030425.html" class="external text" title="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030425.html" rel="nofollow">"What's the story behind Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven'?"</a> makes no mention of this story. Neither does the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stairway_to_Heaven_14f0.html" title="Stairway to Heaven">Stairway to Heaven</a>. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.snopes.com/" rel="nofollow">Snopes.com</a> lists four urban legends that mention "Stairway to Heaven", but none of them resemble this paragraph at all. If this story had any kind of factual basis, it would be addressed in at least some of these places.</li>
<li>The writing of this paragraph is very unsophisticated -- it's riddled with errors of spelling, capitalization, and grammar. That doesn't mean that the information in the paragraph is false, but it doesn't exactly inspire confidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the whole paragraph is bogus, and I'm going to delete it. If someone disagrees with this assessment and decides to restore it, I have some recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>If this story belongs in Wikipedia at all, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stairway_to_Heaven_14f0.html" title="Stairway to Heaven">Stairway to Heaven</a> article is a far more logical place for it (with a cross-reference in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_writing.html" title="Automatic writing">Automatic writing</a>).</li>
<li>Citation of published sources is absolutely mandatory for a story that makes extraordinary claims like this. In particular, the story describes events that, if they occurred at all, were witnessed only by Plant and Page. It even tries to tell us what was going on inside Plant's head (he was in a bad mood; he didn't know why he was holding pen and paper; he "watched his hand write out the song "). The only possible sources for this information are Plant and Page themselves. If they told this story, when and where did they do so?</li>
<li>Before being restored to Wikipedia, the paragraph should be copy-edited to clean up the errors and vagueness.</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Based on my limited studies of concopts related to true self, one might say that as one gets closer to the real world, one gets further away from the real self if one is to say that one is distinquishable from one's true self at all. This is the corruption model, and it is concepts in this model that are drawn upon to say that the unconsious is</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The second model is the "all knowing" model, which says that the true-self reflects what you would do if you were all-knowing, in which case the conscious mind might be more reflective of the true self.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both models rely on roughly the same testable variable or variable set for the relationship, differing mainly on the interpretation of that data. The existence of both models is evidence for the ability to determine the distances between the conscious self, the unconscious self, and the true self. Thus anyone making assertions that there is no evidence as to the orientation of these "selves" simply does not understand the concept of the "true self". <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 21:27, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
