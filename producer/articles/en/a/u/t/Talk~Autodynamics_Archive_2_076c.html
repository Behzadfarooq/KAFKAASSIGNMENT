<p>This could be a typo on the Autodynamics website??</p>
<p>AD Skeptics</p>
<p>Well, well, it appears that David Hilster pretty much painted himself and, by induction, Carezani into a corner. Since I'm no autodynamicist, I could just let it be. But I started to wonder about how this Wikipedia thing here works, and I could not let go of it. It is pretty neat how advocates get it in the teeth, and often are hanged by the very things they wrote. That's neat spectacle. However, it carries a MAJOR consequence: that the skeptics (typically administrators with a mission), they too, and just as often as the advocates, don't care either about the truth of the subject-matter or the truth of facts and events. Permit me a simple demonstration: yes, the admin skeptics invite open dialogue, but it is a trap for the uncautious only. They have the power to disconnect, the power to determine which peer reviewed journals or magazines are acceptable or not as being scientific, the power to suppress even other people's interventions. They regularly do tag-teams to avoid a bureaucratic cyber-record of any breaks in the idiotic 3RR rule, have special voting privileges, and can even make the show of a majority. This while they remain, for the most part, anonymous, save for a few Grand Dragons. Which gets us back to science - because, if they were NPOV, or impartial, they would strive to weed out the error, not just amongst detractors but even amongst those who call themselves supporters or present themselves as advocates. Hilster is a good person who has done his best to promote awareness of Carezani's work, even if this effort is flawed. Carezani too is a courageous scientist who deserves everyone's respect. Even if he failed, in pars or in toto, he tried to advance science with genuine dedication. Isn't that the important fact?</p>
<p>If we were going to throw out good scientists because they failed, there would soon be no scientists around. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN ALL THIS IS THE SCIENCE, no? Yet that is what has been abandoned here by both Hilster and the admin detractors of AD. And the science is pretty obvious - if you are moving at 1 km/h with respect to frame A and someone (frame C) passes you at a speed that you clock as 1 km/h with respect to your own frame B, then someone sitting on the edge of the road (in frame A), looking at both of you and measuring each in turn, will measure you at 1 km/h and the other fellow at 2 km/h. Reality can be spoken of in many ways, but 2 km/h is the measure for the speed of that someone (on frame C) that was travelling 1 km/h faster than you with respect to frame A. If AD claimed that the right speed of that someone is 1.41 km/h with resepct to frame A, then it would be either (1) a silly error (that's where the administrators are having a party), or (2) be a speed describing not a speed with respect to frame A, nor with respect to frame B, but the geometric mean of both speeds - that observed in frame A (by the third party sitting on the edge of the road), and that observed in frame B (by you), without privileging either one. It would not be anymore silly than Relativity's 1.99999...km/h, were it not that Relativity had no pretensions to butt in the mechanical world of speeds that ARE NOT a substantial fraction of the speed of light c,or pretensions to have found a privileged frame of reference (though things changed somewhat with the discovery of the microwave cosmic background radiation...). Now, the point is that, me not being an autodynamicist, from what I have read of Carezani's work, I never encountered the claim that Autodynamics applied to something other than <b>the world of relativistic speeds</b>, where the speeds of moving objects ARE a significant fraction of the speed of light c. So, as far as my knowledge extends, to take the defender of Autodynamics as the spokesman for Carezani and AD is a willful mistake of those who do not seek the truth but pose as being impartial judges and arbitrators. It is this Wikipedian pose which is an imposture.</p>
<p>From my viewpoint (and I would gladly be proven wrong by either Hilster or the admins - Salsb, Joke ) Hilster may be an apologist of AD, but it seems that he is doing Carezani a disservice when he choses to present AD as claiming that the actual speed of frame C is 1.41 km/h. That result is only the geometric mean of the speeds of frame C when clocked 'simultaneously' with respect to frames A and B. But with respect to frame A, the speed will always be measured as 2 km/h (and not 1.9999...). For that paragraph now in the entry to stand as it does, attribution to Hilster is not sufficient. <b>Hilster or the admins must provide the reference to where Carezani states that the speed with respect to frame A is 1.41 km/h, not 2 km/h, exactly within that range of speeds that are not considered to be a significant fraction of the speed of light</b>. If the paragraph is allowed to stand by the admininistrators who have behaved in this entry with an undeniable POV, then it will be one more reminder of the misinformation that is glibly passed as fact in this so-called encyclopedia. And it will mark the simple fact that these administrators are more interested in behaving as detractors who will use even the errors of supporters to achieve their denigration objectives, than as impartial thinkers trying to construct a balanced entry that could benefit the public. 209.29.97.61 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.29.97.61_d7f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.29.97.61">contribs</a>) (the <i>dialup.ca.telus.com anon</i>, TELUS Communications Inc. in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>) 16:51, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>READ THE CITED REFERENCE! It gives quite clearly the AD velocity addition formula and states 1.41 km/h exactly. Also, it's straight off teh AD website. Someone (preferably a proponent) needs to explain the AD 'refutation' of this (i.e. that presupposing frames of reference leads to error). I tried, but it seems some editor didnt like my verison.

<li>One does not try to apply the equation for the area of a triangle to determine the volume of a cylinder, then claim geometry to be flawed because they obtain an irrelevant answer. The AD sum velocity equation applies to cases of successive <b>decay</b> (hence the name, “Autodynamics”) and not to people walking around on a street (kinematics). This would be a complete misuse of the equation. There is a very detailed explanation of this exact misunderstanding on the AD website, as referenced by dehilster (“article on the Sum Velocity”); has anyone bothered to read it fully? The AD sum velocity equation also conserves energy and momentum at non-relativistic speeds. There is no problem with the speeds used in the example; the problem is with the nature of the example itself. The paragraph in question is rather more of a “simple and obvious proof” that the opponent author does not understand even the most basic concepts of AD and it should be removed.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 08:24, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>'As we said before, our answer was not clear enough for a physicist saturated with "SR's systems in relative motion." He cannot realize that the third person, or body, in the "ground," doesn't conserve energy regarding CM or SR, because the phenomena are unrelated. Of course, the difference is not in the high (relativistic) or low velocity, the difference is only conceptual, or more precisely, physical. As will be explained, the difference is that there is no connection among the three phenomena or the three different "Bobs."'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Read the AD webpage. Look at the calculations (or do them yourself). Using CM or SR to describe an autodynamic phenomenon gives double the kinetic energy that was available to begin with. Again, the AD sum velocity equation is conceptually completely different from CM or SR.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 16:34, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Whether one understands Autodynamics to be common sense or not, at least for the purposes of an encyclopedia entry, one ought to be as accurate to the exposition of the theory as possible. If you continue to try to fit this square peg of a walking example into the round hole of the AD sum velocity equation, then one can only conclude that you are willfully trying to deceive would-be readers. If your purpose is simply to criticize AD for what you perceive as faults, then there are plenty of "mainstream" physics forums for you to do that in.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 16:34, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The calculation is taken from the autodynamics website itself, so the example {which I did not add, but seems an appropriate example} is presenting autodynamics as autodynamics proponents present it themselves. Note also, we are supposed to be neutral, which means including criticism.

<dd>This is a very confusing remark..are you suggesting this is a computational error?</dd>

<dd>Also you have violated the 3 revert rule, which according to WP policy should lead an admin to blocking you for 24 hours at least. Maybe you aren't aware of this rule, so I won't block you, but I suggest you stop these reverts. If you are interested in providing a description of autodyanmics which you think is more accurate than the present one, please do so on a separate page (you can do this in your user directory) and point readers of this talk page to that exposition where it can be discussed.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Yes, magnitudes are irrelevant. And yet again, yes the <i>calculations</i> are correct (the numbers have been successfully plugged into a calculator to return a mathematically correct result). There is no computational error. The reason for using 1000 km/h is explained quite clearly on the website:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>'We take B = 9.26 10^-7 (1000 Km/h) not 9.26 10^-10 (1 km/h) because the qBasic program that we are using will not show significative numbers when a quantity very close to 1 is subtracted from 1. Nothing will change.'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If your method of calculation does not have this shortcoming, then by all means, use 1 km/h.</dd>
<dd>The physical example that you are repeating from the AD webpage is simply a quoted example by another newcomer to AD that did not understand the conceptual difference in the AD sum velocity equation from the SR sum velocity equation. Since people try so frequently to interpret AD with an SR mindset, the author of the article on the website thought it would be a useful tool to present the common misunderstanding and to show why it is wrong. Is this not obvious? Have you not read any further down the page? It is dishonest of anyone to pass off this example as an accurate reflection of the concepts of AD without the author's proceeding refutation.</dd>
<dd>See the webpage:
<dl>
<dd>'AD applies to DECAY cases. Body 1, with mass equal 10, and traveling at B = 9.26 10E-7 decays into body 2, with mass 9.999 999 999 995 712, that, traveling at the same velocity, decays into body 3, with mass = 9.999 999 999 991 424.'</dd>
<dd>'In AD, also, the successive phenomena are observed by the "same observer." There only is one observer. There are not "systems in relative motion."'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How can we proceed if people are not making any effort to understand the fundamentals that are already presented in full detail on the website?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was unaware of the 3 revert rule. Though, whether I am blocked or not seems to matter little since anything that I edit is immediately replaced by those who have no understanding of the theory. Responses appear to already be circular and I am not seeing any attempt for people to see the truth. As I mentioned before:whether or not you agree with AD is unimportant to me, but you should at the very least use proper examples for your straw men.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 17:53, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Something needs to be changed</span></h2>
<p>Something has to be done about the incorrect application of the AD velocity sum equation. <i>At the very least</i>, the phrase "According to Autodynamics" needs to be replaced with something more neutral. At best, the example itself should reflect the meaning of the math. Anyone with a basic understanding of this equation knows that it only applies to successive phenomena with related KE's. Alice, Bob and Carla, in this example, have no energetic relationship to each other, as would a particle undergoing successive decays. In AD, there are no frames in relative motion; Alice doesn't need to know Bob's velocity in order to know Carla's, she can measure Carla's velocity directly. Each phenomenon is unrelated and is measured independently. This equation simply doesn't apply to Alice, Bob and Carla as the hypothetical situation is setup. Let's do something about this. We could just go back and forth reverting each other three times a day, everyday, but that doesn't seem too productive.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 04:03, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Alright, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tbainbri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tbainbri" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a basic explanation.

<dd>OK as far as I'm concerned it seems reasonable but you still need to explain more clearly what the v_i's are. Are they like "boosts?".--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 03:27, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about if I answer the question indirectly by reminding the reader of the connection between the rest masses and motion masses of bodies in successive decay(see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tbainbri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tbainbri" rel="nofollow">update</a>)? A complete explanation would probably require yet another section describing Carezani's frame reduction. I've referenced 3 articles that explain the concept in detail, however I believe one can understand it intuitively by thinking of the rest mass/motion mass relationship.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 04:06, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand the recent addition. It fails to state what exactly is being added in the velocity-addition formula. All velocities are relative. SO, as best as I can understand from the nonsenical gobbeldygook on the AD website If the v_is are boosting the thing being observed, what are they boosting? Relative to what? They can't be boosts relative to the observer, because then you get mathematical nonsense; i.e., a delta-V of 1 mph relative to the observer on something moving 1 mph relative to the observer results in a final velocity of 1.41 mph relative to the observer, which is nonsense.

<p>The answer to your question lies at the core of the derivation of AD: the frame reduction. Body 1 decays into body 2, and body 2 into body 3, etc. Each phenomenon (decay) is observed independently. The observer places the origin of his coordinate system so that the body passes through it at t=0(there is no reference frame in AD; see the three articles referenced). If we set the coordinate system into relative motion before there is any phenomenon, then we've mathematically introduced artificial energy into the system. Placement of the coordinate system does not change the relativity between the observer and phenomenon. The velocity from the sum velocity equation is that of the body with the last mass that has a KE equivalent to the sum of the KE's of the previous bodies.</p>

<dd>It is obvious that you have made no effort to understand what I had written above. Yes, "The velocity <i>from</i> the sum velocity equation", <i>singular</i>. (Must we resort to arguing semantics?) There is only one velocity that comes <i>from</i> the equation (v_n); the other velocities are plugged <i>in</i> to the equation. The last sentence of my paragraph above answers your question as to what v_n is. The fourth and fifth sentences explain that there are no initial relative velocities and why. Finally, these are not <i>my</i> ideas; I am only repeating what is explained in detail on the AD website and in the AD book. I imagine it must be very difficult to "fly" with ideas that one has not even attempted to comprehend. --<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 19:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is getting into "original research"</span></h2>
<p>The AD supporters here need to acknowledge something: AD has not been established by any sort of scientific authority. AD makes a bunch of statements which have not been examined, much less agreed upon, by any mainstream scientists. Among these statements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>SR does not correctly describe decays</li>
<li>some AD equations correctly describe decays</li>
<li>some AD equations correctly describes non-decay kinematics</li>
<li>some as-yet-unstated AD law unambiguously distinguishes decays from non-decays (for example, clearly alpha emission is a decay. Is a firing cannon a "decay"? How about a person jumping off of a car? How about a car pushing forward from the Earth, and a person also pushing forward from the Earth?)</li>
<li>neutrinos do not exist</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's be frank. AD supporters have not convinced mainstream scientists that these statements are correct, or even coherent. (They may say "just not yet", or "because of the self-serving narrowminded elite"; I would say "because they're wrong". Either answer is irrelevant.) The evidence for this is that there are *no refereed articles*, none, anywhere, discussing the AD equations (Physics Essays is not refereed.). Now, the gist of the above discussion is that several supporters are trying to convince several skeptics that the AD equations are well-formed. I suggest that this is inappropriate; Wikipedia is not the place for <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. I would observe that wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#How_to_deal_with_Wikipedia_entries_about_theories" title="Wikipedia:No original research">how to deal with Wikipedia entries about theories</a> "originated primarily as a practical means to deal with physics cranks"! Wikipedia is not the place to compare theory and experiment, solve equations, and announce grand new hypotheses, nor even to argue for the truth of a new hypothesis. It's a place to report and summarize what is going on in the world. Autodynamics has so far not managed to convince the world-beyond-wikipedia that its equations mean anything at all. If they are to make any impact, they have to do it "out there" first, then come in to Wikipedia and summarize their Physical Review article.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think this article should be scaled back dramatically, removing the equations. The remainder <b>should</b> contain full and stern caveats---"Supporters claim ...", "... although this has not been established", "... at odds with the mainstream view", etc. To you AD supporters: if your theory is as convincing as you say it is, you'll have no trouble convincing the referees at Physical Review. You need to convince *someone else* first, if the details of AD are to become wikipedia-worthy. But, please discuss. 18.4.2.3 16:45, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All of this hand waving about peer-review and "scientific authority" is irrelevant at this point. The article is about Autodynamics, <i>not physics in general</i>. All stated claims of Autodynamics about physical processes in the article already contain caveats. If one wanted to present a claim of AD as accepted fact, then of course (according to the Wikipedia guidelines) one would have to present some mainstream, accepted publication to make their case. However, this sort of statement does not exist in the article. In fact, according to the "No original research" guidelines, the first point under "How to deal with Wikipedia entries about theories" suggests to state the key concepts [for the theory]. The addition of velocities in AD <i>is</i> one its key concepts. The second suggestion is to identify the general consensus [for the theory]. Since there are very few publications addressing AD at all, this should in fact lead to very little disagreement on what the key concepts of AD are.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 22:14, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, that was my edit. The AD reference applies a Lorentz transformation to the distance between the observer's origin and a moving object, while still using the observer's own ruler and clock. This is an error. The distance from a stationary observer to a moving object does not Lorentz-transform by the velocity of the object. That's how SR works, on point of fact, not opinion. The AD example uses SR incorrectly.</dd>

<dd>First of all, it does not make logical sense to talk of velocity between a <i>stationary</i> observer and a <i>moving</i> object. Either there is a relative motion between the two, or there is not; you can't have it both ways. If the origin of system F and P's system (F’’, for instance) coincide, and the origin of F’ passes through the origin of F and F’’ at t=0, it is not conceptually inconsistent with SR to apply a Lorentz transformation.

<dd>You are sitting on the roadside. You are the observer. A car moves past you. It makes sense for you to talk about a "stationary" observer and a "moving object", no? Your friend is in the car. He's radioing back to you about his observations of his own car, of the view out the window, of his measurements of the speeds of passing cars. It makes sense to talk about a moving observer. You say "it is not conceptually inconsistent to apply a Lorentz transformation"---it's a very specific transformation, not a general concept. It does not transform distances whenever it sees something in motion. To apply the SR equations, you ask *which observer* is looking at *which ruler* and *which clock*. The equation tells you what will happen if the rulers, clocks, and observers have relative motion between them. That's what it does, and it's abundantly documented how it does it. In your example, you'd need to specify which observer---the one in F or the one in F"---is looking at which distance on which ruler. If you specify this and apply the transformations, then you're doing SR correctly. If you just "apply the transformations", you're tossing equations around randomly. (I know the NPOV policy. However, there's nothing wrong with saying "X is wrong" if it's factually wrong, you can document it, and no one disagrees. I *am* allowed to try to convince you, tbainbri, on the merits.)

<dd><i>On [6], the AD authors incorrectly claim that reference frames are "unnecessary" and "cannot be measured".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not incorrect simply because someone says it is so. At the minimum, if this statement is to be left in the article, it should at least be stated <i>why</i> the claim is incorrect.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is incorrect because it's complete nonsense. A reference frame can be defined arbitrarily; it can be attached to a concrete object, like a rocket or a car; it can carry people, telescopes, rulers, and clocks. The AD statement that they "cannot be measured" is like rejecting the construction of straight lines in a geometric proof. The whole point of SR is to figure out how a phenomenon will appear differently to observers moving at different speeds. We label each observer, and each phenomenon, with a reference frame as a geometric construction to make the math more intuitive. Imagine if AD said, "SR talks about moving observers. This is unneccessary, since these observers are fictional and cannot be measured."</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, it is not complete nonsense simply because you say it is so (or perhaps because you don't understand it). Reference frames are unneccessary because all measurements can be made with respect to the frame of the observer. It's as simple as that. The phenomenon doesn't need a "label". If I'm on the ground and someone is running on a moving train, I don't need to know the speed of the train and the speed of the runner with respect to the train to determine the speed of the runner with respect to myself; I can measure the speed of the runner directly (frame reduction). By the way, I have yet to see a reference frame "carry people, telescopes, rulers, and clocks" as you say. Since reference frames are abstract, artificial constructions, it must be a fantastic sight indeed!--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 05:17, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you can measure the speed of the runner. If you look at the SR equations, you'll see that your measurement of the runner's speed does not require any transformations: you measure the runner's position at two different times, and divide to get the velocity. The runner could look back and do the same for you; he or she will get the same answer for the velocity, and neither of you have to know how fast the train is moving. You'd both get the right answer, even, if you didn't know relativity. Why would you use this as an example of frames being superfluous? The train's frame *is* superfluous here. However, a person sitting *on the train* could also make both measurements. Shouldn't he get a consistent answer, too? Shouldn't physics be *able to* tell us what the results of his measurements would be? SR does that, and it does it with frames. I have asked AD supporters, several times, to demonstrate their ideas using well-constructed textbook problems, which are very clear about who does which measurement with which ruler, but they have refused. -bm</dd>

<dd><i>On [8], the AD authors label a Lorentz length contraction as an "extra velocity" and attribute energy to it; this leads to the claim that SR do not conserve energy and momentum. This claim further rests on the AD assumption that the neutrino does not exist.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, this statement is alright (although the extra energy is a consequence of the extra velocity, not an attribution from AD authors). I’ll put it back. --<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 22:32, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, the mistake is a simple factual one, as in [6]. The AD source applies the Lorentz transformation (perhaps correctly this time, although they don't specify the ruler) to a length x. If an observer is moving with respect to the object at a velocity beta (parallel to x), the same distance is measured as x' = (x * sqrt(1-beta^2)) on the observer's ruler. Clearly the distance has *changed*, but it is strictly *incorrect* to label this change as an extra velocity. A velocity means that a distance *changes over time*. Both x and x' are unchanging with time. The difference between x' and x simply cannot be interpreted as a velocity; it's two different fixed numerical values, percieved by different observers, for a single object. It doesn't even have the right units. (If the velocity of the object or the observer is changing, then different SR equations need to be applied to the system, which is now non-inertial.) That's not POV, that's a factual description of SR.</dd>

<dd>I said <i>Too many statements deleted with dubious claims of NPOV</i> because thats what I meant.

<p>It's quite clear to me what you meant. However, simply saying something is incorrect does not make it so.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV Dispute</span></h2>
<p>At the moment of writing, there have been nine reverts between Oct. 31st and Nov. 2nd (admittedly, nearly half of them were from myself). I believe that I've made reasonable attempts at a discussion of the edit under dispute, however neither of the other players in this revert game seem to be interested in cooperating. I've outlined specifically what comments (IMO) fail to have <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> and why (although the reasoning seems so obvious as to not require an explanation). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William_M._Connolley</a> claims that I have removed too many statements for no obvious reason, despite the fact that even a quick glance on this talk page will show that not to be the case. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalsb_a85c.html" title="User:Salsb">Salsb</a> does not even bother with explanations; he simply makes vague comments indicating that he believes his edit was neutral. I suggest that the article be reverted to the version prior to the edits which are under dispute and frozen until we can settle this. Reverting each other every day is rather pointless. A willingness to work together in keeping this article neutral and informative would be appreciated.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 00:32, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tbainbri, I would point out that it is not neutral, nor informative, to treat SR and mainstream physics as two sides in a he-said-she-said debate. Relativity is documented factually on the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> pages, based entirely on mainstream refereed research with 100 years of support. If some AD supporter comes over here and says "SR claims X, but it is wrong", that's POV. Saying "SR claims X, but AD disputes this" is inappropriate, given the very rigorous mathematical basis of SR. The most encyclopedic way to say it, IMO, would be "SR claims X. AD disputes this, but the critique is based on a misapplication of the Lorentz transformation." That doesn't apply to "AD claims to explain X", which I guess fall under the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> pseudoscience policy, but it really must apply to the "SR is wrong about ..." claims. My proposed solution: let's create an article called Common misunderstandings of Special Relativity. Each AD denial of SR gets the tagline ... " But this is claim is based on common misunderstandings of special relativity." This would be educational, and it would fulfill the idea that science need not fear untrue claims, if it can explain the truth clearly. Also, it would be useful for future pages on crackpots. -bm</dd>
</dl>
<p>bm, First of all, I have never added anything to the article that even remotely implies that AD is either accepted or is more correct than SR. Saying "SR claims X, but AD disputes this" is stating a neutral fact (it is also a suggested method in <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>: "p's believe this, q's believe that"). It is simply true that AD disputes aspects of SR. It is also true that SR is accepted and AD is not. Both statements are factual and without bias. If we do not point out the distinction between AD and SR, then there is little point in having an article on AD at all. What would be left to say about it? This article is about Autodynamics, not the current accepted state of mainstream physics. It is already in the "Obsolete Theories" section and my edits never take the position that AD is "correct" and SR is not. I am wholly in disagreement with your suggestion of stating:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>AD disputes this, but the critique is based on a misapplication of the Lorentz transformation.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I didn't mean to criticize the current edit, which is pretty good. Some past edits have given the last word to AD too many times. -bm</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I find this quite dangerous because it begs the question: who gets to decide that the problem is due to a misapplication of the Lorentz transformation?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Tbainbri, the difference between a correct and an incorrect SR solution is a matter of simple fact. Anyone who knows SR should be able to tell the difference between the AD statement on references [6][7][8], and the SR solutions of the same problems given in physics textbooks. The errors are utterly standard ones, which appear on a large fraction of Freshman physics problem sets. The solution here is for a few WP editors *who know SR* to look at the AD claims and see whether they use the equations correctly. They don't have to understand the rest of AD, they don't need to compare theory to experiment: AD presents its examples in the form "This is what SR says would happen. Clearly this is wrong." All we have to do is analyze the first part: is that indeed what SR says? My analysis says no. I can provide more detail if desired. Anyone else is free to chime in. If we had another crackpot theory which stated "Time Cube argues that Pythagoras was wrong, because the so-called identity sin(x) + cos(x) = 1 is false for x=pi/2", it would be appropriate for an editor to step in and say "... but this is claim misstates the premises of geometry to begin with."</dd>

<p>Your suggestion of "common misunderstandings of special relativity" taglines has the same problem: who gets to decide that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of SR? The AD equations have been published in a peer reviewed journal (see [9] of the current edit of the article). Autodynamics was <i>not</i> rejected on faulty concept <i>nor</i> failure of mathematics <i>nor</i> on a misunderstanding of SR, it was rejected because its predictions did not agree with the results of the experiment.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 05:55, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the one refereed article is the one where AD is shown to disagree with an experiment. This article does *not* present a detailed analysis of AD, nor any of its claims that SR is untenable. These claims---"SR is untenable because of thought-experiments X,Y, and Z"---are the big issue, in my mind, in this WP article, and these claims are *not* mentioned in the Phys Rev A article. AD's claims of SR trouble are similar to many crackpot claims, and were probably rejected around 1906, when early physics students made the same mistakes, drew the same conclusions, and were corrected.
<dl>
<dd>It's really quite sad. The students were absolutely right, but their mentors set back progress in physics another 100 years (and billions of dollars). Someday it will be recognized as a terrible tragedy of arrogance and ignorance.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 14:43, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is a misrepresentation, based on what the article says: <i>A 1999 article in the popular magazine Wired [2] quotes Pierre Noyes, a professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, as claiming "most scientists consider Autodynamics little more than a 'crackpot theory'". Despite this, Noyes et al. performed an experiment in an attempt to compare the predictions of SR and AD, but concluded that the values calculated by SR were significantly closer to what was observed[9].</i>. Which I interpret as: people think its crackpot. In an effort to put a stake through its undead heart, someone once bothered to test it, and discovered it was, as expected, wrong. I can't see how you interpret that as favourable to AD. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 12:00, 3 November 2005 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I never said that it was favorable to AD. First of all, people don't publish tests of crackpot theories in Physical Review. Obviously today it is considered crackpot (although that is slowly changing); at the time, it was not (hence the inclusion of AD in "Obsolete Theories"). Have you read the article? The SLAC version is freely available <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacpubs/2000/slac-pub-2890.html" class="external text" title="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacpubs/2000/slac-pub-2890.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It states that the theory was tested as an alternative explanation for understanding why the energy expected from beta decay did not show up in a calorimeter (the modern explanation, of course, is the neutrino) because the early tests of neutrino theory were not very convincing. The paper goes on to mention Carezani's frame reduction and simplification of the Lorentz equations. If there were an obvious flaw in the math, concept or a misunderstanding of SR which led to the AD equations, then why would they bother publishing then not mention that at all? In fact, the conclusion rejects AD based on experimental data, not for any of the reasons above. Of course, this is because the SR equations (which are a subset of AD in the special case of external energy being provided) work just fine in this experiment. It's rather unconvincing to state that Carezani does not understand SR or the Lorentz transformation.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 13:44, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why did they bother? Because the experiment was trivial. They just read out the temperature data from the SLAC beam dump (data already available, but previously used only by the accelerator engineers), while the beam was running anyway for other experiments, and did a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the heat capacity of the dump. It would have taken all of four hours. -bm</dd>

<td>Publications of the phenomenon basically stop after the 1940s. Energy losses were always greater than the hypothesized explanations (e.g. length of path of absorber, unknown mechanism stopping the electron catastrophically, production of x-rays and neutrinos). If someone can find a reference that uses the <i>"Standard Model of particle physics"</i> to predict the energy losses to a reasonable degree (a 50% difference between theoretical and experimental values is not reasonable), then I'll be fine with leaving this sentence as it is.

<td><i>For example, on [7], a Lorentz contraction is incorrectly applied to the distance between a stationary observer and a moving object.</i></td>
<td>The sentence is POV, doesn't make sense and it also analyzes the example on [7] incorrectly. If there is an observer and an object and a velocity between them, then neither is stationary. I've explained in the "Opinion?" section why the application of the Lorentz transformation is consistent with SR. Regardless, an encyclopedia entry is not the place for an editor to make a personal critique. There is no consensus view to cite because there has never been a publication on the correctness/incorrectness of [7]'s use of the Lorentz transformation. I believe the statement should be removed.
<dl>
<dd>Tbainbri, your understanding of SR is erroneous. If I am standing still on the side of a road, the distance x between me and a car traveling at velocity v is x=vt. There is no Lorentz transformation involved, because the observation is done entirely with clocks and rulers at rest with respect to the observer. If I want to measure the *length* of the car with my stationary ruler, that measurement is Lorentz-contracted when compared to the car's length as measured by a moving ruler (say, carried by the car's occupant.) The AD page acts as though SR transforms the *distance to the car*, which is incorrect. -bm
<dl>
<dd>What if I put some super-glue on my "stationary" ruler, and at the instant the car passes me, I stick it to the car and read the measurement? My ruler is now "stuck to" the car's "frame", but at that instant, x is still zero. Oh me, oh my, what happens when we set x=0 in the Lorentz equations?<i>We obtain the Carezani equations.</i>--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 15:23, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The claim "reference frames are unneccessary" would be fine if it were applying to AD. The AD supporters apply this description to SR, where it is a factually incorrect. Reference frames are a geometric construction that SR uses to keep track of moving observers.

(By the way, this statement also does not make sense because distances are not relevant in these equations; the only variables are mass and velocity.) One could make a neutral statement that the equations failed in [9], but that statement is already in the article. I suggest retaining the statment from the edit prior to Salsb's: <i>A common mistake for someone that is unfamiliar to the conceptual framework of AD is to apply the equation to bodies which are not energetically connected (e.g., people walking around on the street).According to Noyes et al.</i>, "The most appropriate application [of the Autodynamics equations] is to spontaneous autodynamics phenomena without contribution of energy from the external medium."</td>

<dd>The equation is derived by setting the KE of the first particle (m_0_1) with the velocity of β_n equal to the summation of the KE's of particle m_0_1 with velocity β_1 through particle m_0_[n-1] with velocity β_[n-1]. The KE's must have this "connection" to each other for this to be true, such as in the case of decay, where the rest mass of body_n is equal to the motion mass of body_n-1 (therefore KE_n is dependent on KE_n-1). This is how the equation is derived. If you start plugging in values that have no relation to each other, it will fail, of course. However if you feel that the phrase "energetically connected" is confusing, then we can replace it with <i>undergoing decay</i>. I say "mistake" because this is such a common misunderstanding that Carezani includes this as an example in his book (the same example is repeated on the web page).

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This assumes that there is a loss of mass due to decay! If the body hasn't converted its mass into energy, then you just don't use the equation! If Moe walks past Joe at 1 km/hr, then you don't use the AD sum velocity equation equation because Moe's mass has no relationship to Joe's mass. The misunderstanding is very, very simple and has absolutely nothing to due with "high" or "low" velocities. (This is why I say it is a common mistake to make if you are unfamiliar with AD's "conceptual framework". AD and SR concepts are incompatible, so applying SR's interpretation of variables in an AD equation is bound to fail.) --<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 16:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine, let's just apply AD to decays. Let's have the large, complex composite particle "Earth+Joe+baseball". Joe is standing on a skateboard, carrying the baseball. The whole particle "decays"---from a high-potential-energy state to a high-kinetic-energy state---when Joe gets a push forward to 1kph. The large daughter particle "Earth" recoils slightly to conserve momentum. The small daughter particle, "Joe+baseball" decays when Joe throws the baseball forward at 1kph. That's all energetically connected; each "particle" breaks in half and converts some of its internal configuration/mass/binding energy into kinetic energy. The AD equations should apply this time, no? And they give nonsensical results---indeed, the exact same nonsensical results as they give when Joe and Moe were both walking. -bm</dd>

<dd>The energy that "pushed" Joe was *entirely internal* to the decaying Earth+Joe+Baseball particle. The process is a decay: EarthJoeBaseball -&gt; Earth + JoeBaseball + kinetic energy, followed by another decay: JoeBaseball -&gt; Joe + Baseball + kinetic energy. If you want to change "Earth" to "A Cannon" and put it in outer space, be my guest. But it's a single body, having mass but no kinetic energy, changing into two moving bodies with smaller masses. The kinetic energy comes from a tiny, tiny fraction of the mother particle's rest mass. A bit of an extreme case, but why exactly would AD not apply?

<dd>It's another case of fitting a square peg into a round hole. It doesn't apply because the AD sum velocity equation uses the following relation of rest mass and motion mass:

<dd>Tbainbri, your analysis is wrong. In this example, JoeBaseball is *heavier* than the sum of Joe + Baseball. We can weigh them at rest and learn this, just like we know that Uranium 238 is *more massive than* the sum of the masses of its decay products, Th234 and He4. So your substitution of (JoeBaseball - Baseball) for (Joe) is mistaken. The rest mass of the system *changes*. If you want to say the "relativistic mass" changes, that's fine, but then there is no additional kinetic energy. You can write the equation in one of two ways:
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub><i>j</i><i>b</i><i>e</i></sub> = <i>M</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> + <i>M</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>b</i></sub></span></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>OR
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub><i>j</i><i>b</i><i>e</i></sub> = <i>g</i><i>a</i><i>m</i><i>m</i><i>a</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><i>M</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> + <i>g</i><i>a</i><i>m</i><i>m</i><i>a</i><sub><i>b</i></sub><i>M</i><sub><i>b</i></sub></span></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In the first version, we talk about kinetic energy *instead of* rest mass (this is preferred); in the second version, we talk about a relativistic mass increase *instead of* kinetic energy. Work through the gammas and you will see that the two expressions are equal. But you don't use both "E = gamma*m + KE".
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Woah, hold on there Babe Ruth. I'll assume (like in the joewrench example) that the JOE part of the JOEBASEBALL is burning some glucose in his muscles to throw the baseball. In that case, what the heck is KE_b (ooh, maybe it's the baseball neutrino)?? You see, because in your example we start with a composite that is JOEBASEBALL, but we end with: joe + baseball (and KEs). If the JOE part of JOEBASEBALL decayed then what the heck happened to our poor little baseball? In fact, you're talking again about two decays.
<dl>
<dd>(1) JOE -&gt; joe + KE_j</dd>
<dd>(2) BASEBALL -&gt; baseball + KE_b</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is fine in AD, but JOE's decay and BASEBALL's decay have nothing to do with each other, so we treat them as two decays because that's what they are. Just because one part decays, doesn't mean the other has to.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 22:43, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tbainbri: Draw a black box. Joebaseball goes in at rest, later Joe and Baseball come out at high speeds. Unless you're trying to obscure things, you should really restrict your analysis to the initial and final masses, and the initial and final energies and momenta. That's what goes into the SR equations, it's what appears to go into the AD equations. In those terms, the above system satisfies your "decay" criterion; some initial-state mass goes away, and some end-state kinetic energy appears. If you're going to dig into the details of which part of a composite object lost mass, or something, you're going to have to rewrite your decay-vs-kinematics distinction.</dd>

In fact, I don't see that one can avoid a formulation like the one I proposed -- even that formulation is more favorable to AD than NPOV should allow, because it let's AD get away with referring to a complex process referred to as "decay", in what in what is supposed to be a fundamental theory of nature.

<dd>CSTAR, thanks for the laugh. I am glad you are doing this. You seem to be the only person here, that despite your personal opinion and skepticism, maintains a reasonable POV. AD accepts the mass-energy equivalence given by <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span> but not the Lorentz transformation (see the various articles and explanations on the frame reduction or simply see my explanation of the Joebaseball example above). Yes, it is a <i>replacement</i> for relativity.

<p>So let's get this straight: Please confirm or deny:</p>
<p>1. AD has no notion of frames of reference and in particular, no Lorentz transformations relating structures (e.g. observanbles) in one frame of reference to another.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>AD uses only the frame of the observer. It does have the Carezani equations (aka simplified Lorentz equations), but these simply represent the extra time/distance that the signal (light) has to travel due to the relative motion. This is <b>not</b> the same concept as in SR where something called "space-time" magically expands or contracts. It is simply a longer time (duration, not dilation!)\distance due to the constancy of the speed of light and relative motion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. Does AD have a <i>geometrical structure</i>? e.g., some space time manifold to describe states of bodies?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An emphatic NO! There is nothing magical in AD. AD goes back to common sense concepts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. The AD equations are a presumed replacement for the Lorentz transformation relating succesive states of massive bodies to a process of "decay". Is that it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ehh.. actually I don't understand this question. The AD sum velocity equation was derived for successive decays, so that what you use it for, but in general, equations don't assume anything. As Carezani or Lucy Haye (SAA member) will tell you, just because the equation exists, doesn't mean that the phenomenon does. You just have to be careful to use the right equation for the right event.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. Joe is on a space walk without the tether attaching him to the spacecraft. In a moment of mental lapse, he flings his wrench, causing him to fly off helplessly into space, in the opposite direction. Why would would AD not apply in this case?--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 16:39, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't apply for the same reason as Joebaseball doesn't apply. The example doesn't explain where the energy comes from and what has specifically happened to the masses of the parts of the composite. Sure you can just say "oh, well it comes from a conversion of a small amount of mass of the Joe+wrench composite." That still doesn't tell us much.. like what part of the composite? the Joe part or the wrench part or some of both? The problem is more complex, because the Joe part has a different rest mass than the wrench part. Ultimately it comes down to the fact that you have to work with one phenomenon at a time. Maybe the wrench is the part that decays its mass into energy, causing it to fly away from Joe (it wasn't his fault, after all!). In that case, talking about Joe is superfluous (here is the extra frame again). We wouldn't care about Joe because there is no phenomenon at Joe. One observer, one phenomenon; that is Autodynamics in a nutshell.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 17:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tbainbri, any physicist can tell you which mass decreases. The rest mass which is converted to kinetic energy comes from molecules of glucose in Joe's arm muscles. The total mass of a glucose molecule includes some molecular binding energy, amounting to a few eV. The molecule is broken up into carbon dioxide, etc., whose binding energy and mass is lower. This kind of binding energy-as-rest-mass can in principle be measured by weighing the molecules (Pritchard et. al. at MIT are working on this: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2003/ions.html" class="external free" title="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2003/ions.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2003/ions.html</a>).

<dd>Sorry Tbainbri, that makes no sense. In the final state, the wrench carries some of the kinetic energy and some of the total mass. In writing down the equation, you're trying to keep track of the initial energy and the total final energy and momentum. (A decay of the form A -&gt; B + KE is forbidden by momentum conservation, by the way.)

All decays lead to at two or more daughters, and conserve momentum. Every one. No exceptions. Look through the listings at [<a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov" class="external autonumber" title="http://pdg.lbl.gov" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] and find a counterexample if you like. We can also write down the A-&gt;B "decay", where M_B &gt; M_A.

After all, JOE becomes joe, who is less massive. In AD, we represent this relationship (as present several times above), as:

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You can see by inputting values for v, that at v=0, <span class="texhtml"><i>m</i> = <i>m</i><sub>0</sub></span>. That makes sense. And as the velocity increases towards c, mass tends towards 0. That also makes sense for a body decaying it's mass to energy. Please, please, oh please, tell me how SR represents this mass decrease??Now, I <i>KNOW</i> you're not going to give me the SR mass equation:

<dd>Because certainly a "non-crackpot" like yourself can see that it makes absolutely no sense for mass to increase <i>in a decay process</i>, regardless of how fast it is moving.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 22:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tbainbri, let's be clear here. SR says energy is conserved. A massive particle has energy equal to its rest mass M_0. It can decay into a pair (or any number) of lighter particles, as long as their rest masses add up to less than M_0. The daughter particles will emerge with velocities, and kinetic energies, *such that* the total final-state energy (m1+ke1 + m2+ke2 + m3+ke3 etc.) adds up to M_0, the total initial state energy. If you want to write that in terms of m' = gamma(v) m, then you would write that the final state particles have velocities v_i such that the relativistic mass increase gamma(v_i) yields (m1' + m2' + m3' ...) = M_0.</dd>
<dd>If you do the whole thing "for a moving particle", i.e. if the initial state has kinetic energy KE_0, you just get M_0 + KE_0 = m1+ke1 + m2+ke2 + m3+ke3 etc., and nature will choose the ke_i such that the equation is true and energy is conserved. If you want to say "the mass increases", then you write M_0' = (m1' + m2' + m3' ...), where each m_i' is a function of v_i, the v_i are chosen such that the equation is true and energy is conserved.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your search for how SR describes "this mass decrease": first, sorry, it took me a minute to understand your capitals/lowercase notation. While it is true that, in an energy sense, the final-state kinetic energy is determined by KE=JOE-joe. However, that tells you nothing about velocities; the final-state kinetic energy is divided up between joe and WRENCH. The velocities of these states are different depending on their masses; for example, for a fixed KE, if WRENCH is quite small, you'll get joe recoiling with a low velocity (v_wrench &gt; v_joe, and KE_wrench &gt; KE_joe). If WRENCH is the same mass as joe, they'll have equal recoil velocities (v_wrench=v_joe and KE_wrench = KE_joe). If WRENCH is very heavy, it barely recoils, and JOE gets a higher velocity and and most of the kinetic energy. You absolutely cannot understand the problem by reducing it to JOE -&gt; joe + KE; you'd have no idea what joe's final state is, because you're ignoring the share of KE that goes to the wrench (a share determined by momentum conservation and the wrench's mass). If you do know, please tell us what value of "beta" goes into your AD equation? Is it joe's velocity, or the wrench's? Where does your AD solution acknowledge the difference between a heavy wrench and a light one?</dd>
<dd>SR, of course, looks at the total mass-energy lost (dM = JOEWRENCH - joe - WRENCH in your notation), turns this into kinetic energy, and assigns final-state velocities to both daughters (v_j for joe, and v_w for WRENCH) in such a way that energy and momentum are conserved. There are always two equations, one for energy conservation and one for momentum. If you like, you can write the energy equation by demanding that the total 'relativistic mass' is constant, but it's easier in modern notation. -bm</dd>

<dd><b>Thank you</b> for finally admitting this. Unfortunately your conclusion is wrong about velocity. We know the velocity because we know the KE, because we know the final and initial masses. You then go onto a discussion about recoil, <i>but there is no recoil!</i> JOE spontaneously decays into joe. joe now has a velocity, the energy of which comes from a small portion of JOE's mass. In your treatment of the scenario, JOE not only decays, but he <i>pushes</i> against WRENCH!. If joe obtains his velocity ONLY via mass decay of a portion JOE into KE, then where did the energy come from to recoil WRENCH?

<dd>Don't lie now. Everything is shown here on this wikipedia talk page for the whole world to see for the next 100 years or however long wikipedia exists.

The mass from portion JOE decays into energy providing velocity (your words, KE=JOE-joe). The only *other portion* is WRENCH! WRENCH doesn't give up any of its mass!

<dd>Tbainbri, please keep track of everything going on here. In the final state, both joe and WRENCH are moving. In addition to their rest masses, they both have kinetic energy. Let's add up the energies, using energy conservation. Initial total energy = final total energy. We'll keep track of all of the rest mass and all of the kinetic energy. <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub><i>J</i><i>O</i><i>E</i><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>M</i><sub><i>J</i><i>O</i><i>E</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>M</i><sub><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>M</i><sub><i>j</i><i>o</i><i>e</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>j</i><i>o</i><i>e</i></sub> + <i>M</i><sub><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub></span>. Notice the *two* kinetic energy terms? They are there because both joe and WRENCH are moving in the end (or do you deny that?). Let's try to figure out how big those terms are. Canceling out the rest masses, you get <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub><i>J</i><i>O</i><i>E</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>M</i><sub><i>j</i><i>o</i><i>e</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>j</i><i>o</i><i>e</i></sub> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub>.</span>. Rearranging, <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub><i>J</i><i>O</i><i>E</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>M</i><sub><i>j</i><i>o</i><i>e</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>j</i><i>o</i><i>e</i></sub> + <i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub></span>. JOE's mass loss gives kinetic energy to *two objects*. That means that joe doesn't get all of it. joe gets some, the wrench gets some. You've been going through this whole thing as if <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i><i>E</i><sub><i>W</i><i>R</i><i>E</i><i>N</i><i>C</i><i>H</i></sub></span> is zero---is that some sort of bizarre AD assumption? Or did you just forget about how, when you throw things, they usually start moving?</dd>
<dd>And I might predict that you're going to say, well, joe doesn't moving "because he has relativity" and you can just view the whole process from his perspective. Let me preempt this by noting that joe and JOE occupied different inertial reference frames, and one could accurately analyze the situation from either one (if you want to be in the frame where joe ends up at rest, you'd perceive JOEWRENCH to have some initial velocity/momentum/ke) but an observer that starts off seeing JOE at rest, and ends up seeing joe at rest, is not in an inertial frame. (sigh. will this provoke yet another attack on frames? or will Tbainbri try to put in relativistic masses instead the rest masses? why do I bother?) -bm</dd>

<dd>You know that this doesn't happen; WRENCH is unaffected by JOE. Of course there will be a relative velocity between WRENCH and joe, but speaking with respect to KE, it is <i>joe's</i> velocity because the situation is exactly the same if WRENCH simply didn't exist, but it is NOT the same if JOE didn't exist.
<dl>
<dd>Wrong wrong wrong. If WRENCH doesn't exist, then the decay JOE-&gt;joe+KE is explicitly forbidden by momentum conservation. So let's stick to the event where WRENCH does exist, eh? I'm amazed to hear you say, with a straight face, that the final velocities don't depend on the masses, and that joe doesn't have any final velocity. It's as true in Newtonian mechanics as it is in relativity.
<dl>
<dd>You continue to admit that momentum is not conserved in decay in special relativity and I'm not sure how you use that as a case against AD, but you are absolutely correct. This is because SR's crackpot momentum equation contains SR's crackpot relativistic mass which makes no sense for a particle that is supposed to be losing mass, not gaining it. The self-proclaimed "physics establishment" claims that THIS mass increase isn't real or it is only a <i>perceived</i> mass increase. If it's not real, then why is it lurking in your KE and momentum equations? The situation isn't nullified just because your equations can't describe it! <b>That is not science and you should be ashamed for even suggesting it.</b> We have this beautiful mass-energy relationship discovered by Einstein, yet you have no idea how to use it. You don't even understand what decay is! You just need a new set of equations (AD) and everything works just fine. The fact is that SR can't handle even the most basic example of decay (JOE = joe + KE). If all the energy in your example of decay comes from JOE (as you said) then what has WRENCH's mass got to do with anything? WRENCH can be one 1g or 500kg, but it doesn't affect JOE's momentum at all.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 03:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, if JOE didn't exist, there wouldn't be any event to describe! Does this answer your beta question? To answer your second question, my AD solution <i>doesn't</i> acknowledge a difference between a heavy wrench and light one, because in your glycolysis example <i>there is no such difference</i>! <b>If JOE eats a chocolate bar full of glucose while holding WRENCH, will the WRENCH get more massive?</b> No, of course not; that's silly. It's just as silly as saying the converse: that WRENCH loses mass when JOE converts some sugar into energy.
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you're deliberately being dense. I wasn't saying WRENCH gets heavier in the course of the "decay", nor by eating glucose; I meant, we're going to do the experiment several times with different wrenches: say a 5-gram, a 50-kg, and a 5000-kg. These three situations will give manifestly different results. You've said that the results don't depend on the wrench's mass at all---am I right? This means that momentum is not conserved in your solutions.
<dl>
<dd>Of course momentum isn't conserved in decay with SR. Neither is KE. And you admit both, but still refuse to accept AD! This is truly amazing.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 03:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You then go on to talk about KE conservation, but it is easy to show that it is not conserved in SR although it is in AD. In AD, if FATJOE has 200 units of mass and decays into a slimmer JOE, at 150 units of mass, we get 50 units of KE; then if JOE at 150 units of mass decays into joe at 125 units of mass, we get 25 more units of KE. If we use the SR KE equation to calculate each successive velocity, we arrive at a final velocity which is different when calculated with the SR sum velocity equation!</dd>

<dd>Sorry, you've just constructed a situation which violates momentum conservation. As I have said, a decay of the form FATJOE -&gt; JOE + KE is explicitly forbidden in SR. In order for JOE to have kinetic energy, he has to have a velocity and a momentum. He can't just pick up this momentum out of nowhere; he has to kick-off of something, imparting that object with momentum in the opposite direction. Are you ignoring this on purpose, or because you didn't think of it, or because you think *momentum* conservation is also wrong? -bm</dd>

What is BM's conclusion? Is it that we must use the equations which conserve energy and momentum to describe the phenomenon? NO, he simply concludes: <b>THE EXPERIMENT IS INVALID.</b> I hope to whatever deity might exist, that you are not in a position to be teaching science to students! Then again, a lot of grant money is awarded every year to people that use this kind reasoning, so I guess it must be profitable. Who cares if it's not actually science, huh?</dd>
<dd>So, do I think momentum conservation is wrong? NO. I think SR doesn't conserve momentum when applied to a simple case of decay. Is this really your line of reasoning when you do an experiment?--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 03:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we use AD's sum velocity equation and KE equation, we get exactly the the same final velocity. AD <i>just makes sense.</i> The problem is that in SR, you are <i>always doing kinematics</i> and <i>never autodynamics (decay)</i>. In the universe, the general case is decay and the special case is application of external energy to a system. SR was (although it was apparently not conceptually understood as such at the time) mathematically derived to describe the later (though not conceptually), and that's why it fails at describing the former (and hence the invention of the neutrino to make up for the difference in energy predicted versus energy observed). It is also why you get that crazy relativistic mass equation in SR. I say crazy, because it is conceptually incongruent with SR and therefore treated as "not real", yet it is still hidden away in the SR momentum and SR KE equations. AD (as I have shown above) can be easily reduced to SR (with respect to the equations, not SR's conceptual framework) for the special case of external energy being applied to a system if we just set <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>K</i><i>E</i></span>. In that case, the mass increase IS REAL! It is no longer crazy, because we know where it comes from; it comes from the external energy (like the kylstron EM field, for example)! Of course, in AD that mass increase is temporary because the added mass is then decayed to give rise to the velocity. This incongruence between SR concept and SR equation only leads to stranger and stranger concepts to hide it's inability to describe the universe: space-time warping, infinitely dense objects, time dilation, neutrinos, etc..(yeah, some of these are GR concepts, but GR is based on SR..) AD explains everything with common sense. Newton would be proud.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 16:35, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

For example, if a movement <i>the additivists</i> claimed that 1+1=31, then we would say in an NPOV manner: <i>Additivists make the controversial claim that 1+1=31, which contradicts all the established rules of arithmetic. Additivists insist that the rules of arithmetic are meaningless and don't apply to what they call "transcendental discovery states."

<p>I'd like to sum up my impressions of the above discussion. The original criticism of the AD equations is that they disagree with kinematics, in a trivial way. Cars on the highway obviously do not measure velocities according to the AD equations. The rebuttal was that AD only applies to decays. I proposed the Joebaseball analogy to suggest that, no, ordinary kinematics and *decay* kinematics are not separable. In SR, you've got an equation which gives you a particle's energy as a function of velocity (E = gamma(v) mc^2) and another one which gives you momentum as a function of velocity (p=v/c gamma(v) mc). Those two equations describe any system of masses, decaying, scattering, fusing, etc. The Lorentz tranformation shows you how to describe the same system from any moving vantage point.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yikes. When I have to resort to quoting myself, it really means that you're not paying attention.</dd>
<dd>Here we have the definition of kinematics: <i>The branch of mechanics dealing with the description of the motion of bodies or fluids without reference to the forces producing the motion.</i></dd>
<dd><b>Decay is not kinematics.</b> We can refer <i>exactly</i> to where the energy comes from in decay: it comes from a body's rest mass!--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 03:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How, we asked, does AD *separate* decays from kinematics? We haven't had a clear answer. First it was "mass turns into kinetic energy". Fine, but that occurs also in the Joebaseball system. Then it was "But it's only Joe's mass which turns into energy, the baseball has nothing to do with it" and therefore (for unclear reasons) it was not a decay. But without including the baseball's mass and recoil velocity, you a) cannot conserve momentum and b) cannot have any idea how to calculate Joe's velocity. It's not entirely clear to me, but I think Tbainbri suggests that Joe does not recoil at all when throwing a wrench or a baseball. (Is that what you think *happens*, or is that what you think *SR predicts*?) Next, TBainbri suggests that SR requires the wrench/baseball itself to change mass.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, here we go. Here comes the typical response: "we tried to discuss an example with AD supporters, but they just don't answer our questions." This is complete RUBBISH and now anyone in the world, with access to the internet can come to this discussion page for years to come and see that it is a lie. First you say: <i>We haven't had a clear answer.</i> But then you immediately contradict yourself and say: <i>First it was "mass turns into kinetic energy".</i> Voila! There is your answer! Should I repeat it to you again so that you can't say that I didn't answer when you asked me? <b>Mass decays into KE.</b> There. Let's move on to the next lie: <i>therefore (for unclear reasons) it was not a decay</i>. I never said it wasn't decay, I only said that you're not treating it as a decay because in SR you have joe decaying mass into energy and simultaneously pushing BASEBALL or WRENCH or whatever that particular object was in that example. It's decay, so JOE isn't <i>pushing anything</i>. But, then, you don't seem to know what decay is, anyway.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 03:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>How can it not be clear to you, when I've already said, above, that there is no recoil? There is one, and only one velocity because in the system, only joe and BASEBALL exist! Unless you want to redefine the velocity between joe and BASEBALL to recoil. Be my guest; you can call it whatever you want, but it's still "v".</dd>
<dd>Again, I've already told you how to calculate joe's velocity! It's not difficult at all! If we know the rest mass and the motion mass, then we know the velocity:</dd>

This is getting rather far from the original question: how does AD separate decays from kinematics? Clearly, it's something other than the black-box treatment, in which you start with mass A at rest, end up with masses B and C in motion, and the masses obey (A &gt; B+C). Anything of that form---or, indeed, any form---is handled by the same SR equations. In AD this is not the case; whether the AD equations apply or not depends somehow on the detailed substructure of A. In the end, it looks like the difference is: "If you can test it against day-to-day experience, and AD fails, it must be kinematics. Otherwise, it's a decay." I don't think there's any merit to keeping the equations on WP if the AD supporters can't even tell us when they apply.</p>
<dl>
<dd>See above for the decay/kinematics question (but if you understood what decay is, it would be obvious).</dd>
<dd>AD fails for no example. Mass-decay and energy absorption are fundamental processes in the universe. Ultimately, all relative motion results from this.</dd>
<dd>If you start with one mass (A) and end with two masses in motion (b and c), then you have 2 decays and AD handles this just fine.</dd>
<dd>A = BC</dd>
<dd>B -&gt; b + KE_b</dd>
<dd>C -&gt; c + KE_c</dd>
<dd>A = B + C = b + KE_b + c + KE_c</dd>
<dd>It's as simple as that. Note that we really do have two velocities this time because there are two decays.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 03:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All energy in the universe is ultimately the result of a conversion of mass. This is called decay. Both SR and AD accept <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span>, so this shouldn't be a point of contention. Therefore, all relative velocities ultimately come from some process of decay. As long as we have enough information about the system, we don't have to resort to kinematics. We only resort to kinematics when we know what the energy is, but not where it all came from (see definition of kinematics). AD works fine in both cases. In the case where we have the information, we use the general AD equations, but in the case where we don't, we just add the KE into the system without regard to what mass converted its energy and set the rest mass equal to<span class="texhtml"><i>M</i> = <i>m</i><sub>0</sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>K</i><i>E</i></span>. Really, CSTAR, I'm honest when I say it is straightforward. I don't know why BM doesn't know the difference between decay and kinematics, after I've posted the definition of kinematics twice and he knows the mass-energy equivalence.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 05:07, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Evidence on Autodynamics</span></h2>
<p>More Evidence Of Pico-Graviton Hypothesis</p>
<p>These are tiny moons. Their estimated diameters lie between 40 and 125 miles (64 and 200 kilometers). Charon, for comparison, is about 730 miles (1170 km) wide, while Pluto itself has a diameter of about 1410 miles (2270 km).</p>
<p>The team plans to make follow-up Hubble observations in February to confirm that the newly discovered objects are truly Pluto's moons. Only after confirmation will the International Astronomical Union consider permanent (and catchier) names for S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2.</p>
<p>The Hubble telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys observed the two new candidate moons on May 15, 2005. "The new satellite candidates are roughly 5,000 times fainter than Pluto, but they really stood out in these Hubble images," said Max Mutchler of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the first team member to identify the satellites.</p>
<p>Three days later, Hubble looked at Pluto again. The two objects were still there and appeared to be moving in orbit around Pluto.</p>
<p><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/01nov_moonsofpluto.htm?list8434" class="external free" title="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/01nov_moonsofpluto.htm?list8434" rel="nofollow">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/01nov_moonsofpluto.htm?list8434</a></p>
<p>The evidence for the Pico-graviton hypothesis seems to be pouring in. It is the only hypothesis can predict that the number of satellites around a planet is also determined by its distance from a star and not just its mass.</p>
<p>Second AD 'Success' Within A Month Moon discovered orbiting tenth planet</p>
<p>The tenth planet in the &lt;a style='text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px double;' href="solar%20system" onmouseover="window.status='solar system'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=<i>; return true;"&gt;solar system&lt;/a&gt; has a moon at least a tenth of its size. The discovery, made on 10 September ….. officially a planet - for now its only official designation is 2003 UB313 ….. nicknamed it Xena after the television warrior princess, is calling the moon Gabrielle, after the princess's companion.</i></p>
<p>The moon is ten times closer to its planet that our Moon is to Earth, and the pair are 97 times further from the Sun than the Earth is. Viewed from Earth, they are separated by only half an arc-second.</p>
<p>The best estimate of Xena's size so far is about 2700 kilometres in diameter, about one-fifth the size of the Earth. Gabrielle, which is about a tenth the size of Xena, is about one-eighth the size of our Moon.</p>
<p>An intriguing consequence of the latest discovery is that three of the four largest objects beyond Neptune are now known to have moons, including Pluto and 2003 EL61.</p>
<p>Brown suggests "some very common mechanism must be responsible". He proposes they were created by collisions between icy trans-Neptunian objects, similar to the collision between the nearly complete Earth and a Mars-sized object that created our Moon.</p>

<p>This is no mystery to the Autodynamicist. The Pico-Graviton hypothesis says that there is a relationship not just between the mass of a planet and its number of moons but also between how close a plant is to the Sun. When a moon is in alignment with its planet and the Sun, the net difference in pico-graviton radiation pressure pushes the moon a little closer to the Sun. This is born out by the inner planets. Mars is half the size of the Earth and Venus and yet has two satellites where as the Earth, which closer to the Sun only has one satellite and Venus, which is even closer has none. Still closer to the Sun is Mercury which has none and yet Pluto, on the &lt;a style='text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px double;' href="far%20side" onmouseover="window.status='far side'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=<i>; return true;"&gt;far side&lt;/a&gt; of the Solar syatem, is smaller than Mercury and has at least one satellite. Now we find that tiny Xena also has a satellite.</i></p>

<p>This usage is quite standard and for AD to pretend otherwise is misleading. Note that I am not saying you cannot call it what you want. However, I am saying that the reader should be alterted to AD's unusual definition and that AD appears to be using the term in a non-standard way. For me that point is <i>not</i> negotiable.

<p>Would it be acceptable to everyone here if I put an infobox in the main article giving a brief summary of what Autodynamics is? Right now, the article is very long, and a casual reader probably won't wade through it. The infobox would look something like the following:</p>
<table class="infobox" style="width:22em;">
<tr>
<th colspan="2" style="font-size:larger;background:gainsboro;">Disputed science:<br />

<dd>The "claim" isn't entirely accurate. One can easily derive the SR equations starting from the autodynamic equations for the special case of a body receiving external energy (therefore the equations are not necessarily invalid, if they are applied to the appropriate phenomena). As for GR, we would say that AD provides a mechanical model for gravity, which GR does not. Also, GR does not predict some phenomena as accurately as AD, such as perihelion advance, precession of binary stars, etc. The sentence you use implies that GR fails as a result of the Lorentz transformation equations being formulated incorrectly. That's not really the claim made by AD. Anyway, I'm not opposed to having an infobox, as long as it is accurate to the claims.--<a href="../../../t/b/a/User%7ETbainbri_f049.html" title="User:Tbainbri">Tbainbri</a> 15:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
