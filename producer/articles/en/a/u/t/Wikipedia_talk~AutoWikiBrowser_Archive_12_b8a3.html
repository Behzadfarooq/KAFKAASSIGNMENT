<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adding Project tags</span></h2>
<p>Well, I'm back again. I have a list of roughly 1300 U.S. airports that have articles. What I'm looking to do is place the tag for the WikiProject on the talk page of each, if it doesn't already exist. Is there functionality to do this without manual list modification? I can't seem to figure out a way to. It seems that "Append Message" would add it even if it already existed.</p>
<p>The best thing I've figured out would be to use Notepad's functionality (Find/Replace) to put Talk: into every link and then skip if contains the tag. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThadius856_6dcf.html" title="User:Thadius856">thadius856</a><sub><a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThadius856_2f19.html" title="User talk:Thadius856">talk</a></sub> 20:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that's what I am doing. I was just wondering if there was an automated method to put them on talk pages that don't have them, without having to manually place Talk: in front of each in Notepad to modify the list. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThadius856_6dcf.html" title="User:Thadius856">thadius856</a><sub><a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThadius856_2f19.html" title="User talk:Thadius856">talk</a></sub> 00:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Basic Qs: Find/Replace</span></h2>
<p>Hi all. I've just started using AWB, and I have some very basic questions...</p>
<p>(1) I'd like to have the Find/Replace function ignore any "X" that's found within a [[Category:X|X]] or [[Image:X|Y]] tag, while still seeking and replacing for "Y". (And still seeking and replacing in the rest of the article.) How is this done? (2) Can we use this to Find/Replace article titles? That is, can I use AWB to move pages?</p>
<p>Thanks. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 11:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>\r\n represents a newline, using regexes with multiline enabled, ^ represents the start of a line and $ the end. \D matches non digits, but this will match syntax and punctuation as well, so I don't know if it helps. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's the wordcount threshold for being considered a "stub"? Thanks--<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 00:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a>. Excerpt: "A stub is an article that is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of the subject, but not so short as to provide no useful information. To qualify as a stub it must at least define the meaning of the article's title. Often that means three to ten short sentences, but less text may be sufficient to qualify as a stub for articles on narrow topics, and complicated topics with more than ten sentences may still be stubs. However, in reality, many articles which are labeled as stubs are much longer than that. You can help Wikipedia by removing inappropriate stub notices.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Hi Martin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any progress on plugins getting access to methods to have AWB load XML settings files/load XML streams with settings? No real rush on this just so long as you've haven't forgotten&#160;:)</li>
<li>Looks like in SkipOptions in AWB.exe you've started to make a few settings public. If we could get access to all of the main form <i>controls</i> this way, in an API encapsulated fashion, it would help with robustnesss. As you can see from the code I sent you, I currently do all sorts of hacks like accessing your controls by name and registering handlers for them, changing the colour of a button, etc&#160;:) It works a treat of course but will break the moment you decide to rename something.</li>
<li>Logging. My plugin writes out logs (in XHTML and wiki format). I want to add support for uploading these logs to Wikipedia. Are there any functions anywhere in AWB/WikiFunctions which would help me achieve this?<br />
Also, I was thinking that this feature might be useful to other folks. Would you be interested in me writing the logging/uploading support into the WikiFunctions namespace and compiling into a seperate DLL for distribution with AWB? (WikiFunctions2.dll). I could supply the source for SVN too of course but it would be VB (boo hiss). That's if there's not already code to do this (uploading a page in the background) in the library which I've missed. Whatever, I'll still presumably need to write code to add the links for the new log pages to a central log page, and some code for configuration. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>I haven't forgotten, but I still can't decide how to do it either, plus I haven't been doing a whole lot to AWB recently.</li>
<li>I need to work out how plugins are normally implemented, I doubt passing loads of object references is the way, I'll get around to improving it eventually.</li>
<li>WikiFunctions.Editor contains code for editing articles, I haven't used it recently, but I imagine it covers your needs, if not then we can see if it could be improved. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:59, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK mate. I haven't been doing much plugin work either so no rush&#160;:)</p>
<p>I'll take a look at WikiFunctions.Editor and also of course the extended WebControl. If I end up writing a lot of portable code I'll come back and suggest sharing it again.

<p>I've started working on this Martin, and I think the Editor class is likely to be exactly what I needed. A few queries I couldn't answer myself from the source (yet) and a feature request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't seem to have an argument for "add to watchlist". Could an overloaded function perhaps be added for this?</li>
<li>What happens if the page can't be loaded? Is an error thrown? How can I distinguish between failed loads and empty pages?</li>
<li>Do <i>I</i> have to check user is logged in?</li>

<p>Another request, sorry. I see that the webcontrol has LoggedIn and UserName properties, but presumably they'll only work when the web control has a page loaded. I need to find out the username of the logged in user, and I think by far the best way to do this would be for AWB to let plugins know when it's got the user name and performed it's checkuser. Again, only a couple of lines of code. C'est possible? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 21:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Double- and triple-spaces are nothing uncommon. They occur across all of Wikipedia, not just this project. If you want to have them still match regex, use a + after the space (meaning 1 or more). For example, "foo +bar" would find "foo bar", "foo&#160;&#160;bar", "foo&#160;&#160;&#160;bar", etc. However, many browsers (IE and FF at least) don't typically render double-spaces.

<p>Martin, Is there any way you can save the name space checkbox values (in the filter) as part of the "User Preferences" or "Settings file". I am currently applying project banners to talk pages. I load a category in, use convert to talk pages feature, and then go into filter and remove all other namespaces except talk. I am having to do this each and every time. Please advise.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">View article while editing talk page?</span></h2>
<p>I'm currently using kingboyk's plugin to tag talk pages of articles as falling under <a href="../../../p/h/y/WP%7EPhys_c65f.html" title="WP:Phys">WikiProject Physics</a>. I've got a series of mixed physics and non-physics categories to go through, and it would be very useful if I could view the article pages within AWB while editing the talk pages using the plugin. That way, I can point AWB at a mixed category and just click "ignore" when I see a page that's not about physics. Is this possible?

<p>I have been getting more than my fair share of restarted edits over the last few days, and for some reason the "Replace text with last edit" option is simply not working. At what point does the "last edit" get overwritten? Is it possible for AWB to check more thoroughly as to whether this is a new article or the same one being reloaded? It might even be helpful for AWB to ask <i>every time</i> an article is reloaded whether the user wants to reload the previous text.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Making a list based on article content</span></h2>
<p>Is there any function/plugin which allows pages to be filtered by content and then saved to a list?<br />
Whilst going throgh a large list of articles where only a few needs updating (but the updating needs to be manual rather than automatic) it becomes tedious to sit and wait whilst AWB scrolls through the pages. If I on the other hand go away then AWB stops when it finds an article to update and then does noting else until I come back and tell it to continue. What would be really usefull is a function where instead of opening the article for editing it would add it to a list and then go through the rest. That way when one comes back there is a list of only articles needing updating. /<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokal_Profil_a1b0.html" title="User:Lokal Profil">Lokal_Profil</a> 19:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>HI, two requests, both of which may have been made before:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there an option to locate all the links to disambiguation pages within a single page that is being edited? That is, can I check a page for dab page links?</li>
<li>Umm, I think AWB can find all members of two categories or whatever by skipping things that do not include both.. but what if one category is on the Talk page and one is on the article? Here I'm thinking of stub template(s) on the article, and wikiproject(s) on the Talk page. Is there no way to merge the two lists to find their intersection?</li>

<p>A minor quibble.... apologies if it has already been addressed.</p>
<p>An AWB edit to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Long_Good_Friday_f464.html" title="The Long Good Friday">The Long Good Friday</a> would have changed "Long good friday DVD.jpg" to "Long good Friday DVD.jpg".... capitalising the names of days would normally be desirable, of course, but in this instance, it would have broken the image. Obviously, vigilant editors will catch things like this.... but can't AWB just be persuaded to leave images alone? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 19:46, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Insignificant Edit Templates</span></h2>
<p>Now and again, i come accross people doing insignificant edits with AWB. This is of course, against the rules of AWB.</p>
<p>In some cases, they end up typo edit summary, but no changes....</p>
<p>Rather than having to manually write out something to ask them nicely to refrain from doing it, would it be possible to create a template for it ie {{Wikipedia:AutowikiBrowser/Insignificant Edits}} , and then we can sign against it?</p>
<p>Would anyone else see a use for this?</p>

<p>Whenever I get new messages, AWB freezes and can't be exited without using CtrlAltDel. I imagine there's supposed to be some sort of buttons to click to return to the program once you've checked your messages, but these buttons are not appearing for me, and so the little pop-up box that tells me I have new messages cannot be closed. Please help. (I have mentioned this program before, about a month ago - another editor suggested simply "that shouldn't be happening. try hitting Alt-Tab."

<p>Just a few minor proposals for looks and functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "stop" button (the one in the bottom panel, not on the tool bar), should be as wide as the buttons above and below it. You might also want to give it a slight reddish tint and give the "start the process" button a slightly greenish tint.</li>
<li>When clicking "More" in the skip articles box, the window that pops up is too tall for its contents, and its title should be "Skip Options", not "SkipOptions".</li>
<li>Also in the Skip Options dialog box it should say "Skip if no tag change<b>d</b>", as everything else in that box is in the past tense.</li>
<li>The input box where you can manually add articles to be processed is quite small; it would probably be better if it was moved below the list of articles so it could be stretched.</li>
<li>In the auto mode groupbox, the text "Delay (seconds)" is not faded out when the user does not have bot rights.</li>
<li>In the automatic edit summary, when fixing typos a comma should be added before the word "Typos"</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feature request</span></h2>
<p>In the "Find &amp; Replace" pop-up box it would be great to have more control than just "Ignore external/interwiki links, images, nowiki, math and ". Would it be possible to have separate check boxes for each of these separate items? For example I often wish to change the spelling of a word in the <i>description</i> line of an image thumbnail, but not the occurance of the same word in the <i>filename</i> which would produce a broken link.

<dd>Quite right. But it's critical to think twice about which kind of edit is suitable for AWB and which requires an editor's discrimination, <i>before</i> pulling the trigger on an AWB editing session. Pointing out significant problems after so many hundreds of edits underlines AWB's thousandfold increase of the power to screw up, but I think a lesser increase in the ability to clean up the mess afterwards.

<p>I appreciate SDC's attempts to "fix" style problems, but I agree with the above, and I don't see this hyphen removal project as particularly productive. The inverse—lack of appropriate hyphenation—seems to be a much more common problem.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some minor issues with the latest version</span></h2>
<p>Just a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The setting which enables the toolbar is no longer being activated on loading a settings file. My current file contains <code>&lt;ToolBarEnabled&gt;true&lt;/ToolBarEnabled&gt;</code> but the toolbar fails to appear on loading.</li>
<li>Could we have an option as to whether to save the Article-list with a settings file? It can be handy to save the list if you're preparing a task to be processed later, but it does bloat the settings file somewhat. Also when you load, could we have an option to over-write the current list with that in the settings file? At the moment it appears to silently ignore the saved list.</li>
<li>I would like an option to "skip" the current item rather than to "ignore" it…in other words save it for later and move on to the next item in the list. This can be handy when preparing a task to be processed later: I copy my settings file between my machines at work and at home, and it would be handy if I could simply set the former going to generate a list of pages which fit the current criteria and then process them on the latter at my leisure. If this is not possible in AWB itself, is it doable with the "Make module" gadget?</li>

<p>If I save a file set up to go throught all the articles as <i>Helen Clark</i> then load one <i>John Howard</i> to make some changes to it the next time I go to save it has remembered the name of the file I last saved, <i>Helen Clark</i>, and not the name of the one I loaded, <i>John Howard</i>.</p>

<p>Hi, Just doing my DB scan on my wiki dump using AWB, noticed a few things.</p>
<p>Although the list is loaded into AWB, there is no count given in AWB. I presume this is from the count event for the listbox not being called? I know it wouldnt be the best idea doing it every item, but maybe say every minute or something?</p>
<p>The "Save result list", just creates a blank file... And to save the list in the actual AWB program, little annoying, but you need to click start, and then you can save it (ie start tab)</p>

I also found an exception earlier, but i cant seem to find it again</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Login problem</span></h2>
<p>I can't seem to use AWB 3.052 with my laptop today, as AWB keeps cycling through "Loading page to check if we are logged in." It successfully locates my user name (which shows up as green in the lower righthand corner), and sometimes it can even get a page loaded, but it still shows up as "You are not currently logged in" at the top of the window, and then it just sits there, repeatedly cycling through "loading page" and "loading page to check if we are logged in."</p>
<p>I've tried various methods to deal with this, including various permutations of loading a fresh copy of AWB, pre-logging-in via IE, trying the "login" option in the File menu, but nothing seems to work. I did note though that when I rolled back to earlier versions (3.015 and 3.029a), I correctly got the "You are not logged in" pop up (which the newer versions weren't doing), which then brought me to the login page. But even though they'll let me login, I can't use those versions of AWB, because they keep prompting me to upgrade to the newer versions.  ;) So I guess I'm stuck, unless someone knows how to disable that "upgrade to newer version" block? --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 23:41, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(update) On a different computer (desktop, not laptop), the "You are not logged in" pop up appears normally. However, if I attempt to run multiple instances of AWB (when I'm on a roll I routinely have 3 or 4 going at once), the login information is not saved per session, and I need to separately login with each instance. With earlier versions of AWB, only one login was required, and the other instances of AWB would "remember" the login info. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 03:24, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>good idea, all (typos, find and replace matches etc.) into [[image:]] and internal links [[ ]] should be ignored :&gt; <a href="../../../../pl/g/r/e/wikipedysta%7Egregul_f03c.html" class="extiw" title="pl:wikipedysta:gregul">pl:wikipedysta:gregul</a></li>

<dd>Skipping image file names and external link addresses is good, but internal links often need to be fixed. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 01:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as images are [[Image:ImageName.extension]] , and external links [http://website linkname] , this should be feasible. But like Mets501 said, internal links are needed, as some do have typos in <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReedy_Boy_3c7f.html" title="User:Reedy Boy">Reedy Boy</a> 10:19, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It might be me, but that seems like a use that would be sparsely used?</p>

<p>Has any experienced a bug where AWB is adding pages too your watch list even thought the options is unselected ? (<a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnevin_9c3c.html" title="User:Gnevin">Gnevin</a> 22:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Yes, though it's not so much a bug, as "just one of those things."  ;) Evidently the toggle on AWB can only be used to turn <i>on</i> watchlisting if it's already <i>off</i> in your normal preferences. If it's <i>on</i> in your normal preferences, the AWB toggle really has no effect. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 01:08, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So i have to turn it off in my watchlist ok, Maybe this should be made a little clearer on the main page (<a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnevin_9c3c.html" title="User:Gnevin">Gnevin</a> 11:47, 29 November 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>The Start tab defaults the focus to the edit summary field. Several times I've found this has meant I've inadvertantly scrolled to a different edit summary. Could it default to a different field? <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 22:48 <a href="../../../2/9/_/29_November_a4fb.html" title="29 November">29 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</p>

<dd>It could be. Quite easily, a simple change for MaxSem or Martin... What would you prefer it on? <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReedy_Boy_3c7f.html" title="User:Reedy Boy">Reedy Boy</a> 10:37, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Building on from this, it would be good if there was an "Add edit summary" button so that custom edit summaries could be saved without digging through the config file. <i><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryboyles_b16b.html" title="User:Harryboyles"><font color="darkblue">Harryboyles</font></a></b></i> 10:47, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
