<p>Autobiographical work took the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_comics.html" title="Alternative comics">alternative comics</a> scene by storm during this period. The autobiographical genre had turned into English-speaking alternative comics subculture's "signature genre" in much the way that superhero stories dominated the American mainstream comic books, the stereotypical example recounting the awkward moment which followed when, the cartoonist sitting alone in a coffee shop when their ex-girlfriend walks in.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of the most popular self-published <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minicomic.html" title="Minicomic">mini-comics</a> of the 1990s in America, <i>Silly Daddy</i>, depicted Joe Chiappetta's parenthood and divorce, sometimes realistically and sometimes in a parallel fantasy story.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
