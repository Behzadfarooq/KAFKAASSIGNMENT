Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., "only" yeah right).

<li>See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at <a href="../../../a/u/g/Talk%7EAugusto_Pinochet_4eff.html" title="Talk:Augusto Pinochet">Talk:Augusto Pinochet</a>.

<li>To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote. All other parties have written <i>several</i> draft intros <i>each</i> to try to accommodate objections and concerns. 172 dismisses these efforts as "partisan bickering" and "bullshit". - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 22:30, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. "All other parties," according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the <b>minority</b> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Augusto_Pinochet#CIA_poll" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Augusto_Pinochet#CIA_poll" rel="nofollow">most recent round of polling</a>. His preferred version does not have a "consensus" behind it. This was <i>really</i> the winning position in the poll: "Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:25, 18 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172. The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically. Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering. Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 06:44, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I wasn't "brought in" to vote. Nor was I voting "ideologically", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments AndyL 10:33, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who am I attacking? And saying I "should present more compelling arguments" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:20, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't "brought in" to vote, I wasn't voting "ideologically" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 12:31, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regardless of who the poll may have "brought in", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to "bring in" opinions from members of the community. Regardless of whose "random buddies" they are. Nor do I see why the fact that people have had little or no previous role in contributing to the page disqualifies their opinions, or shows that they have no understanding of the issues.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I don't see anything approaching a consensus for either version.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no consensus behind Veriverily's intro? So I am not a liar when I state otherwise? Veriverily stated, "Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda. The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying." Can you ask this user to stop slandering me and giving misleading summaries of developments on the page so as to instill prejudice among other users against my comments? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 07:05, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Even assuming that a consensus was ever "reached" (before or after the poll), the debates and revert wars prove that the consensus was never <b>maintained</b>. About the poll specifically, I note that the results as currently presented are heavily refactored, because the poll itself led to a revert war <b>on this talk page</b>. I don't question the validity of any individual user's vote, but I can't see a disputed poll, among a small sampling of Wikipedia users, as a permanently binding determination of consensus.</p>
<p>I do note that AndyL and Ericd were "brought in" (that is, specifically notified by 172 of this discussion) to validate their votes. Not that anybody should object to that, but I do hope that since they are now aware the debate rages on, they might stick around with the discussion to help us move toward a consensus. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:39, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michael Snow, just to clarify the points I made which you disputed: Bringing in members is one thing, but campaigning specifically for one view <i>does</i> taint the results (you seem aware of this). As for the "no understanding of the issues", I was referring to the fact that some who voted in the poll gave reasons for their vote which showed they were wholly unaware of the ongoing discussion. For instance, giving the GWU link (which has already been cited and rebutted), claiming the US acknowledges that the CIA instigated the coup (which had been specifically contradicted by citing a CIA briefing), and saying that there is "no controversy" over it, when there clearly is. - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:20, 18 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Veriverily, you know very well that the intro does not refer to the coup as 'U.S.-instigated,' something about which there would really be controversy. The issue here is an intro that refers to U.S. backing, something about which there is no controversy. Your comments are addressing a non-issue. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 07:09, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>Once again, 172 ignores the fact that "US-backed" is ambiguous and misleading. See the discussion above...<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>And (for those who just tuned in) "US-backed" being one of the few things said in the first sentence strongly suggests the US's role was rather significant (merely "wanting it to happen" would not warrant such placement). <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 11:14, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another poll</span></h2>
<p>Is the assertion of U.S. backing for the coup misleading or controversial in Augusto Pinochet/intro (succinct version), even in the presence of the footnote?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is loaded phrasing. I do not consider it misleading, but the simple fact that this discussion is taking place is proof that it is controversial. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 17:07, 2004 May 19 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ec, this is asking whether or not the assertion is controversial, as opposed to an undisputable fact, not whether U.S. actions were 'controversial'. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a></dd>

<p>[IMO "even in the presence of a footnote" should not be in the question, because some of us do not want a footnote even if we think it goes some way towards clearing up the NPOV issue. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> ]</p>
<p><b>Yes:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>By 172's own definition (see the discussion in section 10) the possible meanings of "backed" include "aided", so the word is misleading. 172 should also note that readers of this article are unlikley to look up every word they read in a dictionary, and should take the context of the word into account (as VV points out in his previous comment). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>My own definition to "back" (v) is <i>American Heritage's</i>, which is to provide support, assistance, <i><b>or</b></i> encouragement for (a contending force). It does not necessarily entail the provision of "aid." Cadr is putting words in my mouth; I said "or" as opposed to "and" when I has written the word "aid" once (very hastily). <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 11:49, 19 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact that you said "and" instead of "or" is of no significance, as I've pointed out already. If one possible meaning of "US-backed" is "US-supported" or "US-assisted" <i>or</i> "US-aided" (going on 172's earlier, different definition), the word is misleading. (There is no conclusive evidence that the US assisted/aided the actual 1973 coup). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<li>The US didn't back the coup. Am I missing something here? Why would we say they backed it if they didn't?

<li>This entire debate is utter nonsense. The historical record is clear: Nixon and Kissinger wanted Allende out and the CIA went about engineering it by funding the opposition, spreading FUD, and the like. The day of the coup, the American reporter Charles Horman was in Viña del Mar, near the port of Valparaíso, which was a key base for both the Chilean coup plotters and US military and intelligence personnel who were supporting them. He spoke with several US operatives and took notes documenting the role of the United States in overthrowing the Allende government. Several days later he was arrested and executed by the Chilean armed forces. His family believes this was because he (accidently) bore witnesss the US role in the affair. 'Backing'? Yep, I'd call it backing, although perhaps we could debate how active a role the CIA et al played in the coup, but nobody is claiming that the CIA itself bombed La Moneda -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 16:03, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

<li>Puritan yes – dumb no, not except for in your rhetoric above. Since I was 17 and started full-time apprenticeship, I admit to have studied the foreign language of the country where I live in any way resembling school. "Intellectual" - just the right accusation to throw at me! Common Americans being more ignorant of their country's foreign politics than the electorates of other democracies, that's a fact. The arguments are very well presented by plenty of others. There is no need to repeat those.

</li>
<li>I wasn't going to vote on this, because I thought the poll question missed the mark. The issue isn't whether a particular wording is misleading, etc., but rather what's the best way to present the subject. I don't like the footnote. I thought the best approach was an in-text summary in the introduction, avoiding the word "backed," even though living with some nuance made for a longer intro. To that end I essayed a revision of the first-created sandbox. I tried to meet Cadr's objection to my initial version. Now, however, I find that VeryVerily has edited it so as to eviscerate any discussion of this issue in the intro.<br />
It seems, then, that each side has its own sandbox and the two sides continue to talk past each other. With regard to the intro, 172 wants a flat statement of "backed," somewhat qualified in a footnote, while VV wants a mere allusion to what "many believe," with no indication in the intro that they have any factual basis for their beliefs. <i>As between those two extremes</i> (CIA role stated as fact versus CIA role stated as mere unsupported opinion, albeit opinion of "many"), I prefer the former, although the specific wording of the footnote would need some work.<br />
I still think the footnote is, by its nature, an inelegant solution. It would be better for the text of the intro to state a few key evidentiary points, including the CIA's denial, rather than present the conclusion as an established fact. If other people agree with me, and say so and/or restore key data to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro" rel="nofollow">original intro sandbox</a>, then perhaps we have a chance of reaching consensus on that approach. Until then, I'm going to turn my attention to editing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro_(succinct_version)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro_(succinct_version)" rel="nofollow">"succinct version"</a> of the intro.<br />
Finally, on the issue of recruitment: 172 did urge me to vote in this poll. I ignored his urging for the reasons stated above. I have now been "recruited" to vote by VV's edit, not by 172's electioneering. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 00:13, 20 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's your vote, but puzzling reasoning: you're not voting on the question asked in the poll. Anyway, the whole point of the sandbox is to experiment. I gave my reasons (several times) for my edits, which (perhaps ironically) largely come to succintness: the <i>intro</i> does not need to lay out the evidence, that's what the <i>article</i> for. The intro serves to summarize. Fercrissakes, look at the <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusto_Pinochet_2e33.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">article</a>, nearly <i>half</i> of which is now about the CIA. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 00:36, 20 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My vote is that the wording being polled is not misleading (the question asked in the poll) but that the wording also isn't good. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I agree that the intro should summarize, not present the whole discussion, but it involves striking a balance between, on the one hand, going into too much detail about the facts, and, on the other hand, simply saying "many believe" with no allusion whatsoever to the facts until later on. I don't think your edit version makes any attempt to strike that balance. Your version isn't a summary, it's a reference. My idea was that something taking up nearly half the article, as you put it, deserves a bit more space in the intro. I tried to put in a few critical points that would, for example, in response to SamSpade's inquiry, show that there are indeed references available, while also noting the CIA's denial and leaving the full elaboration for later in the article. My hope was that we could work out a consensus summary. Perhaps I was unduly optimistic. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 02:48, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is evidence both ways and no consensus, which makes it hard to be both neutral and succinct. In addition, as the discussion above shows, people with different opinions can see different shades of meaning in a term like "backing." Therefore, I think we're stuck with having to go into somewhat more detail about what's known. Two specific points: (1) The heavy emphasis on the CIA could give the misleading impression that the CIA was running a rogue operation; the important issue is the role of the <i>United States</i> in Pinochet's accession, not the role of the CIA, so I've added the Nixon statement. (2) My response to Cadr's edit summary: The CIA has admitted advance knowledge of the coup. From CBS's report on the documents declassified during the Clinton Administration: "The CIA had prior knowledge of the plot that overthrew Allende three years later but denies any direct involvement. CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher said, 'We were aware of coup plotting in 1973, but we did not instigate it.'" (<a href="http://cbsnews.cbs.com/stories/2000/09/11/world/main232452.shtml" class="external text" title="http://cbsnews.cbs.com/stories/2000/09/11/world/main232452.shtml" rel="nofollow">CBS News story</a> and, to the same effect, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/09/19/us.cia.chile.ap/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/09/19/us.cia.chile.ap/" rel="nofollow">CNN's story</a>) Do we need to insert a citation into the text?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Don't be silly</span></h2>
<p>All this talk of settling the editing issues by polling and declaring "winners" is silly. As Michael pointed out (more politely!), that's not what polls are for. Well, I'm telling you that the official policy of this website is <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>If a fact or value (or anything else important) is in dispute in an article, <b>the Wikipedia is not supposed to settle the issue</b>. Rather, it <b>REPORTS WHAT THE VARIOUS SIDES SAY</b>. Sorry for shouting, but some contributors on this page just don't get it.</p>
<p>Including a phrase like "US-backed coup" <b>implies that Wikipedia endorses the view</b> that the coup was backed by the US (whatever that means or entails). Since there is CLEARLY a dispute among us contributors about whether (or how much) the US "backed the coup", the Wikipedia cannot come out and say flatly <i>that the US backed the coup</i>.</p>
<p>Rather, the article must report what various historians and other observers have said. I'd be happy to see something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>All historians, except for a few right-wing wackos, agree that the US backed the coup.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Okay, <i>wackos</i> is a bit extreme, but you know what I mean: <b>we attribute every point of view (POV) to the advocated of that POV.</b>)</p>
<p>It might be a bit more polished to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historians and others disagree over how much support the US gave to Pinochet. Joe Schmoe says the US "backed the coup by supplying arms, intelligence, money, and assurances of friendly future relations." Sam Shady, a known CIA operative, claims that the US had no part in the coup, aside from making public statements amounting to a claim that Allende was destroying the Chilean economy and driving the country toward dictatorship. (Note that these are <b>made-up examples</b> of the kinds of quotations we need to find and put into the article, so that all POV is properly attributed.) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:06, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poll results and their significance</span></h2>
<p>Is everyone in agreement that 172 has won (oops, musn't use that word...) the poll? He has been quite active in canvasing voters, but I think it's unlikely that a comparable number of people could be convinced to vote in the other direction, and this is basically a repeat of a previous poll with a similar result. I think we should now decide whether the results of this poll have any implications for the content of the intro, which is doubtful in my opinion. If some of the voters would join in the actual discussion on this page, we might really get somewhere, but so far the pattern has been that only a small number of people have participated in discussion, while a much larger number has voted (and we have no way of knowing how well informed these people are with regard to the preceding dicussion — an important issue). Surely, if Wikipedia is discussion and consensus based, the views of people who have not (yet) entered into discussion are of dubious significance. Let's finish with the poll and get some more people involved in forming a consensus.</p>
<p>(Obviously a lot of the sentiment here comes straight from Ed Poor's post, but my additional suggestion is that we close the poll now, with the results archived as they currently stand.)</p>

<dd>The poll is utterly meaningless, which is why I did not even take part. 172 recruited his ideological allies to vote, and they did. (With similar canvassing we could garner votes of our own, but no matter.) There are only one or two users I find it sad to see caring so little about NPOV, but the results change nothing. I <i>already know</i> about Wikipedia's strong political bias and don't need a poll to remind me. As has been pointed out, a similar poll on whether to include <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Mother_Teresa_e896.html" title="Criticisms of Mother Teresa">Criticisms of Mother Teresa</a> would also probably go the wrong way. And Cadr is quite correct that most of those people have not participated in the discussion; statements such as "I didn't even know this was disputed" indicate, uh..., unawareness of what is going on here. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 21:21, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd rather not get involved in personal disputes, but the idea that Wikipedia has a systematic left-wing bias is silly. There are lots of users who are on the left, and lots on the right. Different pages, and different disputes, might tilt one way or another, but the fact that pretty much everybody seems to feel that Wikipedia is biased against their POV suggests that we've got things about right, at least in terms of the big picture. As to this page as a whole, I'll have to read through the talk archives to see what points have been made, but I've really <i>never</i> seen it seriously disputed before that the US backed the coup. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 21:33, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if I may say, you seem to have a bit of a left tilt yourself, which may be why things seem "about right"&#160;:). The main complaints about systematic "right-wing bias" come from those who want to see Wikipedia look like Mao's Red Book. There are, to be sure, other strains of thought here - though outnumbered sometimes persistent - and lesser articles often reflect the bias of the last to edit them. Still, I feel conservatives "stand out" here, and the more modest even half-apologize for their views (I recall <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArk30inf_d1d1.html" title="User:Ark30inf">User:Ark30inf</a>'s old user page).

<dd>I wouldn't deny having something of a left tilt. At the same time, I think it is deeply unfair to say that those who complain of a right tilt want to see Wikipedia look like Mao's Little Red Book, just as it would be unfair to say that those who complain about systematic left-wing bias want Wikipedia to look like Fox News. Probably more unfair, since Fox News is more within the realm of acceptable political beliefs than Maoism. At any rate, I'd add that the left bias (such as it exists) on Wikipedia is a rather intellectual, academic leftism, for the most part, and not very similar to the agitprop of Soviet-style communism. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 00:26, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

FOX news certainly is extreme, so far as I can see; I suppose anyone who saw it as mainstream would probably perceive a left-wing bias in any serious political commentary. Being pretty left-wing myself, I've always perceived a right-wing bias to Wikipedia (at least on any issue involving America). I would say that there's very little "academic Xism" on Wikipedia, and a definite majority of underinformed Yism and Zism. Anyway, given that we all perceive different biases, it's probably fair to say that Wikipedia as a whole is fairly neutral, as John points out. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>The point is is that "backed" is a vague word. Everyone thinks the US backed the coup <i>in some sense</i>, but it would be easy to read the intro and get the wrong idea (e.g. that there was direct US military involvement, at one extreme). The footnote helps with this, but I don't like it because the main body of the text should be clear in the first place. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<p>Voting on POV/NPOV issues isn't very productive in my experience. I think we should continue to work towards a solution that is acceptable to all parties. In my opinion, writing that Pinochet's <i>government</i> was backed by the US is far less ambiguous than the assertion that the coup itself was backed (which is likely correct in virtually all possible interpretations, but still to some extent unproven). Then we can do away with the footnote and discuss the details of the coup in the appropriate section in the article.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:09, May 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Encarta</i> just mentions U.S.-backing in the intro with no footnote, but let's keep the footnote as a gesture of compromise <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564829/Augusto_Pinochet.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564829/Augusto_Pinochet.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. We don't want an entire sentence or two on U.S. involvement, as this is an intro to a biographical article, not the 1973 coup.

<dd>The footnote's pretty unpopular anyway, since it's an inelegant and not particularly effective solution. Several people who have voted no in the poll have said that they don't like it.

<dd>Most of the people voting in the poll had no previous input to the page, and had not followed the previous discussion. The question was rather narrow, since it did not mention any alternatives to using "US-backed", so people could not object to your intro on grounds of style or clarity. I've explained inumerable times why the footnote is not a good idea, and even people who have voted no in the poll have said that they do not like it. All the poll does is verify that your intro is not especially misleading when the footnote is present; it is <i>not</i> a vote of confidence in your intro on any other grounds (i.e. style, clarity, etc.) If you wish to decide by poll which intro we should have, you need a new question (i.e. is <i>this</i> intro better than <i>that</i> intro?) <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Give it up. If this goes to arbitration, you wouldn't even get the footnote. This will look like a deliberate stalling attempt to everyone else. I mean, the 14 users who voted "no" sure as hell aren't going to turn around and vote for an intro reading, "many people believe the CIA had a role in the coup." Please handle the poll results as honorably as TDC handled them on Talk:Fascism.

<dd>That's not necessarily the intro they'd be asked to vote for, 172. The idea that this poll is all that is required to get your intro into the article is farsical. For a start, it doesn't show that your intro is any good, all it shows is that it's <i>not misleading</i>. This side-steps the main issue — no-one has seriously suggested that the intro is especially misleading with the footnote, but plently have objected to the footnote as a means of avoiding ambiguity (why not just use unambiguous language is the first place?) It may well be the case that a majority of people would find VV's or mine or JamesMLane's intro not to be misleading if a poll were held to find out, and such polls would surely be necessary to give context to your poll. To decide on an intro for the article, we would have to have a poll between several <i>competing</i> intros. You poll is a pathetic attempt to get any kind of positive result in the hope that people will be mislead into believing it is significant. If this goes to arbitration, I expect people there will take as dim a view of your poll question and your canvasing as they have here (complaint has been quite prevalent, even amongst those who voted no). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Your argument against the succinct version of the intro emphatically lost with <b>88% voting against it</b>. I'm done hearing you say the same things over and over again. Backing is an indisputable fact and backing means backing! If you insist, we can have arbitration affirm that as well. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:44, 20 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>172, the poll did <i>not</i> ask if the "succinct version" should be used. One might almost as well have a poll about whether a particular intro was correct in using "CIA" rather than "C.I.A.," and then use the poll's approval of the form "CIA" to mean that that version of the intro had to be used. Cadr's interpretation of the vote is much more accurate. Please note my explanatory comment (as one of the "88%" you invoke): "My vote is that the wording being polled is not misleading (the question asked in the poll) but that the wording also isn't good." I believe I'm not the only one who feels that way. We need to continue the discussion, perhaps with yet a third (!) sandbox. The first sandbox, where VV deleted from the intro my citations to the CIA's admitted role, can be reserved for those who don't want anything in the intro that would give the slightest validation to the charges of U.S. culpability. The second sandbox, your "succinct" version, can be reserved for those who want to treat that charge as established fact and don't want anything in the text of the intro that would cast the slightest doubt on their position. The new (third) sandbox) would be for people genuinely interested in finding text that reasonably accommodates all points of view. Then, when each version had gone through some discussions and edits, we could have a comparative poll, eliciting preferences as among the three of them. Your alternative suggestion -- that we treat it as a done deal, archive the talk and move on -- is unrealistic, as we would immediately be back in another round of reverts. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 14:29, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, 172 has not responded to my substantive point. As I said, the poll only established that 172's intro was not misleading, <i>which I did not disagree with anyway</i>. It did not establish that his intro has consensus or majority support, which is the key issue. Please respond to this point, 172. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
