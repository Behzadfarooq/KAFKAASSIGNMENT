<p>Whats with that picture of women in hats at rubens? I have never heard of these women in hats and I can find no mention of them anywhere on the internet and I am skeptical of the claim that they are "famous" and thus propose that the picture be removed. Surely there is something in Augusta more worthy of having a picture on the page that some crummy looking manequins in a dingy storefron on Broad Street.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well you obviously must not be a native of Augusta. Everyone knows Rubens Dept Store and the "Women in Hats." Indeed the store and it's display fall into the category of being a local oddity, but I think they are worth mentioning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Provide a citation then. If generic mannequins in generic hats in a generic storefront qualify as a "local oddity", then every town in America has a local oddity just as odd. If it qualifies as "notable" then find a mention of it somewhere on this vast internet, or at least in the Augusta Chronicle. A quick poll of three of my fellow *native* Augustans reveals that none of them have heard of the "Women in Hats", and one of them has taught history for over 20 years. One of them had heard that Rubens sells hats tho.&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 02:07, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since when is the CSRA only made up of just counties in Georgia? Have you even been to Augusta? I just performed an informal poll of my fellow Augustans, asking the question "What would you consider the CSRA to be made up of?" and not one of them excluded areas in South Carolina. Ironically I am watching News Channel 12 just tonight and they mentioned that Radio Shack is closing "three stores in the CSRA, one in Evans, one in Martinez, and one in Aiken." -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 03:09, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For your information, I was born and raised in Augusta. I know Augusta folks colloquially refer to the entire Augusta/North Augusta/Aiken area as "the CSRA", but the CSRA official website, at <a href="http://www.csrardc.org" class="external free" title="http://www.csrardc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.csrardc.org</a>, specifically states that the CSRA is "a 13 county and 41 city region in the eastern portion of Central Georgia". As an encyclopedia, we should be dealing in facts, not informal opinion. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 03:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am interested about the origin of the phrase "CSRA", you keep using the term CSRA and CSRA RDC as interchangable terms, I mean the quote that you mention in it's entirety is "The CSRA RDC is a public sector, non-profit planning and development agency that serves a 13 county and 41 city region in the eastern portion of Central Georgia." If the CSRA RDC does not refer to itself as simply the "CSRA" as you seem to imply that they do, then why should Wikipedia insist that the only proper usage of the term "CSRA" is in reference to some beauracratic entity that most people in the CSRA (on both sides of the river) have never heard of. If we are going to have an article about the CSRA RDC I think it should be in a seperate article by itself apart from an article about the CSRA. I think it is reasonable to recognize the FACT that a vast majority of Augustans consider the CSRA to be an area that encompasses areas in Georgia and in South Carolina. There are examples on wikipedia that concern subjects similar to this, for example the entry on <a href="../../../u/p/s/Upstate_New_York_7a34.html" title="Upstate New York">Upstate New York</a> is one. A search on google for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=CSRA+augusta&amp;start=50&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=CSRA+augusta&amp;start=50&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">CSRA Augusta</a>" yields dozens of results, but you'll have too look far down the list, number 110 or so, in fact, to find the link to the CSRA RDC. Many other organizations that use the name "CSRA" rank much higher, The CSRA Linux User's Group (ranked 1st), The CSRA Shag Club (which has meetings in Augusta, North Augusta, and Aiken) and the CSRA Heat Olympic Volleyball Club rank much higher. I would water that the vast majority of those clubs and organizations bestowed the CSRA moniker on themselves not because they just happened to fall within the beauracratic boundries of the CSRA RDC, but rather because they live in the Augusta area, and as all Augustans know, that is what you call the Augusta area, including those vast areas that happen to be on the northern side of the River. While I can accept that perhaps the CSRA RDC was the organization that coined the term "Central Savannah River Area", I can't accept that wikipedia would try to pass off as fact that the only way such a term can be used is in reference to that organization. That is not only misleading, it is simply not factual. If that organization *did* coin the term, I would request that you please cite some source that proves that. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 03:59, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Our article on the Central Savannah River Site does already mention that some cities and counties in South Carolina consider themselves part of the CSRA. Perhaps we can revise it to say that the CSRA is considered essentially the same as the Augusta-Aiken Metroploitan Area (which is how people in Augusta, Aiken, etc. treat the terms)...but we need a reliable source for that. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 05:05, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article does mention that "some cities and counties in South Carolina consider themselves part of the CSRA". I think that POV is a bit skewed in that, as I'm sure you would recognize, more than just those cities and counties consider themselves part of the CSRA, rather the vast majority of the denizens of the CSRA consider those cities and counties in South Carolina to be part of the CSRA. What would you consider a "reliable source" that the CSRA is considered the Augusta area as a whole? I don't think it would be difficult to find some sources that mention the CSRA containing areas such as North Augusta and Aiken, as I noted earlier, I heard the CSRA refered to on Channel 12 as including Aiken and North Augusta. Either way, I propose that an article about the CSRA RDC be a seperate article. I for one haven't seen any evidence that the CSRA RDC: 1. coined the phrase "Central Savannah River Area", 2. has sole domain over the defenition of the location of the CSRA, 3. is the most notable organization that uses the name CSRA. Even if any of those is shown to be, I still don't see why in the long run the CSRA RDC should warrant more than a footnote in a short article about the CSRA.</dd>

<dd>My main contention would be this: Those who desire to find out what the "CSRA" *is* are going to find the information that the CSRA is a colloquial term refering to the Greater Augusta area as a whole, as opposed to a beaurcratic area defined by an an organization that most people in Augusta probablly have never heard of will most likely find the former, as opposed to the latter, more useful and, more importantly, more relevant to whatever would cause someone to inquire about the Central Savannah River Area. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 07:17, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FOLKS-- This debate is really beside the point. Any Augusta metro area discussed in this article should be the <i>Augusta-Aiken (GA-SC) metropolitan area</i> defined by the US Census Bureau and the Office of Budget Management. All U.S. metro areas are defined by these two agencies. The Census Bureau/OBM definition (and population) is the one that appears in encyclopedias and almanachs, and Wikipedia is no exception.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is no reason that colloquial and poorly defined geographical areas should be omited from articles like this. The fact of the matter is, is that most people in the <a href="../../../c/s/r/CSRA_373f.html" title="CSRA">CSRA</a> refer to the CSRA as the "CSRA". I'm not saying that the article should use the term CSRA in lieu of the 'official' designation of "Augusta-Aiken metropolitan area". But the article should not omit the usage of "CSRA" completely just because there is a more "official" designation. Doing so results in an incomplete article, and it does no service to anyone wanting accurate and notable information on the city of Augusta. Shall we erase all mention of The "<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Area_2a1a.html" title="Bay Area">Bay Area</a>" in favor of the more sanitary and more accurate "San Francisco Bay Area"? Shall we delete the article on <a href="../../../u/p/s/Upstate_New_York_7a34.html" title="Upstate New York">Upstate New York</a> all together since no one's is even quite sure where it is? -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 03:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>== Test question: Does anyone remember that blue textbook on Augusta History? You know the one that we had to study in elementary and then <em>again</em> in high school? If you remember it (along with the quarter system) there shouldn't be a problem in keeping this Wiki to standards. Apart from the racial politics, and a certain political loud mouth who <strong>should stay in Atlanta</strong>, I love my native city dearly and promote it online. I can help to edit this Wiki to standards, but being a product of the RCBE school system, don't shoot me for flunking English grammar.&#160;:p Jokes aside, what <em>is</em> needed to get this Wiki to standards (that Wikipedian didn't leave a comment)?
