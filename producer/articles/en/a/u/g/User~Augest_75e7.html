<p>Leslie Cheung was born in <a href="../../../k/o/w/Kowloon.html" title="Kowloon">Kowloon</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Cheung was the youngest of 10 children of a middle class family. His father was a fairly well-known <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tailor.html" title="Tailor">tailor</a>, whose customers included American actors, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Holden_9ea3.html" title="William Holden">William Holden</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cary_Grant_b5ee.html" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>. His parents divorced when he was quite young. At the age of 13, he was sent to England as a boarder at Norwich School. He worked as a bartender and then sang at a restaurant during the weekends. He was later admitted to <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_University_8dee.html" title="Leeds University">Leeds University</a> in northern <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, where he majored in textile management. He dropped out of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_University_8dee.html" title="Leeds University">Leeds University</a> at the end of his freshman year and returned to Hong Kong due to a family mishap. During a radio interview in 1985, Cheung admitted that he had a fairly tough childhood.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, Cheung won the second prize at Asian Music Contest held by Rediffusion Television Co. (RTV). He signed a contract with RTV (RTV subsequently became Asia Television Company (ATV)) and started his career in entertainment industry. He also signed a contract with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polydor_Records_bb15.html" title="Polydor Records">Polydor Records</a> for music and released <i>Day Dreaming</i> (1977) and <i>Lover's Arrow</i> (1979).</p>
<p>The early days of his career were not easy. He was once booed off the stage during a public performance. His first two albums were not welcomed by the public. He left <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polydor_Records_bb15.html" title="Polydor Records">Polydor Records</a> upon the end of his contract. Cheung's first ever film, <i>The Erotic Dream of the Red Chamber</i> (紅樓春上春) in 1978 was a soft porn film. It marked a low point in his career. Cheung later disclosed that he was unaware of the sexual nature of the film when he signed the contract.</p>
<p>During the 70s and 80s, he appeared in a number of TV dramas such as <i>The Young Concubine</i> (我家的女人), <i>Agency 24</i> (甜甜廿四味), <i>Pairing</i> (對對糊), and <i>The Spirit Of The Sword</i> (浣花洗劍錄). These TV dramas helped turn him into a household name in South East Asia.</p>

<p>In 1982, Cheung joined Capital Artists upon the end of his contract with RTV. It was at Capital Artist that Florence Chan became his music agent and remained as such through his demise. While at Capital Artist, he also met <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Mui_4a43.html" title="Anita Mui">Anita Mui</a>, another Hong Kong <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantopop.html" title="Cantopop">Cantopop</a> idol, and built up their long lasting friendship. In 1983, Cheung released his first hit song, <i>The Wind Blows On</i>. In 1984, he released his first top ten hit song <i>Monica</i>, which became the first so-called "fast" song that won the <i>RTHK Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Award</i>. <i>Monica</i> became a representation of a new genre of Hong Kong music in the mid 1980s. Fans began to demand fast and energetic Cantopop songs that would be suitable for both dancing and listening. Other <i>Top Ten Gold Songs</i> released by Cheung through Capital Artists included <i>Wild Wind</i> (不羈的風) (album, <i>For Your Love Only</i>, 1985); <i>Who Can Be With Me</i> (有誰共鳴) (album, <i>Leslie Cheung: Allure Me</i>, 1986) and <i>Mode of Those Years</i> (當年情) (theme song for <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_5002.html" title="A Better Tomorrow">A Better Tomorrow</a></i>, album <i>Leslie Cheung: Allure Me</i>, 1986). <i>Mode of Those Years</i> (當年情) became the <i>Gold of the Gold Songs</i> (Best Song) of the Year for 1986.</p>
<p>Cheung's movie career was a little slower to take off. He appeared in supporting roles in his second and third movies <i>Encore</i> (1980) and <i>On Trial</i> (1981). However, his acting talent was soon recognized with his nomination for the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Film_Awards_e6fb.html" title="Hong Kong Film Awards">Hong Kong Film Awards</a>'s Best Supporting Actor for his role in <i>On Trial</i>. Subsequently after this nomination, he began to star as the leading man in <i>Teenage Dreamers</i> (1982) and has held the lead role in almost every movie he had starred in since. However from the early 1980s through 1986, most of the movies he had starred were teenage movies. Among them, <i><a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">Nomad</a></i> (1982, directed by Patrick Tam Kar-ming) are widely considered by film critic as the representation of the Hong Kong "New Wave" films. Cheung's role as Louis in <i><a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">Nomad</a></i> won him his first Best Actor nomination of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Film_Awards_e6fb.html" title="Hong Kong Film Awards">Hong Kong Film Awards</a>. Later, Cheung confessed that he considered <i><a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">Nomad</a></i> as his very first "real" movie. During this period, Cheung continued to act in a number of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_Broadcasts_2669.html" title="Television Broadcasts">Television Broadcasts</a> (TVB) dramas, such as <i>Once Upon an Ordinary Girl</i> (儂本多情) and <i>The Fallen Family</i> (武林世家).</p>

<p>In 1986, he joined Cinepoly Records Hong Kong and released the album <i><a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Romance_db2c.html" title="Summer Romance">Summer Romance</a></i> in 1987. <i><a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Romance_db2c.html" title="Summer Romance">Summer Romance</a></i> became the <i>Best Selling CD of the Year</i> and <i>IFPI Best Selling Album</i> in Hong Kong. The success of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Romance_db2c.html" title="Summer Romance">Summer Romance</a> made him one of the top two Cantopop idols (the other one was <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Tam_176a.html" title="Alan Tam">Alan Tam</a>) at the time. In 1988, he composed one of his most famous songs <i>Silence is Golden</i> (沉默是金). Other popular albums published by Cheung through Cinepoly Records included <i><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Summer_6b4f.html" title="Hot Summer">Hot Summer</a></i> (1988), <i><a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Snow_082a.html" title="Virgin Snow">Virgin Snow</a></i>(1988), <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_%2789.html" title="Leslie '89">Leslie '89</a></i> (<i>Side face</i>, IFPI Best Album of the Year, 1989), <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Encounter_d215.html" title="Final Encounter">Final Encounter</a></i> (1989), and <i>Salute</i> (1990). <i>Salute</i> was the first non-profit album released by a superstar in Hong Kong music history that would only collect songs originally performed by other singers. According to Cheung, <i>Salute</i> is an album to "Salute" to the music. He donated all the income from <i>Salute</i> to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Academy_for_Performing_Arts_7f70.html" title="Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts">Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts</a>(香港演藝學院), which was named as <i>Leslie Cheung Memorial Fund</i> after his death.</p>
<p>With the popularity of Cheung and Tam, the fans of the stars became hostile to each other and started a long-standing conflict. The situation became worse soon and brought huge pressure to both singers. In 1988, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Tam_176a.html" title="Alan Tam">Alan Tam</a> claimed to quit from all pop music award ceremonies. In 1989, Cheung claimed to retire from his music career as a singer. Cheung then set a record by being the first singer ever in Cantopop history to hold a retirement concert series (<i>Final Encounter of the Legend</i>), which ran for 33 consecutive nights (he was 33 at the time) at Hong Kong Coliseum. In 1990, he left Hong Kong at the peak of his music career and immigrated to British Columbia, Canada. Later in 1992, he gained Canadian citizenship and left Canada to reside in Hong Kong again.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 1989, Cheung acted in a number of movies that are considered as Hong Kong classics by film critics and Asian movie fans. In 1986, Cheung co-starred with <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chow_Yun_Fat_502d.html" title="Chow Yun Fat">Chow Yun Fat</a> in <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_5002.html" title="A Better Tomorrow">A Better Tomorrow</a></i> (directed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Woo_8471.html" title="John Woo">John Woo</a>), which was widely considered as a trend starter for Hong Kong triad movies in the 1980s. Cheung played <i>Kit</i>, a righteous and idealistic young cop. Cheung's role in the movie was widely considered as his debut as a serious actor. He also starred in the sequel, <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_II_5675.html" title="A Better Tomorrow II">A Better Tomorrow II</a></i> (1987). In 1987, Cheung starred in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Kwan_cc3e.html" title="Stanley Kwan">Stanley Kwan</a>'s <i><a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouge_%281987%29.html" title="Rouge (1987)">Rouge</a></i>. He played <i>Chen-Pang Chan</i>, an infatuated, opium-smoking playboy, and the doomed lover of a beautiful prostitute, <i>Fleur</i> (played by <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Mui_4a43.html" title="Anita Mui">Anita Mui</a>). That same year (1987), he appeared in <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsui_Hark_8660.html" title="Tsui Hark">Tsui Hark</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Chinese_Ghost_Story_7fd8.html" title="A Chinese Ghost Story">A Chinese Ghost Story</a></i>(directed by Ching Siu-tung). Cheung played <i>Ling Choi Sin</i>, a nice but cowardly debt collector who had fallen in love with a beautiful ghost (played by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Wong_9b81.html" title="Joey Wong">Joey Wong</a>). His performance in these movies won him two Best Actor nomination from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Film_Awards_e6fb.html" title="Hong Kong Film Awards">Hong Kong Film Awards</a>. The success of <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_5002.html" title="A Better Tomorrow">A Better Tomorrow</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Chinese_Ghost_Story_7fd8.html" title="A Chinese Ghost Story">A Chinese Ghost Story</a> made his name known in Japanese and South Korea film market.</p>

<p>In 1995, Cheung signed a contract with <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Records_8845.html" title="Rock Records">Rock Records</a> and claimed his return to the music as a singer. At the same year, he released his first post-"retirement" album, <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Beloved.html" title="Beloved">Beloved</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Beloved.html" title="Beloved">Beloved</a></i> achieved large market success with the award of <i>IFPI Best Selling Album</i>. However, <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Beloved.html" title="Beloved">Beloved</a></i> did not receive much acclaim from music critics as it is a collection of Cheung's movie theme songs from 1993 to 1995. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Cheung released possibly his most highly acclaimed album, <i>Red</i>. <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">Red</a></i> merged the music such as smooth jazz, R&amp;B, trip hop, etc., into cantopop and formed a consistent unique style, which marked Cheung's return as the "point of no return". Cheung worked since then on the cutting edge music as well as cantopop and made a music style totally different from that before his 1989's retirement. In this album, Cheung also composed another important song in his music career, <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">Red</a></i>. In 1998, Cheung released his first and also the only original mandarin album <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Printemps.html" title="Printemps">Printemps</a></i>.</p>

<p>In 1997, Cheung held his first post-retirement concert series: <i>World Tour 97</i>, which lasted from Dec. 12, 1996 to June 17, 1997. Like his music, Cheung introduced a new image to his audience. The most daring part possibly was the closing dance "Red" where Cheung did a tango duet in a pair of red high-heels with a macho dancer . <i>World Tour 97</i> included 55 concerts: 24 concerts were held in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Coliseum_7387.html" title="Hong Kong Coliseum">Hong Kong Coliseum</a> and 31 concerts were held in the cities around the world.

He also composed the song <i>I</i> (first released in album <i>Big Heat</i>), which was considered by him as a song of self-statement. In 2000, Cheung was awarded the Golden Needle award (lifetime achievement award in Cantopop music). In the same year, Cheung had been assigned as the "Music Ambassador" of Composors And Authors Society of Hong Kong (CASH) until his demise.

Leslie Cheung in Passion Tour, 2001</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 2000, Cheung held his last concert series, <i>Passion Tour</i>. <i>Passion Tour</i> included 43 concerts, lasting from July 31, 2000 to April 16, 2001. It was his most disputable, and possibly best concert. Cheung worked at the first time as the art director as well as the singer for the concert. He invited <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Gaultier_07ff.html" title="Jean-Paul Gaultier">Jean-Paul Gaultier</a> to design all eight costumes for the concert. However, the costumes, together with his long wig and beard, were criticized bitterly by Hong Kong media at the early stage of the concerts. Cheung later disclosed that <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Gaultier_07ff.html" title="Jean-Paul Gaultier">Gaultier</a> was very angry about the criticism and claimed in an email (sent to Cheung) that he would never design costumes again for any asian performer. Dispite the early criticisms from the media, <i>Passion Tour</i> achieved huge success. <i>Passion Tour</i> was highly welcomed in Japan and made Cheung held 10 concerts there. Together with <i>World Tour 97</i> concerts, Cheung set a record of foreign artists of holding 16 concerts in Japan. In China, Cheung set a record yet to be broken by holding two consecutive night concerts in Shanghai Stadium (capacity of 80,000). He was also won the "Grand Salute Award" (2000) by Mingpao Weekly (Hong Kong) and "Music Salute Award" (2000) from Chinese Pop Music Media Association (mainland China) for his work in <i>Passion Tour</i>.</p>
<p>Since the end of 90s, Cheung started to focus on acting in non-romance roles. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kid_%281999_film%29_2d27.html" title="The Kid (1999 film)">The Kid</a></i>(1999, directed by Jacob Cheung Chi-Leung), he acted as a bankrupted single father who adopted an abandoned baby boy. In action thriller <i><a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Tap_90d2.html" title="Double Tap">Double Tap</a></i>(2000, directed by Lo Chi Leung), he acted as the psycho killer, Rick. In psycho thriller <i><a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Senses_efd3.html" title="Inner Senses">Inner Senses</a></i>(2002, directed by Lo Chi Leung), he acted as the psychologist Dr. Law, who found his own mental problem when he tried to treat a patient Yan (acted by <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kar_Yan_Lam_88a5.html" title="Kar Yan Lam">Kar Yan Lam</a>). His performance in these films got him one more <i>Best Actor</i> nomination from Hong Kong Film Awards and two more <i>Best Actor Award</i> nominations from Taiwan Film Festival. At the same time, Cheung was also involved more in the work as a director. In 2000, he produced his first movie as a director, the 45 minutes <i>From Ashes to Ashes</i>. In 2002, he started to prepare his first regular length movie <i>Stealing Heart</i>, which were not finished due to his health situation.</p>

<p>In an interview of the <i>Time</i> magazine in 2001 <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, Cheung said:"It's more appropriate to say I'm bisexual. I've had girlfriends. When I was 22 or so, I asked my girlfriend <a href="../../../t/e/r/Teresa_Mo_e9d2.html" title="Teresa Mo">Teresa Mo</a> (his colleague in ATV of the time) to marry me."</p>
<p>Despite numerous <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a> rumors, he denied his sexual orientation for the first half of his career. After his immigration to Canada (in Vancouver, British Columbia), his stance relaxed considerably. In the early 1990s he became one of the few Hong Kong actors who dared play gay characters onscreen.</p>
<p>Cheung's first gay role was <i>Cheng Dieyi</i> in <i><a href="../../../f/a/r/Farewell%2C_My_Concubine_dde9.html" title="Farewell, My Concubine">Farewell, My Concubine</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>). <i>Cheng Dieyi</i> was a Beijing opera singer or <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_%28Chinese_opera%29_9d0c.html" title="Dan (Chinese opera)">Dan</a></i> (male actor who plays female roles) who had fallen in love with his male singing partner.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> a Hong Kong tabloid published a photo of Cheung with another man, Daffy Tong Hok-Tak (唐鶴德). In a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> concert, Cheung openly revealed that Tong was his "most beloved" after his mother. The Hong Kong media eventually accepted the two men's relationship and gave Tong the nickname <i>Tong Tong</i> (in the style of <i>Gor Gor</i>). After Cheung's death, Tong published a full-page obituary in a Hong Kong newspaper, in which he was listed as a surviving spouse (未亡人), and was named the executor of Cheung's estate.</p>

<p>In 1986, Cheung joined Cinepoly Records Hong Kong and then published the album <i><a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Romance_db2c.html" title="Summer Romance">Summer Romance</a></i> in 1987, which won the Best Selling CD of the year and IFPI Best Selling Album(Hong Kong). The success of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Romance_db2c.html" title="Summer Romance">Summer Romance</a> made him one of the two top Cantopop idols in Hong Kong (the other one was <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Tam_176a.html" title="Alan Tam">Alan Tam</a>). In 1988, he composed one of his most famous songs, which is also the top ten hit song of 1988, <i>Silence is Golden</i>* (沉默是金) (Cantonese lyric by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Hui_4410.html" title="Samuel Hui">Samuel Hui</a>). In 1989, <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_%2789.html" title="Leslie '89">Leslie '89</a></i> ("Side face") also won him IFPI Best Album of the Year(Hong Kong). At the same year (1988), he set a record of holding 23 consecutive concerts in Hong Kong Coliseum(12,500 capacity). In 1990, he set another record by releasing the famous album <i>Salute</i>. <i>Salute</i> is the first non-profit album released by a superstar in Hong Kong music history that would only collect songs originally performed by other singers. According to Cheung, <i>Salute</i> is an album to "Salute" to the music. Cheung donated all the income from <i>Salute</i> to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Academy_for_Performing_Arts_7f70.html" title="Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts">Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts</a>(香港演藝學院), which was named as <i>Leslie Cheung Memorial Fund</i> after his death. Other popular albums released by Cheung during the period include <i><a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Snow_082a.html" title="Virgin Snow">Virgin Snow</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>), <i><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Summer_6b4f.html" title="Hot Summer">Hot Summer</a></i>(<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>), and <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Encounter_d215.html" title="Final Encounter">Final Encounter</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>). Other hit songs released by him during this period include 無心睡眠 (<i>No Mode to Sleep</i>, No.1 hit, in album <i><a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Romance_db2c.html" title="Summer Romance">Summer Romance</a></i>)， 無需要太多(<i>Don't Need Too Much</i>, in album <i><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Summer_6b4f.html" title="Hot Summer">Hot Summer</a></i>)，貼身(<i>Too Close</i>, in album <i><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Summer_6b4f.html" title="Hot Summer">Hot Summer</a></i>) and 由零開始(<i>Start From The Beginning</i>, in album <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_%2789.html" title="Leslie '89">Leslie '89</a></i> ("Side face")).</p>
<p>With the popularity of Cheung and Tam, the fans of the stars became hostile to each other and started a long-standing conflict. The situation became worse soon and brought huge pressure to both singers. In 1988, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Tam_176a.html" title="Alan Tam">Alan Tam</a> claimed to quit from all the pop music award ceremony. In 1989, Cheung claimed to retired from his music career as a singer. Cheung then set a record by being the first singer ever in Cantopop history to have a retirement concert series, which ran for 33 consecutive nights (as he was 33 at the time) at Hong Kong Coliseum. In 1990, he left Hong Kong at the peak of his music career and immigrated to British Columbia, Canada. Later in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, he gained Canadian citizenship and left Canada to resid in Hong Kong again.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 1989, Cheung acted in several classic Hong Kong movies. In 1986, Cheung acted as the role Kit, a righteous and idealistic young cop in milestone <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_5002.html" title="A Better Tomorrow">A Better Tomorrow</a></i> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Woo_8471.html" title="John Woo">John Woo</a>),which led the trend of gang movie. Cheung's performance was widely considered the mark of him as a serious actor. He cooperated with <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chow_Yun-Fat_937d.html" title="Chow Yun-Fat">Chow Yun-Fat</a> and John woo at the first time in this movie. Later, they also cooperated in movies <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_II_5675.html" title="A Better Tomorrow II">A Better Tomorrow II</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/c/Once_a_Thief_e5f3.html" title="Once a Thief">Once a Thief</a>. In 1987, Cheung acted in two other important movies in Hong Kong movie history. In Stanley Kwan's <i><a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouge_%28movie%29.html" title="Rouge (movie)">Rouge</a></i>, he acted Chan, an infatuated, <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a>-smoking playboy, and the doomed lover of a brothel worker Fleur<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Mui_4a43.html" title="Anita Mui">Anita Mui</a>. In <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Chinese_Ghost_Story_7fd8.html" title="A Chinese Ghost Story">A Chinese Ghost Story</a></i> (Ching Siu-Tung), which set the new trend of ghost movie of a hybrid of martial arts and high-tech, Cheung acted Ling Choi Sin, a nice but cowardly debt collector falling love with the beautiful ghost (<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Wong_9b81.html" title="Joey Wong">Joey Wong</a>). He also acted in <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Better_Tomorrow_II_5675.html" title="A Better Tomorrow II">A Better Tomorrow II</a></i> in 1987. These performances solidifed his appeal, making him the leading actor in the romance role.</p>
<p>(*)<i>Silence is Golden</i> was first performed as a duet by Cheung and Hui. It also has a Madrin and Taiwanese version and performed by many other singers.</p>

<p>In 1995, Cheung signed a contract with <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Records_8845.html" title="Rock Records">Rock Records</a> and claimed his return to the music as a singer. At the same year, he released his first post-"retirement" album, <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Beloved.html" title="Beloved">Beloved</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Beloved.html" title="Beloved">Beloved</a></i> achieved large market success with the award of IFPI Best Selling Album. However, <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Beloved.html" title="Beloved">Beloved</a></i> did not receive much acclaim from music critics as it is a collection of Cheung's movie theme songs from 1993 to 1995. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Cheung released possibly his most highly acclaimed album, <i>Red</i>. <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">Red</a></i> merged the music such as smooth jazz, R&amp;B, trip hop, etc., into cantopop and form a consistent unique style, which marked Cheung's return as the "point of no return". Cheung worked since then on the cutting edge music as well as cantopop and made a music style totally different from that before his 1989's retirement. In this album, Cheung also composed another important song in his music career, <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">Red</a></i>. In 1998, Cheung released his first and also the only original mandarin album <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Printemps.html" title="Printemps">Printemps</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1997, Cheung held his first post-retirement concert series: <i>World Tour 97</i>, which lasted from Dec. 12, 1996 to June 17 1997. Like his music, Cheung introduced a new image to his audience. The most daring part possibly was the closing dance "Red" where Cheung did a tango duet with a macho dancer in a pair of red high-heels. <i>World Tour 97</i> included 55 concerts: 24 concerts were held in Hong Kong Coliseum and 31 concerts were held in the cities around the world.

The hit songs released by him during this peorid include <i>Passing-by Dragonfly</i>, the top one hit song, <i>I</i>, <i>Big Heat</i>, and <i>Left Right Hands</i> , Top Ten Gold Song of the Year (1999). <i>I</i> was composed by Cheung and widerly considered as a song of his self-statement. In 1999, Cheung was awarded the Golden Needle award (lifetime achievement award in Cantopop music). In 2000, Cheung was assigned as the "Music Ambassador" of Composors And Authors Society of Hong Kong (CASH) until his dismise.

<p>In 2000, Cheung held his last world tour concerts, <i>Passion Tour</i>. <i>Passion Tour</i> included 46 concerts, lasting from July 31, 2000 to April 16, 2001 and was his most disputable, and possibly best concert. Cheung was at the first time worked as the art director as well as the singer for the concert. He invited <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Gaultier_07ff.html" title="Jean-Paul Gaultier">Jean-Paul Gaultier</a> to design all eight costumes for the concert. However, the costumes, together with his long wig and beard, were criticized bitterly by Hong Kong media at the early stage of the concerts. Cheung later disclosed that <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Gaultier_07ff.html" title="Jean-Paul Gaultier">Gaultier</a> was very angry about the criticism and claimed in an email (sent to Cheung) that he would neven design costumes again for any asian performers. Dispite the early criticisms from the media, <i>Passion Tour</i> achieved huge success. <i>Passion Tour</i> was highly welcomed in Japan and made Cheung held 10 <i>Passion Tour</i> concerts there. Together with <i>World Tour 97</i> concerts, Cheung set a record of foreign artists held 16 concerts in Japan. In China, Cheung set a record yet to be broken by holding two consecutive night concerts in Shanghai Stadium (capacity of 80,000). He was also won the "Grand Salute Award" (2000) by Mingpao Weekly (Hong Kong) and "Music Salute Award" (2000) from Chinese Pop Music Media Association (mainland China) for his work in <i>Passion Tour</i>.</p>
<p>Since the end of 90s, Cheung started to focus on acting in non-romance roles. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kid_c294.html" title="The Kid">The Kid</a></i>(1999, directed by Jacob Cheung Chi-Leung), he acted as a bankrupted single father who adopted an abandoned baby boy. In action thriller <i><a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Tap_90d2.html" title="Double Tap">Double Tap</a></i>(2000, directed by Lo Chi Leung), he acted as the psycho killer, Rick. In psycho thriller <i><a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Senses_efd3.html" title="Inner Senses">Inner Senses</a></i>(2002, directed by Lo Chi Leung), he acted as the psychologist Dr. Law, who found his own mental problem when he tried to treated a patient Yan (acted by Kar Yan Lam). His performance in these films won him one best actor nomination from Hong Kong Film Festival and two best actor nominations from Taiwan Film Festival. At the same time, Cheung also started to more involve in the work of a director. In 2000, he produce his first movie as a director, the 45 minutes <i>From Ashes to Ashes</i>. In 2002, he started to prepare his first regular length movie <i>Stealing Heart</i>, which were not finished due to his health situation.</p>

Since mid 90s', Hong Kong film industry started a decline and situation became worse at the end of 90s. "a tale of alienated middle class youth flirting with gang involvement that predates not only such serious "neo-realist" efforts as Lawrence Ah-mon's Gangs / Tong Dang (1986) and Wong Kar-wei's As Tears Go By /Wangjiao Kamen (1988), but the string of buzz-cut teen-gang sagas, beginning with Andrew Lau's flashy comic book adaptation Young and Dangerous / Guhuozai (1996) and its three sequels, which have been among the most popular HKof the past two years."--about Nomad, New Maps of Hong Kong by David Chute, Originally published in Film Comment, May-June, 1998.</p>

<p>Some of his later films didn't appeal to the general <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_culture.html" title="Chinese culture">Chinese entertainment</a> world as they are unconventional, as well as uncharacteristically daring, in terms of flamboyance.
