<p>After the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storming_of_the_Bastille_91db.html" title="Storming of the Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a> Jail on July 14, 1789, a mass uproar spread from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> to the countryside. Noble families were attacked by hunger-driven peasants and the aristocratic manors were burned to the ground. Abbeys and castles were also attacked and destroyed. The peers started to emigrate to the cities of France, and incidents of brigandage multiplied by the moment. The season was of <i>‘La Grande Peur’</i> (the Great Fear)—a period of social hysteria and anxiety over who was going to be the next victim of a faceless mob of cruel debauchers. What they failed to understand was that the violence that started the Great Fear—in most cases—was begun not by homeless people but by settled countrymen who took this opportunity to further their own cause.</p>
<p>The Great Fear opened up the vulnerable nature of the French Government—there was a lack of authority at the very center of it. The prolonged riots and massacres led to the general anxiety that things might get out of control, and it did. Seigneurial game was the main target of these rioters. It was an experience that the country had never undergone before.</p>
<p>By late July 1789, as the peasant revolt reports poured into Paris from every part of the country, the National Assembly of France decided to reform the social pattern of the country in order to pacify the outraged peasants and encourage them towards peace and harmony. The discussion continued through the night of the fourth of August, and on the morning of the fifth the National Assembly abolished the <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal_System_cc76.html" title="Feudal System">Feudal System</a>, and eliminated many clerical and noble privileges. The August decrees were finally completed a week later.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Article One</dt>
<dd>The National Assembly declared the feudal system abolished thereafter. Within the “existing rights and dues, both feudal and censuel (this refers to the cens, a perpetual due similar to the payments made by <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyhold.html" title="Copyhold">copyholders</a>), all those originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification.” <sup id="_ref-JHRobinson_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JHRobinson" title="">[1]</a></sup> All other dues were redeemable, but the terms and mode of redemption was to be fixed by the National Assembly.

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Article Thirteen</dt>
<dd>Various ecclesiastical dues were thereby abolished by the National Assembly.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The August Decrees were declared with the idea of calming down the populace and encouraging them towards civility. However, the August Decrees revised itself over and over again during the next two years. <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Louis_XVI_fe69.html" title="King Louis XVI">King Louis XVI</a>, in a letter, on the one hand expressed deep satisfaction with “…the noble and generous demarche of the first two orders of the state…” who, according to him had “…made great sacrifices for the general reconciliation, for their patrie and for their king.” On the other hand, he went on to say that though the “…sacrifices were fine, I cannot admire it; I will never consent to the despolitan of my clergy and my nobility… I will never give my sanction to the decrees that despoil them, for then the French people one day could accuse me of injustice or weakness.” <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> What Louis was concerned with was not with the loss of position of the French nobility and clergy, but with adequate reparation for this loss. But his phraseology showed his inability to accept the concept of all men being equal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the August Decrees paved the way for the National Assembly to make the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_bbc0.html" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man">Declaration of the Rights of Man</a>. It brought forward the first concrete steps towards <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equality%2C_Liberty_and_Fraternity_66ad.html" title="Equality, Liberty and Fraternity">Equality, Liberty and Fraternity</a>.</p>
