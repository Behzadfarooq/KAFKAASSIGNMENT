<p>The actual suicide note in Chinese should be posted and its English translation listed alongside. As with any translation, it's always better to have the original listed so that those who can read the language, can appreciate its original intent.</p>
<p>BTW, you're doing a great job with the article. The only thing lacking are citations to notable publications.

<p>Thanks for the note about Cheung's references. I realize that there are many sources but there are only a few that are notable. I'd use those instead of the more gossipy types. When you're ready, look at the Wikipedia help on how to attribute sources. With references sourced the Cheung page looks legit versus being a POV issue. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeedoflight_a493.html" title="User:Speedoflight">speedoflight</a> | <a href="../../../s/p/e/User_talk%7ESpeedoflight_9154.html" title="User talk:Speedoflight">talk to me</a> 18:59, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not "EVERY" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article.

<dd>If you cannot verify something yet or don't have the time to cite something, then don't put it up on Wikipedia yet. Articles on Wikipedia are syndicated to many sites and once content is syndicated, it is sometimes not updated. Hence, information that is erroneous, including poor grammar is populated across. I have removed information that you have not cited or verifed. You write in content that contain POV that is either yours or some other sources. By Wikipedia standards, these need to be remove. I realize you have emotional attachment to your content. As a writer/contributor, the first rule of thumb is to isolate your emotions away from your content and write in a neutral tone and CITE, CITE, CITE. If you cannot verify statistics, data and CITE them on the page, then it needs to be removed, period. Wikipedia or any source that is reputable is based on written communication. In other words, if you cannot write down your information source when you research, then it is either considered plagiarism or unverifiable. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeedoflight_a493.html" title="User:Speedoflight">speedoflight</a> | <a href="../../../s/p/e/User_talk%7ESpeedoflight_9154.html" title="User talk:Speedoflight">talk to me</a> 19:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not remove the tags concerning the article's health. The article is poorly written. Needs major copy edit, citations. All of these issues are documented on the article's discussion page. You insist on reverting back to editions that have poor edits. I am not sure what your motivations are. We are all writing for the benefit of Wikipedia. Any article on Wikipedia, no matter if the subject is something dear to you or not needs to conform to standards. Wikipedia is not a tabloid magazine. It's a resource site and has a reputation to uphold. I am not going to indulge you in some trivial edit war. You are obviously someone who cares about the subject and may even be a huge fan of Cheung's and being so, do what is best for the article, not for your ego. A write needs to learn to not fall in love with his/her words. The article does not belong to you or I. It belongs to the community called Wikipedia. So please think long and hard about where your interests are. Wikipedia is not your private Web site to write and put whatever you wish. There are standards that must be upheld so that Wikipedia can be used as a resource site for everyone. You could learn a lot from in writing from reputable sources and cleaning up your grammar on the page. If you do not know how to do so, let others do it. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeedoflight_a493.html" title="User:Speedoflight">speedoflight</a> | <a href="../../../s/p/e/User_talk%7ESpeedoflight_9154.html" title="User talk:Speedoflight">talk to me</a> 03:52, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/g/User_talk%7EAugest_1840.html" title="Edit section: cleanup tag">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">cleanup tag</span></h2>
<p>Please explain your cleanup tag on Orientalism. And no, it is not a prerequisite for writing on this topic that one should have read the book, since the topic is not about the Said book, but about the concept and the tradition. However, if you have any objections to the way the book is characterised in the subsection devoted to it, please indicate them. Otherwise the cleanup tag is rather difficult to make sense of and I will remove it. Paul B 09:30, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not write the section on the book, but I have certainly read the book. I added the section on criticisms of the book. The book-summary section seems to me to give a broadly accurate account of Said's arguments. Saying something is "woefully inadequate" without indicating how, is itself woefully inadequate. You still remain mysteriously quiet about just what it is that is wrong with the summary. The tenor of your comments suggest that you believe Said's book to be authoritative in some way, but seem unable or unwilling to suggest just how it has been misrepresented. I suggest you read some of the reviews written at the time, or more recent commentaries on Said's model of "orientalism" [1]. Paul B 09:23, 31 July 2005 (UTC) Well I haven't practiced my swinging, so I'll have to pass on the contest. But I still think you miss the central point. The article is not about the book. The book is a particular intervention in the tradition, one that is clearly important enough to single out, but not to be treated as "gospel" in any sense. Perhaps more on Said's arguments would be desirable. Perhaps more on Lewis's criticisms would be more pertinent. Perhaps we could have more on the art, or more on the details of western scholarly commentary on eastern cultures, or more on eastern views on the west. Perhaps and perhaps. I can only assume that the real reason for singling out the book called "Orientalism" is an assumption that this particular book is central to what the article should be about, partly because the names are the same. And that's essentially my problem with the cleanup notice. Paul B 21:40, 1 Aug 2005 (UTC) Please - I do not think you have earned the right to tell me what is "not a very good attitude to have on Wikipedia". I have as much right "unilaterally" to remove the tag as you did to add it. I was behaving no more unilaterally than you were. There was no sign whatever of a wider "community" who agreed with you. I removed the tag for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. A cleanup tag is inappropriate. It is mainly used for articles that are badly written or otherwise chaotic. I don't think even you thought that this was the case. 2. A cleanup tag refers the reader to the talk page for the reasons why a cleanup tag has been added. You added nothing to talk page to explain the tag. Is this "a very good attitude to have on Wikipedia"? 3. Unnecessary cleanup tags make Wikipedia look bad. They give the impression that the articles are poor and unprofessional. They should only be there when an article really does need to be cleaned up - in order to show that Wikipedians are aware of inadequacies. 4. When I asked you why you had added it I got no clear explanation. You could tell me nothing that was actually wrong with the article, and resorted to the, in my view bizarre, argument that you believed that if someone read Said's book "more closely" then they would come up with a different reading of it than the authors of the article. Now, either you have read it closely and can say what is wrong with the account or you have not. You cannot reasonably claim that some other mystery person will, if they read it, come up with an argument that agrees with your inexpressible intuitions.</p>
<p>I think a request for section-expansion would have been far more appropriate than a cleanup tag. However, what I am going to do is put in a Peer Review request, that is a request for Wikpedians to suggest improvements. Paul B 15:22 24 Aug 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Linkspro, your language is wholly inappropriate. It is clear that you are resorting to the last refuge of insult. I have explained my thinking on the subject as clearly as I can and I have taken appropriate action by requesting Peer review. Here's a link to the relevant page [2]. I note that the only content-related addition so far has been to emphasise criticism of Said's text. Perhaps other editors will respond differently. Paul B 23:55 24 Aug 2005 (UTC) Since your language is becoming increasingly childish, I see no advantage in further discussion with you. Your arguments were not remotely "exact", they were nowhere to be seen. You were uncompromising only in the sense that you you folded your arms and refured to budge. If you think that stubbornness is the same as integrity that I suspect you are mistaken. If I am "delusional" then I suppose User:TheoClarke and User:Pmanderson must be too. In your first reply to my query you wrote "I think most everyone who has read the book would agree with this judgement." I've provided you will links to reviews to indicate otherwise. The above users evidently think otherwise. You have provided no argument at all that is not vague and unspecific. Paul B 10:13 25 Aug 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, an image you recently uploaded, <a href="../../../p/h/a/Image%7EPhantom.jpg_8ddf.html" title="Image:Phantom.jpg">Image:Phantom.jpg</a> replaced another image that was used on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_%281986_musical%29_2cba.html" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)">The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)</a> page, which was causing problems. I have reverted your upload, and I'm afraid you'll have to reupload the 夜半歌聲 poster again using a different file name. Thank you! <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 00:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
