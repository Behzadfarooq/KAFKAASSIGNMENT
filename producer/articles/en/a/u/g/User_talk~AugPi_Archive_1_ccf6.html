<p>Hi AugPi. Thanks for your good work on mathematics.

<li>Why are you changing <i>A</i>′ to <i>A</i><sup>C</sup>, this makes the "complement" image wrong now.</li>
<li>Why are you changing "<i>A</i>&#160;∩&#160;<i>B</i>" to "<i>A</i> ∩<i>B</i>", this looks better to you?</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>OK, I changed <i>A</i>′ to <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> in the image as well.<br />
The reasons why I started changing to <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> are these:
<dl>
<dd>To make Wikipedia's notation for set complement uniform: <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> was used in the article for <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Morgan%27s_Laws_adb8.html" title="De Morgan's Laws">De Morgan's Laws</a>.</dd>
<dd><i>A</i>′ should be reserved for Boolean complement,</dd>
<dd><i>A</i><sup>C <sup>for set complement.</sup></sup></dd>
<dd><sup>The <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> notation has been adopted by PlanetMath (<a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/NotationInSetTheory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/NotationInSetTheory.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).</sup></dd>
<dd>The <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> notation is also used at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (e.g. <a href="http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/~DNC25/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/~DNC25/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> hosted by Churchill College).</dd>
<dd>The <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> notation is more unique: the meaning of <i>A</i>′ is already overloaded: e.g. <i>A</i>′ as derivative of <i>A</i>.</dd>
<dd><i>A</i><sup>C</sup> is more visible; it looks better on the page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, there appear to be five different ways of denoting the complement of set <i>A</i>: (1) <i>A</i>′, (2) <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/7/e/87e9d58b23b6017880dd0a6d36f2bcea.png" alt="\overline{A}" />, (3) <i>A</i><sup>C</sup>, (4) ~<i>A</i>, (5) comp(<i>A</i>). <i>A</i>′ is probably the most frequent one, so if you want to change from <i>A</i><sup>C</sup> back to <i>A</i>′, I would not oppose it.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
&gt;&gt;Why are you changing "<i>A</i>&#160;∩&#160;<i>B</i>" to "<i>A</i> ∩<i>B</i>", this looks better to you? &lt;&lt;</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This way the ∩ appears centered between the <i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> (at least on my browser). Which brings me to my question: the character for ∅ shows up as an empty square on my browser, not as an empty set character Ø. Does ∅ appear correctly on your browser and what did you do (if anything) to make it appear correctly? --<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 22:57, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For all the browsers I use (Safari, IE, Omniweb, Forefox) the former looks centered, the latter does not. Also the using former which uses "non-breaking spaces" means that "<i>A</i>&#160;∩&#160;<i>B</i>" will always appear on the same line, that is it won't break across two lines. Also both empty set symbols show up correctly for me in all browsers, you might try changing your Wikipedia "math rendering preference" <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> 23:33, Nov 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AugPi, I'm trying to specify what this piece is a little more precisely but can't find it. Can you provide a hint? (like what it's written for, its Hoboken number, whatever...)

<dd>The piece is short: one page long, written for the piano. It's all in the key of B-flat major (G minor?). That is all I know: but I sequenced it in MIDI and uploaded the MIDI file, so now it is in the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-dotted_note.html" title="Double-dotted note">double-dotted note</a>'s Listening section.</dd>
<dd>The title "Meditation" is all I know about the piece. It appears on page 23 of the book "JOSEF HAYDN / his greatest / PIANO SOLOS / A Comprehensive Collection Of His World Famous Works", compiled by Alexander Shealy. Copa Publishing Co., Sole Distributor: Ashley Dealers Service Inc., 263 Veterans Blvd., Carlstadt, N.J. 07072. The book has no ISBN, measures 11_7/8" x 9_1/16" x 1/2", and has 191 pages. The front cover is filled with a (painted) portrait of the composer up to thin blue margins. The book is soft cover and was obtained recently in an H&amp;H Music store. Strangely enough, both "Meditation" and another short piece on the page's reverse side did not show up in the Contents page: the printer's must not have been too careful (that, and the missing ISBN...).</dd>
<dd>Another Haydn piece with double-dotted notes is "Sonata in E Flat", which is much longer: the double-dotting appears in the 9th, 10th and 11th pages of the Sonata, but not through most of the rest. --<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 22:34, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AugPi, Thanks very much for your reply. On hearing your sound file I was able to track down "Meditation": it is a piano transcription of part of the second movement of Haydn's String Quartet Opus 72 No. 2. I've seen this transcription myself--it appears in the G. Schirmer "Sonatina Album" used for so many kids' piano lessons. Looks like some unknown musician long ago adapted Haydn's work, and being out of copyright it gets reprinted freely. The title "Meditation", which seems not inappropriate to me, must be from Alexander Shealy.</p>
<p>In a fit of enthusiasm, I made an image file of the quartet passage and added it to the article, noting that the sound file matches it. (This is not <i>quite</i> true, since the adapter left out a couple measures that work only as ensemble music.)</p>

<dd>The footnote<br />
<dl>
<dd>&gt;&gt;*¹ <small>When we say a line through pair of points <i>P</i>, or simply a line through <i>P</i>, we refer to the three dimensional euclidian line that passes through the antipodal points represented by <i>P</i>. When we say that a geodesic line, or a great circle, <i>L</i> is perpendicular to the line passing through the pair of points <i>P</i>, we mean that <i>L</i> lies on the plane that is perpendicular to, and intersects at the midpoint of, the straight line segment in euclidian space that connects the antipodal points that is represented by <i>P</i>. In other words, <i>L</i> is the set of points equidistant in euclidian space to the antipodal points represented by <i>P</i>. <i>L</i> is unique for <i>P</i>.</small> &lt;&lt;<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>is exactly right: it is precisely what was meant! Apparently there was no conscious awareness of just how the meanings of "line" and "circle" were being overloaded. --<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 00:55, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw your edit in G.R. - it is nice to honor Levi-Civita. Yet I feel that before and after the edit, it is kind of misleading to say the connections are zero in the Minkowski metric, because the connections do not measure the curvature of the spacetime - that's why the Riemann tensor is so important. For example, if you use spherical coordinates in the 3-space of Minkowski space (quite handy for radiation problems) you still have a flat space (ignoring the perturbations matter and radiation) but many Christoffel symbols are nonzero. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 00:32, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>So becuase of the above you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, the connection will be non-zero even in a purely Euclidean space if the coordinates are non-Cartesian, e.g. in polar coordinates. In general relativity, the equation for a geodesic will also be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/0/a/90ad5ce485a49c8fcff9ba94081e675b.png" alt="\ddot{x}^a = 0" /> for the special case of a <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inertial_reference_frame.html" title="Inertial reference frame">freely falling reference frame</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Neither statement is correct. The first one is false even in classical mechanics. The second statement is only true locally and under a Cartesian coordinate system.</p>
<p>For the first statement: Just draw a chord through a flat spacetime mapped using polar coordinates: As you travel along the chord, your direction of travel with respect to the coordinate system will constantly change even though a chord describes an inertially moving object. The connections describe how that change in coordinate velocity occurs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I said the connection would be <i>non</i>-zero... so I said the same thing as your above paragraph.
<dl>
<dd>OK. I missed the "non-". Sorry about that. However, your point got bound up in the second statement, which really caught my eye. So I seem to have projected the mistake in the second sentence onto the first one. Feel free to restore it then. Unless there is some reason such that it turns out to be counter-productive (which I do not expect), I will leave it alone. (Please be aware I had someone else changing "stress-energy" to "mass and energy" all over the place, which is no good because it leaves out momentum. So I had to revert beyond your edits and then decide what to bring back in. So please accept my apologies.) --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:35, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the second statement: Look at the case of two spaceships in orbit around the Earth. Under the rules of GR, each is traveling inertially. Now suppose that they are initially at rest with respect to each other. Depending on how they are separated, these ships will immediately start to move with respect to each other, either getting closer to or father from each other as a result. Only if they are ahead of or behing each other in the same orbit will they stay at rest with respect to each other. In the frame of reference of an inertially moving observer in GR, this is due to <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal_force.html" title="Tidal force">tidal forces</a> (or rather tidal accelerations). Once again, the connections must be non-zero (except locally, where the tidal accelerations do not exist).</p>
<dl>
<dd>The second statement was locally accurate but imprecise. In freely falling coordinates χ<sup>α</sup> the geodesic becomes</dd>

<dd>but only strictly true if the geodesic is the proper time coordinate line of the freely falling frame. Neighboring geodesics which start out parallel will suffer <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodesic_deviation.html" title="Geodesic deviation">geodesic deviation</a> due to tidal forces, as you mentioned in the above paragraph. ...

<p>What dialect of English does your Kinesthetic vowel wheel illustrate? (General American perhaps?) Also, how is it made? Is there any documentation on it? —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <span class="usertalk">(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary"><span title="Ae hI: ja" class="IPA">ɑe hɪː jɐ</span></a>)</span> 00:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I do believe that the vowel wheel reflects <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American</a>. Lately I have been studying American English pronunciation using a Longman Advanced American Dictionary: its words entries include IPA broad transcriptions: these transcriptions most probably reflect General American.</dd>
<dd>This was my original kinesthetic vowel wheel (phoneme = azimuth): <b>ɑ=45°</b>, <b>ʌ=30°</b>, a=0°, æ=330°, ɛ=300°, e=270°, ɪ=240°, <b>i=225°</b>, u=180°, ʊ=150°, <b>ɔ=120°</b>, o=90°. Bold indicates phonemes whose position deviate from their positions in the second, final, version of the wheel. The following are the extent of their deviations: Δ(ɑ)=+15°, Δ(ʌ)=+7.5°, Δ(i)=+15°, Δ(ɔ)=+60°. The first three of these phonemes changes their position by small amounts, no more than 15 degrees, but did not change their relative positions. The last phoneme, open o, changed by 60° which is significant and also swapped its relative position with "Spanish" o. (By the way, I do speak Spanish and so do know how to pronounce the "Spanish" vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/. These five monophthongs are the same as those in Japanese, except that Spanish /u/ is replaced by lax /ʊ/ in Japanese (is this right?): /a/, /i/, /ʊ/, /e/, /o/. Anyway, my objective was/is to try to pronounce the remaining characteristically English monophthongs correctly.) The reason for the swap is that I was pronouncing the open o wrong: learned this by comparing the kinesthetic vowel wheel with the IPA vowel chart.</dd>
<dd>To understand the positions of the vowels on the wheel intuitively, imagine a picture of a profile cross-section of a talking head which is facing towards the <i>right</i> (usually in phonetics these heads face towards the <i>left</i> of the page (why?)). Now, when pronouncing a vowel, try to imagine the position of the upper jaw with respect to the lower jaw, as might appear on the mouth diagram. (Notice I said <i>imagine</i>, not to actually observe the position of the jaws externally through, say, X-rays.) Try to reduce this jaw position down to a unit vector quantity indicating the direction of the upper jaw. This is a kinesthetic exercise: to try to imagine the position of the jaw while not really actually looking at it but just feeling it. The exception is the schwa, located at the hub of the wheel: this corresponds to the IPA vowel chart in which the schwa, mid central vowel, is located at the center of the chart.</dd>
<dd>After I came up with the first, incorrect, version of the wheel, I came up with this hypothesis: that the (relative ordering of the) wheel can be obtained from the IPA vowel chart by projecting the English vowels radially outward and away from the central schwa onto a circle drawn around the periphery of the IPA vowel chart (and then rotating the vowel wheel as appropriate (actually, reflecting the wheel about its horizontal diameter)). It turned out that one half of the wheel was reconstructed correctly this way. Later, after coming up with the corrected version, realized that the entire (relative positions of the) wheel could be obtained correctly by projecting the IPA vowel chart radially outward from a point on the central line just above the mid-close line but below the near-close invisible line occupied by lax /ɪ/ and lax /ʊ/. Also remembering that the ʌ is actually a ɐ in General American (is it?).</dd>
<dd>The "absolute" positions of the vowels were then fine-tuned, tweaked, in order to correspond to kinesthetic intuition, and eventually realized that most of the vowels would fit into angles which are multiples of 30°, just like a clock, except for the caret, /ʌ/, which intuition said was very close to the /a/. Notice that four out of five Spanish vowels are located at multiples of 90°: /a/, /e/, /u/, /o/.</dd>
<dd>Now for the "harmonic" properties of the vowel wheel. The top half of the wheel is occupied by open vowels, the bottom half by close vowels. A 15°-195° axis divides the wheel into two regions: a western side occupied by front vowels, and an eastern region occupied by back vowels. Think of the 15°-195° diameter as an axis of rotation (metaphor). It is tilted 15° with respect to celestial North-South axis (0°-180°) so that the "Tropic of Cancer" is the chord 75°-285° and the "Tropic of Capricorn" is the chord 105°-255°. The Tropic of Cancer, and not the "Equator" (90°-270°), is the dividing line between open vowels and close vowels. Think of the 0°-30° chord as the Arctic Circle (part of extended metaphor), and the 180°-210° chord as the Antarctic Circle. The IPA vowel chart has four horizontal lines: close, close-mid, open-mid, open (from top to bottom respectively). These lines correspond to "geographic" lines on the kinesthetic vowel wheel, like so:</dd>
<dd>Arctic Circle&#160;: Open</dd>
<dd>60°-300° chord&#160;: Open-mid</dd>
<dd>Equator&#160;: Close-mid</dd>
<dd>Antarctic Circle&#160;: Close.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the IPA vowel chart, the following pairs of opposite vowels can be found:</dd>
<dd>(a,u), (ɑ,i), (ɛ,o), (e,ɔ).</dd>
<dd>Each of such pairs of vowels is opposite in the sense of being radially symmetric with respect to the schwa. In the kinesthetic vowel wheel, the pairs (a,u) and (ɑ,i) are opposite w.r.t. the center of the wheel, and the pairs (ɛ,o), (e,ɔ) are opposite w.r.t. a point above the center of the wheel, near the intersection of the Tropic of Cancer and the Celestial North-South Axis. The schwa would have to be located at this intersection above the center in order for it to be mid central vowel exactly. However, in English, there is no close-mid central unrounded vowel ("backwards e"&#160;: ɘ) which would be located at the exact center: in the kinesthetic wheel, this narrow region from (ɛ,o)∩(e,ɔ) to (a,u)∩(ɑ,i) can be interpreted as being occupied by the schwa, so complementary pairs in the kinesthetic wheel and in the IPA chart correspond. This might be seen as "cheating" since the complement of /ɛ/ should be /ʊ/. In the IPA chart, /ɛ/ and /ʊ/ are indeed ɘ-complements. In the IPA chart, /ɔ/ and /ɪ/ are ɘ-complements, and in the kinesthetic wheel they are center-complements. The point is that there is a common harmony between the IPA vowel chart and the kinesthetic wheel: this validates the wheel's internal harmonic properties.</dd>
<dd>Note (once again): the "melodic" (chromatic?) properties of the wheel (i.e. relative ordering of the vowels) can be obtained by projecting the English vowels on the IPA chart radially outward from an eccentric point slightly above /ɘ/, between close-mid central and near-close central, onto a circle. This accounts for the relative ordering around the circle but not the exact positions. The exact positions were obtained by: (1) kinesthetic intuition, (2) spreading the vectors around the circle, apart from each other (like a Kohonen net), (3) snapping the vectors onto the twelve-hour grid of a clock. —<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 18:34, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Gosh! That was a lot more detail than I expected! So you made this whole thing up (including the very concept)? Impressive! One thing I don't quite understand is the absolute position of /u/ relative to /i/ and /ʊ/ (particularly when you describe the Spanish /i/ and /u/ as occupying the same positions as the American ones). Many speakers of languages that don't have a tense-lax opposition have difficulty distinguishing the pairs of [i ɪ] and [u ʊ], so I would've they'd be much closer together. Given that of the Spanish vowels, in the IPA vowel chart they're probably the two furthest apart, why are they the two closest together in this Kinesthetic vowel chart? (I did one for my own Australian English I think following your principles, which doesn't have the [i ɪ] and [u ʊ] pairs, instead using onset (diphthongal quality) &amp; length to distinguish /iː ɪ/ and has [ʉː] instead of [u]. It comes out with the same space between [ʉ ʊ] but here I'd expect it...)</p>
<p>About phonetics of languages: Japanese /u/ has a special form of rounding, which is its most well-known feature. Apparently it's a bit centralised, so you can describe it as [ɯ̹̈], but it's not really a specially-rounded [ʊ]. American English /ʌ/ is indeed centralised, and you could describe it as [ɐ] (which is commonly also used to describe the Australian English equivalent vowel, though they're quite different: Australian /a/ (as it's also described) is almost identical to the Spanish/Italian equivalent vowel.</p>

<p>Hi AugPi, I see you've added a " "derivation" of box^2 phi ".

But Wikipedia should be descriptive (as in inclusionist), not authoritative, and it is a fact that some authors do use Δ for Laplacian (throughout their entire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486638332/103-8438779-2911831?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486638332/103-8438779-2911831?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">books</a>), so am leaving that notation there as it was rather than quibble over notation. It was a surprise, though, to find out that there are three alternative notations for d'Alembertian, not just two. By the way, should mention that Einstein notation is being used. —<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 15:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, the notation <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/1/c/11cfcbfe6f430e28cfe3bd87a855084c.png" alt="(\Box^2 - m^2) \psi" /> for some reason immediately appears as if the box were an empty blank, which when filled in yields <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/d/1/cd15aedc0d878a197c5bc8d1231b98e8.png" alt="(\partial^2 - m^2) \psi" />, so now can say that now that have been exposed to it, the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/f/3/ef334ff583426b0a6278891891764a35.png" alt="\partial^2" /> notation for d'Alembertian seems more natural, especially when <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/a/f/9af57557126dcdd6e1c84d267292c122.png" alt="\partial^2 = \partial^\mu \partial_\mu" />: then its naturalness is obvious. —<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 15:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I noticed that you changed the symbols from <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/0/a/90a2a4996825e201331455d3d1f89f77.png" alt="\Gamma^m_{i\ell}" /> to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/2/8/428eaf75212699db81515f5fae9491de.png" alt="\Gamma^m {}_{i\ell}" /> in the above article. Recently another user changed it back and I've been asking why <i>either</i> edit happened. I'm very curious - can you explain your end? <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthografer_608c.html" title="User:Orthografer">Orthografer</a> 15:34, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even though the Christoffel symbol is not really a tensor, notationwise it behaves very much like one. For tensors, there is a notation in which each index is assigned its own "column", in which it is either a superscript or a subscript. In this notation (that I'm using), <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/2/8/428eaf75212699db81515f5fae9491de.png" alt="\Gamma^m {}_{i\ell}" /> is explicitly different from <span class="texhtml">Γ<sub><i>i</i></sub><sup><i>m</i></sup><sub><i>l</i></sub></span> or <span class="texhtml">Γ<sub><i>i</i><i>l</i></sub><sup><i>m</i></sup></span>, and if the <i>m</i> index is lowered, then the symbol becomes simply <span class="texhtml">Γ<sub><i>m</i><i>i</i><i>l</i></sub></span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the alternative notation, there are no "columns": the superscript is "independent" of the subscripts, and the indices might be arranged in a "Delta" (Δ) configuration, with the two subscripts forming the base and the superscript forming the top of the triangle (otherwise the superscript is flushed to the left, just like the subscripts). If the superscript (<i>m</i>) is lowered, the result is a Christoffel symbol of the first kind: <span class="texhtml">Γ<sub><i>i</i><i>l</i>,<i>m</i></sub></span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is even a third notation, in which the Christoffel symbol of the second kind is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/4/c/c4ce7043e0da8aede77ffaa92a301e7d.png" alt="\left\{ {}_i {}^m {}_l \right\}" />, with the indices in a Delta configuration, and the Christoffel symbol of the first kind is <span class="texhtml">[<i>m</i>,<i>i</i><i>l</i>]</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which notation is used depends on the author. For example, Bernard F. Schutz (from Cambridge Uni) in his book <i>A first course in general relativity</i> uses the first notation (the one which I was using); Donald H. Menzel (from Harvard Uni) in his book <i>Mathematical Physics</i> uses the alternative notation; whereas Borisenko and Tarapov (from Russia) in their book <i>Vector and Tensor Analysis with Applications</i> use the third notation. Schutz always uses Christoffel symbols of the second kind, never of the first kind, and commas in the subscript row are reserved for differentiation (instead of for Christoffel symbols of the first kind) (see <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covariant_differentiation.html#Notation" title="Covariant differentiation">Covariant differentiation#Notation</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I made the edits I happened to prefer the Cantabrigian notation, and now I notice that Wikipedia has kept it. The bracketed notation used by those two Russians I don't like: I definitely prefer the use of Gamma, whether it have its indices separated in columns or "independent" (whichever of these two alternatives is used, should not be a big deal, really). However, the Russian book is antiquated (copyrighted 1968) and checking the "Christoffel symbol" article in other languages (French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Russian, Chinese) one sees that they all use Gamma, though some use indices separated by columns (German, French, Russian) whereas some do not (Spanish, Dutch, Chinese). The Dutch version mentions the difference between Christoffel symbols of the first kind and of the second kind. The Spanish version ignores Christoffel symbols of the first kind, which so does the English, by the way (but so do the German, French, and Russian: just like Schutz). The Dutch version does not use a Gamma for the Christoffel symbol of the first kind: instead it uses brackets: <span class="texhtml">[<i>m</i>,<i>i</i><i>l</i>]</span>. <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/" class="external text" title="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/" rel="nofollow">Go figure...</a> --<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugPi_061d.html" title="User:AugPi">AugPi</a> 22:49, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
