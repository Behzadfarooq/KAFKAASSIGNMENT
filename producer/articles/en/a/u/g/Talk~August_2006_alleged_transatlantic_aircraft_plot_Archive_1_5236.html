<p>Isn't "transatlantic" an unnecessary bit of info?

<p>This name is absolutely awful. '2006 UK Aircraft Terror Plot' would be much more appropriate. 'Transatlantic' is simply inaccurate, it is too early to say which flights were targetted for sure. flight cancellations from european airlines show that it may not be just US airlines that were targetted. 84.71.0.89 13:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stop fighting over the name. Transatlantic is accurate because they were planning to blow up the planes on the way to the United States. They possibly might have been planning to blow up the planes over america. So the name is accurate. Don't say 2006 Transatlantic Flight Explosion Plot either. That makes it sound like the incident did happen when it didn't. Keep it at the current title.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">article title should include "liquid explosives"</span></h3>
<p>Currently, the title is <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_transatlantic_aircraft_plot.html" title="2006 transatlantic aircraft plot">2006 transatlantic aircraft plot</a>. I think we should include some reference to the liquid explosives. See <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=in&amp;q=liquid" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=in&amp;q=liquid" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for all the news stories with this byline.

<dd>I think we should hold off on the pagemove; much of this liquid stuff seems speculative at best. Perhaps when it is officially announced, we can move it.

<dd>It's not like there are (likely to be) many 2006 transatlantic aircraft plots. Specifying in the title that liquid explosives were involved feels overly specific. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 21:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hold on, I forgot since none of it has been verified, it should be "2006 '8/10' tansatlantic alleged liquid bomb aircraft plot disaster averted possibility (Alleged)" (since typos have suddenly become <i>de rigeur</i> in moving these pages......) - sorry all, tired now!

<dd>May I suggest we not look to CNN for any official titles for this situation. I love CNN, but earlier today, I saw "EXPLOSIVE COCKTAIL" in large capital letters at the top of their home page.

<p>I have a list of suggestions for the title (which, presumably, is going to be changed). Personally, I think the words (and numbers) <b>2006</b>, <b>airline</b> and <b>plot</b> should all be in the title. However, some other suggestions not including some of these are given too.</p>
<p>These suggestions are based on the assumption that the plot was to blow up airliners over the Atlantic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>2006 transatlantic airline(s) bomb plot</b>. 'Airline' suggests an important feature of the plot - the attack was on American airliners, AFAIK. This also solves the problem of the word 'aircraft' implying objects other then planes, as one user suggested.</li>
<li><b>2006 transatlantic liquid explosive plot</b>. Another mouthful, but it is to the point (if the use of such devices in the plot are confirmed).</li>
<li><b>Transatlantic airline bomb plot</b>. The 2006 may not be necessary.</li>
<li><b>Transatlantic liquid explosive plot</b>. Ditto.</li>
<li><b>2006 liquid explosive airline plot</b>. Based on MPS' suggestion; the word 'bomb' is probably unnecessary (as explosive carries the bomb connotation) and 'aircraft' is replaced with 'airline' (reason in first suggestion).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>I'll go along with that for an initial suggestion, but would like to see the word 'airline(s)' in there somewhere (assuming, of course, that certain airlines were targeted). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathPhys_dfe4.html" title="User:MathPhys">MP</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathPhys_2c2e.html" title="User talk:MathPhys">(talk)</a> 22:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">"Plot"?</span></h3>
<p>The word "plot" carries negative connotations. While I am the first to comdemn any attack on our freedoms, it is still not NPOV to put such a label on an article which many people may see as their first Wikipedia article whilst searching for information. I confess that I don't really know what to replace it with, perhaps "2006 attempted translatlantic aircraft attack"? —<a href="../../../d/b/m/User%7EDbmag9_1efb.html" title="User:Dbmag9"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">D</span></a><a href="../../../d/b/m/User%7EDbmag9_Esperanza_bb6e.html" title="User:Dbmag9/Esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../d/b/m/User%7EDbmag9_1efb.html" title="User:Dbmag9"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">niel</span></a> <a href="../../../d/b/m/User_talk%7EDbmag9_aa02.html" title="User talk:Dbmag9">(‽)</a> 23:26, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't think <i>attack</i> carries negative connotations? Regardless, I believe <i>plot</i> was used instead of <i>attack</i> since it looks like this won't be happening. Perhaps <i>plan</i> would be more neutral, but perhaps also more awkward. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> <small>(joturner)</small> 23:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, "scheme" seems a little ridiculous (sort of like a detective story or something). I don't really see how we can or should use anything other than "plot".

<p>It might be worth trimming down the editorializing style, in favor of a long term encyclopedic style. Some information should probably be footnoted, left in original sources, or summarised. I'm thinking of things like ages and locations of suspects, and some of the wording styles especially. Its more detail than an encyclopedia article should probably contain, and more detail than other comparable articles seem to have. Overall a good article and well sourced though. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 10:27, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, for one thing, Great Britain is no longer the "host nation" of this event. Granted, the initial discovery of the plot occurred in Britain, however the ramifications of the plan are more far-reaching than just being limited to flights originating there. DHS on this side of the pond has had to elevate security levels to their highest as of late, and governors in a few states have sent National Guard elements into the airports to aid in security measures. So I would venture to state that this has become a bi-lateral issue, albeit one that could reach even farther in time.

<p>How about "softdrink cans"? <i>Softdrink</i> seems a recognizable term in international English and takes care of the fact that not every non-alcoholic beverage in such a can is carbonated. (<i>Softdrink</i> may also be 'less regional' in the U.S. than <i>soda</i>, <i>pop</i>, <i>sodapop</i>, and <i>Coke</i>.) The other terms, including "fizzy drink", all seem very regional, or ambiguous ("soda" can mean more than just carbonated drinks; "pop" could mean all kinds of things), or inaccurate (many would take "Coke" for non–Coca-Cola drinks as just plain off). (Triviality: most such cans in the U.S. have 355, rather than 330, mL.) — <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 19:49, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Britain certainly is the host nation of this event - just because America has raised its security level, Edit Centric informs us, to its highest, in no way makes any difference. Britain, in the days surrounding the announcement of the plot, was also on its highest threat level. And you can't say they were flights with US planes. No information about which flights where to be targetted have been released (to my knowledge): only that they were transatlantic. You can't say that because an event has international consequences therefore it should be written in American English. Besides, 9/11 had international consequences, but it doesn't mean I think it should be written in British English, Britain quite clearly was not the host nation. Fact of the matter is, it was a plot to compromise the security of British airports within Britain, it was tracked and disrupted by the British Metropolitan Police and British Intelligence, and those arrested in connection with will be tried in British courts, in all likelihood. --Mister Macbeth 12:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just so we are clear - in britain - a Purse is a female version of a wallet (or billfold) in which a woman would keep her money and creditcards - she would keep this purse in a handbag.</p>

<dd>Most women I know (I'm in the US) would call that a wallet, same as men. Any smallish thing for putting money or credit cards in can be a wallet; something still smaller, for coins only, would be a change purse. What Brits call a handbag is a purse or pocketbook (although "handbag" is also understood) in the US. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Titles for Prime Minister Blair and President Bush</span></h3>
<p>First of all, I want to congratulate everyone, this is an incredible response from the wikipedia community. I've tried to make sure Prime Minister Blair and President Bush are referred to by title throughout the article, as that's standard practice in both nations, same as referring to members of the armed forces by rank, or referring to individuals with Ph.Ds as Doctor. I'm not sure what the Wikipedia policy is here, so I hope someone will cleanup behind me a bit, but in the meantime I thought this ought to be fixed. -<a href="../../../m/b/l/User%7EMBlume_70ae.html" title="User:MBlume">MBlume</a> 05:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's standard practice in some American and British news organizations to use "Mr." more often than "Prime Minister" and "President" in front of these men's names. (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, for example, always puts a title before someone's surname, and usually starts with "President Bush" at the first mention in the article and then continues with "Mr. Bush" in the rest.) But it seems to be Wikipedia practice (as well as the practice of most English-language general encyclopedias) to mention their offices early in the article and then use just their surnames, without titles, in most of the rest of the article. — <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 06:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not, by any stretch of the imagination, a fan of President Bush, and I don't honestly know that much about Prime Minister Blair, but I do feel that respect for the office is important, and should be encouraged. I guess the trouble here is that this article has very much been written in bits and pieces (very fast bits and pieces!) and so every mention is almost a first mention. Think I ought to change the rest of the article to Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair? -<a href="../../../m/b/l/User%7EMBlume_70ae.html" title="User:MBlume">MBlume</a> 06:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, Tony Blair is never referred to as "Prime Minister Blair" in UK press - I've only ever heard him referred to like that in the USA press. (The same is true for UK usage about other politicians - we tend to say "Jacques Chirac", rather than "President Chirac" etc, possibly with the first use mentioning his title.) I would suggest saying "UK Prime Minister <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>" at the first mention, and "<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>" at any later mentions (ie use "UK Prime Minister" as an adjective, rather than a title). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 14:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, there are far too many usages to spell them out in full each time. I agree that it is best to be consistant, since there are many paragraphs with "UK" and "U.S" in close proximity. As consensus is to use British styling for this article, I would suggest "UK" and "US". In fact, I have twice gone through the article making this correction, but each time some well-meaning person has changed it back.

<dd>also "Articles that focus on a topic specific to a particular English-speaking country should generally conform to the usage and spelling of that country" and "If an article is predominantly written in one type of English, aim to conform to that type rather than provoking conflict by changing to another."</dd>
<dd>I think that it's fair to say the Manual of Style is amiguous on this point, so we should go for whatever looks best for <i>this page</i>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 15:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a minor point of clarification: while it's popular in the U.K. to omit periods from <b>both</b> (<i>US</i> <b>and</b> <i>UK</i>), practice in many American style guides is to use <i>U.S.</i> <b>and</b> <i>UK</i>—the logic being that <i>US</i> could look like an all-capital form of the pronoun <i>us</i> (e.g., "GIVE <b>US</b> SOME WATER"), which is quite a common word, while <i>UK</i> is unlikely to be mistaken as anything other than a variant of <i>U.K.</i> So, consistency can be a matter not just of using periods everywhere or using periods nowhere, but also of using periods only when there's ambiguity. (My own personal style is periods for both.) Anyway, I'm not taking a stance on usage in this article, but am just pointing out something that hasn't been mentioned here. — <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 19:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A number of sentences say "according to ABC news", "BBC reported", "deputy commissioner John Doe has said", etc. Should some of those be removed, at least from widely reported statements? The language would be crisper and easier to read.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Citation for mixing components of explosive on flight?</span></h3>
<p>The article currently states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>To avoid discovery by explosive detection baggage screening devices, the plotters planned to bring several liquid components on to the planes concealed in soft-drink containers, then combine the components in-flight to make the explosive.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see any reference to this being the plan in any of the articles linked from the section on the explosives. The idea that this was the plan seems popular in various blogs, but I haven't seen it reported anywhere reputable. As I've seen pointed out, doing so would be rather tricky, as manufacturing either of the two suggested explosives is a rather long and involved process. Do we have a reference for it, or should we remove it? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 13:45, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Hand luggage policy</span></h3>
<p>Maybe this should be in a more general article, but what happens if a passanger is forced to check in e.g. a laptop as hold luggage and it gets stolen or damaged? Who is going to pay for it? --<a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmo_3228.html" title="User:Jcmo">Jcmo</a> 15:47, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's not that trivial. The point is that people making decisions on security measures are not held accountable for the consequences of those decisions, which encourages exaggerated policies, to the point of ridicule. The plot in question was stopped by good investigative police work, NOT by forbidding people to take magazines and newspapers on board aircraft. --<a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmo_3228.html" title="User:Jcmo">Jcmo</a> 16:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I do think policy makers sometimes get too excessive or silly when it comes to security measures, I wonder if you're missing the point. Although there has been suggestions these measures may have be permanent, at the moment they are only temporary. Given that this plot was uncovered and widely published, we can assume that in the event anyone even remotely associated with it or the people involved, who was planning to carry out an attack (whether part of this plan or not) would either go underground or try to execute it immedietly. Given that the details have been published, they would probably try to modify their plans a bit to prevent detection. As such, it may make sense to temporarily impose harsh measures to ensure that this does not happen. Also, there are already well established procedures for lost baggage. Did you really think baggage other then laptops doesn't normally get stolen? The Montreal convention provides 1000 SDRs which is admitedly not very much. You would need travel insurance for greater coverage. 01:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is possible to hide bomb parts in hand luggage now, it will be always possible. By that line of reasoning, these restrictions should be made permanent (there is already talk of that). Some of these items can also be concealed under clothes and not be detected by a patdown search. Maybe next people will be forced to board airplanes naked. And since there are other methods of hiding things, a body cavity search for every passenger is next. When will they learn and start concentrating on the people, not the tools? El Al, which is a primary target for terrorists, has been doing that for decades. <a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmo_3228.html" title="User:Jcmo">Jcmo</a> 12:26, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Security measures are inevitably inconvenient, especially if applied suddenly. If you are worried about your valuables being lost if in the hold - insure them, or don't take them at all. A more germane point is lost time for businessmen no longer able to work en route. The answer here is that senior business people will have to rearrange their working/travel schedule to cope.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">'Liquid Explosives'</span></h3>
<p>One of the buzzwords around this event seems to be the 'liquid explosives' that were planned for this. Can anyone clarify what this could mean? (Right now the word just links to wikipedia's article on explosives.) -- hack 16:25, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Liquid explosives are just that; an explosive in the form of a liquid. Nitroglycerin and MEKP are examples of these. I suspect that the terrorists planned to synthesize an organic peroxide onboard, due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and sulphuric acid. In OP syntheses, hydrogen peroxide "peroxidizes" a ketone like acetone or Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEKP) to form unstable but powerful explosives. The acid is a catalyst. From what I've read it is not clear to me that the ACTUAL explosive product would have been liquid. If they were synthesizing an organic peroxide onboard, acetone peroxide (which is a solid, and was used in the london train bombings) would have been much easier because it only needs to be filtered; you need a seperatory funnel for MEKP as it is an oily liquid. The precursors for both of these OPs are all liquids, however. --<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrucible_Guardian_c04e.html" title="User:Crucible Guardian">Crucible Guardian</a> 17:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Don't be silly, it would be simpler to sneak ready made organoperoxides onto the aeroplane. The terrorists were going to make pirhana solution, and then mix it with any organic solvent (probably acetone). Figure that you flush a quart or two of acetone down a vacuum toilet, and then flush a pint or two of pirhana solution. You'll get a nice boom out of that. 129.10.244.59 21:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've just heard that they were going to use "Gelled" explosives in a false bottom attached to a gatorade type drink. The bottle was to be sealed as to allow for them to drink the liquid fromt he main compartment if questioned about the bottles at security check points. They were to be detonated with a jury-rigged disposable camera flash.--<a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDasGooch_d431.html" title="User:DasGooch">DasGooch</a> 21:54, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does the article mention MEKP? The source article linked doesn't. Whilst MEKP is a dangerous chemical it is not the same as TATP.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For that matter, why does the article mention TATP and HMTD? Both of those were crystaline solids last time I checked --70.70.143.237 06:22, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Im pretty sure its MEKP as mentioned above it cant be TATP or HMTD as they are solid crystals, Glycerol Trinitrate and Ethylene Glycol Dinitrate are liquid explosives but are secondary explosives needing a primary explosive detonator which means they cant be it because the plan states they were going to use a filament to ignite the material. MEKP is the only logical choice as it is fairly powerful, a liquid organic peroxide based explosive and can be detonated by DDT from the filament.58.7.140.128 09:39, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a note on the following: "According to a report in CNN, ingredients found in a unnamed British sports drink could have also formed part of the explosive mixture." I think this info was misinterpreted. All the news reports I have seen have suggested the explosives would be concealed within sports drinks/sodas, like a glob of gel in a separate compartment <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/08/explosive_gel_t.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/08/explosive_gel_t.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

Everyone else charged was acquited and several other people charged had their cases dropped. Also, from what I can tell no evidence of ricin was found Bourgass may not have been a very nice person, he was convicted of murder previously <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/04/14/nbour14.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/04/14/nbour14.xml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and a plot may even have been considered but there is no real clear evidence it got very far. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:13, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So what? The security services' job is to prevent plots being put into action. Obviously they try to stop such plots at a stage where some evidence might be forthcoming, but the important thing is to prevent the plot "hatching". There is a difference between the task of trying to obtain convictions (if you want to do this ideally you wait until the bomber is seconds away from detonating his bomb ie "caught red handed") and trying to stop bombs going off (ideally you jump in as soon as you are convinced a plot is afoot). Too early - you might end up with no evidence and have to release everyone. Too late - you end up with piles of corpses.</p>

Are facts from the British government not to be taken as fact? We have seen, even here on Wikipedia, facts from other sources taken as fact before they have been proven. <a href="../../../m/n/w/User%7EMnw2000_d6d1.html" title="User:Mnw2000">user:mnw2000</a> 12:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this comes down to the presumption of innocence. Until tried in a court of law, we can't assume that any of those arrested are guilty of plotting anything. The UK Government says a lot of things; we shouldn't assume they are all true. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 12:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The tone of this seems to have shifted entirely to an acceptance that there was a plot. Do I think they were upto something? Sure... however at the moment all of those men are innocent and there is no "confirmation" of a plot until it's presented in court.</dd>

<dd>We cannot assume anything at all. We cannot assume they are guilty, we cannot assume they aren't. Assuming is POV and OR. We report what others report. We report what reliable sources tell us. If reliable sources state that these people were arrested because they plotted this, then we will state that these people were arrested because they plotted this. And yes, most people consider the BBC and CCN (and also the UK government) reliable sources. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<p>Well I think the BBC is a reliable source - and they use "suspected", "alleged" and "suspect" - they don't write their copy as if those men are guilty.</p>

<p><br />
Here in the U.S., the media and the government use the terms like "suspect", "allegedly", etc. to describe people and not crimes. Describing people as guilty before they are tried would often interfere with their right to a fair trial. But there is no need to refer to a crime or plot the same way, since it is not going to be put on trial. Calling someone an "alleged killer", for example, does not mean the killing itself is unproven or call it into doubt in any way; instead, it means that the person accused of carrying it out has not been convicted. That people are only allegedly guilty does not mean the plot's existence is only alleged. It is thus proper to say there was a plot to bomb these planes, even though it is also proper to call those arrested "suspects" rather than "conspirators", "bombers", or what have you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The BBC is constantly referring to it as the "alleged" plot. As long as it isn't proven that there was/is a plot (we currently only have the word of the police and the politicians, and they have in the past announced numerous plots which turned out to be based on false information), we should stick with "alleged' plot. If we don't, we're saying that the plot is a fact, although none of the persons currently arrested have yet been charged for anything, and that would be POV. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 21:41, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why isn't there at least a sentence in the article, specifying that there isn't yet any proof or evidence about the plot that UK officials have discovered&#160;?

<dd>What on earth makes you think there's no evidence? The police surely didn't just make this whole thing up and arrest people selected arbitrarily. No evidence has been introduced in court yet, or even shown to the media, but that does not mean it doesn't exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The analogy to Colin Powell at the U.N. hardly supports your position. There was a great deal of evidence that Iraq had WMDs, and Powell presented much of it during his speech. It turned out that the evidence had been misinterpreted and had thus led the U.S. to an incorrect conclusion, but to say there was no evidence at all is simply wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It may turn out that the authorities are mistaken about this plot or about the involvement of some of the suspects, but whether their beliefs are correct is a different question from whether they have evidence to support those beliefs.</dd>

<p>The Daily Mail (which I accept is not to be regarded as in any way reliable) and other papers have reported that at least two of those named by the Bank Of England were converts to Islam - there appears to be quite a bit of evidence that one was born in the UK, his parents being from St Vincent, and another was born in England of English parents - I think the line quoted above is now out of date and should be changed.</p>

<dd>Many, including myself, see Wikipedia not as a regular encyclopedia but as even a major news source. The main page could even be compared to a major news website. Unlike other encyclopedias, this one is updated not only daily but every second. To prohibit such information just because it's "not encyclopedia–like" is unfair—Wikipedia is unique. — <sup>`</sup><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a><sup>`</sup> 14:21, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How can something that is supposedly an "encyclopedia" be expected to publish "non-encyclopedic" material?

<dd>I agree, when i woke up today and heard the situation on BBC radio the first website o went to to get the broadest insight was bbc news, <i>followed by wikipedia</i>. wikipedia is in my opinion is at the forefront of information because it can be editted now, not annually like other published encyclopedias. thus i have to say that wikipedia is more then just a source of information, it is quite a reliable source of news too. not only that because the articles are editted by many people from different parts of the world the articles are quite trustworthy, and the funny thing is the more people edit it the more mistakes are picked out. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg.loutsenko_ef3b.html" title="User:Greg.loutsenko">Greg.loutsenko</a> 14:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. Why do you think we have a "current event" template? And plus, if we enforced your views, this article would only be about 2 sentences long.

<p>I consider this an important section to include, although it might repeat some of what is already there. The politicians run a separate narrative from that of the police operation. The involvement of people in the highest level of government in what should essentially be a police operation is pretty notable. This event, like many other foiled terrorist plots (some of very dubious veracity) is likely to crop up frequently in their speeches about terrorism in the coming weeks, and perhaps they should be mentioned here.</p>

<dd>John Reid's comment is pure propaganda. The largest loss of life to 'innocent civilians' in such a way is certainly the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, although done during wartime by a nation state, therefore not considered an act of 'terror'. Without more facts it's difficult to speculate on numbers of deaths, and if they are in fact 'unprecedented' and 'unimaginable'. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 12:13, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, have some manners, anonymous user. Referring to Pakistanis as "Pakis" just isn't very nice. I'm prepared to admit that it might be worth mentioning somewhere in the piece that some people *think* this is a hoax. However, the balance of evidence suggests it isn't. A hoax would require a coverup on a massive scale, and risk an enormous backlash if it were found out.

I agree with Rich Farnbrough. There is every chance that this is a hoax. If not a complete fabrication, its been blown out of all proportion. It is feasible that the authorities have stumbled upon the sick fantasies of a few disillusioned young minorities, and are now running hard to make max political yards. Of course the fantasy is extremly unpaletable, but the media hysteria we are seeing at the moment is not proportional to these kids' fantasy. We know there were no tickets purchased. We know some of them do not have passports. We know they do not have plausible terrorist backgrounds -- was there really much chance of them actually carrying this atrocity out?</p>
<p>The lack of 'verifiable content' should not rule out the mention of a possible hoax in the article. What links could possibly be provided at this stage? Until the evidence (or paucity of) is presented in court then the question should remain open and the article neutral. The police have not shown the people any evidence whatsoever... the peoples' encyclopedia should acknowledge so (guilty until proven innocent remember??)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">U.S. &amp; U.K. government &amp; news statements about suspects' religious ties</span></h2>
<p>I wonder whether it's worth mentioning, in this article, a difference between British and American government officials and mainstream news media.</p>
<p>On the day on which this news broke, President Bush spoke of "Islamic fascists"—a term that, the United States' NPR News reported, would not be used publicly by authorities in the U.K.</p>
<p>According to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, a member of the House of Lords said that the police had told him that all 21 (at the time, the reported number was 21, not 24) of the arrested suspects were "British Muslims".</p>
<p>But it seems that most mainstream news reports and government statements have steered clear of wording about the suspects' religious backgrounds or views.</p>
<p>The opening story of the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> edition of NPR's <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Things_Considered_7ab4.html" title="All Things Considered">All Things Considered</a></i> had a report from correspondent Rob Gifford, in London, that included these words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>ROB GIFFORD: Inevitably, there has been speculation about who the suspects are. The areas of London and Birmingham where the arrests were made have large multiracial communities; other suspects were arrested in the town of High Wycombe, near London. But police have been treading very sensitively, giving no background information, bearing in mind often delicate relations with the Muslim community, since four young extremists killed themselves and fifty-two others on the London transport system last July. Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Paul Stephenson was at pains to stress this was nothing to do with any specific community or any specific faith.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PAUL STEPHENSON: This is not about communities. This is about—this is about criminals. This is about murderers, people who want to commit mass murder. This is not about anything to do with any particular community. This is about people who might masquerade within a community, behind certain faiths. But this is about people who are desperate, desperate people, who want to do things that no right-minded citizen of this country or any other country would want to tolerate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe this interesting question of what to say and what not to say when giving information about such an event is worth mentioning in this article.</p>

I think it is rediculous and that this is very well part of the WOT and the UK is very much involved in fighting terrorism. It's a different war, not a war of nations, it's a war of Nations vs Criminals, people who don't just rob their local bank or their corner shop, they kill millions of innocent people. I support this war on terrorism and hope that one day, we will defeat them. Yesterday is an example of that, and a victory for the police and security services of the UK, we deserve acknowledgment in our contribution to ending what could had been the largest terror attack since 9/11.</p>

<dd><i>they kill millions of innocent people.</i> WTF? when the yanks invaded afganistan and iraq they killed tens of thousands of <b>innocent civilians</b>. the yanks call this collateral damage, but this is bull shit, its called murdering tens of thousands of people. <b>al qaeda was created by CIA</b>. trained, funded, they even activly provided intellegence. so i think the yanks should just go and hug their <b>forner friends</b>. and since all you yanks are so christian why dont you turn the other cheek.

<dd>I absolutely agree. We can't leave this template out because it "sounds a bit American". These were trans-Atlantic flights and this is an international encyclopedia. If there's an equivalent British template that should be added too. I was really objecting to "THE YANKS CREATED AL QAEDA, WHY SHOULD THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS" in all caps and to "WTF" - a completely inappropriate use of a talk page that provokes others to misuse the pages too.

<dd>On quick research, none of the London bombing articles have a "War on Terror" template. My feeling is is that is was determined innappropriate for the content at hand. Neither does the 2006 Toronto Terrorism Arrests, something that (As far I remember from CNN) related to the War on Terror. At the current place and time I don't think there is a clear connection to either Al-Qaeda or the War on Terror (And for the most part it is an American term, but I do not feel that it is restricted to only America. Other countries have used it, I believe, including my own).</dd>
<dd>Besides, all Terror is international (Hence why I'm apprehensive about France's part in the anti-terrorist activites). There is no way anyone can say "Terrorism does not affect my country".</dd>
<dd>So, sorry, I don't feel the "War" on Terror template is appropriate. I'm sure it's been called part of the War on Terror, but I don't know if that's what Wikipedia wants.</dd>
<dd>However, if there is a generic "Relating to Terrorism", "Terror Template" or "Relating to attacks purportedly seeking recompense for international greivances", I'd be more for it. Heck, even an "Relating to Airway terror" template would do. I'm sure that there is an appropriate template out there: If War on Terror is the one, so be it. My current beliefs say it isn't, but that's just me.

<dd>Well the US government has been pretty clear that this is probably Al Qaeda related. I don't think many really doubt this even if nothing's confirmed. The "War on Terror" template is good as a generic Al Qaeda related terror template whereas aircraft terror or international grievances are rather unhelpful categories (how likely are people to want a list of aeroplane related terrorist attacks and how likely are they to want a list of Al Qaeda attacks?). I know what Wikipedia is not but I'd like to see a template with a name people can agree on to group together all of these Islamic terrorism pages.

<p>Can we agree that, since this was a terrorist plot and the targets were said to be flights heading to the United States on US airlines, there is a US connection and therefore it's at least plausible to tag this with the "War on Terror" template?

<p>Well, the name of the template appears to be <i>War on Terrorism</i> which a) makes more sence than War on Terror and b) makes the argument you've all been having a bit redundant and pointless. For the benefit of our American brethren, UK politicians very rarly refer to the WOT as people sniggering can really put you off your stride in a speech. Journalists tend to precede the term with a cough, a pause or pronounce it in inverted commas ( watch Paxman ). Satirists love the term, and tend to precede it with the possesive: 'George Bush's War on Terror' <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmackaerospace_fc92.html" title="User:Jmackaerospace">Jmackaerospace</a> 00:33, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note: for the following, I'm using some generalizations based on popular political opinion. I'm not trying to incite anything, I'm just being brief. The "white house attack" would be the biggest niche for conspiracy theorists in the US as far as I can tell. Joe Lieberman's loss to a "real anti-war" opponent was a potential sign that the Democractic party is growing a spine for the upcoming elections. It is very disconcerting that the terrorist plot was unvieled just after Lieberman's loss (and the White House's renewed attack on Democrats), and that Stone's 9/11 movie just came out, with elections coming up, etc etc. Talk of the conspicuous timing of these events will certainly hit major news outlets before long (I've heard it quite a bit on NPR [radio] for starters). And I'm not trying to validate the conspiracy theorists' claims at all, but it's just the close timing of all of these events (just as the Bush administration gets a "big win" pushing for peace in the Israel/Hezbollah conflict) is something that's drawing a lot of raised eyebrows regardless of stance on a conspiracy. <a href="../../../g/s/p/User%7EGspawn_e375.html" title="User:Gspawn">Gspawn</a> 14:14, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>All that jazz about timing and whatnot is fine, but I still don't see how that's related to the plot itself--the actual "plot" the suspects were looking to execute doesn't seem to really, mm, relate to the bit I'd mentioned earlier, or at least certainly not under security reaction; however, it could be placed somewhere else, i.e. a subsection about reaction or something, or even more towards "political reaction," but I'd wager a. it's strangely out of place in this article, and b. it's almost certainly out of place in its current section. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERuss_a_boykin_e604.html" title="User:Russ a boykin">russ.</a> 16:38, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A quick look into the articles created on the suspects arrested in relation to this plot reveal that apart from the fact that they were arrested as suspects, nothing else is written.

<p>A couple of points. (1) It's worth starting a new discussion here (not half way up the page) as this talk page is rather long and is going to need some archiving soon. This also makes it much easer to find the reasoning (the edit summary "(As per talk)" does not help in this regard). (2) There was a consensus reached back on August 10 that this name is ok, at least for now.

<dd>I agree that the title, as it stands, isn't ideal, although I'd say it's more a case of it being unverified rather than POV.

<dd>The article covers two distinct issues, the first is an alleged plot to blow up several aircraft en route from the UK to the US, the second is the reaction in terms of increased airport security and the related hindrance to travel. Ultimately we may need to split the article to deal with these two related issues fully (I don't think this is needed yet, but with coverage of any future trial, other possible plots and so on this may be needed quite soon). <b>August 2006 airline security alert</b> covers the second issue while <b>2006 transatlantic aircraft plot</b> covers the first (I don't think we need to include "alleged" and it is rather clumsy).

<dd>Let me express myself more clearly, this article is about the police investigation going on in Britain. The difficulties of some air passangers is not that important compared to a police investigation spanning two countries that we know of, involing 25 arrests and alligations of planning to commit mass murder.

Yeah, and maybe we should rename the israel-lebanon crisis a "border alert," eh? Airline security alert is a pretty broad term that doesn't really at all describe the cause of what happened and is happening presently--and the alert, in the context of flying, is still barely notable if you compare to the many, many, people who've heard about it in another context, i.e. the planes and their allegedly planned disintegration midflight(i.e. the story seems to be the alleged plot, not the security reaction in the airports). Aircraft raids suggests either aircraft were raided, or aircraft did the raiding, so that won't work. As far as the idea that, "If the plot is proven to be genuine, we can split the article," well, the story concerning the reaction in airport security following the alleged plot seems to be inextricably linked to its chronological origins; if we're to split at some point in the future, there's no sense in renaming for that yet unseen possibility. I can see the idea of splitting it, much like, say, JFK's assassination was [probably? I'm too new and unread in the JFK assassination talk page] split into several separate articles, i.e. reaction, autopsy, funeral, etc. However, the possible renaming of this article to "airline security reaction" should wait till we even know there will be something article-worthy and is more than an alleged plot from which to split this thing.</p>
<p>The idea of allegation as a parenthetical or using the incident panacea seem to have the most appeal as far as I can see. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERuss_a_boykin_e604.html" title="User:Russ a boykin">russ.</a> 09:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The word 'transatlantic' should remain, since this is apparently a plot only affecting flights from the UK to the US. It sounds as though the intent was to explode planes over the US, just to board them in the UK. Also, I do not favour inserting the word 'alleged' into the title. Any name for a historical event describes what it was about, not necessarily whether it was justified. This story is definitely about a plot. One important issue is indeed whether there really was a plot, or not, but it is not necessary to clutter up the title with that information. Stating it clearly in the introduction is sufficient. (Though also see my comment below. The UK home secretary this morning used the phrase 'alleged plot' in a TV statement announcing the downgrading of the security alert.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 09:48, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How will that help? It is all the same story. The plot, real or not, is the direct cause of the increased security measures.

<dd>Because this article is about a series of anti-terror raids in england, the affects to air travelers are a side effect of that and now people are trying to make this article about luggage restictions as if such things were of encyclopedic importance. That why it needs spliting, because they can't tell which of the two events is important and which isn't.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 11:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But actually the most important thing about this issue <i>is</i> the luggage restrictions and inconvenience. The whole reason people threaten to blow up airplanes is because it causes an enormous amount of disruption and inconvenience, even if no plane ever suffers the slightest bit of damage. There is a huge difficulty quantifying and equating different types of suffering but it is nonetheless necessary to consider how many inconvenienced people amounts to more suffering than one death. This is not just about 'inconvenience'. This disruption <i>will</i> have had a definite effect on the economy, will have increased stress levels, caused people to miss critical appointments, caused them to have heart attacks... The difficulties with luggage <i>is</i> the most serious consequence for most people from this entire issue. It is what has actually affected their lives.</dd>

<dd>The security restrictions do not appear to have been eased because the authorities consider it to be 'safe', but because they consider it impossible to continue to run the airports with these restrictions in place. If anything, the political risk to the UK authorities should a bomb actually explode seems much greater than the personal risk to anyone flying. If this were not true, I can't imagine why no one has actually gone out and increased the number of security staff long ago, so that there are enough, with enough equipment available, to search people properly all the time. It would seem that there was already a shortage of security staff before this happened,(refs available somewhere online<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml;jsessionid=MV5QXQKHA0MTJQFIQMFCFFOAVCBQYIV0?xml=/travel/2006/04/08/etnewsbags.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml;jsessionid=MV5QXQKHA0MTJQFIQMFCFFOAVCBQYIV0?xml=/travel/2006/04/08/etnewsbags.xml" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>) and long queues for the previous security measures. There were such queues at heathrow a few weeks ago when I was there. Funnily enough, coming back security seemed no less stringent, but was much quicker. There also did not seem much scope for creating extra channels to process people faster. It is also not impossible that this chaos is related to the current building of a new terminal at Heathrow, which plainly implies that the current existing facilities are overcrowded without any additional work load. Anyway, this story is not simply about a security alert, which was predictable, but about a failure to handle it without chaos. This is in fact more of the same pattern we have seen of shooting innocent people while attempting to enforce necessary security. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 17:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>i have to say, and with regret, that I have seen no evidence that any real plot exists, more than various officials reporting what they have been told by someone else. The main source of information so far appears to be the Pakistani government, who under other circumstances would not be considered trustworthy.And as I have already said, on past performance only a fool would believe these reports are accurate. Now, under the circumstances I am willing to give them rather a lot of benefit of the doubt, and credit for well-meaning intentions, but no, I can not honestly say that I do believe what we have been told. Nor do I find it an acceptable excuse that 'Heathrow have been cutting corners'. This is supposedly an emergency situation, yet the government has not seen fit to ensure that critical services are capable of doing their job. If the security services really believe what they are telling the public, then they should have been prepared for what happens when they announce the inevitable emergency situation. It is the same story. Government causes chaos. (though again to be fair to the security services, no one knows what they actually had to say about the situation before it went through political translation). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 22:04, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difficulty was that they went overboard explaining the importance of their succesfull operation, and then it all turned out to be rubbish. Then they had another go, and (last I heard) shot someone for dealing in pornography? They have yet to redeem their record, so I repeat, on their record, any statement is not to be relied upon. It is a straightforward judgement of the facts presented. I have little truck with this notion of screwing up prosecutions. Statements like that also sound like excuses to avoid explanations: it is quite normal for government oficials to refuse to explain their mistakes and hide behind some alleged contractual obligation. Right now they are obviously feverishly looking for evidence, so plainly they havn't wrapped up the case to their own satisfaction. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 23:29, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly correct. You can't have it both ways, either you can't leak anything about the investigations or you can. If anything, the fact that they reported to have found some guns in a wood is a clear sign that there is still no trace of the alleged liquid multi-component explosives. We have seen this all before. Silence after killing de Menezes, silence after Forest Gate, silence after the invasion of Iraq. Before and after the admission of failure, details are leaked to give public opinion a pacifier (de Menezes was an illegal immigrant who ran away from the police, we found some porn at Forest Gate, "but Saddam was a really really bad guy, so it doesn't matter if the WMD are not there" etc). To call an intelligence operation successful in my book you gather specific information, you raid the premises, and you find stuff. I still hope that they do find something (possibly not planted) to support their case, but based on what we know the skepticism is growing... <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 05:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However this latest alert differed in that the JTAC and/or John Reid/Blair decided on the handluggage restrictions, which had a minor but noticable effect on thousands of people's lives, and cost £millions to businesses. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 17:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is utterly insane. Calling this the "2006 transatlantic aircraft plot" tells you nothing about the event. It's a <i><b>terrorist</b></i> plot; that's why it has gathered so much attention. Excluding the word "terrorist" is deliberate obfuscation. The entire reason this subject is noteable enough to have an article on is the specter of <i><b>terrorism</b></i>. To fail to reflect that in the article's name is absurd. Furthermore, quibbling about the word "plot" is stupid. We can't have a policy that anything that isn't proven in a court of law cannot go on Wikipedia. (We might have a very slim encyclopedia indeed!) If the event turns out to be a massive hoax, then we can highlight that in the article, or rename the article as the "2006 transatlantic terrorist hoax". Until then, it lives on in the media and thus in popular imagination -- and the vast majority of English speaking people would recognize this event -- as a "terrorist plot". <i>Nobody</i> is going to search for this event with the word "aircraft" or the phrase "alleged plot". --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 20:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a terrorist plot, because no such verifiable plot exists. Wikipedia rules are pretty clear. As I said, they have been applied (correctly) with de Menezes, I can't see why that should not apply for this article. It's all over the media: "alleged plot". In fact, quite a lot of people are happy with "August 2006 airline security alert".

Actually, I don't think a lot of people are happy with it, and that sounds a lot like a run-up to a vote, which, if I'm not mistaken, is frowned upon as a matter of settling problems; I disagree with the idea of naming it airline security alert, seeing as that's a byproduct of what actually happened. If a fork were to happen, then we could have an article on the alleged plot and the airline security alert as a separate thing describing what happened at airports, restrictions on liquids, gels etc, but the event as it stands is not being described as an airline security alert; it's being described, as you say, as an alleged plot. I'm sympathetic as to keeping the terrorist thing out of it[though, understandably, hyphen and others have made a practical point concerning the usefulness of it] for the reasons stated by PizzaMargherita, but am not fond of the proposed name change. For one, hyphen's argument about it being "proven" is a strong one, insofar as waiting on proof so as to abide npov policy; glance at the al-qaeda article for a perfect example. No alleged or any other such equivocation(even though they've taken responsibility for sept 11, they would still be only allegedly responsible, seeing as, despite their taking claim for it, "The readers don't know who you are. You can't include your telephone number so that every reader in the world can call you for confirmation. And even if they could, why should they believe you?" and, as someone mentioned earlier, the article itself can handle or assert the reality of whether or not x or y is the case. PM[if you don't mind my abbreviating your name as such] seems to be discussing verifiability differently as I understand it: he appears to mean [in the first line of his previous post, anyway] whether or not the plot has been verified to exist at all, as opposed to whether or not it has been addressed as a plot, alleged or otherwise, in a verifiable source calling it more than alleged.</p>
<p>In any case, looking at WP:V, I see "'Verifiability' in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true," and I would take that to mean it's not necessary, beyond citing a reputable source that simply addresses it as a plot, to debate over calling it alleged for the sake of the article if there is a v. source that does so. Can we verify it's being called a plot, not merely alleged, on this side of the pond[the states, for reference/clarification]? Yeah. Can anyone verify right now that it's actually more than an alleged plot? Nope. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERuss_a_boykin_e604.html" title="User:Russ a boykin">russ.</a> 07:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm adding this from the end of the above article:</p>
<p>THE MEN THE POLICE ARE HOLDING</p>
<p>The police took 24 people in for questioning and have released one without charge. Most of the rest can be held in custody until Wednesday, although police can then seek permission to hold them for longer, up to a limit of 28 days. Among those seized were:</p>
<p>Usman Muhammed Saddique, 24, from Walthamstow, worked at his brother’s pizza restaurant. Nicknamed Uzi, he is “highly educated” and a fitness fanatic, say friends, but had a rebellious streak. Police took videos and computer disks from his house.</p>
<p><br />
Assan Abdullah Khan, 21, and Waheed Arafat Khan, 25, lived together at a semi-detached house in Walthamstow. The brothers were known locally as proficient amateur mechanics who helped to fix neighbours’ cars. Assan is studying at the University of Hertfordshire and his elder brother is married with a baby. They prayed daily at a mosque close to their home.</p>
<p><br />
Assad Sarwar, 26, lived with his brother in an ex-council house in High Wycombe. His brother, who was not arrested, is known locally as “Valentino” after he posted his details on an internet dating site three years ago, revealing that he liked rap music and fish and wanted to meet a girl with a “nice personality”.</p>
<p><br />
Waseem Kayani, 29, from High Wycombe. A taxi driver who lived with his parents and wore western clothes. Neighbours say he had a pronounced limp and had shaved his head while retaining his long beard. He recently returned from Pakistan with a new bride.</p>
<p><br />
Shazad Khuram Ali, 27, from High Wycombe runs a car trading company which is believed to have employed fellow suspect Assad Sarwar. Accounts show that the company made an £11,000 loss last year. Neighbours have complained about the building of a makeshift mosque in his back garden. Recently visited Pakistan.</p>
<p><br />
Mohammed Shamin Uddin, 35, from Stoke Newington moved into his housing association flat a month ago. The former body-builder is understood to have suffered from mental illness after a violent assault which temporarily left him in a coma.</p>
<p><br />
Waheed Zaman, 22, from Walthamstow is a final year biochemistry student at London Metropolitan University. He is president of the college Islamic society and lives opposite the Queen’s Road mosque where at least eight of the suspects are believed to have worshipped. Friends say he was too busy revising for exams to be a bomb plotter.</p>
<p><br />
Don Stewart-Whyte, 20, son of a former Tory agent, attended a grammar school. His half-sister is Heather Stewart-Whyte, a successful model who lives in north London. She has said that she has never met her half-brother.</p>
<p><br />
Umair Hussain, 24, and his brother Nabeel Hussain, 22, were seized in Hackney, east London. Nabeel, a hospital administrator, recently visited Pakistan — friends say he went with his grandmother</p>

<p>The Sun newspaper reported that the actions of Islam, 28, a former Rastafarian who converted to Islam, had been "at dramatic odds" with allegations he was involved in the latest terror plot. "Immediately after the bombs, he was sent to Liverpool Street - which could easily have been another target area because it is in the financial district," the newspaper quoted a colleague as saying. "It was where buses were terminating and he joined others in checking under the seats for suspect packages." "He was briefed in evacuation and security procedures, and was making sure the public did not go where they shouldn't. Basically, he was helping to marshall the buses and trying to sort-out the chaos. Whatever his beliefs, he did a great job. He was certainly committed to what he was doing, you couldn't fault him at all. On that day he was trying to save lives, not destroy them."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">alleged</span></h2>
<p>I'm all for conspiracy theories, and i also don't like all the convenient "terror attacks" that seem to happen when the public starts to forget about the war and the President and whatever. However, this is an encyclopedia. We don't have the luxury to doubt the Press and the governments of two countries. We just report what happened. That's it. "alleged" is a POV word and must be taken out and left out of this article. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 03:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree that alleged is a POV word. In fact, it should be used until something has been proven; in that case the article would be exhibiting POV <i>without</i> it. However, according to the media, the investigation turned up bomb-making materials and there is proof of the plot. In this situation, the attack is not "alleged". <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 04:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly disagree that we cannot doubt governments.</p>
<p>The plot is alleged until a jury rules the opposite. While it's clear (if debatable) that governments and airport security cannot, can we hold our breath for some time? The principle of presumption of innocence has been observed by WP for almost a year, until the officers who shot seven times in the head a guy who was boarding a train before scores of eye-witnesses were cleared. I can't see why that should not apply here. If anything, there are far too many instances of unqualified "plot" in the article. In mainstream media (UK at least) you can't find "plot" anywhere unaccompanied by "alleged". Whatever some people would like us to believe, it's not only the "Muslim community" who doesn't trust this British police/goverment anymore, ex-Labour Tony Benn yesterday (interviewed by the BBC) was very clear about this.</p>
<p>War in Iraq, de Menezes, Alpizar, Forest Gate, what do these all have in common? Bad intelligence (or lack thereof), worse policies, civilian casualties. I do hope that this plot will be demonstrated to be real. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 06:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This morning I just saw a government minister, the home secretary, on TV where he used the phrase 'alleged plot'. His statement is still running as of now on BBC news 24 on UK terrestrial TV. Is that official enough? The alleged word has crept into all news reports since the day it happened, perhaps because there seems as yet to be no proof of anything. From memory, I recently heard some statistics re terrorist related arrests in recent years. Of about 1000 people arrested, more than half have simply been released, and only about 30 have been convicted of anything directly related to terrorism. Then we have the couple of people shot by police despite not having any demonstrable terrorist link, which I suspect sounds more acceptable in the US than it does in the UK. In short, while people are willing to go along with security measures because there obviously is a risk, there is an increasing level of cynicism about their effectiveness, and the credibility of any official statement. Wiki does generally give the benefit of the doubt to official government sources. However, there has to be a limit as to how long we are willing to quote statements from a source which repeatedly demonstrates its inaccuracy, without qualifying those statements.</dd>

<dd>"Presumption of innocence". That applies to an individual prosecuted for a crime. It doesn't apply to whether a crime took place or not! Whether a crime occurred or not can usually be determined long before a trial takes place. That is, if we have a body and a murder weapon, and suicide is ruled out, we don't need to talk about an "alleged" murder. In this case of course things are a little less clear-cut. We don't know if the police have anything more than hearsay (suspect being overheard) - say, forensics, documents, confessions, etc. Imagine that Guy Fawkes had been caught before he'd planted the gunpowder in the basement. Would we now talk about the "alleged" gunpowder plot? As I've stated elsewhere, if you catch your plotter early enough you may be unable to prove in a court of law that a plot ever existed. But as a security service your prime motivation is not to obtain convictions but to foil plots.</dd>

They want that story, even the BBC, if the Police had Nothing they would not have got past the Senior County Court Judge yesterday, does this Something equal proof they are guilty NO! Have the police said anything offical, Yes that they found "items of interest" in the woods and thats all they have said. I've said it before the police can't say much at all without risking the prosicution, and that risk should not be taken just for poeple who won't believe what they are told anyway. This lack of information creates a vacuum of facts that the media depending on the ethics of that media group fill with Leaks, Suppositon or out-right made up BS.

<dd>As i've said the police have released no evidence to the public as it would jepordise the case.

<dd>The fact that so far no evidence has been made available is significant, I think, because British intelligence services have an extremely poor record in terror related cases: see the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_Green_ricin_plot_a759.html" title="Wood Green ricin plot">Wood Green ricin plot</a> for example, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charles_de_Menezes_a252.html" title="Jean Charles de Menezes">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>, or the <a href="../../../2/_/j/2_June_2006_Forest_Gate_raid_add8.html" title="2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid">2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid</a>.

<dd>The first independant test of the evidence comes lunchtime tomorrow when the police have to bring each subject to court and present a case for continued detention under the anti-terrorism laws.

<dd>I do not advocate writing the article with a sceptical tone towards the statements that a plot exists, but having said that, my opinion is that if any significant evidence proving the existence of a real threat had been found, then this would have been 'leaked' immediately. At this point it is not necessary to leak prejudicial information about individuals, from the POV of the authorities the desperate need has to be to demonstrate that they are correct in the mere existence of a threat by someone. But I agree tomorrow should be interesting. I think it was at that point, last time round, that the authorities suddenly declined to produce any evidence. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 22:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tasting baby formula at US airports</span></h2>
<p>At least one person inserted an edit on the basis that he had personally seen people required to taste baby formula at US airports. Someone else immediately reverted this to a version saying it had been proved that this was not the case, on the basis of an official motice saying this would not be required. I do not find this convincing. For my money, no official notice of general policy can ever 'prove' that a certain thing never happened. Anyone got better information? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 21:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am the person who made this edit. Originally I had first stated that UK passengers were being forced to taste baby formula to prove it was not a hazardous liquid (explosive). I then went on to say it was rumored that US passengers were being forced to do the same. I did not personally witness people tasting baby formula at US airports, though this may have occured. Fox News Channel reported at one point that it was rumored that this was occuring. The NY Times article that I cited is where I got the information that TSA would not be requiring US passengers to taste baby formula. Mynameisryan812 16:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe it's quite possible that it was <i>planned</i> to make ppl taste formula/bottled breast milk, until someone actually checked and found that it wouldn't be immediately toxic, and if you were going to blow up a plane with liquid explosive <i>anyway</i> then why would you care if you were made drink some... RTÉ (Irish) radio had a British security expert interviewed on the morning of the alert saying it was pretty pointless... <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 16:39, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Under 1.2 (Scope of Plot &gt; Liquid Explosives) it explains why tasting the baby formula was irrelevant. The container that the plotters planned to use was to contain the original liquid on the top. Thus, they would be tasting a harmless drink while the explosive material sat at the bottom of the modified container. We need to make clarification on this section. I think we need to state that immediately after the incident was uncovered, passengers in the UK were forced to taste baby formula. In the meantime, it was rumored that US passengers had been forced to do the same. I do not know if this actually occured or not; I was hoping to see if anyone had witnessed this or had any sources. As more details of the plot were uncovered, this was deemed unnecessary due to the reason I mentioned above. Mynameisryan812 17:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linking dates</span></h2>
<p>Do we really have to make every date in the article a link to the wiki page for that date? Normal convention is only to link the first occurrence of anything in an article.

<dl>
<dd>In order for the date processing to work correctly, dates ARE one of the things you are ALWAYS supposed to link. When the software sees, say, [[11 September]], it automatically knows to render that as "September 11" on my screen. However, if it wasn't a wikilink, that automatic conversion would not happen. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 22:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Because peoples' preferences for how they read dates are strongly culturally ingrained, and disagreements lead to transatlantic edit wars. There was a hell of an argument about this back in 2003 before date formats were made a user preference – I should know, it's the only major edit war I've been involved in since joining Wikipedia.

Which is why I'm going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and relink the dates. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 14:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
