<dd>Well, then expand the footnote, if you want. But your hypothetical example isn't good enough to change my mind. Please edit this this footnote accordingly.<a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 17:34, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What hypothetical example? VV and I both <i>actually</i> find "US-backed" ambiguous and potentially misleading, as I've explained before. The big long post I made explaining how a reader might interpret "US-backed" was just a way of justifying a point that's obvious to almost everyone except you — that "US-backed" is ambiguous and potentially misleading — in order to counter your insulting allegations that I'm lying about my intuitions in this regard. Apparently you want to have it both ways: if I use a hypothetical example, you object because it's hypothetical; if I explain my own intuitions or cite VV's, you refuse to believe me. The footnote is silly because it would make more sense just to write an unambiguous intro in the first place, as I've explained before. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, I'm fine with you further contextualizing things as you see fit in the footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 18:53, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm not fine with that, though. I've explained why I don't like the footnote. Do you have a response? <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, take it or leave it. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 20:51, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a pretty stupid response on Wikipedia. I'm not going to take it, and I'm not going to leave it. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>That's right, the page will continue to be protected until you decide to compromise.

<dd>I don't have to accept whatever compromise you deign to offer, and you certainly haven't met me half way. Given that a footnote is exactly what I don't want, you've done the opposite and gone off in your own direction. In any case, you've rejected everyone else's offers of a compromise, and have yet to respond to virtually any of my arguments against your introduction and its silly footnote. I will not compromise with someone who can't justify their position, and whose idea of compromise is "take it or leave it". <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, for the record, let it be known that I have been the only one to offer a compromise. I don't particularly want the footnote either, but I made an attempt to end the edit war. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 12:25, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The record tells a different story. And you still haven't responded to my points and justified your intro. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>I beg your pardon? It is clear by virtue of our <i>ongoing</i> conversation alone that I have been the only one to offer a compromise. We've been having an argument over the reference to U.S. backing. Although I am dismissing your "points" (which are based on an assumption that you don't back up with evidence and with which I fundamentally disagree with - namely that the word 'backing' is so widely misunderstood), I have already agreed to disagree, thus explaining my offer of the <b>compromise footnote</b>, in which you can contextualize things as you see fit. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 12:59, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Sure, you offered a compromise, but you aren't the only person to have done so. I didn't like your proposed compromise, and I've explained why. I have backed up my points with a lot of evidence. If I use my own intuitions (and VV's) about what "backing" means, you don't believe me. If I use a hypothetical example and work it through in detail, you object because it's hypothetical. What other kind of "evidence" can one use to show what a word or sentence implies? Why is it that <i>you</i> do not have to provide <i>any</i> evidence in favour of your views on this matter — do you have a privaleged uderstanding of language? This isn't an issue of someone "misunderstanding" "US-backed", it's an issue of someone coming to a perfectly reasonable interpretation of it which is contrary to fact. Your apparent desire is for you to write the intro, and everyone else to have their contributions reduced to "contextualizing" your brilliant prose in a poncey little footnote. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This isn't about saving face. I'm fine with mentioning U.S. backing, you're not, so a workable compromise is adding a footnote, which means that you can rest assured that readers won't read "backed" but think "installed." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:38, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's not my position. I'm fine with mentioning the US role, so long as the wording used is unambiguous. In fact, I'm fine with having <i>a large porition of the intro</i> dedicated to describing the US role. You tell me that I "can rest assured that readers won't read 'backed' but think 'installed.'" Why? I've given plenty of reasons to think the contrary. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Although the meaning of the word backing only refers to support, aid, or encouragement, I have agreed to disagree with you on the point that readers won't read 'backed' but think 'installed.' So, this isn't about giving more hypothetical reasons to think the contrary just to save face. Instead, we can rest assured that readers won't misinterpret "U.S. backing" in the presence of the footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:58, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you said, the word refers to "support, <b>aid</b>, or encouragement". There is no conclusive evidence that the US (materially) aided the coup to any great extent, so by your own definition of the meaning of "US-backed" (which is anyway very conservative and does not take context into account) the term is misleading.
<dl>
<dd>Hold on, now you are being deliberately misleading. I was referring to a one of a number of dictionary definitions (moreover I used "or" rather than "and"), not what is implied in the context of the intro. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 14:15, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I don't get what your're saying here. If one of the possible meanings of "backed" is "aided", one of the possible meanings of "US-backed" is misleading. The context does nothing to filter out this misleading interpretation. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are wrong to think that readers won't read "backed" and think "installed" — the only reason me and VV are arguing with you is because we did exactly that. The footnote clears up the issue, but it would be much better to use clear language in the main body of the text and avoid a footnote altogether. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It was clear enough for <i>Encarta</i>, and I think that it is clear enough in the context of WP's NPOV policy. But do you want to save face and argue this forever, or move on and compromise?</dd>

<dd>Oh, and for the last time, <i>my reasons were not hypothetical</i>. I only started using hypothetical examples because you refused to believe my own personal intuitions, and VV's account of his. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Well, your reasons were certainly backed up by hypothetical examples. Short of an empirical test and a survey analysis of readers' impressions, we aren't going to be able to bring this argument to a closure. Do you just want this back-and-forward two-way argument between us on the talk page to go on forever? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 14:15, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, my reasons were backed up by <i>actual</i> examples, i.e. me and VV's reading of the intro, which you disengenuously refused to believe. There's already been an emprical test — we find the intro misleading, and would not have any argument with it if we did not. In fact, even by your own definition of what "US-backed" means it's misleading, as I pointed out above, so I'm not sure how you can still defend it. Do I want this argument to go on forever? No, but until we can find a real compromise (i.e. a compromise which appeals to me as well as to you) it presumably will. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Augusto_Pinochet#CIA_poll" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Augusto_Pinochet#CIA_poll" rel="nofollow">poll results on this page</a> indicated pretty damn strongly that a majority of users who responded disagreed with you and VV. Yet, you don't seem to want compromise. You seem to want to play a semantics game instead. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:43, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not a question of majority — "US-backed" is misleading to a significant number of people, so it shouldn't be used. If I am playing a semantics game, I'm playing it by your rules, since "US-backed" is misleading <i>according to your own definition of the word</i>. You can trivialise any meaningful discussion by terming it a "semantics game"; as far as I can see it's just a synonim for important and meaningful. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
<dd>&lt;later edit&gt;Also, I think many people in the polls supported inclusion of "US-backed" because they wanted the article to state that the US was directly involved in the coup. I'm certainly sympathetic to this view, but it's not NPOV&lt;/later edit&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You keep stating your argument and assumptions over and over again, so I guess I'll repeat over and over again that I'm willing to agree to disagree on whether or not a significant number of people will read "backed" but think "installed," and thus I'll accept a footnote that you're free to rewrite and/or expand. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 17:26, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I've repeated them because you haven't responded to them. If we have to agree to disagree, I'd at least like to know why you disagree. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
<dd>In any case, the point of disagreement is the neutrality of the article. I can't just agree to disagreee on that. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Then perhaps you'll want to take a look at the footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 17:36, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The footnote doesn't resolve the NPOV issue very effectively. By your own definition of the word, "US-backed" is misleading. Why not just remove it and add a bit of extra text with a proper explanation? <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Don't put words in my mouth. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 17:47, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not. Here's a quote: "Although the meaning of the word backing only refers to support, aid, or encouragement, I have agreed to disagree with you on the point that readers won't read 'backed' but think 'installed.'". Now, since "US-aided" coup would be misleading, "US-backed" coup would, according to the definition you gave, be at least potentially misleading. I know you gave that definition as a dicdef, not as the meaning of the word in the context of the intro, but there is nothing in that context which precludedes the "aided" interpretation (or if there is, you didn't explain what it is the last time I made this point). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>I already explained that you were quoting me out of context. I am going to cease responding to you if you continue to play games with me. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 18:02, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not quoting you out of context. I mean I included about half of your post, and the remainder of the relavent context I summarised by saying that "I know you gave that definition as a dicdef, not as the meaning of the word in the context of the intro..." The rest of your post, and even the surrounding posts, are here for anyone to read. If you <i>really</i> think I've quoted you out of context, you should at least explain why (I responded to your original explanation some time ago). Really I have to play games you, because you never discuss any substantive issue. Every point I make is countered only by vague accusations. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You are not sucking me into any more semantics games. This will be my last response to you on this page unless you start considering compromise. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 18:21, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Semantics games? You accused me of quoting you out of context and I explained why I didn't think I was; semantics didn't enter into it. If I was interested in playing semantics games I might ask you to look up the definition of "semantics", to stop you abusing the poor word so. You apparently have nothing of interest to say, choosing instead to evaid my points and throw around unsubstantiated allegations which change from one minute to the next without explanation. It's impossible even to have an argument with you. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>172's characterization of himself as the only one to offer a compromise is absurd. At least five users worked through numerous drafts of the intro to find one which pleased (or at least didn't offend) everyone. This includes me; I made several edits and re-edits in hopes of accommodating all concerns raised. By contrast, 172 is not willing to alter so much as one word of his intro paragraph; his <i>only</i> compromise is to add a <sup>1</sup> to his deceptive intro, where a reader can follow a link to a (poorly worded) "footnote" at the bottom of the page. Of course, if anyone's been reading this far, they already know this to be true. - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 22:02, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Need to note that Allende was not nearly as popular as claimed</span></h2>
<p>Just my 2 cents. It is deceptive to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>citing the Chilean coup as an example of U.S. intervention that went against the wishes of the local population. Powell responded: "With respect to your earlier comments about Chile in the 1970s and what happened with Mr Allende, it is not a part of American history that we're proud of." The newspapers in Chile hailed the news as the first time the U.S. Government had conceded a role in the affair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because the claim that the coup was against the wishes of the locals is not necessarily well substantiated. Allende won the election with 34% of vote, and the conservative party candidate got approximately the same percentage, the rest going to the centrist guy. So it is more likely that in fact the majority (as in more than 50%) of Chileans opposed, or at least had reservations about, Allende and his policies. And do not forget that there were very many supporters of Pinochet who demonstrated against Allende and for the coup, presumably all those 30% of the voters who supported the right wing candidate. So bottom line is, Pinochet has subverted freedom of election and democracy in Chile, but this was not somehow blanketly "against the wishes" of the people. It was for the wishes of some and against wishes of others, and this has to be properly reflected in an encyclopedia article. And as for the invasion of Iraq, hey, once again we subverted an elected leader, this time one with 100% electoral support... <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatcher_5a47.html" title="User:Watcher">Watcher</a> 00:30, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All fair points, but it's worth noting that (at least according to the election results) Allende was more popular than any of the alternatives — he had a plurality. Pinochet was apparently less popular than Allende, and if there was not a majority in favour of any candidate, the fact that Allende didn't have a majority was a weak argument for deposing him, to say the least. Of course you have pointed out a POV/factual inaccuracy issue which should definitely be addressed, I just think we should keep it in perspective. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<p>In terms of political parties, at least, Allende had two of the three traditional thirds of Chilean politics against him. Both the right (the National Party) and the center (the Christian Democratic Party) were allied against Allende, and the Christian Democracy, at that time the most important party, initially hailed the coup. They became part of the opposition after some time (months, or at most couple of years, not sure) after it became evident that the military were there to stay for a while. Also, talking about "supporters of Pinochet" at that time hides the fact that the coup was not a personal one, it was a widespread military intervention, and the fact that Pinochet was the commander in Chief of the Army at that moment was only because he was perceived to be by his predeccesor a "constitucionalist", that would not participate in a coup. Pinochet was the least political of those participating in the coup, and the the regime became highly personalized in Pinochet only after the coup. Probably (but I'm speculating here), had Pinochet been refused to join the coup, either he would have been replaced by some of his more activelly pro-coup subordinates, or there could have been a civil war between pro and against Allende forces. The regime was not only of Pinochet: even After Pinochet became "President of the Republic", burying the rotating presidency idea, all the "decrees law" that would be the only means of legislating until the constitution of 1980 had to be signed by all four commanders in chief (three commanders in chief and Director General of Carabineros, to be precise), meaning that each of them had veto power, and, in fact, they did use that power often.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AstroNomer</a> 16:24, May 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How to get this page unprotected</span></h2>
<p>Okay, we had at least some content-related discussion interspersed with the sniping, but now the primary combatants in the revert war appear to have moved on to other projects, and I don't think the discussion moved very far toward a resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p>The dispute is entirely over the introduction, so in order to remove the protection, I think it would be best to have a new introduction ready to go. That's what this page is for, to hash out proposed changes to the text. Once the new introduction is ready, it will be the first edit after unprotection, and the article can go forward from there. So I suggest that we start from scratch and have everyone work together to write the introduction over again.</p>
<p>Use the space below to work on the introduction. Please start from a blank slate, instead of working from either of the currently competing versions. No reverting allowed; if you have problems with something, rewrite it, but don't just go back to what you wrote before, because if somebody else changed it, that means they had problems with your version.

<dd>That's where we were weeks ago, before I was even involved. My rewrite already reconciled the two contending versions and cut out the excess verbiage. At any rate, I am still going to keep my positions consistent. I'd rather delete sentences than use the old "some people have said" line. And will not stand for the removal of relevent, factual content because facts hurt a Wikipedia user's feelings. Moreover, perhaps everyone has forgotten that we're supposed to be writing an encyclopedia here. Compromise between users is not a virtue in and of itself; the only relevent consideration for our purposes as editors is the quality of the article. So, I would appreciate it if people would not step in looking to cook up new schemes for mediation. We need people to step in and differentiate who's right and who's wrong on matters relating to the substance of the article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:54, 13 May 2004 (UTC)

<p>172 is correct that Michael's suggestion is where we were weeks ago before his involvement, which is why things were fine and 172 is the sole problem user on this page. We <i>did</i> go through the named process, and <i>did</i> come up with an intro that satisfied the various parties (172 dismisses this consensus-building as "partisan bickering" which he could "care less" about). But 172 will have none of it. His version must stand unaltered, and (to quote from above) if you don't like it "you'll just have to bear it", "take it or leave it". 172 is simply not interested in the Wiki process. It is because of people like him completely convinced that they are right and that there is no need to adjust to anyone else's concerns that Wikipedia has so many edit wars. There is no working with someone who insists on sole authorship; that is why the edit box warns "edited mercilessly". People like that should shape up or leave. 172 knows perfectly well he is adding "unproven" claims, but he just plays semantic games with everyone who takes time out to explain it to him. That is why I regard this as trolling, he's being inflammatory and provoking response. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 01:16, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the matter of the introduction, I think we are not that far from consensus at all.

<dd>??? How is anything I've said a "personal attack"? I have been summarizing 172's behavioral patterns using his own words. Curiously, no one seems interested when 172 calls me a "right-wing" "chauvinist U.S. nationalist" who acts on "emotional" whims and lives in a "fantasy world", or when he called me RickK's "little bitch" or said my edits were "bullshit" and "gibberish". I guess those aren't personal attacks, but instead the thoughtful reflections of a "professional historian". Sure, there are no double standards here. Anyway, what is there to disagree with in my analysis of 172's behavior? And, we are at consensus, not counting 172, who has essentially opted out of that process. As for your recent proposal, I don't like "US-backed government" for two reasons: (1) it implies somehow that the US was propping it up, and that it would have collapsed without it, and (2) mentioning the US, a foreign nation, however involved in the Chile issue they were, as the first and only modifier describing the government, gives it undue prominence; why mention this aspect among all of them? Anyway, we <i>have</i> a perfectly good intro already, which we both worked on to find an agreeable version. 172 has no substantive objection to it except for it was not written solely by his own hand. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 09:32, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I changed wording on admirers and critics to just say "some", reason being that it is redundant to note that people who say such things are admirers/critics, and so let's be concise.

And I removed mention of the general US support for a coup, reason being that that is not relevant to Pinochet at all, <i>except</i> in that it may be evidence for CIA support for the coup.

<dd>Most of the rationale for my recent edits is in the edit summaries, but I'd just like to say that I think that <i>if</i> we are going to mention the allegations that the CIA was involved in the coup, we should also mention that it was CIA policy for Allende to be overthrown by a coup (although I don't think this is quite what VV was getting at). Otherwise we risk making accusations of CIA involvement sound like a crackpot conspiracy theory (which they're not) unless the reader takes the time to read through the detailed discussion in the rest of the article. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>Perhaps, but CIA plotting to remove Allende and the subsequent US support for Pinochet not only give context to the allegations of CIA involvement in the coup, but have also been criticised in their own right. Unless we include all three objects of criticism we're telling half the story, even in an introduction summary. It gives the impression that <i>any</i> allegations of CIA/US plans to depose Allende are speculative, since no other allegations are mentioned. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>I still disagree; that's what the text is for. Justifying the allegations is not only out of scope but places way too much emphasis on <i>one</i> aspect of Augusto Pinochet, about who so much more could be said. The CIA plotting to remove Allende in 1970 has no provable connection to Pinochet whatsoever; many other groups also had abortive plots. I could have been plotting to remove him for all it matters. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 22:08, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mostly agree with you. My point is that if we mention allegations of US involvement in the coup, we should also mention other allegations (i.e. the allegations that the US/CIA supported Pinochet after the coup and had longstanding plans to overthrow Allende). It seems wrong to mention only one of these three closely connected allegations, but I'd be fine with mentioning either all or none of them. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>Okay, I guess my issue is that if we're going to mention allegations, we should only mention those connected to Pinochet, not the CIA's abandoned efforts in 1970, or mass anti-Allende advertising in 1964. I'm also of course happy not broaching this subject in the intro, and leaving just the substantial section to discuss it. Anyway, honestly, is there really a point to this?

<dd>Well US support for Pinochet's government is related to Pinochet, so perhaps we could mention that. Otherwise I agree with you, really.

<p>My changes: Change "return to democracy" to "civilian rule", because how democratic the 1980 constition is (or was before the ammendements) is subject to discussion. But the fact is, that either Pinochet won or lost, there would have been a civilian government in 1990, with a congress in place, political parties (a law for them had been already passed) and the armed forces with no responsability in the government. There was a promise of Pinochet to leave his port in the Army if "elected", to emphasize more the distiction, but I don't know if he would have stood by his promise. For the Pinochet regime, the transition period was from 1980 to 1989, when the transitory articles were valid. Nobody claimed that that period was democratic: executive power was Pinochet, and the legislative power was headed by the other commanders in chief and general director or Carabineros. But for the opposition (that became the government in the 1989 elections) the transition started then, with a 4 year presidency (created by the 1989 reforms, before that reform all perios would be 8 year ones). About the immunity: all the members of congress have immunity that means they can not be processed before a higher court strip them of immunity. This also applied to Pinochet, and he was in fact, stripped from his immnunity <i>after</i> he was arrested abroad.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AstroNomer</a> 22:30, May 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Michael Snow,</p>
<p>Veriverily is speaking about a "consensus" on the "Augusto Pinochet/intro" page among himself, Cadr, EdPoor, and AstroNomer- the users voting in the <b>minority</b> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Augusto_Pinochet#CIA_poll" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Augusto_Pinochet#CIA_poll" rel="nofollow">most recent round of polling</a>. His preferred version does not have a "consensus" behind it. As usual, he is being misleading at best. This was <i>really</i> the winning position in the poll: "Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial."

<li>To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote. All other parties have written <i>several</i> draft intros <i>each</i> to try to accommodate objections and concerns. 172 dismisses these efforts as "partisan bickering" and "bullshit". - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 22:30, 16 May 2004 (UTC)

<li>Veriverily's comments are misleading at best.

His preferred version does not have a "consensus" behind it.

The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically. Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering. Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 06:44, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Michael Snow, just to clarify the points I made which you disputed: Bringing in members is one thing, but campaigning specifically for one view <i>does</i> taint the results (you seem aware of this). As for the "no understanding of the issues", I was referring to the fact that some who voted in the poll gave reasons for their vote which showed they were wholly unaware of the ongoing discussion. For instance, giving the GWU link (which has already been cited and rebutted), claiming the US acknowledges that the CIA instigated the coup (which had been specifically contradicted by citing a CIA briefing), and saying that there is "no controversy" over it, when there clearly is. - <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:20, 18 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Veriverily, you know very well that the intro does not refer to the coup as 'U.S.-instigated,' something about which there would really be controversy.

<p><b>Yes:</b></p>

<li>By 172's own definition (see the discussion in section 10) the possible meanings of "backed" include "aided", so the word is misleading. 172 should also note that readers of this article are unlikley to look up every word they read in a dictionary, and should take the context of the word into account (as VV points out in his previous comment). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>My own definition to "back" (v) is <i>American Heritage's</i>, which is to provide support, assistance, <i><b>or</b></i> encouragement for (a contending force). It does not necessarily entail the provision of "aid." Cadr is putting words in my mouth; I said "or" as opposed to "and" when I has written the word "aid" once (very hastily). <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 11:49, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

If one possible meaning of "US-backed" is "US-supported" or "US-assisted" <i>or</i> "US-aided" (going on 172's earlier, different definition), the word is misleading.

<li>This entire debate is utter nonsense. The historical record is clear: Nixon and Kissinger wanted Allende out and the CIA went about engineering it by funding the opposition, spreading FUD, and the like. The day of the coup, the American reporter Charles Horman was in Viña del Mar, near the port of Valparaíso, which was a key base for both the Chilean coup plotters and US military and intelligence personnel who were supporting them. He spoke with several US operatives and took notes documenting the role of the United States in overthrowing the Allende government. Several days later he was arrested and executed by the Chilean armed forces. His family believes this was because he (accidently) bore witnesss the US role in the affair. 'Backing'? Yep, I'd call it backing, although perhaps we could debate how active a role the CIA et al played in the coup, but nobody is claiming that the CIA itself bombed La Moneda -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 16:03, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't going to vote on this, because I thought the poll question missed the mark. The issue isn't whether a particular wording is misleading, etc., but rather what's the best way to present the subject. I don't like the footnote. I thought the best approach was an in-text summary in the introduction, avoiding the word "backed," even though living with some nuance made for a longer intro. To that end I essayed a revision of the first-created sandbox. I tried to meet Cadr's objection to my initial version. Now, however, I find that VeryVerily has edited it so as to eviscerate any discussion of this issue in the intro.<br />
It seems, then, that each side has its own sandbox and the two sides continue to talk past each other. With regard to the intro, 172 wants a flat statement of "backed," somewhat qualified in a footnote, while VV wants a mere allusion to what "many believe," with no indication in the intro that they have any factual basis for their beliefs. <i>As between those two extremes</i> (CIA role stated as fact versus CIA role stated as mere unsupported opinion, albeit opinion of "many"), I prefer the former, although the specific wording of the footnote would need some work.<br />
I still think the footnote is, by its nature, an inelegant solution. It would be better for the text of the intro to state a few key evidentiary points, including the CIA's denial, rather than present the conclusion as an established fact. If other people agree with me, and say so and/or restore key data to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro" rel="nofollow">original intro sandbox</a>, then perhaps we have a chance of reaching consensus on that approach. Until then, I'm going to turn my attention to editing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro_(succinct_version)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet/intro_(succinct_version)" rel="nofollow">"succinct version"</a> of the intro.<br />
Finally, on the issue of recruitment: 172 did urge me to vote in this poll. I ignored his urging for the reasons stated above. I have now been "recruited" to vote by VV's edit, not by 172's electioneering. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 00:13, 20 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's your vote, but puzzling reasoning: you're not voting on the question asked in the poll. Anyway, the whole point of the sandbox is to experiment. I gave my reasons (several times) for my edits, which (perhaps ironically) largely come to succintness: the <i>intro</i> does not need to lay out the evidence, that's what the <i>article</i> for. The intro serves to summarize. Fercrissakes, look at the <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusto_Pinochet_2e33.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">article</a>, nearly <i>half</i> of which is now about the CIA. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 00:36, 20 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My vote is that the wording being polled is not misleading (the question asked in the poll) but that the wording also isn't good. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I agree that the intro should summarize, not present the whole discussion, but it involves striking a balance between, on the one hand, going into too much detail about the facts, and, on the other hand, simply saying "many believe" with no allusion whatsoever to the facts until later on. I don't think your edit version makes any attempt to strike that balance. Your version isn't a summary, it's a reference. My idea was that something taking up nearly half the article, as you put it, deserves a bit more space in the intro. I tried to put in a few critical points that would, for example, in response to SamSpade's inquiry, show that there are indeed references available, while also noting the CIA's denial and leaving the full elaboration for later in the article. My hope was that we could work out a consensus summary. Perhaps I was unduly optimistic. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 02:48, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is evidence both ways and no consensus, which makes it hard to be both neutral and succinct. In addition, as the discussion above shows, people with different opinions can see different shades of meaning in a term like "backing." Therefore, I think we're stuck with having to go into somewhat more detail about what's known. Two specific points: (1) The heavy emphasis on the CIA could give the misleading impression that the CIA was running a rogue operation; the important issue is the role of the <i>United States</i> in Pinochet's accession, not the role of the CIA, so I've added the Nixon statement. (2) My response to Cadr's edit summary: The CIA has admitted advance knowledge of the coup. From CBS's report on the documents declassified during the Clinton Administration: "The CIA had prior knowledge of the plot that overthrew Allende three years later but denies any direct involvement. CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher said, 'We were aware of coup plotting in 1973, but we did not instigate it.'" (<a href="http://cbsnews.cbs.com/stories/2000/09/11/world/main232452.shtml" class="external text" title="http://cbsnews.cbs.com/stories/2000/09/11/world/main232452.shtml" rel="nofollow">CBS News story</a> and, to the same effect, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/09/19/us.cia.chile.ap/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/09/19/us.cia.chile.ap/" rel="nofollow">CNN's story</a>) Do we need to insert a citation into the text?

<dd>That's only the nine-hundredth time (approx) Powell has been cited. He was discussed recently above.

All I was really pushing for was an indication that the CIA had <i>admitted</i> to plotting a coup — this just makes the intro sound less POV, since it shows that the assertion of CIA plotting is strongly justified. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<p>"Backing" is a very broad term. At one extreme it can be direct military involvement; at the other it can be nothing more than a speech expressing agreement with the coup. Anything in between can also be "backing". <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 17:35, 2004 May 19 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Don't be silly</span></h2>
<p>All this talk of settling the editing issues by polling and declaring "winners" is silly. As Michael pointed out (more politely!), that's not what polls are for. Well, I'm telling you that the official policy of this website is <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>If a fact or value (or anything else important) is in dispute in an article, <b>the Wikipedia is not supposed to settle the issue</b>. Rather, it <b>REPORTS WHAT THE VARIOUS SIDES SAY</b>. Sorry for shouting, but some contributors on this page just don't get it.</p>
<p>Including a phrase like "US-backed coup" <b>implies that Wikipedia endorses the view</b> that the coup was backed by the US (whatever that means or entails). Since there is CLEARLY a dispute among us contributors about whether (or how much) the US "backed the coup", the Wikipedia cannot come out and say flatly <i>that the US backed the coup</i>.</p>
<p>Rather, the article must report what various historians and other observers have said. I'd be happy to see something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>All historians, except for a few right-wing wackos, agree that the US backed the coup.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Okay, <i>wackos</i> is a bit extreme, but you know what I mean: <b>we attribute every point of view (POV) to the advocated of that POV.</b>)</p>
<p>It might be a bit more polished to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historians and others disagree over how much support the US gave to Pinochet. Joe Schmoe says the US "backed the coup by supplying arms, intelligence, money, and assurances of friendly future relations." Sam Shady, a known CIA operative, claims that the US had no part in the coup, aside from making public statements amounting to a claim that Allende was destroying the Chilean economy and driving the country toward dictatorship. (Note that these are <b>made-up examples</b> of the kinds of quotations we need to find and put into the article, so that all POV is properly attributed.) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:06, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poll results and their significance</span></h2>
<p>Is everyone in agreement that 172 has won (oops, musn't use that word...) the poll? He has been quite active in canvasing voters, but I think it's unlikely that a comparable number of people could be convinced to vote in the other direction, and this is basically a repeat of a previous poll with a similar result. I think we should now decide whether the results of this poll have any implications for the content of the intro, which is doubtful in my opinion. If some of the voters would join in the actual discussion on this page, we might really get somewhere, but so far the pattern has been that only a small number of people have participated in discussion, while a much larger number has voted (and we have no way of knowing how well informed these people are with regard to the preceding dicussion — an important issue). Surely, if Wikipedia is discussion and consensus based, the views of people who have not (yet) entered into discussion are of dubious significance. Let's finish with the poll and get some more people involved in forming a consensus.</p>
<p>(Obviously a lot of the sentiment here comes straight from Ed Poor's post, but my additional suggestion is that we close the poll now, with the results archived as they currently stand.)</p>

<dd>The poll is utterly meaningless, which is why I did not even take part. 172 recruited his ideological allies to vote, and they did. (With similar canvassing we could garner votes of our own, but no matter.) There are only one or two users I find it sad to see caring so little about NPOV, but the results change nothing. I <i>already know</i> about Wikipedia's strong political bias and don't need a poll to remind me. As has been pointed out, a similar poll on whether to include <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Mother_Teresa_e896.html" title="Criticisms of Mother Teresa">Criticisms of Mother Teresa</a> would also probably go the wrong way. And Cadr is quite correct that most of those people have not participated in the discussion; statements such as "I didn't even know this was disputed" indicate, uh..., unawareness of what is going on here. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 21:21, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd rather not get involved in personal disputes, but the idea that Wikipedia has a systematic left-wing bias is silly. There are lots of users who are on the left, and lots on the right. Different pages, and different disputes, might tilt one way or another, but the fact that pretty much everybody seems to feel that Wikipedia is biased against their POV suggests that we've got things about right, at least in terms of the big picture. As to this page as a whole, I'll have to read through the talk archives to see what points have been made, but I've really <i>never</i> seen it seriously disputed before that the US backed the coup. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 21:33, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if I may say, you seem to have a bit of a left tilt yourself, which may be why things seem "about right"&#160;:). The main complaints about systematic "right-wing bias" come from those who want to see Wikipedia look like Mao's Red Book. There are, to be sure, other strains of thought here - though outnumbered sometimes persistent - and lesser articles often reflect the bias of the last to edit them. Still, I feel conservatives "stand out" here, and the more modest even half-apologize for their views (I recall <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArk30inf_d1d1.html" title="User:Ark30inf">User:Ark30inf</a>'s old user page). Anyway, if any good comes of this mess it'll be that a few may learn that their dogmas about the US turn out to not be so straightforward as they thought. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 22:51, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't deny having something of a left tilt. At the same time, I think it is deeply unfair to say that those who complain of a right tilt want to see Wikipedia look like Mao's Little Red Book, just as it would be unfair to say that those who complain about systematic left-wing bias want Wikipedia to look like Fox News. Probably more unfair, since Fox News is more within the realm of acceptable political beliefs than Maoism. At any rate, I'd add that the left bias (such as it exists) on Wikipedia is a rather intellectual, academic leftism, for the most part, and not very similar to the agitprop of Soviet-style communism. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 00:26, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I don't doubt there is FOX News influence, but (as you note) FOX News is hardly extreme, and those who make specific accusations of such influence have largely ruined their credibility with me by accusing me of also being a FOX partisan (even the non-"Maoists", which also reflects poorly on them). Yes, "academic" leftism may more predominate here, but that's still a healthy tilt. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 00:43, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, but there's also people here who'd like to whitewash Nixon and Pinochet. FOX news certainly is extreme, so far as I can see; I suppose anyone who saw it as mainstream would probably perceive a left-wing bias in any serious political commentary. Being pretty left-wing myself, I've always perceived a right-wing bias to Wikipedia (at least on any issue involving America). I would say that there's very little "academic Xism" on Wikipedia, and a definite majority of underinformed Yism and Zism. Anyway, given that we all perceive different biases, it's probably fair to say that Wikipedia as a whole is fairly neutral, as John points out. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>The point is is that "backed" is a vague word. Everyone thinks the US backed the coup <i>in some sense</i>, but it would be easy to read the intro and get the wrong idea (e.g. that there was direct US military involvement, at one extreme). The footnote helps with this, but I don't like it because the main body of the text should be clear in the first place. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Voting on POV/NPOV issues isn't very productive in my experience. I think we should continue to work towards a solution that is acceptable to all parties. In my opinion, writing that Pinochet's <i>government</i> was backed by the US is far less ambiguous than the assertion that the coup itself was backed (which is likely correct in virtually all possible interpretations, but still to some extent unproven). Then we can do away with the footnote and discuss the details of the coup in the appropriate section in the article.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:09, May 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Encarta</i> just mentions U.S.-backing in the intro with no footnote, but let's keep the footnote as a gesture of compromise <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564829/Augusto_Pinochet.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564829/Augusto_Pinochet.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>The footnote's pretty unpopular anyway, since it's an inelegant and not particularly effective solution. Several people who have voted no in the poll have said that they don't like it.

<dd>Most of the people voting in the poll had no previous input to the page, and had not followed the previous discussion. The question was rather narrow, since it did not mention any alternatives to using "US-backed", so people could not object to your intro on grounds of style or clarity. I've explained inumerable times why the footnote is not a good idea, and even people who have voted no in the poll have said that they do not like it. All the poll does is verify that your intro is not especially misleading when the footnote is present; it is <i>not</i> a vote of confidence in your intro on any other grounds (i.e. style, clarity, etc.) If you wish to decide by poll which intro we should have, you need a new question (i.e. is <i>this</i> intro better than <i>that</i> intro?) <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Give it up. If this goes to arbitration, you wouldn't even get the footnote. This will look like a deliberate stalling attempt to everyone else. I mean, the 14 users who voted "no" sure as hell aren't going to turn around and vote for an intro reading, "many people believe the CIA had a role in the coup."

<dd>That's not necessarily the intro they'd be asked to vote for, 172. The idea that this poll is all that is required to get your intro into the article is farsical. For a start, it doesn't show that your intro is any good, all it shows is that it's <i>not misleading</i>. This side-steps the main issue — no-one has seriously suggested that the intro is especially misleading with the footnote, but plently have objected to the footnote as a means of avoiding ambiguity (why not just use unambiguous language is the first place?) It may well be the case that a majority of people would find VV's or mine or JamesMLane's intro not to be misleading if a poll were held to find out, and such polls would surely be necessary to give context to your poll. To decide on an intro for the article, we would have to have a poll between several <i>competing</i> intros. You poll is a pathetic attempt to get any kind of positive result in the hope that people will be mislead into believing it is significant. If this goes to arbitration, I expect people there will take as dim a view of your poll question and your canvasing as they have here (complaint has been quite prevalent, even amongst those who voted no). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>In 1973, after the Allende government moved to introduce Socialist ideals into the predominantly Roman Catholic education system, and after the leader of the Socialist party called for a barracks rebellion against senior officers, the military broke its tradition of being apolitical and staged a bloody coup, backed by Washington. <a href="http://www.remember-chile.org.uk/comment/00-12-31nyt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.remember-chile.org.uk/comment/00-12-31nyt.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>I think Allende had the project to create a national education system. Some wrote "in the East German way" but this could also be in the "French way". One thing that bother me is that Allende critics consider him as an evil Marxist-Leninist while for me it seems clear that Allende project was more similar to the French Socialist Party platform of the time. According to many sources François Mitterrand was very worried in 1981 about the risk of a "Chilean scenario" in France. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 21:23, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pinochet's coup was a joint force coup&#160;: a large plot involving navy, infantery, tanks and Air Force do you seriously think there could have been a "conccurent project" backed by the CIA&#160;? Even if there was at time several plots it seems like they all merged in one. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 00:47, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Nixon administration wanted to get rid of Allende they had contact with Chilean high rank officers, they had a plan for elimination of marxists or so-called marxists in South America and they had policies to destabilize Allende this is uncontroversial OK&#160;? This has to be mentioned there. I'm in favor of being precise, let's devellop the role played by the CIA and the US administration in the fall of Allende instead of writing "the CIA backed the coup". Of course nobody will never find a written order of the CIA to Pinochet, they're not so stupid. I will oppose to any formulation like "some believe than the CIA backed the coup while other believe they were gently neutral". They were not neutral and made everything they could do to bring a coup, but Pinochet was probably not simply CIA puppet. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 01:54, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that there is some truth in this. The CIA did have a hand in the coup against Allende, but to what extent is uncertain. With that said, I also beleive that there would have been a coup with or without CIA involvement. The only thing the CIA did was ensure Allende's groupies would not win the coup. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 14:38, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

But since this is a Wiki, not a religious text, I'm afraid you must be content to let the vulgar masses trample on your tasteful and factually pure edits from time to time. The phrase "US-backed" is controversial, because although the US undoubtably supported some kind of coup to depose Allende, there is no clear evidence that they supported <i>the actual coup that happened</i>. It is not your rewriting of the intro that we object to (as you well know), but your insistence that the highly controversial and not-entirely-factual phrase "Us-backed" be included in it, despite the detailed discussion of the various POVs in the rest of the article. Your callous attitude to the discussion between other Wikipedians ("and I could care less") shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the Wikipeida project.

It does not detract from the person Pinochet (and in any case, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> allows for two paragraphs of intro text, so we can easily add more material here).

<p>The implications of the intro that I keep restoring imply don't imply anything that isn't implied by the "compromise" version. For example, "U.S.-backed" does not imply, e.g., "U.S.-orchestrated," "U.S.-engineered," "U.S.-planned," "U.S.-plotted." In other words, it does not delineate the extent and scope of U.S. backing in and of itself. I have one question, though. Is the meaning of "U.S.-backed" is commonly misunderstood among people for whom English is not a native language? If so, I wasn't aware. If this happens to be the case, I'm willing to work around it. A footnote would be the proper course of action, not an off topic tangent in the intro. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:32, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The footnote just duplicates material which is discussed in detail in an existing section.

<dl>
<dd>OK, (now 172 has reverted my edits — which is fair enough I suppose). I think that what 172 means by "US-backed" is factually accurate and NPOV, but I think the phrase, as used in the current intro, makes it sound too much like the US-supported Pinochet directly. The footnote helps with this, but the intro should be self-contained — you shouldn't have to read a big section of the main article in order to understand what it means. This is why I favour keeping any reference to the US out of the intro altogether (unless the intro is considerably expanded, as per Eloquence's edits). However,, I'm perfectly happy to accept a reference to the US in a shorter intro if some slightly less ambiguous phrasing can be found. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>Oops, didn't quite see that there was now a footnote rather than a link to an article section.

<dd>The intro is straightforward and accurate, two polls affirmed the intro, and there's even a compromise note to prevent misunderstanding. The disputes should be brought to an end now.

<dd>This 172-intro is insufficient.

<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with the intro before 172 started trolling. The "wordiness" was a red herring; an article this length can afford a few dozen words in the intro, in complete sentences (you know, with verbs). The only questionable part was that relating to the US and the coup; this already has a gigantic section, and we do not need to take sides in the intro. The footnote is particularly ridiculous, when there is an <i>article</i> which says the same thing. The version we'd worked out gives a clear, concise, neutral description of Pincohet's rise, rule, fall, and perceived legacy. A new version of the short note about the US has been put in; the reader can read more later about it in the extensive coverage. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 02:05, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC) (This comment was added after edit conflict with Ruhrjung.)</p>

<p>Well, the intro does need to mention the US support prominently - that is one condition on my end for a compromise. Whether this is in form of a short version with note, or a more verbose one without one, I do not care.

<dd>That is very definitely your POV, which I equally definitely do not share. But this is not what about what either of us think. That's why I favor the language noting a "relationship" with the US. The details and points of view on that complex relationship can then be addressed later. As I've noted, I don't even see the need to mention the US at all so early on (this is about Chile, mostly), but if it must be there, it should not presume any one person's opinion. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 04:19, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the term "backed" is perfectly factual -- we've been through the <i>proven</i> ways in which the US supported deposing Allende and supported Pinochet afterwards, and "backed", with a footnote explaining what that means in this context seems like a short way to express this. "Relationship", on the other hand, is unnecessarily ambiguous, because we <i>know</i> a lot more than this phrase suggests. Again, alternative suggestions are welcome, but a brief summary of what is currently mostly in the "CIA role" section needs to be in the intro; a good <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> should summarize all key aspects of an article, and this is one of them.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 04:28, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, a comrpomise with two parties is not good enough. We need to try to find a compromise with <i>all</i> parties. VV and Ruhrjung would prefer an intro which gives more details on Pinochet's rule. I have tried to reconcile this with the desire for a short intro by abridging their additions.

Is the first paragraph OK? I presume your main problem is the second paragraph, i.e. the NPOV characterization of views of supporters and critics.

<dd>(Re recent alterations.) What's wrong with the language I had about "support for his government"?

<dd>Well, if your only complaint is that it is <i>redundant</i>, then I think we are firmly in NPOV territory&#160;;-).

<dd>Surely you've seen the weeks' worth of discussion, and how little fruit it's brought with 172, who dismisses all criticisms and says it's "too bad" if you don't like his version. I and several other users have worked out consensus versions of the intro, but 172 will only tolerate his own. I <i>do</i> consider this trolling; he is deliberately adding inflammatory misinformation over several users' wishes, knowing it will provoke a response; that is virtually the definition. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 00:16, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sympathetic, and I'm not saying that this situation is your fault. But the simple truth is that when we've got to the point where we've had three near-identical revert wars, it's clear that there's going to have to be more discussion. I agree your intro was based on a consensus, but it was by no means supported by <i>everyone</i> except 172. We could at least try to hash out something that everyone except 172 thought was acceptable, although obviously a true consensus would be preferable. A few more points...
<ul>
<li>172 may or may not be trolling. Either way, saying that he is isn't going to help.</li>
<li>Your two intros are (if you stand back a bit) virtually identical. It's completely crazy that the difference between them could cause this much animosity. I'm not sure that anyone even disagrees on the basic facts (i.e. we all accept that there's no inconteastible proof of US support for Pinochet's actual coup, even though there definitely was support for <i>a</i> coup.)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page protected</span></h2>
<p>VeryVerily and 172, I've protected the page and added a protection note after, since I kept getting edit conflicts. I don't even know which version I protected since the reversions were coming so quickly, so I hope no one accuses me of protecting <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">The Wrong Version</a>. I didn't even notice the edit war at first because I just happened to get the same editor and edit summary three times in a row.

<dd>Surely you've noticed the asymmetry between our handling of the situation, impartial though you may wish to be? All partisans worked out an intro that was mutually tolerable. The reverting started when 172 refused to accept any other than his own. You must be aware by now of 172's tactics; recall this is someone who told you to "fuck off" not a few weeks ago. If I thought there was any credible Wikipedia apparatus for ending the madness on this page, I would take it. But I have tried them all - consensus building, third-party admins, RfC pages, quickpolls - without avail. (Okay, except mediation, which I have, as I <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EEloquence_b8a8.html" title="User talk:Eloquence">promised</a>, been reading up on, but remain doubtful of.) It seems when dealing with the likes of 172 one must use equal force if one's edits are to not be consigned to the dustbin of page history as soon as they are submitted. (I should also note I generally do back off a bit if even modest signs of possible good faith compromise appear, as I did earlier today on the Soviet history page.) -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:38, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Impartiality is a tricky notion here, when it was "impartiality" in the form of consensus and POV-balancing that produced the consensus intro I now defend.

I am a bit at a loss as to what to say about the content that I and others have not said already, mostly unanswered.

<p>What's there to discuss? VeryVerily and I share absolutely no common ground, so I doubt that he'll ever be able to stop snipping at me. We simply hold fundamentally incompatible conceptions of NPOV. He demands that the text pay lip service to his narrow, knee jerk, rightwing Americentric worldview, irrespective of whether or not it bears any relationship with realit, whereas I could care less. This has been patently obvious on this page, where he has been demanding for months that the introduction not contextualize the 1973 coup, regardless of my attempts to enumerate a reality with which he is uncomfortable, and again regardless of my efforts to promote a footnote to check the possibilities of readers' misconstruing the scope of U.S. involvement. In contrast, my view of NPOV is more epistemological than emotional. I favor linking the actions and motives of historical actors to the social/economic/political context in which action occurred, and a narrative voice inclined to reserve moral judgments. Hence, in this particular context, I favor a concise and factual intro, consigning the partisan rhetoric to history, in other words to a matter of agency, which was bound together in struggle <i>historically</i> in which this ideological contention emerged. I am **not** concerned with the circular arguments of the people squabbling still over whether or not the '73 coup was justified, and whether or not Pinochet's a "good guy" or a "bad guy" in the context of the values of U.S. political culture. And BTW, notice that my intro skirts a number of can of worms usually opened up by leftwing users in order to take shots at the legitimacy of Pinochet's regime. The page history attests that I have also stood in the way of users attempting to cast him as mythical villain, who scrapped a 'democratically elected government' in favor of a 'brutal tyranny.' Instead, why not look at this coup, say, as a part of broader political pattern in South America in the 1960s and 1970s, which saw military takeovers reverse in Brazil (1964), Argentina (1966), Chile (1973), Uruguay (1973), and Argentina again in 1976 (civilian rule was restored in 1973)?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm being too pedantic for the purposes of Wikipedia, but I think that if users want to pit a mythical villain against a romanticized savior of Chile, they can wrangle over this in the legacy section. But why not stay straightforward and factual in the intro? Speaking for myself, when I'm referring to an encyclopedia, I'm looking for an informative, factual write-up, as opposed to seeking some reaffirmation of a mythology that I find reassuring. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:55, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fail to see how your intro is any more "factual" than the current (protected) one. Calling other people's views "mythologies" is one particular point of view, it is not <i>the truth</i>. NPOV is the balance of different views, some of which may be mythological, some of which may be factual. NPOV is <i>not</i> a "middle ground", that is a common misconception (the middle ground is itself a POV which must be treated like any other), and it is also not the avoidance of controversy. As for the argument of conciseness, I have already addressed this. <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> very much allows for an intro of the present length.
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that NPOV is a "middle ground" - that would be even worse than what VeryVerily's promoting. I'm just stressing historical context and scholarly consensus, but perhaps I should just drop that. I guess that this comes with too many nuances to be promoted on Wiki, and it's way too easy to be read as a straw man. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:30, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erik, read this paragraph: He is widely considered a brutal military dictator responsible for severe human rights violations and social decay. The support by the United States for Pinochet's government has also been the target of substantial criticism, and many believe the CIA had a role in the 1973 coup. Pinochet's admirers regard him as a great modernizer who staved off communism and rescued the faltering economy (the "Miracle of Chile"). <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:48, 8 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>There is little to say in response to 172. His charge that what I've written seeks to "pay lip service to his narrow, knee jerk, rightwing Americentric worldview" is too absurd to even comment on, as anyone who has read the intro can see. 172 believes that his view and his view alone is the only right one so there is simply no need to balance with other views, which is not the NPOV policy I know. Furthermore, he wants to erase the brief summary of Pinochet's legacy, but this is crucial information for someone who wants to learn about the person in question. What "many people believe" today about him is an important part of it. Worst here of course is his disrespect of consensus, the essence of Wiki; he has the last word on what <i>the</i> historical content and meaning of Pinochet is, and no dissent will be brooked. Here, he wants to flatly assert the unsubstantiated <i>US-backed</i> part, offering only a superscripted <i>1</i> to say what could be said with a few words in the intro, attached to a modifier which on its face pushes a POV, disclaimer or no. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 21:35, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>United States support for Pinochet</li>
<li>human rights violations</li>
<li>"Miracle of Chile"</li>
</ul>
<p>These are, in my opinion, the things most remembered about Pinochet. An intro that satisfies these criteria is fine with me. Beyond that, I am willing to make compromises to keep the peace on the article if they do not hurt its factuality.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 20:54, May 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>FWIW, I agree with Eloquence's suggestions for what should be in the intro, and I don't think VV's intro was anywhere near as POV as 172 made out. Doesn't look like we're going to get much sensible discussion on this, though. Perhaps a very short intro like the one I introduced temporarily would at least be able to gain a consensus, even if everyone agreed it wasn't as informative as it should be. Until VV and 172 kiss and make up I'm not sure I can see an alternative.

<dd>FWIW (and if you'll forgive me belaboring the point, what we think is apparently not worth anything), sarcasm aside, Eloquence's list is fine. I still think US support is a bit off the path - it's not mentioned in the intro to, say, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> - but it's okay as long as the intro does not also say Pinochet is pure evil and the text provides for understanding the US's policy choices in context (Eloquence sees no/little moral grey here, of course, but others do). The US-coup allegation remains a sticky point, and none of my tries (e.g., "support for Pinochet's government" w/o specifics) for anything short of what's there now seemed to gain consensus acceptance. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 12:34, 9 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, it's nice reading something by VV that isn't an attack on me for a change. Anyway, while I agree with everything in the above paragraph , I'd like to add that I don't see a "sticky point" in my intro, which doesn't misconstrue the scope of U.S. involvement in the coup ('backing' does not mean 'orchestrated' or 'deciding factor'), and even includes a footnote to check the possibilities of confusion. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:18, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think US-backed is a bit misleading, 172. It does imply (to me at least) that the particular coup which actually happened was materially supported by the US. This may well have been the case, but we can't be sure. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></p>

I understand that what 172 means by "US-backed" is uncontroversial, but it's a sad truth that words don't always mean quite what people want them to. We're not lying. To a lot of people, "US-backed" strongly implies "US-aided/organized", and that's the only reason I want it changed (because there is no conclusive evidence that the US aided/organized a coup <i>specifically with the intention of bringing Pinochet to power</i>).

<dd>Re the footnote, I just think it's silly, sorry. There's plenty of room in the intro for a proper explanation, and a footnote rather implies that the intended meaning of "US-backed" is some minor side-issue.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, the footnote is silly. But it's even sillier to insist that factual content be kept out of the article because someone states that hypothetically someone else could be under the <b>wrong</b> impression that a single word means something that it does not. So, in order to compromise with Veriverily's extremely silly stance, I am offering a somewhat less silly footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:16, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point is that your interpretation of "US-backed" is not the only sensible interpretation. It is not that it might <i>hypothetically</i> be misinterpreted by some deliberately contrary fool; it is <i>actually</i> unclear what it means. To me, the word "US-backed" implies quite strongly "US-organized". We should either drop the issue of US support from the intro altogether, or have a full explanation. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>Well, my "interpretation" is the only one that fits the dictionary definition(s). Yes, 'U.S. backing' and 'U.S. planning' are not mutually exclusive, but you still cannot infer things that are not within the confines of the definition(s) of "backing," which **does not** in and of itself imply anything else without further information. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:56, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The word "US-backed" is not in the dictionary. I am a native English speaker, so is VV; our opinions of what it means matter.

<dd>Language is a tricky matter. But facts and the meaning of words are all we have to go on here, so I'll continue to hold that a factual summation of history takes precedence over Veriverily's feelings and chauvinist U.S. nationalist jingoism. BTW Cadr, can <i>you</i> think of a word that's less commonly 'misunderstood' than "backing" to go in its place? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:06, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be missing my point. Your summation of history is not factual because "US-backed" does not convey your intended meaning to a lot of people (including myself).

<dd>The footnote, as I've said before, is silly — we should just have a full explanation in the intro or drop the matter entirely. You didn't bring up my political affiliations, you brought up VV's (I said "people's poltical affiliations", not "<i>my</i> political affiliations").

<dd>BTW, you still have not presented any evidence as to your claim that users will see "U.S.-backed" but think "U.S.-installed."

<dd>The adjective "X-backed" is extemely vague. In the context, with no supplementary information, it appears to many people (for example to me and VV) that the intro is suggesting the US supported Pinochet directly. "US-supported" is worse than "US-backed", it seems to imply that the US organized the coup to some degree (which as I've said before, may well have been the case, but there is not any very strong evidence for it). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>No, the intro is saying that the U.S. backed <i>the coup</i>. You could claim that you think that it is suggesting anything, and thus you have reason to make any ridiculous demand you want. These misunderstandings are much more "silly" than the footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 23:29, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The adjective "X-backed" is extremely vague; its meaning varies greatly with context. Let's take a look at the pragmatics of "US-backed coup" in your intro to the article. It's a short intro, so the reader will naturally assume that only important information is in it. Now, if "US-backed" is being used in the limited sense of "desired" or "sought-for", the fact that the coup was "US-backed" in this sense would not be particularly remarkable — the US was bound to prefer one or other of the governments, and unless they provided some kind of material support to the coup, it's not overwhelmingly interesting who their preferred ruler of Chile was. So the reader might well conclude that "US-backed" was being used to mean "materially supported by the US", or something like that. Given that there is not any conclusive evidence that the US materially supported <i>the coup</i>, only that they desired and fermented <i>a coup</i>, the intro is a little misleading. I find your statement that "You could claim that you think that it is suggesting anything, and thus you have reason to make any ridiculous demand you want." rather rude. If you refuse to believe anything I say, I don't see how we can have a grown-up discussion. The word "US-backed" gives a misleading impression to me and several others, <i>honestly</i>. The footnote clears up the ambiguity, but its silly to cause unnecessary confusion and then clear it up with a footnote — why not just extend the intro to avoid confusion in the first place? (Note: this does <i>not</i> mean adopting VV's intro as it stands, since it has little more of a consensus that yours or mine.) <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Well, if cognitive dissonance is causing you not to understand things you read, that's none of my business. After all, I'm a historian, not a psychologist. I offered you a footnote (which <i>Encarta</i> doesn't even bother with) - take it or leave it. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:06, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There you go, being needlessly rude again. Look, this is Linguistics 101. Words can have (very) different meanings depending on their context. Not everyone will interpret a sentence you wrote the way you intended. This does not mean that they have cognitive dissidence (I think you mean "dissonance", btw) or that they are living in a world of make-believe. Personally, I think the problem is that nature of US support for the coup is too complex to be summarised accurately by a single adjective. As I said, if you refuse to believe that I am not a retard, and that I am not being deliberately difficult in my reading of your intro, we can't have a sensible dicussion. Maybe if you'd explain what was incorrect or misguided in my previous post, we could.

<dd>I was typing too fast for my own good, being rushed for a meeting. That's what I meant. Anyway, we're not just dealing with any context, but the context of what the word means in this intro (which I'm sure everyone has read many times over and in the context of the footnote). I can't help it if people can't read, but the intro in question does not state that the U.S. provided backing to Pinochet, that the U.S. was in control of the situation, that the U.S. role was the deciding factor, and that the U.S. initiated the coup. You are being deliberately difficult in your reading of the intro; you'd be able to use the same argument to raise objections about anything posted in any intro. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:54, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
