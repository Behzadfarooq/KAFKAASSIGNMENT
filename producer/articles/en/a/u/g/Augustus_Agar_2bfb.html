<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Agar_2bfb.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Augustus Agar was born in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandy.html" title="Kandy">Kandy</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/y/Ceylon.html" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>. He was the thirteenth child of John Shelton Agar, an Irishman from Woodmont, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Kerry_4b36.html" title="County Kerry">County Kerry</a> who had left his native land in 1860 to become a successful tea planter in Ceylon. Agar's mother, who was an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a>, died shortly after his birth and at the age of eight he was sent with one of his brothers to school in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. His father died in 1902 of <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cholera.html" title="Cholera">cholera</a> which he contracted during a visit to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>.</p>
<p>Augustus (Gus) Agar attended <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framlingham_College_73e3.html" title="Framlingham College">Framlingham College</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffolk.html" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. He was now without parents or a fixed home and his oldest brother, Shelton, determined that he should go into the Navy. Gus, who idolized his older brother, willingly agreed. To prepare he attended Eastman's naval academy in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southsea.html" title="Southsea">Southsea</a>.</p>
<p>A friend of the family, Sir Henry Jackson, later an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">admiral</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Sea_Lord_a058.html" title="First Sea Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, nominated Agar for a spot in the annual intake of cadets. After time spent with a "crammer", he passed the entrance exams and in 1904 joined the naval cadet school, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_%281860%29_58d5.html" title="HMS Prince of Wales (1860)">HMS <i>Britannia</i></a>, at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth%2C_Devon_614e.html" title="Dartmouth, Devon">Dartmouth</a>, England. The <i>Britannia</i> was a wooden <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_of_war.html" title="Man of war">man of war</a>, obsolete when launched in 1860, and soon tied up and used as a stationary training ship.</p>
<p>As a part of his training, Agar went to sea in the 5,650 ton second class <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruiser</a>, HMS <i>Highflyer</i>, and afterwards on the slightly older HMS <i>Isis</i>. These ships were stationed at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and many classes were held ashore when the ships were in port. Agar had many pleasant memories of sports, swimming, boating and picnics during this period.</p>
<p>Agar served at sea in a number of ships in the prewar period, including the battleships <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_%281902%29_0eae.html" title="HMS Prince of Wales (1902)">HMS <i>Prince of Wales</i></a> attached to the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Fleet_37ed.html" title="Mediterranean Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a>, and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Queen_%281902%29_8f19.html" title="HMS Queen (1902)">HMS <i>Queen</i></a> with Captain (later Admiral) <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beatty%2C_1st_Earl_Beatty_879a.html" title="David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty">David Beatty</a> in command. He greatly admired Beatty's dash and style.</p>
<p>Agar's early training gave him a thorough grounding in basic naval matters, especially in handling small boats. This was to prove a great asset later in his career. In 1910 Gus passed his seamanship examination with flying colours and was made an acting <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-Lieutenant_1947.html" title="Sub-Lieutenant">sub-Lieutenant</a>. During 1911 he served aboard a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a>, HMS Ruby. He spent the next period on course at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and studying at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Naval_College_ab55.html" title="Royal Naval College">Royal Naval College</a> at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich.html" title="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, England. He was promoted <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>.</p>
<p>After his courses were complete, Agar was assigned to small ships, his first being <i>Torpedo Boat No. 23</i>. In April 1913 he was sent to learn to fly. It was not entirely his metier, though he obtained his license after enduring three crashes in the very primitive aircraft of the time. He joined the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-dreadnought.html" title="Pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> battleship, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hibernia_%281905%29_984f.html" title="HMS Hibernia (1905)">HMS <i>Hibernia</i></a>, in September 1913, attached to the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Fleet_3928.html" title="Home Fleet">Home Fleet</a>.</p>
<p>During this period, Agar became a gunnery expert.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Agar_2bfb.html" title="Edit section: World War One: The Grand Fleet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War One: The Grand Fleet</span></h3>
<p>Agar was aboard the <i>Hibernia</i> when <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> broke out and soon sailed with her to Britain's then secret wartime base at <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapa_Flow_fccf.html" title="Scapa Flow">Scapa Flow</a>.

<p>As newer and faster <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreadnought.html" title="Dreadnought">dreadnoughts</a> joined the fleet, the pre-dreadnoughts became increasingly obsolete, being slower, with much less firepower and poor design features. <i>Hibernia</i> and her sisters of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edward_VII_class_battleship_e079.html" title="King Edward VII class battleship">King Edward VII class battleships</a> had their secondary 6" guns placed too low in the water, where they were liable to be submerged in all but the calmest seas.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1915 it was decided to send <i>Hibernia</i> out to the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dardanelles.html" title="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> to provide gunnery support to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied.html" title="Allied">Allied</a> landings on the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> peninsula. She arrived in September 1915 at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> base at <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudros.html" title="Mudros">Mudros</a> on the Greek island of <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemnos.html" title="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> at the entrance to the straits leading to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sea_23fa.html" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>.</p>
<p>The sheltered waters of the <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegean_Sea_b508.html" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and the straits enabled Hibernia to use all her guns and she was employed in firing at <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Turkish</a> targets on Gallipoli and the nearby <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a> shore. She was hit once by a Turkish shell, but not seriously damaged.</p>
<p><i>Hibernia</i> returned to Britain when the Allies evacuated Gallipoli and was stationed at <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosyth.html" title="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> with others of her class to guard against raids on the British coast by German ships. Because of their slow speed and weak offensive power, the pre-dreadnought battleships were not ordered to join the Grand Fleet for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Jutland_e65a.html" title="Battle of Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>, though they got up steam pending the outcome of the engagement.</p>

<p>After Jutland the battleship threat from Germany receded somewhat and the danger from mines and submarines grew. Especially vulnerable were the two ports of <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murmansk.html" title="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkhangelsk.html" title="Arkhangelsk">Arkhangelsk</a> in North <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> used by British merchant ships bringing war materials to their ally. Mine sweeping <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trawlers.html" title="Trawlers">trawlers</a> were sent out to counter this threat and two old <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruisers.html" title="Cruisers">cruisers</a> were modified to act as repair workshops and headquarters for this <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flotilla.html" title="Flotilla">flotilla</a>. Agar joined one of them, HMS Iphigenia, in December 1916, as <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_officer.html" title="Executive officer">executive officer</a>. The <i>Iphigenia</i> dated from 1892 and displaced 3,400 tons and her early days could make 20 knots.</p>
<p><i>Iphigenia</i> arrived at Murmansk in March 1917, just as the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a> was beginning. She operated out of Archangel in the summer when the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Sea_8776.html" title="White Sea">White Sea</a> was clear, and from the ice free Murmansk in the winter. Although it was apparent to local Allied commanders that the war material landed after the spring of 1917 was not being put to good use, their advice to stop the flow was ignored by <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehall.html" title="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>. Indeed much of the material was either destroyed or ended up being used by the Bolsheviks or the Germans.</p>
<p>While at Murmansk, Agar had the opportunity to renew acquaintance with Russian officer friends from the cruiser <a href="../../../a/s/k/Askold.html" title="Askold">Askold</a>, which was berthed alongside. He had served with them in the Dardanelles, when he was on the HMS <i>Hibernia</i>. He met them again at the <a href="../../../h/m/n/HMNB_Devonport_1d25.html" title="HMNB Devonport">Devonport dockyard</a>. But, mutiny soon broke out on the <i>Askold</i>, and Agar was shocked to see his officer friends arrested one by one and taken ashore, not to be seen again. Discipline aboard the ship broke down completely, and after the last of the food and supplies were consumed, she was abandoned to rust away.</p>
<p>This difficult and occasionally dangerous mission occupied the <i>Iphigenia</i> until the end of February 1918, when worsening conditions and a hostile Bolshevik government prompted a withdrawal. The British were able to take away with them a number of Russians fleeing the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>The Russian experience was of value to Agar later in his career.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Agar_2bfb.html" title="Edit section: Coastal motor boats">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coastal motor boats</span></h3>
<p>Agar served in coastal motor boats (CMB's) in home waters during the latter part of the war. These small vessels displaced just 5 tons compared to the 1,110 tons of a World War One era <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a>. Their main offensive weapon was a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedo</a>. They were of shallow draught and could operate close inshore.</p>
<p>The CMB's carried one or two torpedoes, depending on whether they were "forty footers" or "fifty-five footers". Mines could be substituted for torpedoes and they also carried <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charges</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_gun.html" title="Lewis gun">Lewis guns</a>. It was planned that they be either towed or carried into battle on the German coast by the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_cruiser.html" title="Light cruiser">light cruisers</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore.html" title="Commodore">Commodore</a> Sir <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Tyrwhitt_a118.html" title="Reginald Tyrwhitt">Reginald Tyrwhitt</a>'s <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harwich.html" title="Harwich">Harwich Force</a>. With their shallow draught they could skim over the mines and attack the German patrol craft around <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heligoland.html" title="Heligoland">Heligoland</a>. As 1918 wore on a more ambitious scheme matured, to send the CMB's in over the shallow coastal waters to attack the German fleet at its anchorage. But the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">Armistice</a> occurred on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> before these plans could be put into effect.</p>
<p>It was as torpedo and mining officer that Augustus Agar was selected for this service. He participated in the famous <a href="../../../z/e/e/Zeebrugge_Raid_a8e6.html" title="Zeebrugge Raid">raid on Zeebrugge</a> led by Commodore <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Keyes_f23c.html" title="Roger Keyes">Roger Keyes</a>, CMB's being used to lay smoke screens outside the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_%28architecture%29.html" title="Mole (architecture)">mole</a> to cover the escape of the crews of the blockships.

He was asked in late 1918 by Sir George <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mansfield_Smith-Cumming_8b67.html" title="Mansfield Smith-Cumming">Mansfield Smith-Cumming</a>, head of the foreign section of the British <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Intelligence_Service_e82b.html" title="Secret Intelligence Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a>, to volunteer for a mission in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> where Coastal Motor Boats (CMBs) were to be used to ferry British agents back and forth from <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> Russia. The shallow draught and high speed of the CMB made it ideal for landing on enemy occupied shores and making a quick getaway. Two of the chief British agents in Russia were Sir Paul Dukes and <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Reilly_27cf.html" title="Sidney Reilly">Sidney Reilly</a>. During this time Agar and his two boats were technically under the command of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Office_36ed.html" title="Foreign Office">Foreign Office</a>.</p>
<p>Agar set up a small base at <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terijoki.html" title="Terijoki">Terijoki</a> just inside Finland, close to the Soviet frontier. From here he undertook secret missions to drop off and retrieve British agents on the coast of the Bay of Petrograd. To do this his boats had to cross Bolshevik minefields and pass by a number of forts and ships guarding the entrance to the Bolshevik naval base at <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt.html" title="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> and to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrograd.html" title="Petrograd">Petrograd</a>, now <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_adeb.html" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>.</p>
<p>Also operating in the eastern Baltic Sea was a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> detachment of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_cruisers.html" title="Light cruisers">light cruisers</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyers.html" title="Destroyers">destroyers</a> under Admiral Sir <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Cowan_9c17.html" title="Walter Cowan">Walter Cowan</a>. Though technically not connected, Agar regularly reported to Cowan and received assistance from him. Cowan's mission was to keep the sea lanes open to the new republics of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> which were under threat of being overrun by Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>On their missions Agar and his crews dressed in civilian clothes, to maintain the fiction that Britain was not involved. They had a uniform on board in case they were in danger of capture. Without the uniform, they could be shot as spies, though it probably would not have made much difference to the <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheka.html" title="Cheka">Cheka</a></i>, the Bolshevik <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_police.html" title="Secret police">secret police</a>.</p>
<p>Agar felt that his small force should be doing more than acting as a shuttle service. The Bolsheviks had seized much of the Russian fleet at <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt%2C_Russia_5917.html" title="Kronstadt, Russia">Kronstadt</a>, and Agar considered these vessels a menace to British operations and took it upon himself to attack the enemy battleships.</p>
<p>He set out with his two boats, <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Coastal_Motor_Boat_4_3467.html" title="HM Coastal Motor Boat 4">HM Coastal Motor Boat 4</a> and another, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">17 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. One had to turn back before completing its mission but Agar continued into the bay. The battleships were not in the harbour though. CMB4 penetrated a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> screen and was closing on a larger warship further inshore when CMB4, whose hull had been damaged by gunfire, broke down. She had to be taken alongside a breakwater to do repairs and for 20 minutes was in full view of the enemy. The attack was then resumed and a Russian <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruiser</a>, the 6,645 ton <i><a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg.html" title="Oleg">Oleg</a></i> was sunk, after which Lieutenant Agar retired to the safety of the open bay under heavy fire. For this he was awarded the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a> Agar was promoted to <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Commander_7c33.html" title="Lieutenant Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">30 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>.</p>
<p>Realizing the utility of the CMB's, Cowan ordered a number more sent out from England to add to his fleet.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">18 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, Agar took his remaining boat against the Russians, acting as guide-ship to a flotilla of six others, leading them through the minefields and past the forts. Agar's boat was ordered to stay outside the harbour, and the attack was lead by Commander <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Dobson_b8fc.html" title="Claude Dobson">Claude Dobson</a>. They entered Kronstadt harbour, this time sinking two battleships, the 23,360 ton <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">dreadnought</a> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship_Petropavlovsk_%281914%29_46cd.html" title="Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)"><i>Petropavlovsk</i></a> and the 17,400 ton <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-dreadnought.html" title="Pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Pervozvanny_class_31c7.html" title="Andrei Pervozvanny class"><i>Andrei Pervozvanny</i></a>, both of which were subsequently salvaged, and a submarine depot ship, the 6,734 ton <i>Pamiat Azova</i>.</p>
<p>For his part in this action Agar was awarded the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">DSO</a>.

<p>The British naval presence in the Baltic Sea was crucial to <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonian_War_of_Independence_c800.html" title="Estonian War of Independence">securing the independence of Estonia and Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>Immediately following his Baltic experiences, Agar returned to Osea Island. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> he married the 19th Baroness Furnivall.</p>
<p>Agar held a number of sea going commands between the wars. His first, in June 1920 was as <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_officer.html" title="Executive officer">executive officer</a> aboard <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Chatham_a1e2.html" title="HMS Chatham">HMS Chatham</a>, a 5,400 ton <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_cruiser.html" title="Light cruiser">light cruiser</a> assigned to the newly formed <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> Navy. In 1922 he was given command of HMS Philomel, an obsolete cruiser of 2,575 tons used as a training ship for the New Zealand Navy. These were very happy years for Agar, in a friendly country with interesting work and regular cruises through the South Seas.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, at the request of King <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V</a>, Agar was appointed captain of the Royal Yacht HMS Victoria and Albert, another pleasant duty. He served until January, 1925.</p>
<p>A great professional assignment in April, 1926 was command of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. The commander in chief, Admiral Sir <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Keyes_f23c.html" title="Roger Keyes">Roger Keyes</a>, specifically asked for Agar. Keyes was an outstanding leader and brought the fleet to the height of its efficiency. The Flotilla consisted of four ships, and Agar commanded the flotilla leader HMS Witch. He served here until July 1927.</p>
<p>By the late 1920's Agar and his wife were living apart and they divorced in 1931. This probably had an adverse effect on his chances for promotion, keeping him from reaching flag rank.</p>
<p>After these assignments, Agar was on course and on shore duty for several years, including a stint as naval advisor to the New Zealand Delegation to the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Naval_Conference_c0ad.html" title="London Naval Conference">London Naval Conference</a> of 1930.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, Agar was placed in command of the <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloop.html" title="Sloop">sloop</a> <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Scarborough_6d28.html" title="HMS Scarborough">HMS Scarborough</a> attached to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_and_West_Indies_Squadron_6411.html" title="North America and West Indies Squadron">North America and West Indies Squadron</a>. During this time he married Ina Margaret Lindner in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, a union which lasted the rest of his life. He served aboard the <i>Scarborough</i> until September 1932.</p>
<p>Other seagoing commands followed, first in early 1936 aboard the 4,190 ton anti aircraft cruiser HMS Curlew, part of the reserve fleet at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nore.html" title="Nore">Nore</a>. Then, from <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> he commanded his favourite ship, the 7,300 ton light cruiser <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Emerald_dc6a.html" title="HMS Emerald">HMS Emerald</a>, at 35 knots, with her sister, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Enterprise_%28D52%29_760b.html" title="HMS Enterprise (D52)">HMS <i>Enterprise</i></a>, the fastest ships in the Royal Navy.</p>
<p><i>Emerald</i> was attached to the East India Station from January 1937 to July 1938. Agar then served as Captain of The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Naval_College_ab55.html" title="Royal Naval College">Royal Naval College</a> at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich.html" title="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, England, but with war in the offing he was returned to command of the Emerald in the summer of 1939.</p>

<p>When war began on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> Agar was in command of the <i>Emerald</i> and, as in 1914, was directed to <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapa_Flow_fccf.html" title="Scapa Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. His ship was soon ordered onto the "Northern Patrol", between the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faroe_Islands_62a3.html" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a> and <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> to intercept any German merchant ships trying to make it back to their homeland. A second duty was to stop neutral ships and check for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraband.html" title="Contraband">contraband</a> headed for Germany.</p>
<p>In October 1939 <i>Emerald</i> sailed for <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a> with five tons of gold bullion from the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_England_ea3c.html" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a>, bound for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> to pay for war materials.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in Halifax, <i>Emerald</i> was assigned to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Atlantic_0bb4.html" title="North Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convoy.html" title="Convoy">convoy</a> escort duty. Since the <i>Emerald</i> had been designed and equipped for work in gentler climates this was very uncomfortable as well as dangerous duty. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Red_Cross_b5ed.html" title="Canadian Red Cross">Canadian Red Cross</a> provided a large supply of warm clothes for the crew.</p>
<p>Among the convoys <i>Emerald</i> escorted was the first Canadian Troop Convoy, in November, 1939, when 7,500 troops reached Britain without incident. Convoy duty continued through the bitter winter of 1939/40. Agar's tour of duty as captain of the <i>Emerald</i> was up in late May 1940 and he spent the next 6 months on temporary duty, first as commander of the 16th destroyer flotilla at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harwich.html" title="Harwich">Harwich</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Agar_2bfb.html" title="Edit section: Operation Lucid">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Operation Lucid</span></h3>
<p>Agar was in charge of planning and carrying out Operation Lucid in September 1940, an attempt to hit the German wooden invasion barges at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a>, France, with incendiary material and set them alight. It was a desperate time and any measure, however risky, that could frustrate the German invasion plans was welcome. The plan had the personal backing of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>.</p>
<p>Accompanied by various auxiliary vessels, Agar set off for Boulogne several times in September and October of 1940 with four small ancient oil tankers filled with a special incendiary fuel (called <i>Agar's special mixture</i>). The wartime need for oil tankers was so great that only vessels unfit for convoy work were available to Agar. The very poor mechanical condition of these ships hampered the enterprise. Either bad weather or mechanical breakdowns forced cancellation on the first attempts.</p>
<p>The last attempt seemed that it would be a success until the command ship with Agar aboard, HMS <i>Hambledon</i>, a <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunt_class_destroyer.html" title="Hunt class destroyer">Hunt class destroyer</a>, hit an acoustic mine mid-Channel and was severely damaged. She had to be towed back to England, being shelled by German coastal batteries on the French coast on the way back, without scoring a hit.</p>
<p>The season was now too late for another attempt and the threat of invasion had receded.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">November 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Agar was appointed Chief Staff Officer to the Rear Admiral commanding Coastal Forces. This was a critical position as the Germans were vigorously attacking the coastal convoys running down the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> and up and down the east coast from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> to the northeast of England down to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. The threats were from aircraft, mines and fast German motor torpedo boats, called <a href="../../../e/_/b/E_boats.html" title="E boats">E boats</a>. Britain had let her coastal forces deteriorate since the days Agar had commanded C.M.B.'s.</p>
<p>One coastal convoy in the fall of 1940 lost 14 of 25 ships between London and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>. The toll on the East Coast convoys was just as great, with E-Boats a threat here, making a quick dash from ports in the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>. The problem was that if coastal convoys were discontinued, the British rail network could not handle the extra traffic and factories would be idle for lack of raw materials. The vessels used in the coastal trade were small and specially designed for the service, and of limited utility on ocean convoys. The traffic in coal from the northeast of England to London was especially important.</p>
<p>Agar worked hard in this role from November 1940 to July 1941 when he was given a new seagoing command.</p>

<p><i>Dorsetshire</i> was not equipped to operate in an area with enemy aircraft and Agar was attempting to add antiaircraft guns in Colombo and to dismantle and refit her engines and boilers to meet the challenges ahead when word arrived that an enemy fleet had entered the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Ocean_dac8.html" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>.

<p><i>Dorsetshire</i> was in some ways a victim of the lack of British intelligence about the capabilities of the Japanese fleet. Neither Agar nor Admiral Somerville had any idea that the range of Japanese naval dive bombers was almost twice that of comparative British aircraft. To survive after getting a second warning of the presence of a large westbound Japanese Fleet in the Indian Ocean he would have had to leave Colombo as fast as possible and head west at top speed.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> an urgent message summoned Agar to the base Operations Room in Colombo. A <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consolidated_PBY_4_211b.html" title="Consolidated PBY 4">Consolidated Catalina</a> <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_boat.html" title="Flying boat">flying boat</a> had just reported that it was shadowing a large force of enemy carriers accompanied by battleships steering west from the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malacca_Straits_8200.html" title="Malacca Straits">Malacca Straits</a>, directly for Ceylon. This was the fleet of Admiral Nagumo.</p>
<p>Admiral Somerville was in the Maldives beyond the immediate reach of the advancing Japanese. Upon receiving the news he moved further out of Nagumo's way and ordered the <i>Dorsetshire</i> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Cornwall_%2856%29_2a29.html" title="HMS Cornwall (56)">HMS <i>Cornwall</i></a>, which was also in Colombo, to join him with all speed. He left the choosing of a rendezvous point to the admiral commanding in Colombo. It took six long hours to reassemble the ships machinery and get her ready for sea. The two cruisers left Colombo harbour at 10pm on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a>. The rendezvous point was approved by Admiral Somerville. It was a fatal error as a more westerly rendezvous point would have saved the two ships. The ships could steam at only 28 knots, the top speed that <i>Cornwall</i> could make.</p>
<p>At daybreak, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Sunday_e163.html" title="Easter Sunday">Easter Sunday</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, Agar received a signal that the Japanese Fleet was only 120 miles south of Colombo. They began an attack on the port at 8 am. No further communication was received from Colombo (their radio tower was hit).</p>
<p>At this point, lacking further direction, as Somerville was maintaining radio silence and Colombo was out of action, Agar made a fatal decision. He saw his first duty as rejoining the fleet in the hopes of launching a night attack on the Japanese and opted to continue on southwards to the rendezvous point instead of heading due west out of the danger zone. At 11:30 am a Japanese patrol aircraft spotted them. There were six hours of daylight left. Agar continued on to the rendezvous point. He broke radio silence to tell Somerville of his decision. The rendezvous point was 90 miles away.</p>
<p>The two ships were caught by Japanese <a href="../../../d/i/v/Dive_bombers.html" title="Dive bombers">dive bombers</a> at 1pm on <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Sunday_e163.html" title="Easter Sunday">Easter Sunday</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> and the <i>Dorsetshire</i> sank eight minutes after the first bomb hit. She went down at 13:50 after being struck by 10 bombs. 234 men were killed and 500 including the Captain survived in the water until rescue 32 hours later. Only 16 of the men who went into the water died, a testament to crew discipline and the leadership of Agar and the other officers and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petty_officer.html" title="Petty officer">petty officers</a>. The <i>Cornwall</i> was sunk as well.</p>
<p>Agar worked hard to save his crew, picking up the wounded in a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whaler.html" title="Whaler">whaler</a>, gathering up stragglers and giving good advice. He was reported by survivors as speaking calmly.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairey_Swordfish_cd82.html" title="Fairey Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> found the men in the water the next afternoon and an hour later the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_cruiser.html" title="Light cruiser">light cruiser</a> <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Enterprise_%28D52%29_760b.html" title="HMS Enterprise (D52)">HMS <i>Enterprise</i></a> and the destroyers HMS Paladin and HMS Panther arrived to rescue the survivors. Agar was taken aboard the <i>Paladin</i>.</p>
<p>During the engagement Agar was wounded in the leg by shrapnel. This wound turned septic as a result of being left unattended after the sinking. When the <i>Dorsetshire</i> sank, Agar was dragged down deep and suffered the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bends.html" title="Bends">bends</a> coming up, doing serious damage to his lungs. On the surface he swallowed oil. These injuries affected his fitness for further seagoing duty. He was 52 and had completed 37 years of active duty. After a short stay in <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a> where his health took a turn for the worse, he was sent to hospital in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. The leg healed, but lung trouble from the bends and oil he swallowed stayed with him for the rest of his life. He arrived home on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>.</p>

<p>The British paid dearly for underestimating Japanese capabilities. After <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_865a.html" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, the loss of <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Repulse_%281916%29_5e59.html" title="HMS Repulse (1916)">HMS <i>Repulse</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_%281939%29_d184.html" title="HMS Prince of Wales (1939)"><i>Prince of Wales</i></a> and the fall of Singapore one might have expected greater caution. Augustus Agar's seafaring days ended close to where he was born 52 years before.</p>
<p>It is easy to assess blame afterwards, but it did seem unwise to sent <i>Dorsetshire</i> back to Colombo for a second time to finish her refit with a huge Japanese Fleet threatening. This was Somerville's decision. But, of course we do not know what other viable choices he had. Certainly, South Africa was a safe place for a refit, but it was so far away that Dorsetshire could not get back in time to assist him. He needed every ship. Was Bombay too crowded? Did the ship really need the refit at this critical juncture? It must be remembered that Somerville had to choose his time for battle carefully. If he was caught in the open, he would surely lose to the larger Japanese Fleet with all its dive bombers and torpedo bombers. He had divided his fleet into a fast part and a slow part, with the latter in reserve. <i>Dorsetshire</i> was assigned to the fast division where speed was essential for a fast night attack, in and out before aircraft could reach them. Hence Somerville's insistence on a refit to increase her speed.</p>
<p>The rendezvous point for the cruisers with the main British fleet was set too far east, too close to the Japanese. This was the port admiral's decision. Agar should have fled due west at dawn when he heard how close the Japanese were. But this is hindsight. He had no reason to believe that Somerville would not show up at the rendezvous point, expecting the help of two cruisers for a night attack on the Japanese aircraft carriers. He knew he was taking a great risk.</p>
