His first place of education was the Union Academy in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_London%2C_Connecticut_2c51.html" title="New London, Connecticut">New London</a>. Following this, he was sent to <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkins_Grammar_School_84b6.html" title="Hopkins Grammar School">Hopkins Grammar School</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven</a> and entered <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a>. At Yale he was elected membership to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Kappa_Epsilon_f190.html" title="Delta Kappa Epsilon">Delta Kappa Epsilon</a> and <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a>. He was graduated in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>, and spent the next year in study at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_Law_School_ca55.html" title="Yale Law School">Yale Law School</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a> he entered the law office of Andrew C. Lippitt and after admission to the bar in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a> entered a partnership with Mr. Lippitt. He continued the practice of law until <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, when he was chosen to represent the town of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_London%2C_Connecticut_2c51.html" title="New London, Connecticut">New London</a> in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_House_of_Representatives_19d1.html" title="Connecticut House of Representatives">Connecticut House of Representatives</a>. Although a young member of the house, he was selected as a member of the judiciary committee. He was also Chairman of the select committee to carry through the "bill for the defense of liberty," which was aimed at preventing the enforcement of the <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugitive_Slave_Law_1680.html" title="Fugitive Slave Law">Fugitive Slave Law</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. Later, Brandegee chaired the committee on the Maine Law, and was responsible for passing the only propitiatory liquor law ever passed in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a> he returned to the practice of law, and was elected judge of New Haven's criminal court. During this time Brandegee became well-known in Connecticut as a free solier, speaking in many towns on slavery issues. He was chosen as one of the electors of Connecticut on a ticket headed by former Governor, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Sherman_Baldwin_4e95.html" title="Roger Sherman Baldwin">Roger Sherman Baldwin</a>.</p>

During this first "War" session of the house, Brandegee managed to keep favour with both <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democrats</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republicans</a>. At the end of the year, fellow <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Bonesman</a> and leader of the opposition, Henry C. Deming presented him with a service of silver.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Civil_War_988f.html" title="United States Civil War">Civil War</a>, Brandegee was very active in supporting the Union cause. He travelled all over <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> addressing meetings, raising troops and arousing public sentiment. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a> he was elected to Congress from the 3rd district of Connecticut. Although the youngest member of the house, he was selected as a member of the committee on naval affairs, and later to the important committee on military affairs.

He laid down the office after two years, to give more time to the practice of law. He was Chairman of the Connecticut delegation to the National Republican Convention in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>.</p>

As a favourite in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican party</a>, his fellow Republicans had tried to convince him to run for <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Connecticut_ece3.html" title="Governor of Connecticut">Governor</a> or Senator, but Brandegee declined any furthers offices. Although, he served as corporation counsel of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_London%2C_Connecticut_2c51.html" title="New London, Connecticut">New London</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>.

<p>At a special meeting of the superior court on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, Judge George D. Stanton said of Brandegee:</p>
<p><i>"August Brandegee, a leader of the New London county bar for half a century, is dead. During all that time he reflected honor upon this bar. He gave to its member an example for emulation. He has left us a memory which is a benediction. We strive through this memorial to show that we appreciate what he was and what he stood for.</i> He was a learned lawyer. Coming to the bar filled with the learning of the classics, he readily absorbed the law written in the books, and yet was always more than the book lawyer. He never failed to appreciate that the law is not an abstract science, but a rule of action of men. Mercy and charity ever came to him as the hand maidens of legal principle. He approached the real of a cause with diffidence. He participated in the trial as a master.</p>
<p>He was a brilliant orator. Convention, legislature, congress and the courts thrilled with his eloquence. In manner unexcelled he clothed his thoughts in language chaste and beautiful, and drove his words deep into the hearts of his hearers. He stood for high ideals through all his public life. At a time when the Abolitionist met scorn and contumely, he laboured zealously to free the slave. A member of Congress through the war, he became the trusted friend of Lincoln, and rendered signal service for the cause of the Union. And then and ever after he put aside official station for the simple life.</p>
<p>He was a knightly man - hypocrisy, shame, expedients, pretensions - the whole brood of lies and deceits - were his enemies. He fought them all his days and when the end came, passed over God's threshold with escutcheon unstained and with plume untarnished."</p>
