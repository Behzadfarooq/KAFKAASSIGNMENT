<p>I feel like more should be stated about his overall apearance. For a long time people had tried to gain sole control over rome. He was the first one in a long time.

<p>I think the article needs to make mention of the short time after Caesar's assasination that Octavian went to war with Antony and came to the aid of assasin Decimus Brutus Albinus at Mutina with the consuls Hirtius and Pansa. Also does anyone know exactly why he did this? It seems odd he would help an Assasin, perhaps it had something to do with Decimus being adopted as Caesar's 2nd son and Antony's falling out with Caesar? Or maybe he simply hated Antony more or was trying to eliminate his main rival? Do any ancient sources elaborate on exactly what his motivations were here? NeoRicen 06:06, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can come up with several reasons, but probably the best way to deconstruct what exactly Octavian was doing is to look at the results. Its clear that Octavian manipulated Cicero to gain political allies amoung the moderates and the Optimates; Cicero himself states as much. Octavian inherited Caesar's army and his name, giving him an edge, but by working with the Optimates (ie: his grand-uncle's assasins) Octavian gains additional political power among the people and is, in the end, able to say that he is truly a servant of the Republic, a supporter of neither Caesar's dictatorship nor the abuses of the Optimates. Perhaps those were his reasons, or perhaps he was manipulated. Either way, the end result is that Octavian ends up in command of almost all of the Senatorial legions (legions controlled by the state and in the previous civil-war loyal to the Optimates), as well as a majority of Caesar's legions as well as his own forces. Combining arms with Antony and Lepidus allows Octavian full control of all of the military forces of the Republic and allows him to march into Rome at the head of eight legions and set up the Second Triumvirate, which this time is a legal institution. Once again, in the end, this is all speculation based on what Octavian does overall, and basically put it shouldn't necesarily be included because it is an area of historical speculation on the part of us historians. In other words, we're all still debating it, and we don't and probably never will have a definitive answer short of discovering Octavian's personal journal from those times. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 09:19, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Legal institution in that the power of the Triumvirs is sanctioned by the Senate for five years and these three men are charged with restructuring the Republic. In other words, legal in that it is done through legal means. Were they cajoled, threatened, berated, what have you? In the end its irrelevant. The only reason it matters at all is in the fact that while the First Triumvirate was three guys with incredible personal power working behind the scenes and manipulating circumstances, the Second Triumvirate was three guys with moderate personal power attempting to work within the legal framework of the Republic. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 06:30, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"History is (mainly) written by the victors, studied by the losers (or intelectuals), and forgotten or ignored by the rebels and fools."</p>
<p>Ancient soures are not so reliable as we wish and believe. Why did he do it? Well, why do in effect ppl do anything? (cheap Rethorical question)</p>
<p>Well, his true own personal reasons are in fact impossible to know. What he said, could be and probably was, a "white" lie, or do you believe that he saved the republic for patriotic reasons? Nevertheless, that was his "official" reason (or so he claimed at that time).</p>
<p>Everybody (politicians and rulers simply more than the average person) lies to a certain personal degree (simply stating a true fact). Ancient historians "also" lie to a certain degree. Many were of the "old republican-senatorial" side, and they could be executed (and some were) for what they wrote (accordingly they were very carefull in what they wrote).</p>
<p>His apparent and official reason (at that time) was "in order to secure the republic, the Senate and the people of Rome" against Antony, who was officially a renegade (at that time). Don´t ever forget that "officially" Octavian did everything to save the republic. In fact Dictators always use that excuse (security) and perhaps even believe themselves at the beginning.</p>
<p>His "real" reasons could have been to gain the command of a army (filled by the veterans of Caesar) and in fact the two consuls died very suddenly and very conviniantly. Now this is my personal theory (I haven´t read this anywhere, but then I haven´t read every book about these events) but "perhaps" they where mudered or put in the front line and than abandoned (like that story of David and Urias? something like that). To have a army is to have power and Octavian was certainly power-hungry. Lateron Octavian used that army to:</p>
<p>First, negotiate with Antony and Lepidus. Second, to simply terrify and to bleed the Senate.</p>
<p><b>Answer</b> I think its because he despised Antony, who had been holding up the time it would take for him to recieve his will and was in general being very difficult to Augusuts. I recall reading that in Cassius Dio</p>
<p>Cassius Dio 5 <i>"Indeed, so far from demanding of Antony any of the money that he had previously plundered, he actually paid court to him, although he was insulted and wronged by him. For Antony did him many injuries both in word and deed, particularly when the lex curiata was proposed by which the transfer of Octavius into Caesar's family was to take place; <sup>4</sup> Antony himself pretended to be doing his best to have it passed, but through some tribunes he kept securing its postponement, in order that the young man, not being as yet Caesar's son according to law, might not meddle with the property and might be weaker in all other ways."</i></p>

<p>Someone (who's only been editing as a logged-in user since 31&#160;Dec&#160;05) has blithely gone off and moved this article back to <b>Caesar Augustus</b>, with the arch comment that the previous move, carefully considered by quite a few of us. was "inappropriate". This needs to be moved right back to <b>Augustus</b>, per the previous consensus. This is among the many kinds of things that makes Wikipedia look very silly. (I'm also puzzled how this person changed the redirects etc.; surely not an admin with just 9&#160;days of logged-in editing?) <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 13:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not defending a move (and I certainy didn´t do it) but is "Augustus" really the "more commonly" used name? I have a few books and the authors name this person "Octavian" instead of "Caesar" which is normally used to designate "Julius Caesar". "Augustus" was a title (and Caesar also slowly changed into a title) and I believe that the majority of the latter emperors also adopted that title. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 13:22, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The short answer is that this man was referred to by various names (Caesar, Octavius, Octavianus are all met with in the ancient authors) — until he became emperor: from then on, he is almost universally called <i>Augustus</i>, which is also the usual practice of modern authors, except in careful writing when he is being referred to before that date, when in English at any rate he is usually referred to as <i>Octavian</i>, a custom owing much to euphony and Shakespeare; in French and Italian for example he is customarily referred to, under those conditions, as <i>Octave</i> and <i>Ottavio</i> (rather than <i>Octavien</i> and <i>Ottaviano</i>). The KJV <i>Caesar Augustus</i>, amusingly, is the most technically accurate appellation, which is what one would expect from the phenomenally talented, scholarly, and meticulous group of people who translated King James's Bible; yet that form is almost never used outside a Christian religious context. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 16:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>August reputedly has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July.</i></dd>

<p>I remember reading that this is an urban legend, though not where. It would be nice if anyone could add information on who or what "reputes" this, and what opinions there are on this claim. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 21:48, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not true, and derives from a medieval mistake. In short, August already had 31 days before Augustus renamed it (i.e. when it was called Sextilis. The article <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_calendar.html" title="Julian calendar">Julian calendar</a> has all the info on this. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:19, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Err, what? When Octavian got to Rome in May 44 Cassius and Brutus weren't even IN Rome, let alone in control of it.

<p>Augustus was 75 when he died (not 77 as stated above). This can be confirmed by maths, and also Suetonius. In Chapter 100 of <i>Augustus</i> he states:</p>
<p><i>He expired in the same room in which his father Octavius had died, when the two Sextus's, Pompey and Apuleius, were consuls, upon the fourteenth of the calends of September [the 19th August], at the ninth hour of the day, being seventy-six years of age, wanting only thirty-five days.</i></p>
<p>In other words, he died 35 days before his 76th birthday. He was born on 23 September 63 BC, and died on 19 August AD 14. Since there was no "Year Zero" between 1 BC and AD 1, simply adding 63 and 14 to get his age will give an erroneous result, which must be reduced by 1 in order to give the correct figure. Or, put another way, we must convert all BC figures to "minus AD" figures - i.e. 1 BC becomes "0", 2 BC becomes "-1", and 63 BC becomes "-62". 62 plus 14 gives the correct figure of 76 - or, to be more precise, it tells us that his 76th birthday fell in the year that he died. He didn't reach it of course.</p>
<p>This common mistake (assuming the existence of a "Year Zero") affects all sorts of things, including the ages of Livia, Tiberius, and Claudius, the length of Augustus and Livia's marriage, etc. I have tried to correct as many as I can find.</p>
<p>It should also be noted, in passing, that 23 September 63 BC is a date on the pre-Julian Roman republican calendar. It remained the legal anniversary even after the introduction of the Julian calendar. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 10:39, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Biblically speaking it can be read in Luke 2:1 that "Caesar Augustus" decreed the world should be taxed (the reason Mary and Joseph were in Bethelham) From where does he get the authority? The three children: Alexander Helios -- King of Kings of Parthia and Media, Ptolemais Philadelphus King of Syria (Luke 2:2) and Caesar Ptolemais Philopator Philometor -- KING OF KINGS. Proverbs 1</p>
<p>All of octavian's title he assumes to compete with Caesar(ian)(Little Caesar). Caesarian's birth is recorded on the walls of the Temple of Montu -- He was the son of Amen-Ra through Julius Caesar. We note after J. Caesar's murder octavian makes J.C. a god so that he can proclaim divi filius. He then minted coins that read Caesar Augustus Divi Filius,(Caesar, Venerable Son of god) a potrait of himself on one side, and a huge star on the other. When one reads the story in the bible these things should be kept in mind. Octavian takes the name Caesar to counter Julius' living issue after his own name -- Caesar(ian). A review of history reveals that Romans often manipulated the "will". It was through a "will" that Ptolemais Apion "decreed" Cyprus to Rome ( J.C. returned it to Cleopatra -- she minted a bronze coin with the image of her and Caesarian -- some say it is a type of "Aphrodite and Eros" -- the same iconography that is repeated as "Mother and Child".</p>
<p>octavian was in Judea for one reason, to reclaim the land that had been "stolen" from Rome ("donations" of Alexandria -- Coronation every knee bowed to the King of Kings). These "Theives" being 14/15 year old Alexander Helios, his twin sister Cleopatra Selene, 5/6 year old Ptolemais Philadelphus, and 17/18 year old Caesar.</p>
<p>He is rome's "saviour" -- the tekhen(obelisk/token) in the center of St. Peter's square that is topped with the cross -- it is dedicated to none other than the Divine Augustus. A.D.: in the year of our lord who? Does this dating refer to the birth of christ, or the birth of Imperial Rome?(the birth of christ is in the same moment as Rome proclaiming the "authority" to Tax the world). The Tekhen has been made into a sun dial -- a big clock -- Roman Times.</p>

<dd>He gets his authority from censorial powers that were granted with his tribunician potestas. Caesarion is killed almost immediately when Augustus seizes Egypt. He is never a political threat outside of Egypt, and he's only a threat within Egypt because he is a Ptolemaic symbol. Caesar proclaimed himself a god, and Antonyhad it ratifies after his death; Augustus had little to do with Caesar's deification. Octavian takes Caesar's name beause it was Roman law; as the adopted son of Caesar, he took his adopted father's name. It is doubtful the will was manipulated by Augustus, as he was 18-19 years old and in Greece, and it was Antony who made a display of reading the will (probably assuming he was the heir). Mother/child iconography dates back to pre-history and was an explicit part of Ptolemaic syncretism. Octavian/Augustus, to my knowledge, never visited Judea. Judea itself at that time was a client kingdom under Herod the Great. The children of Cleopatra were long dead by this time, having been offed at the occupation of Egypt and the subsequent Triumph in Rome, which occurred some 30 years before. The obelisk that you reference was also part of that Triumph, and was actully placed there later by Nero as the center of his private hippodrome. As far as the "birth" of imperial Rome, as far as anyone in Rome was concerned, the Republic continued to function straight through Augustus's reign. Rome had long ago become an empire in the technical sense of the word. Anyway, all that being said did you have a point to conribute to this discussion? <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 07:16, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found this comment in the <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesarion.html" title="Caesarion">Caesarion</a> article: "In lists of the time Octavian himself appears as a Pharaoh and the successor to Caesarion." Having read up on the interesting history of Octavian/Augustus and the <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemaic_dynasty.html" title="Ptolemaic dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> (said to have ended with the death of Caesarion) and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Greek_and_Roman_Egypt_179c.html" title="History of Greek and Roman Egypt">history of Greek and Roman Egypt</a>, I see that Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire after it was conquered by Octavian/Augustus, but that the Ptolemaic system of government was left largely undisturbed, "although Romans replaced Greeks in the highest offices". If so, how correct is it to say that Augustus, and his successors as Emperors, were considered Pharoahs of Egypt? Did Egypt have a special status, with the Emperor being both Emperor of Rome and Pharoah of Egypt? Or was the institution of Pharaoh ended after Caesarion, with the listing of Augustus as a Pharoah being something to mollify the people of Egypt? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:28, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, Augustus and his successors were indeed regarded as pharaohs.

<dd>Can something incorporating all this be added to this article, and those of the other Emperors of Rome that are definitely known to have been (nominally) considered Pharoahs in Egypt.

<p>Even if they were technically pharaohs, I presume none of the Emperors spent much time in Egypt, and left the province under the control of a governor to be the "bread-basket" of Rome. So I'm uncertain how to phrase all this in the relevant Roman and Egypt pages? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:19, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Egypt had a special status as a Roman province, because it was, pretty much alone, seen as a personal possession of the Emperor. Senators were not allowed to visit it without imperial permission, and the Governor was always of sub-senatorial rank, to demonstrate the Emperor's personal control. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:43, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have seen cartoushes for all of the emperors up to Domitian, even for Galba, Otho, and Vitellus. As was said previously, Egypt was a special case and functioned as the private domain of the Emperor. The ceremonies and responsibilities that had belonged to the pharaoh were taken up by the governor, which by the time of Rome amounted to little more than the yearly Nile ceremony. The Ptolemies had broken Egyptian religion down to a very local level; the pharaoh was no longer the national religious authority he had been under the native dynaties. As such, the Romans left everything alone and the Egyptians did their own thing, as long as Rome was fed. Could you call Augustus Pharaoh? Not really; he was never really there, the governor ruled for him in absentia, and really by the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty the entire office of pharaoh had broken down and really didn't mean anything to the Egyptians. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 05:14, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Talk of "original research"!! Even for Wikipedia, the statement by anonymous that <i>AD</i> was only used for dating starting in the&#160;18c is an unparalleled inanity. Since it's always to be preferred to assume the best, this doesn't mean the author of the statement is an idiot or malevolent or has an agenda, just that they're talking thru their hat, without the faintest idea of the facts in the matter. There are literally tens of thousands of examples of inscriptions, on stone and paper, dated <i>AD</i>; and I myself have seen many hundreds of them, and photographed several dozens. But to demolish the statement, it suffices to find a single counter-example; so pretty much at random, <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Umbria/Perugia/Giano_dellUmbria/Montecchio/churches/S.Bartolomeo/exterior.html#04A.3733" class="external text" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Umbria/Perugia/Giano_dellUmbria/Montecchio/churches/S.Bartolomeo/exterior.html#04A.3733" rel="nofollow">here's one, dated AD&#160;1223</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 22:45, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I rather expected this. In fact, you <i>are</i> a fool. "AD" is indeed POV, but in the matter of dating articles, Wikipedia has had to settle on something, and that is to leave the commonest terminology unless it is manifestly inappropriate as for the lives of rabbis. I&#160;am not Christian, and couldn't care less whether or not Wikipedia is Christocentric. But you got caught making a very foolish and instantly refutable statement: the use of "AD" antedates the&#160;18c, and gee you don't like getting caught out: nobody does. The best way to avoid that is not to talk thru your hat. Dionysius says nothing by the way about any "common era", his term is "ab incarnatione Christi".

<dd>Another example of a quite pathetic self-absorbed Christian psychopath. First of all, Thayer, you need to calm down and review the facts.

Your accusations that my historical facts are inaccurate and that I am a <i>fool</i> are typical of the angered Christian who even goes as far as to <i>deny his faith</i>.

<dd>(Much later, but this note just in case some well-intentioned soul, doing a homework assignment maybe, should get this page as a Google result and read, above, that Dionysius dated his calendar to the birth of Caesar and was 45&#160;years off...) Neither statement is true. Dionysius did not base his calendar even indirectly on the birth date of Julius Caesar, and Dionysius' calendar is not 45&#160;years off: something like three or four years off seems to be the figure.

<p>Discussion of what names should be appearing in the introduction--and throughout the article as a whole--is scattered throughout this talkpage, but since it seems to have become an issue again, I'd thought I'd gather together here many of the copious reasons against using the "Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus" that seems to be so popular.</p>
<p>Chiefly, it's not his name, and it never was. When Julius Caesar adopted him, he took the name Gaius Julius Caesar, and henceforth is described as Caesar both by himself and by others. When Antony wished to refer condescendingly to him, Suetonius tells us, he referred to him as Thurinus; no mention is made of "Octavianus". I'd like to ask—and I'm genuinely curious here to discover any instances I might have missed—anyone who believes the name "Octavianus" should be included in the article to produce any instances in the ancient sources of Octavian's contemporaries describing him as "Octavianus".</p>
<p>It is not a valid counterargument to respond—as has occurred elsewhere on this talkpage—that the <i><a href="../../../m/o/s/Mos_maiorum.html" title="Mos maiorum">mos maiorum</a></i> was so strong an influence on Roman society that Octavian <i>must</i> have taken the name Octavianus, even though we have no evidence that he did, because Roman tradition dictated that he did. For one thing, it's quite firmly in the territory of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. For another, it's just plain wrong. There are plenty of instances in the Late Republic of adopted men not taking gentilical cognomina, either because they kept their original cognomen instead or because (like Octavian apparently did) they simply took their adoptive father's name and abandoned their original name completely; Quintus Lutatius Catulus Caesar, Marcus Junius Brutus (who progressively dropped more and more of his adoptive name Quintus Servilius Caepio and returned to his original name) and Varro Lucullus all leap to mind. The <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Classical_Dictionary_9a44.html" title="Oxford Classical Dictionary">Oxford Classical Dictionary</a> is quite explicit that "an adopted son took his adoptive father's full name, but <i>could</i> add an extra cognomen formed with the suffix <i>-ianus</i> from his original gentile name" (italics my own).</p>
<p>In conclusion, given all the names that Augustus held throughout his life—Gaius Octavius Thurinus, Gaius Octavius, Gaius Julius Caesar, Imperator Caesar Augustus—and the significance that each name change holds, it just seems really odd and capricious to me that the one "full Roman name" we would give him in his introductory is, in fact, not a name he ever used.</p>
<p>But a fuller understanding can only be achieved by debate! <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 18:24, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as your charge of original research, find any scholarly source anywhere that refers to Octavian's full Roman name as anything other than "Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus" prior to 27 BC and I will send you $5. Whether its "actually" what was used or not is irrelevant, it is his name as used in secondary sources and the scholarly community. If you have a problem with it, get a PhD and write a book and maybe someone will listen to you. Till then, what you think his name may or may not have been and the reasons why is irrelevent. Prior to 27 BC, his name was Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. End of story. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 22:02, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Um, no. His name "as used in secondary sources and the scholarly community" is Octavian, so long as we're discussing the English secondary sources, or Caesar in the Latin secondary sources (like Suetonius). The burden is therefore not on me to produce a reference giving him a Roman name <i>other</i> than C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, the burden is on you to find a reference that <i>does</i> call him C. Julius Caesar Octavianus.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have been going back through the various sources I have to hand, and the only pattern I can see emerging is that those few modern scholars who want to avoid using the anglicised "Octavian" use instead "Octavius", but such authors also seem by and large to be writing of the period prior to 44 BC, so I don't know how much that indicates. Everett does indicate that Cicero referred to him deprecatingly as Octavianus in the initial period after Caesar's death (unfortunately Everett's biography isn't sufficiently annotated to attribute that fact), which I think bears insertion into the first paragraph of the "Rise to Power" section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The OCD—can we agree that, in the absence of contradictory references, the OCD is representative of the English language's modern scholarly community?—seems conspicuously to avoid using any name to refer to him between his adoption by Caesar and his adoption of the praenomen Imperator, repeatedly calling him "Caesar's heir" (which, if it can be seen as supporting any particular name, seems to be choosing "Gaius Julius Caesar" over either "Octavian" or "Octavianus"), and then calls him Imperator Caesar between his adoption of that praenomen and 27 BC, though the OCD's other articles appear universally to refer to him as Octavian.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I don't see that "prior to 27 BC, his name was Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus" really being true at all, either to the ancients or to modern English scholarship, and even a brilliant oratorical technique like trying to forestall debate by declaring "End of story" after stating your own position without substantiation isn't going to change that. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 15:24, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Caesar" for the period from 40 BC to 27 BC doesn't already do so—I offer the following quotations from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Grant_%28author%29_ef78.html" title="Michael Grant (author)">Michael Grant</a> in <i>The Twelve Caesars</i>: "When this information was published after the dictator had been murdered, Octavius—or Octavian as he is generally known to us during these years of his rise to power—assumed his adoptive father's names Gaius Julius Caesar, and started the fourteen-year struggle to gain supremacy in the state." (Pg. 52, 1996 edition) And, even more explicitly: "'His name and his age': his youthful years were an enormous handicap, but his name—Gaius Julius Caesar—already a remarkable asset, became more valuable still when, in January 42, he and the two men with whom he had now become allied in the Second Triumvirate, Antony and Lepidus, pronounced the murdered Julius a god of the Roman state. Octavian's exploitation of this development was displayed upon coins which show himself on one side, described as 'Caesar son of a God', and Julius Caesar on the other, named 'the God Julius'."

<dd>Once again, find a source that refers to him as anything else. Octavian is there, and if you actually bother to read the sources instead of glossing a few onlin ones, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus is used as well. I have nethr the time nor the patience to go through every single source and list them for your own personal education; in other words, readthem yourself. This is not just English works either, but French, German, and Italian sources as well. Cite me a source that has his name as something different and the $5 will be on its way; I want an actual source, not an argument. Since apparently you had some problem with this before, let me restate it again: Find a source that has his name as anything other than Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus prior to 27 BC, and you win. This is of course referring to secondary sources; primary sources will generally refe to him as Augustus throughout his life, and coinage from the triumvirate lists him as Caesar. You are probably correct that he never went by that name, however, Wikipedia is no original research, and all secondary sources accept the name. Whether we think it was or not is, once again, beside the point; the material treats this as his name. Second, I doubt that the OCD lists his name as Imp. Caesar between 40 and 27 BC, as he did not adopt Imperator as his first name until 23 BC after the second settlement. I am grateful that you took the time to look up Grant's work anyway, though that doesn't really argue your case; Grant refers to him as Octavian, and then references Suetonius "Divi Augustus" 7-8 and coinage that I referred to above where he is presented as "Caesar". You still have yet to provide a secondary source that treats his name as anything other than Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus; despite your having an argument that does make perfect sense and is for all intents and purposes likely to be true, the fact of the matter is this is how the secondary materials present his name. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 19:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Addendum: While I do not concede the point, I do think that further discussion has little likelihood of proving constructive, since neither I nor the people who disagree with me seem particularly likely to budge. As long as the information currently contained in the first paragraph of the "Rise to Power" section remains in the article, I have no objection to a mention of the name Octavianus in the article's introduction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There might have been a misunderstanding here:<br />
First, the later Augustus never used the name "Octavianus" himself (some sources: Appian, bella civilia 3, 2, 11; Cicero ad Atticum 14, 12, 2; Cassius Dio 45,3, 2), his full nomenclature after adoption can be seen in an enscription (CIL IX 2142) which has "Caius Iulius Caesar", no Octavianus whatsoever. I know of three ancient sources who use that name, one being Cicero (for instance: ad fam. 16, 24, 2; ad Att. 15, 12, 2) and another Cassius Dio (46, 47, 5-6). It is conspicuous that Cicero only uses the form "Octavianus" as long as he is in opposition, as soon as he joins the later Augustus' party he continues to call him "Caesar", as he does himself. Cassius Dio is mistaken because he transfers the "conventional manner" after which an adoption is done in Rome on the special case of Octavianus, which itself he does not know because he is too distant temporally. The third man denying Octavianus his chosen name "Gaius Julius Caesar" is Brutus (e.g. Cicero, ad Brutum 1, 16), obviously because he is his enemy and knows what implications taking up Caesar's name has (being the legitimate heir meant inheriting Caesar's clients).<br />
Second, the name Octavianus does certainly exist, but it is a wholly modern construction used by scholars to differentiate between Julius Caesar the dictator and his heir (who took up that very same name) on the one hand, and between the young Octavianus, still struggling to get into power, and the later ruler Augustus on the other. While the name is in constant use in scholarly discussion of Augustus, it is not historic and should therefore not be given as the actual name of the first princeps. In German historiography one can even find the name "Oktavian" instead of the more natural "Octavian" (latin has no 'k') just to show that the name is an artificial product of modern scholarship.<br />
Some secondary literature: Malitz, Jürgen: "O puer qui omnia nomini debes" (...) In: Gymnasium 111 (2004), pp. 381-409; p. 401; Schmitthenner, Walter: Oktavian [&lt;- Notice the 'k'] und das Testament Cäsars. 2nd ed. München 1973, p. 70 et seqq.; Syme, Ronald: The Roman Revolution. Oxford 2002, p. 112 et seq.; ---: Imperator Caesar. A Study in Nomenclature. In: Roman Papers I (by Ronald Syme), Oxford 1979, pp. 361-377.<br />
I hope this is convincing enough, even without me having a PhD and all. And I'm quite sure that in the works mentioned above, there are enough passages calling Octavianus something else than "Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus" prior to 27 BC to entitle anyone who has enough time to look those passages up to their $5.

<dd>Maudiporc, you're <i>almost</i> right: I included all of Augustus' names in the German wikipedia-article. "Octavianus" is used (as you rightly say) by Cicero and others (like Asinius Pollio), but mainly because they were too far away from Rome to know about the unusual name policy. The only historians that use the name "Octavianus" are Cassius Dio and Tacitus, but only for reasons of historiographical accuracy (chronology etc.). All other historians do <i>not</i> know him by this name. Nevertheless, modern scholarship followed Dio and Tacitus in order to distinguish Caesar (father) and Caesar (son). The cognomen <i>Octavianus</i> is thus historical, but it was never adopted or used by Augustus or his (Caesarian) followers. <i>Octavianus</i> is usually put in brackets. (I was basically quoting the same literature as you did: Syme, Schmitthenner et al.) —Eickenberg 02:44, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't find any mention of rioting in 27 in the obvious sources (Velleius, Suetonius, Dio). Dio does mention rioting in 22, 21 and 19 BC because Augustus no longer took the consulship.

<dd>And what makes the era "common"? All of a sudden when Christ was supposedly born everyone got together and recognized our similarities? Both dating systems are based on the same "comvention", ie: dating from the assumed birth of Christ in 1 AD/CE. Calling it CE instead of AD in no way removes its connection, nor does it somehow make it more "neutral". The debate is pointless; the Western dating system divides itself into eras based around the birth of Christ. Don't like it? Gain enough power so that someone cares and then change the dating system.

<dd>Actually, imperator means a general who was allowed to triumph. Later it became part of the Roman imperial titles but Augustus was carefull not to be seen as a monarch. Which doesn't mean he wasn't one but in name. He had just cloaked himself in all the old republican magistracies and their powers at the same time (tribune, consular powers, etc...) Later even that carefully tendered distinction was abolished and the names he assumed instead became associated with the imperial titles. Nonetheless Augustus is considered to be the first emperor of the principate. -- <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a>, 12 January 2007, 19:30.</dd>
