	    <p>General Augur was born at Kendall, NY, 10 July 1821. Very early in life he went to Michigan with his mother, who was then a widow, from which State he was appointed to West Point, entering in 1839, and being graduated in 1843. Among his classmates were several who rose to high rand and distinction, viz.: General Ulysses S. Grant, General Rufus Ingalls, General Joseph H. Potter, General W. B. Franklin, General William F. Raynolds, General J. J. Reynolds, Gneral James A. Hardi, General Frank Gardner (Confederate commander of Port Hudson, Louisiana), General Frederick Steele, General F. T. Dent. As to his very exceptional record of promotion, the Army Register shows that he was commissioned from brevet 2nd lieutenant through every grade to brigadier-general in the regular establishment, and was major-general of volunteers from 1862 to 1866, during the war, and received the brevets of colonel, brigadier, and major-general in regular establishment and major-general of volunteers.</p>
<p>A few years after graduation he was in the Mexican War as 2nd lieutenant 4th Infantry, where he, with Colonel H. M. Black, served as Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier-Genearl Caleb Cushing, of the Volunteers. He was also Aide-de-Camp to Briagdier-General Hopping. Both received marked commendation from General Cushing upon ending their service with him. He then served with his company of the 4th Infantry at Fort Niagara, NY, and in 1852 went with the regiment, via the Isthmus of Panama, to Oregon. The late General Grant was quartermaster, and the writer [Maj. Gen. Russel] has often listened to the story of the trials of the trip with choler and Chagres fever, which quarantined them at Panama for several weeks, and where Grant came in largely for praise, and made his usual mark for pluck and coolness and for knowing the best way to do things.</p>

In Oregon, Augur, promoted to captain in 1852, served at several posts including Fort Vancouver, and was for several years in command of Fort Hoskins. While in Oregon he engaged in fights and skirmishes with Yakima and Rouge River Indians in 1856, with a creditable record. Sumter having been fired upon, the 4th Infantry was ordered East in April, 1861. Upon reaching San Francisco, hearing of his appointment as Major of the 13th Infantry, he proceeded to New York. Arriving there he found the appointment as Commandant of Cadets at West Point (August, 1861), which post he filled from August 26 to December 5, 1861. He was then appointed brigadier-general of volunteers. He commanded a brigade in the advanced defeneses of Washington until May, 1862, operations on the Rappahannock to July, 1862, and was in command of the troops (including his brigade, Gibbon's battery, and bayard's and Kilpatrick's troops of cavalry) at the first capture of Fredericksburg. He commanded a division of the 5th Army Corps July 19 to August 10, 1862, being engaged in the battle of Cedar Mountain, where he was severely wounded. The rank of major-general of volunteers (and brevet colonel, U.S. Army), was conferred upon him "for gallant and meritorious services" in the above battle--one of the few full commissions so conferred. In the fall of 1862 Major-General Augur went with Banks' expedition to New Orleans at General Banks' request as "second in command." He commanded the District of Baton Rouge from January 20 to May 20, 1863. In hte expedition to surround Port Hudson he commanded the troops engaged in the battle of Port Hudson Plains, and after effecting junction with Banks, he commanded the center wing of the army in the siege which followed. In this siege, which was long and tedious, he did remarkable service for the goverment in handling his troops, who did much fighting, and in instructing others. In the council he vigorously opposed, but in vain, the unfortunate and bloody assault of May 27, as premature and without due knowledge of the ground. He was then assigned to command the Department of Wshington and 22nd Army Corps, serving in this capacity from October 23, 1863 to August 13, 1866. This command was one of the most trying in the Army, comprising all the troops in, and forst around, Washington on both sides of the river, and in the country for several miles into Veriginia, Troops were constatnly arriving or passing through--recruits to the front, aand deserters and prisoner to the rear. Many serious civil complications had to besettled between the military and the regular distrcit civil authorities. The military held a regular provost court, which tried all soldiers and also citizens who violated the military orders or laws--such as selling citizens' clothing to soliders, selling liquor when bar rooms were orderd closed, aiding deserters, etc. The rule of the district was semi-civil and semi-military, but, for a wonder, tehre was no open conflict between them. Then there was the imperious Stanton but forty rods away, with his secret service, and as the department commander had another corps of detectives, some amusing clashes often arose. There were the congressmen at the other end of the avenue, continually asking fovors or passes for friends to go beyond the lines and all sorts of impossible things, and then often wonderingy why a resresentative of the sovereign people should be thus denied. Mosby's troops made frequent raids into his territory in Virginia, and troops had to be kept constantly on the move. At one time General Augur himself took the field to drive Mosby from a railroad which head torn up at Falls Church. Early "came knocking at the door" of Washington in 1864, nearly forcing and entrance, but was reulsed. Then came the intense excitement attending teh assassination of President Lincoln and the pursuite of the assassins, thowing great anxiety and weighty responsiblilty upon the department commander, who scarcley sletpt for days, except for a short nap on a sofa in his office. Such duties threw little glamour about them to reach the general publcic, but were much more aruous and trying than those of many who rose to greater fame in the battle reports and newspapers. In 1864, when General Grant reorganized the Army of the Potomac he sought for General Augur as one of his corps commanders, but Secretary Stanton refused, saying that he was doing more important work in Washington. His conscientious and correct performance of his trying duties in the Department of Washington was well known and appreciated by those in authority and also by those under him.</p>
<p>In September, 1866, General Augur was mustered out of the volunteer service as a major-general, and reverted to his regular army rank, then colonel, 12th Infantry. After serving for several months as president of teh Examining Board for officers, the news of the terible Fort Philip Kearney massacre in Northern Wyoming reached the East and General Augur, assigned to his brevet rank of major-general, was ordered to relieve General P. Saint George Cooke in command of the Department of the Platte, headquarters in Omaha, reporting there in January, 1867. At that time Omaha was a small town compared with its present size, with no railroad connections with the East. The Chicago &amp; Northwestern, however, reached Council Bluffs shortly afterwards. The Union Pacific was finished only to North Platte, 290 miles from Omaha. All operations had ceased during the winter. Troops were hurried out but nothing could be done with them until spring, as the season was terrible up to the end of April, everything being blocked by snow and the weather bitterly cold. One train was eleven days going from Omaha to North Platte in April. In the spring Forts Philip Kearney and C. F. Smith were reinforced,; but the Sioux still continued hostile, picking off small parties here and there. The department commander had several regiments in small detachments scattered along the line of the Union Pacific to protect fro mattach--but more from alarm--the ten thousand men at work at different places, and in 1869 the connection through to the Pacific was made.</p>
<p>Upon March 4, 1869, General Grant appointed his old friend and classmate to the vacancy in the brigadier-generals, caused by Grant's resignation and the promotion of Sherman and Sheridan. From 1872 to 1875 General Augur commanded the Department of Texas, during which time there was much trouble with the Kiowas and Comanches on the North, and the Kickapoos from Mexico on the south. In 1875 he took command of the Department of the Gulf, Headquarters in New Orleans. The State of Louisiana was still in the terrible political condition in which it had been since the war. Terrorism, intimidations, and often worse means were employed by the white Democrats in many parishes to prvent the Negro from voting; or if voting to prevent the count of his ballot. Troubles, threats, adn conflicts were constant up to the 1876 elections, when Packard (Republican) claimed the State by the Returning Board throwing out several parishes, and held and barricaded the State house; Nicholas (Democrat) cliamed the State as per original returns. Hence there were two governors and legislatures, creating a most confused and dangerous condition of affairs in the settling of which General Augur had much to do and say. Any error of judgment on his part would have created chaos, having troops stationed in various troublesome parts of the State. At the culmination, when an armed attack in force upon Packard's position was threatened, the Nichols troops, about 10,000 men, actually turning out, he had twenty-five companies of U. S. Infantry in New Orleans. At last, under a prior telegraphic order to preserve the "present status," which was the only instruction received for months, General Augur notified Governor Nichols that he considered that the peace, not only of Louisiana but of the United States was threatened, and desired him to withdraw his troops. This was done which ended any armed display, the further settlement being effected under President Hayes through diplomacy. In all this affair General Augur showed his wonderful repose of good judgment, having to act without instructions from higher authorities, and seeking none. Such duty and responsibility was wearing in the extreme. His next commands were: Department of the South, Newport Barracks, Kentucky, 1878 to 1881; Department of Texas, 1881 to 1883; Department of the Missouri, 1883 to July 10, 1885, when he was retired from active service.</p>
<p>The foregoing is concerning General Augur's military record. What shall be stated of him as a man? He was the most noble, calm, just, and evenly balanced man, in public affairs and private, the writer has ever known. He was gentle to all from the highest to the most lowly--the type of what is known as "a true Christian gentleman." Anything coming before him intimating trickery or dishonesty shocked him. Like General Grant he never suspected an officer of wrongdoing, and could be brought to believe wrong had been done, aonly upon convincing evidence. Where punishment was involved in any matter before him, he weighted the case with calm deliberation, erring, if at all, on the side of mercy. In all his years of duty, by his calm judgment and justice to all, and by an inborn natural dignity, he commanded the respect of all his subordiantes to a remarkable degree, and thus brought order easily out of threatened chaos, and kept the officers of his departments throroughly united. The same was true also in his management of the Indians, having had under his charge at times the great tribes--the Sioux, Cheyennes, Comanches, Kiowas, Apaches and New Mexicos. Of strkingly fine presience and bearing, and with a courtly manner for all, he was a favorite wherever he served, especially among the old Washingtonians, now fast disappearing. General Augur was a consistent member of the Episcopal Church, but liberal toward those not of that Church. He was a vestryman of St. John's Church, Washington, and of the cathedral churhes at Omaha and San Antonio, and was a delegate to many general conventions of the Church.</p>
<p>General Augur married, in 1844, Miss Jane E. Arnold of Ogdensburg, NY, daughter of General Jacob Arnold, an army officer, and a niece of Surgeon Wheaton. They had eleven children. He was most fortunate in possessing the love and devotion of wife and children at all times. They resepected and looked up to him in all things. It was the most united of families in heart and spirit, and although scattered in the flesh as individuals to the four winds of heaven, they all felt bound to the dear husband and father with bonds of steel which nothing in this world could sever but death.<sup>1</sup></p>
