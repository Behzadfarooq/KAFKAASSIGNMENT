<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_Wilson_ffdd.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Born <b>Frederick August Kittel</b> in the <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_District_64d0.html" title="Hill District">Hill District</a> of <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, Wilson was the fourth of six children. His father was a German immigrant baker, also named Frederick August Kittel, who seldom spent time with his family, and his mother was an African American <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleaning_woman.html" title="Cleaning woman">cleaning woman</a>, Daisy Wilson, from <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>. Earlier, Wilson's maternal grandmother walked from North Carolina to Pennsylvania in search of a better life. Wilson's parents stayed together until he was five; his father raised their children in a two-room apartment behind a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grocery_store.html" title="Grocery store">grocery store</a>. This economically-depressed neighborhood was inhabited by many black Americans as well as others.</p>
<p>During August's teenage years in the late 1950s, his mother married David Bedford, and the Bedford family moved from the Hill to a then predominantly white <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> neighborhood, <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_%28Pittsburgh%29_43ac.html" title="Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)">Hazelwood</a>. There, they encountered racial hostility; bricks were thrown through a window at their new home.</p>
<p>Wilson was the only black student at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Catholic_High_School_%28Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania%29_621c.html" title="Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)">Central Catholic High School</a> in 1959; threats and abuse drove him away, but Connelley Vocational High School proved unchallenging. He dropped out of Gladstone High School in the 9th grade in 1960 when a teacher accused him of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarizing.html" title="Plagiarizing">plagiarizing</a> a 20-page paper on <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>.</p>
<p>Wilson made such extensive use of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnegie_Library_of_Pittsburgh_44e7.html" title="Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh">Carnegie Library</a> to educate himself that they later awarded him a degree, the only such one they have bestowed. Wilson, who had learned to read at age four, began reading black writers there at age 12 and spent the remainder of his teen years educating himself by reading <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Ellison_fc94.html" title="Ralph Ellison">Ralph Ellison</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wright_%28author%29_557c.html" title="Richard Wright (author)">Richard Wright</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langston_Hughes_1899.html" title="Langston Hughes">Langston Hughes</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arna_Bontemps_90b6.html" title="Arna Bontemps">Arna Bontemps</a>, and others.</p>
<p>By this time, Wilson knew that he wanted to be a writer, but this created tension with his mother, who wanted him to become a lawyer. She forced him to leave the family home and he enlisted in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> for a three-year stint in 1962, but left after one year and went back to working odd jobs such as a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porter.html" title="Porter">porter</a>, short-order cook, gardener, and dishwasher.</p>

<p>August Kittel changed his name to August Wilson to honor his mother after his father died in 1965. That same year he discovered the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> as sung by <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessie_Smith_146d.html" title="Bessie Smith">Bessie Smith</a> and bought a <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typewriter.html" title="Typewriter">typewriter</a> for $20 and started writing poetry.</p>
<p>In 1968, Wilson co-founded the Black Horizon Theater in the Hill District of Pittsburgh along with fellow resident <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Penny_8d9b.html" title="Rob Penny">Rob Penny</a>, who went on to become associate professor of African studies at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>. Wilson served as a scriptwriter and director for the next ten years; desperate for space, they staged many of their plays in elementary school auditoriums and community centers. His first play, <i>Recycling</i>, was performed for audiences in small theaters and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_housing.html" title="Public housing">public housing</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_center.html" title="Community center">community centers</a>. Among these early efforts was <i><a href="../../../j/i/t/Jitney_%28play%29.html" title="Jitney (play)">Jitney</a></i> which he revised more than two decades later as part of his 10-play cycle on 20th century Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Wilson has been married three times. His first marriage was to Brenda Burton in 1969. That same year, his stepfather David Bedford died. Wilson's oldest daughter, Sakina Ansari Wilson, was born January 22, 1970. The marriage ended in 1972.</p>
<p>In 1976 Dr. Vernell Lillie, who had founded the Kuntu Repertory Theatre two years earlier, directed Wilson's <i>The Homecoming</i>. That same year Wilson saw <i>Sizwe Bansi Is Dead</i> at the Pittsburgh Public Theater, his first professional play. Wilson, Penny and poet Maisha Baton also started the Kuntu Writers Workshop to bring writers together in a meaningful discussion and to assist writers with getting published and/or produced. Both organizations are still active to this day.</p>
<p>In 1978 Wilson moved to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Paul%2C_Minnesota_76e0.html" title="Saint Paul, Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota.html" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> at the suggestion of his friend director Claude Purdy, who helped him secure a job writing educational scripts for the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Museum_of_Minnesota_0687.html" title="Science Museum of Minnesota">Science Museum of Minnesota</a>. In 1980 he received a fellowship for the Minneapolis Playwrights Center.</p>
<p>In 1981 he was married to Judy Oliver, a social worker. They divorced in 1990. That same year Wilson moved to <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>1900s - <i><a href="../../../g/e/m/Gem_of_the_Ocean_ddeb.html" title="Gem of the Ocean">Gem of the Ocean</a></i> (2003)</li>

</ul>
<p>Although the plays are not strictly connected to the degree of a serial story, some characters appear (at various ages) in more than one of the cycle's plays. Children of characters in earlier plays may appear in later plays. The character most frequently mentioned in the cycle is Aunt Ester, a 'washer of souls'. She is reported to be 287 years old in <i><a href="../../../g/e/m/Gem_of_the_Ocean_ddeb.html" title="Gem of the Ocean">Gem of the Ocean</a></i>, which takes place in her home at 1839 Wylie Avenue. The plays often include an apparently mentally-impaired oracular character (different in each play) - for example, Hedley [Sr.] in <i><a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Guitars_fc3f.html" title="Seven Guitars">Seven Guitars</a></i>, or Hambone in <i><a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Trains_Running_b0fa.html" title="Two Trains Running">Two Trains Running</a></i>.</p>
