<p>I am a member of the <a href="../../../a/m/a/AMA_1b91.html" title="AMA">AMA</a> (Association of Members' Advocates) currently acting on behalf of <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaligvla_061d.html" title="User:Caligvla">User:Caligvla</a>, who has named you as one of the participants in the dispute over whether Armenia is in Europe or Asia. Caligvla has listed a number of reference sources classifying Armenia as an Asian country. He claims that the only sources quoted by your side of the dispute are <i>1.) an obsecure Canadian website that places Armenia in Europe, and a BBC article that mistakenly places Armenia in Europe.</i> Can you please respond to this and give your side of the argument (preferably on my userpage)? Under the AMA principle of <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi_alteram_partem.html" title="Audi alteram partem">audi alteram partem</a>, you have the right to be heard.

<dd>Thank you for your response. I appreciate the fact that you have provided sources supporting your side of the dispute. As Armenia is a member of the Council of Europe, this indicates that politically they may be considered a part of Europe. It now appears to me that the weight of evidence is roughly equal on both sides. The trouble with the whole Wikipedia process is that, in almost all disputes, it is possible to locate sources to support both sides of the argument, which sends us 'back to square one' as far as the whole dispute-resolution process is concerned. The only solution I can see is to edit all the disputed articles to add something along the lines of: <i>Some authorities consider Armenia an Asian country, due to its geographical position and the historical relationship of Armenians to Asian peoples. However, Armenia is part of the Council of Europe, and is now considered part of Europe for some purposes. Armenians themselves disagree about whether their country is Asian or European.</i> Do you agree with this as an acceptable form of phrasing? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:43, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The previous phrasing of the article was fine. I do not support Caligvula's self-gratifying effort to change the Armenia article to reflect his racial/cultural sensibilities. The quote you are proposing is simply insulting, as I do not see the need to classify Armenia as purely European or purely Asian when the country is geographically and culturally related to both areas. Leave the article as it is, Caligvula is the only one who has problems with it, because he is "offended" by the idea that Armenians could somehow be related to his own racial/cultural background. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 14:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Caligvla is trying to impose his view only upon the article, aka replace all opinions with his own. His intention is to remove references to Armenia being a European country, and has given the reason that he is "offended" by the notion. This is not proper Wikipedia conduct. I believe that the Armenian Genocide occurred, this does not give me the right to go to the article about the Armenian Genocide and remove all references to the position that it did not happen, and then appeal to higher authorities or mediators when my edits are consistently removed. Caligvula himself has said that he is offended by the idea of Armenians being Europeans, so I don't see how merely stating his own self-described behavior is a personal attack.</dd>

<dd>I'll admit that I may not have used the best tone when speaking of Caligvula's actions, but I still believe it was relevant to point out that he has done many things that have been seen by members of the Wikipedia community as displaying a racist attitude against the Armenian people, and his own user page for some time featured a comment dispariging of Armenia, by putting it first on the list of country's he will "never visit." I don't understand InShaneee's accusations, as I don't see how I could troll my own talk page. Why would I try to disrupt my own page? It doesn't make sense. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 15:01, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a>, I apologise for inadvertently starting this disagreement, and did not mean to be insulting in any way. I'm only trying to resolve this matter with mutual agreement on both sides, which is my job as an advocate. Looking at the discussion on my talk page, it seems that you and Caligvla both concede the following sentence to be a fair compromise: <i>Armenia is situated at a cultural, historical, and religious intersection and located at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, in the southern Transcaucasus.</i> Will you therefore consent to this sentence replacing the following sentence in the Armenia article: <i>Culturally, historically and politically Armenia is considered part of Europe</i>. Please remember that I'm not trying to promote anyone's POV. I have no personal connection to Armenia, nor do I have an opinion on this issue; I'm just trying to establish a constructive consensus to make Wikipedia better and more accurate. That's my job. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17.16, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that's a fair compromise, although I would also include the sentence about Armenia being a transcontinental nation. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 21:06, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for being reasonable about this, and thank you for remaining civil throughout this dispute, unlike some other users. I will ask <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">User:The Myotis</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekleni_17fc.html" title="User:Tekleni">User:Tekleni</a>, also parties in this dispute, if they will accept this compromise as well. <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">User:Eupator</a> appears to be taking a rather more aggressive stance in relation to this issue, and has even deleted comments from my talk page without my permission. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've now opened a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_poll.html" title="Straw poll">straw poll</a> on my talk page concerning the proposed change. Please add your comments. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:11, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see, the straw poll has provoked equally strong support and opposition for the proposed changes. It's useful, if only to show that there are strong feelings on both sides of this debate - but it sends us back to square one, in that the opposition from <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">User:Eupator</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Myotis_b44b.html" title="User:The Myotis">User:The Myotis</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">User:Hectorian</a> is strong enough that I don't have a mandate to make the changes. As such, having failed to find a compromise of my own, I'm now inviting everyone else to suggest one. We need to find a way of saying, in a way that no one finds offensive, that Armenia is both in Asia and in Europe and that the domestic political situation reflects links with both continents. Any ideas would be welcomed. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 12:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given the complete deadlock on this issue, and the failure of the strawpoll, I think the time has come to take the dispute-resolution process to the next level by opening a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Request_for_comment.html" title="Request for comment">request for comment</a>. This will open the debate up to the whole Wikipedia community, and hopefully generate, if not consensus, then at least a majority view.

A nationality just doesnt forget its name, or change names sometime in their history, it doesnt work that way. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 17:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not saying that Armenians <i>are</i> Phrygians. I'm saying that the Greeks believed them to be Phrygians. Whether or not it is true that the Armenians have some relation to the Phrygians is really irrelevant to the sentence you removed the information from. This is simply what the Greeks of the time thought, and it is referenced in George Bournoutian's <i>Concise History of the Armenian People</i>. I hope this clears up the issue. <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 18:01, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello i removed a unsourced statement that Armenians were involved in the massacre is there any references stating that they were? Nareklm 01:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Armenians weren't involved in the particular massacre, but Armenians are alleged to have taken part in other atrocities during the war, most notably the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khojaly_Massacre_2d3e.html" title="Khojaly Massacre">Khojaly Massacre</a>. - <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 13:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah the newest refs you added theres nothing on the Maraghar Massacre its in the town of shusha? Nareklm 20:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm simply noting that both sides of the Nagorno-Karabakh war have claimed that the other has committed atrocities against civilians, so as to set a neutral tone to the article. - <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 21:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But this is not revelant with the current article. Nareklm 21:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, it is relevant in that it presents the Maraghar Massacre as being part of a pattern of massacres that occurred during the war. - <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 22:02, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I see where your coming from but saying that both sides were involved in the massacre is misinforming with no accurate sources stating that i can do that with the other articles but I've never seen anywhere saying that Armenians were involved in this massacre it was mostly only Khojaly. Nareklm 22:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My intention was to state that both sides are alleged to have committed massacres during the war, not in the area of Maraghar. I changed the word "conflict" to "war." I hope this makes the sentence less ambiguous. - <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 22:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that Caroline Cox has an Armenian bias, however, calling her a "quest of Armenian seperatists," whatever that is supposed to mean, seems in itself aggressive to me. I'd prefer a more neutral, objective wording, such as mentioning that she is an honorary member of Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh, and that she has been described as a friend of Armenia by the ambassador to the U.S. -- <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustgrahl_dc72.html" title="User:Augustgrahl">Augustgrahl</a> 01:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
