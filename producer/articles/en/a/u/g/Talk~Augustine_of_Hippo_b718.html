Is it really accurate to describe his youth as "hedonistic"? In the Confessions he describes himself as being quieter and meeker than the other boys. Even with his mistress he seemed to be faithful. -Mike Kunz</p>

<p>Was saint Augustine a Berber&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, he was of Berber descent, his mother Monica, was a Berber. Her name derived from the Libyan deity Mon worshipped in the neighbouring town of Thibilis. Throughout his life, Augustine’s background as a Berber always remained an influential source on his thinking. However, we don’t have any information that Monica’s husband was a Berber too.--Rpetit212.158.75.197 11:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There has never been any doubt among historians regarding Augustine's <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber_people.html" title="Berber people">Berber</a> ethnicity. According most of them, not only was Thagaste a center of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber_people.html" title="Berber people">Berber</a> culture, but his own name, and those of his mother and son, are all either <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a>, or Berber-derived in their meaning. Monnica is a <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber_people.html" title="Berber people">Berber</a> name and Adeodatus, the name of Augustine's son is without doubt a Latinization of Iatanbaal (given by God). Ferguson mentions additional evidence of Augustine's Berber heredity, including the apparant "outsider's style" of his discussion of the Roman empire in "The City of God" and an nationalist attitude in the "Confessions". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_90.28.127.128_15c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/90.28.127.128">90.28.127.128</a> (talk) 17:04, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>It is rarely stated that Augstine's most famous work, namely the City of God, is utopian fiction. That posterity chooses to read his utopian fiction as 'proven' fact is a serious error. In particular, the unconscionable misinformation regarding Genesis 2 &amp; 3, and which he ad-libs in Chapters 12,13 and 14 of the City of God, should make everyone think thrice before accepting Augustine as an authority.

<dd>People may use wikipedia as a source for their college works or other studential works. If you add things that are mainly your beliefs, it will be difficult for those people to back their work with credible sources. Many people on this earth believe that Augustine was a very important person and hold him in high esteem and likewise a majority of people do believe that Augstine wrote important theological work. And <b>this</b> is what Wikipedia reports. We do not call the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> merely a work of fiction for the same reason, which is that we do not write our own opinions. <b>Please</b> read about <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, the perhaps most important principle on Wiki.</dd>

<dd>The edits you made were of controversial sort. It is fine and even encouraged to add important controversial material, but with sources to back it up. Obviously it would be something like "Several important theologians, such as N.N, N.N., and N.N., have argued that Augustine wrote work of fiction." (all though i doubt you will find those people) Who says, for instance, that the doctrine of original sin is mighty flawed as you claimed in your edited? Since it isn't "mighty flawed" to many people, we don't write it, no matter how sure <i>you</i> are that it is.

<p>I have just added a new section to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism_and_Christianity_c61a.html" title="Judaism and Christianity">Judaism and Christianity</a> on "love." It is just a stub of a section, hopefully others will add more about the Jewish notion. But I know that my characterization of the Christian notion is at best wildly incomplete. Perhaps among the contributors to this page there are some who could go over it and add whatever additional material, detail, nuance, explanation they think necessary. I am very concerned about not misrepresenting, or doing justice to, the Christian point of view. I also added a long quote from Maimonides to the section on Heaven and Hell; in fact, I did a rewrite a week or two ago. I know the Jewish position is well-represented but again I am concerned that in the process the Christian view may appear misrepresented or at least underrepresented. So, I'd be grateful if someone checked and made sure the Christian view(s) are accurately and sufficiently represented.

<p>I just have a comment on the the section dedicated to Augustine's passage on 'the Jews'. An anti-Semitic quote can be found for nearly every Ancient Christian Thinker; from the Apostles to Luther. It is certianly an unforunate legacy that we must deal with. My question is whether including this quote accurately represents Augustine, or if it merely discredits him. It is very unforunate that this was a part of his thinking, but I think including this with such promience distorts and ignores some of his more important contributions.</p>

<dd>By the rules of wikipedia you cant keep it out, even if you remove it, someone else will re-add it later. But you can put it into historical context, to show that it was not specific to Augustine but of everyone in that time. I had to do this for <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Carta_56fc.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>, see the section "Magna Carta and the Jews" for an example of what i mean by putting it into historical context. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 16:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I certainly think that if there is a section on Augustine and Judaism, more mention needs to be made of Augustinian "witness doctrine," which has significant impact on the way that Jews are treated throughout Medieval Christendom. While Augustine takes a negative view of Judaism--as did all his Christian contemporaries--he constructs Jews and Judaism in such a manner that, in his mind, their survival is critical to Christianity. In Living Letters of the Law, Jeremy Cohen links Augustinian witness doctrine very closely to the fate of medieval Jews, arguing basically that thinkers who followed Augustine favored (relatively) acceptable conditions for Jews, and thinkers who moved further from his views favored worse conditions. While the negative aspects of Augustine's views of Judaism are (justly) noted here, the positive (relative to other classical / medieval thinkers) aspects are not. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakrina_52f9.html" title="User:Makrina">Makrina</a> 06:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I found this misleading also, as the common doctrine of the ancients was that the Jews would be converted before the Eschaton (according to Revelation), and so any comments on Judaism are aimed at conversion, not anti-Semitism. Someone who knows more of this that I can edit the article and discuss it (perhaps doing so with other ancient authorities as well).</p>

<p>I recently came across an encyclical from Pope Leo XIII, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18111893_providentissimus-deus_en.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18111893_providentissimus-deus_en.html" rel="nofollow">PROVIDENTISSIMUS DEUS</a>. In it Pope Leo XIII quotes St. Augustine several times regarding interpretation of scripture. One passage in particular I found interesting was this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There can never, indeed, be any real discrepancy between the theologian and the physicist, as long as each confines himself within his own lines, and both are careful, as St. Augustine warns us, "<i>not to make rash assertions, or to assert what is not known as known.</i>"(51) If dissension should arise between them, here is the rule also laid down by St. Augustine, for the theologian: "<i>Whatever they can really demonstrate to be true of physical nature, we must show to be capable of reconciliation with our Scriptures; and whatever they assert in their treatises which is contrary to these Scriptures of ours, that is to Catholic faith, we must either prove it as well as we can to be entirely false, or at all events we must, without the smallest hesitation, believe it to be so.</i>"(52)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This quote may be useful in the 'Influence as a theologian and thinker' section, but I don't want to make any edits based on one quote and little understanding of Augustine's philosphies. Others more familar with the his philosophy may find the encyclical a useful source as to his influences. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbert_White_c9e3.html" title="User:Albert White">Albert White</a> 15:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section of the article dealing with the interpretation of Genesis is fine, but the second paragraph is a little odd. That Augustine was a creationist goes without saying, but the use of that particular quote is misleading. Augustine is specifically responding, as he does throughout <i>City of God</i>, to the views of pagan philosophers. Remember that the book is written to merge western and semitic traditions while disproving pagan ones, especially the Roman Civic Religion and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoicism.html" title="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>. So, this section is a means of disproving cyclical history theories. Follow the link to see just how all the contemporary context.</p>
<p>My problem with this section is that it is totally irrelevant and attaches associations to this Doctor that do not necessarily exist. Many young-earth creationists would even reject his allegorical interpretation. Augustine is exculsively speaking about the creation of Adam to AD419 - the Biblical history of humans. This is akin to the current doctrine of the RCC, while the idea of young-earth creationism as a distinct movement is the result of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> and <i>sola scriptura</i> literalism. He was just saying that <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesiod.html" title="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>, and his ilk were wrong in disputing the Bible by using invented texts. It is possible that if he were presented evidence, he would allow for many more years (But this kind of speculation is as bad as what I'm complaining about.</p>

<p>The section <i>Doctrine of Original Sin</i> is misleading and erroneous. It is ascribing Calvinism to Augustine (namely, that God predestines the reprobate to Hell), which is incorrect. The source of the quote (a book by Bertrand Russell, an agnostic and strong critic of religion) is furthermore highly unreliable. I have thoroughly corrected the section now based on the 1914 Catholic Encyclopedia.</p>

<p><br />
Here is some of what the article currently says in the "doctrine of original sin" section:</p>
<p>"His idea of predestination rests on the assertion that God has foreseen, from time immemorial, all the choices every person who would ever live on Earth would make, and whether they would cooperate with Grace or not. The number of the people God knows would be saved are the elect, the number who God knows will not be saved are the reprobate. God has chosen the elect certainly and gratuitously, without any previous merit (ante merita) on their part. Yet Augustine also maintains firmly that it is God's will to save all men. God does not destroy human liberty and free choice, but preserves it, so that the elect would, potentially, have the full power to be damned and the non-elect full power to be saved. … Augustine's theory of predestination was misunderstood by both the Semipelagianists and John Calvin as teaching double predestination, ie. that God had already explicitly decided who would be saved and who would be damned and predestined them to this fate, in a way that does not leave room for free will, personal choice and cooperation with Grace."</p>
<p>The article seems to imply that Catholic Encyclopedia of 1914 (which has a paragraph-long block quote) interpretation is correct, and Calvin's interpretation is wrong. Did the Catholic Encyclopedians talk with Augustine's ghost and find out what he was really trying to say? Is there a reason that we can authoritatively say that "Augustine's theory of predestination was misunderstood by both the Semipelagianists and John Calvin as teaching double predestination"? Is there encyclopedically valid proof that that isn't what Augustine was really trying to say? Did Calvin read a bad translation?</p>
<p>I am not an expert on this subject, but the article basically calls Calvin's reading of the text a misinterpretation. Is there proof that this interpretation is incorrect? We can't get Augustine to give us a signed letter clarifying what he was trying to say. -Todemo</p>
<p>The Catholic Encyclopaedia quotation is accurate, but the content of the encyclopaedia itself seems questionable to me. I checked a couple the quotations (commentary on Psalms 73 and 102) against the Christian Classics Etheral Library, and could find neither. See, for example, this CCEL link: <a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-08/npnf1-08-109.htm#P2551_2539172" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-08/npnf1-08-109.htm#P2551_2539172" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. NigelCunningham 00:08, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Made an NPOV dispute for this section only. I would like to see us get a quotation from somewhere else other than the Catholic Encyclopaedia, since it appears (unless someone wants to correct me) to have fabricated the quotations (see previous comment).

<p>This provides a capsule introduction, but it's certainly not above the level of what a college student should know about Augustine. Also, the organization of the article could be improved - the links between Augustine's doctrines of original sin and concupiscence (lust, essentially) should be brought out more (and sources used besides <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>); the main thought section seems like a grab bag, and is partly redundant with later sections. Finally, the ways in which his thought was appropriated by later opposing traditions, such as the Thomistic and Calvinistic readings (not to mention Bernard of Clairvaux) deserve a section.</p>
<p>Still, the article is better than the last time I worked on it. My compliments to those who've been working to bring it to this point. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdonovan_0e0a.html" title="User:Edonovan">Evan Donovan</a> 04:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lostcaesar, sorry for my edit note about "extensive discussion", the discussion actually happened off-page, in user talk pages, and it wasn't as extensive as I remembered it&#160;:)</p>
<p>Basically the problem is this: some editors want to remove the mention of "catholic" and use "Christian" instead, seeing as how this is a period before the Eastern and Western Churches had split, and the use of the word Catholic carries a lot of connotations that shouldn't be pushed that far back.. an anachronism. So an edit note is needed to clarify why catholic is being used, and which version of the word catholic is being used (lower-case). It was a compromise solution since some editors get confused about what is meant by "catholic" vs Catholic and the history of the church. I'll wait to hear your concern before changing back. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 18:06, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Augustine described himself as a Catholic, and his mother as one too. I don't see what the difficulty is. "Catholic" is a term employed meaningfully in a fourth century context, and likewise it has a meaning beyond just contrasting Greek Orthodoxy, or Arianism &amp;c. Neither is it really that different than it is used today, in fact its probably less anachronistic than using the term Christian, if we follow the same sense of schism and doctrinal development. Personally, this little note seems a bit like editorializing, and that's why it should just go. It seemed like editorializing when it was added, but I decided to let is slide, figuring that it was probably being advanced with someone who had strong personal convictions that were better left alone for a while. The reformers wanted to claim Augustine as a proto-protestant, and sort of anachronism hasn't died yet in some circles. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 18:35, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm actually that is incorrect. Catholic (could) mean something different then, then it does today. Back then, there had not yet been a split between eastern Orthodox and western Roman Catholicism. So today when you use the term "Catholic", it generally means "Roman Catholic", which would be incorrect when referring to Monica. As for "editorializing" - can you explain what you mean? Editorializing suggests there is some sort of "opinion" being expressed. There is no opinion, it is simply a clarification of the word, which has changed meaning between then and now. This whole problem started when various multiple editors tried to change "Catholic" to something else, because they (rightly) thought that it was confusing to suggest she was Roman Catholic before Roman Catholic even existed. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are overemphasizing the effect of the schism. There were various splits in antiquity between the Greek and Latin elements of the Church, resulting in continual reconciliation until the Middle Ages. There was always a Latin dimension of the Church, to which Monica belonged unquestionably. So I don't see the direct relevance of the schism. There were later schisms in the Latin Church also (such as the Reformation), but we wouldn't shy from calling Monica a Christian, even though the later splits in Christianity were doctrinal, whilst the Great Schism was not doctrinal, as both Greek and Latin authorities assert today. The editorializing is, frankly, the assertion that the Catholic Church did not exist in antiquity, acting as if the Catholic Church today is a different Church, not continuously existing historically since antiquity. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 22:42, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, please remove anything that says "The Catholic Church did not exist in antiquity". To your first point, keep in mind that we are dealing with the general reader (and editor) who may not have the nuanced understanding you do about the many vicissitudes of "catholicism" though history, and only understand it from the widely known version that we know today - thus the note for clarification. If this was not the case, we would not have an article called <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">catholic</a> which discusses "Catholic" versus "catholic", not would we have had the previous editorial disputes (with other editors) about using "Catholic", "catholic" or "Christian".

<dd><i>Monica would have called herself a catholic.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The problem is that this implies that the modern sense of Catholic with a cap "C" it describing a different institution than the one Monica belonged to. That the Catholic Church is more developed today than in antiquity seems simple enough — the same could be said for Christianity in general — but its the same Church. You seem to say that, calling St. Monica a "Catholic" implies something false, but I don't see what that falsehood is. She was a Latin Catholic Christian. If someone reads that and thinks "Roman Catholic", they would be right. The adjective "Roman" only came to be applied to the term "Catholic" after the Reformation, not the Great Schism, and was used by Latin Christians who had broken from the Church to represent their own new ecclesiology. If we had to apply a modern label to Monica, and we insisted on using post-Reformation terms (rather than post schism, wherefore the adj. "Latin" would be more apt) it would be Roman Catholic; there is, of course, no reason to do this — "Catholic" will suffice — but the risk of confusing this with "Roman Catholic" is inconsequential since, in modern terminology, they represent the same thing (lest we impose Reformation ecclesiology on the fourth century!). <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 15:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Just War" is a theory subscribed to by Augustine and taken up by the Catholic Church; however, it is in direct contradiction to the foundation of the Church.
