<h2><span class="mw-headline">Domestic support for the coup</span></h2>
<p>Okay, i'm DEFINITELY not neutral here, but I'm somewhat skeptical of how NPOV is the passage beginning</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A large fraction of the population expected an intervention of the military to end the chaos caused by Allende's economic policies and foreign-backed domestic political opposition to them, culminating in a national transport owners' strike.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Specifically, the use of the word "expected" suggests "wanted" - is this true? I would hardly think so.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, it is true, there were celebrations after the coup. Even people that became oppositor to Pinochet after it was clear he was going to stay a long time, considered at first a welcome change. It doesn't say a mayority, though, just " a large fraction". I guess it was at least in the tenths, but I don't have hard data about that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also the passage suggests that the economic chaos is entirely the result of Allende's policies, and somewhat glosses over concerted efforts by business interests to make Allende pay for his decisions. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraft_fc33.html" title="User:Graft">Graft</a> 16:29 Oct 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that. It says "foreign-backed domestic opposition to them". The internal opposition had to do with the economical chaos too, and they received money from abroad. i don't see how that puts all the blame on Allende.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AN</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Torture on Spaniards</span></h2>
<p>34 cases of torture of spanish citizens in a few months? I don't think so.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Spanish charged him, eventually, with 94 counts of torture, but they were people of a wide variety of nationalities. This was justified under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which says that any state can prosecute it regardless of where it took place or against whom. Similar idea to the "crimes against humanity" thing that allows the trial of Slobodan Milosevic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The British 1988 Criminal Justice Act was when this convention entered into force in Britain, so this is why they stuck to charges alleged to have taken place after that time. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">Paul Drye</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><i>Bloodiest</i> coup</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure i'm willing to take BBC's word that the 1973 coup was the "bloodiest in 20century southamerica". The actual fighting was little. All branches of the armed forces supported the coup, the were no "loyal forces" defending Allende, except for Allendes personal guard the "GAP" (Group of Personal Friends) (and maybe a few others). The actions were on large scale because more resistance was expected. If the idea is to consider not only the coup itself, but also the aftermath, to compute the number of casualties, Argentina's "Guerra Sucia" (Dirty War) had several times the number of deaths and dissaperances. I'd said that what it did have was one of the largest (if not "the" largest) psycological impact: the fall of a democratically elected socialist president in a country with a long democratic tradition. --<a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a></p>

<p>The "Rettig Commission" official name was "Comision Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliacion" , National Commision of Truth and Reconciliation. It was created by the government of President Patricio Alwayn, and its aim was to "establish the most complete frame about the most serious violations to the humans rights with result of death or dissapereance, performed by agents of the State or particulars with political purposes, to obtain infomation that would make posssible to identify the victims and establish their fate or location, to recommned reparations and reivindications that would be considered fair and those that should be adopted to prevent the ocurrence of new violations". The period under study was between September 11, 1973 and March 11, 1990. The Rettig report documented 2,920 cases of dissapearances and deaths (included in this number there is a small number of military killed in attacks by guerrilla forces).--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AN</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Euphemisms</span></h2>
<p>Regarding "terrorist attacks" -&gt; "violent attacks". Um, isn't violent redundant? "terrorist" told me something useful about the attack -- they're attacks against non-military and/or civilian targets. However, aren't pretty much <b>all</b> attacks violent? I realize you could have a "non-violent attack", but that's pretty much an oxymoron. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 23:01, Sep 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In this context, 'terrorist' is a POV-loaded term. Many saw Pinochet and his regime as an illegal entity of state-backed murderers. It is one thing to talk about those engaged in armed violence against a legally empowered state, where the state demonstrably has legal and constitutional legitimacy, as 'terrorists'. But it is more problematic where the 'state' is made up of a military junta that seized power contrary to law and was responsible for the death of tens of thousands, to describe their opponents who also practiced voilence as terrorist. Saying they engaged in violence is a statement of fact, calling them terrorists when they were acting against a military junta that had no democratic mandate, is dangerously judgmental. In their eyes they were the equivalent of those who fought against German control of France during WWII. I am not saying they were and I am not saying their actions were justified, but the situation under Pinochet was not akin to ETA fighting the democratic Spanish state, or the IRA fighting a democratically elected and accountable UK. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 00:36, 12 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Disappointments" id="Disappointments"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disappointments</span></h2>
<p>I have little dissapoints with the article:</p>
<p>1. The assasination intent against Pinochet by the Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez was the ONLY ONE intent in the 17 years of dictatorial government.</p>
<p>2. About the chilean opossition to Allende and the "economic chaos", thats very inexact. Allende wons the 1070's presidential ellections with a 36% (was no second election system in chilean constitution in 1970); at 1971 the government parties won the legislative ellections with a 42%, 6 percentile points more in just one year. The civil opossition was hard, but not come from active majorities; come from high-level chilean and US enterprises and who sabotage the government with a deploy block, stacking the production (for that was the US dollars, to support the blocking enterprises). The economic chaos come from this, and so the oposittion. Inclussive in this situation, with a terrible support crisis, the day of the coup d'etat great portions of the population come to the "industrial cordon's" (an industrial colective structure of the socialist democratic government) in expect of weapons to resist the military intervention. In fact, the popular support to Allende growth continually from 1970 to 1973 because the Allende's program prove to be very similar to the Christian Democracy party (the last party at the government). All this, of course, in the fragile atmosphere of crisis and conspiration who the enterprises generate.</p>
<p>About the discussion here, i just want to say two more things:</p>
<p>1. Was a hard resistance inside the chilean's army forces. It's not true that was no loyal forces to Allende. Great groups of the naval army was enclosed at Valparaiso port by the golpist, grat groups of the Carabineros (uniformed chilean police) and Investigaciones (chilean not uniformed police) resist in santiago, entire batallions of the terrestrial army was enclosed too at their cuartels, important groups of the air force was arrested in their own homes and incomunicated during the night before the attack, and a lot o loyal soldiers was executed; this assasinations do not figure in any lists because the chilean army statutes authorize vertical executions without judge at alert or emergency state. Anyway, the Pinochet coup has been named the "most bloody" not because numbers. Its because it's proved the sistematically planned assasination of people, and the coordinated use of assasinations and torture of great ammounts of people to generate social and political effects. In fact, from 1973 to 1985 in Chile was not a serious armed resistance; so the golpist force do not confront little armies; use planned assasinations series to dismount civil organizations killing great numbers of selected objectives. The practice of torture and assasination against civil organizations in latin america was common, but in the "crisis-control-mode", not in the periodic and constant model of the chilean golpist, who use them until at least 1987.</p>
<p>2. The FPMR - Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez - was an armed side of the Chilean Communist Party (PC). In Chile, the PC was the most moderate of the socialist coalition (Unidad Popular), and a republican party with a long democratic tradition. In fact, the FPMR organize it self at 1983, and operate first at 1985, after 12 years of cruel repression, torture, assasinations, people who's burned alive in the streets and pregned womens who're tortured until die, 12 years of day after day tryng a democratic way to change the situation. This guys, the FPMR, was primely young chileans who leave from their 7 to 9 years old under a hard repressive dictator. No one can say these guys was terrorist; in no one, really, NO ONE of the FPMR operations a civil was murdered, they NEVER use explosives in urban objectives and the few times who take hostages they where returned with no damage and telling about the polite manners of their captors. It's not possible to equal a patriotic resistance group against an illegal government supported by external interests with the ETA or similars.</p>
<p>You'll see, im not really neutral, i'm chilean (my english its very bad), but i think i know about my country history. I`m not socialist, but i've seen the FPMR history with my eyes and the historical context of their actions. It's because this I tell the FPMR its proudly remembered by a lot of chileans, not only socialist, even by important sectors of the chilean catholic church (the most "people-like", of course). They was a dignity bastion against repression when appeared to not exist hope.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe I'm all wrong about Pinochet, but check out <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChile_bdb0.html" title="Talk:Chile">talk:Chile</a> for the current state of the country.</p>
<p>My POV is that Pinochet stopped Allende from turning Chile into a Marxist dictatorship. Ah, if only Germany had someone who could have stopped Hitler from turning Germany into a fascist dictatorship!</p>
<p>Let's discuss how we can balance the two main POVs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pinochet is bad because he overthrew an "elected president"; and because he prevented socialists from establishing a worker's paradise; and because he brutally suppressed revolutionaries trying to overthrow his dictatorship; versus,</li>

<dd>Ed - you are embarking on revisionism. Pinochet expected to win the plebicte, otherwise he wouldn't have held it (just like Hitler in 1936). He was surrounded by sychophants who told him he would win. Many members of the opposition has just been executed after the attempt on Pinochet's life the previous year, the remainging figures in the opposition movement were not united. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 19:26, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good. Put that in the article! "Pinochet had no intention of giving up the perverse thrill of being a dictator. He thought that like Hitler he could consolidate his power by holding a special election that would forever trample democracy under his boots. In an incredible quirk of fate, democratic forces jerked the rug out from under him."</dd>

<dd>The plebiscite was programmed since 1980, it was among the transitory articles in the constitution aproved by referendum on that year (that also gave Pinochet 8 more year, so he was elected in a sense for the period 1981-1989). Pinochet didn't govern alone, the "Junta" (the other commanders in chief) were the only ones that could have prevented the plebiscite, and with difficulty, because it would have meant a constitutional reform. The "many members of the opposition executed" were three comunists (only a small part of the opposition) that didn't help important positions, and who were murdered, the crime was investigated. The opposition had access to free time on TV for the plebiscite, the same as the "yes" option (half an hour each everyday for a month or so). Of course there was unnoficial tv time for the yes option in news or so, but I don'tr think that that is so unusual. Recent versions say that Pinochet thought of not accepting the results, but he was not the sole ruler, the Junta would have had to approve a break of the constitution, and they didn't. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AstroNomer</a> 19:49, Mar 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The CIA, and the government of the US in general did contribute the the conditions that led to the coup, that is very well documented. It is also documented relation of the CIA with the repressive apparatus. But the involvement of the CIA in the coup itself is not documented anywhere. It might be in the still not declassified documents, but until they are declassified (if they exist) there is no proof of involvement of the CIA in the coup.

<dd>Give me a break...US and CIA support of the coup is not even a topic of dispute. I can go beyond that and say the US government handed the Chileans the name of American journalists and the like in Chile who were subsequently executed is not in dispute. The US also let the Chilean spooks come into the US and assassinate an American, Ronni Karpen Moffitt on a street in Washington DC during a time that they were assassinating Chilean exiles and pro-Chileans all over Europe as well, something the US government gave less of a damn about, although there is no smoking gun to speak of. But of course, someone was killing Chilean exiles and supporters all over the world and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. The US support of Chile's coup is braindead, you should stick to arguing about DINA's hit on Moffitt and the like. -- <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanpuk_d4ec.html" title="User:Hanpuk">Hanpuk</a> 17:55, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The best collection of declassified material can be found in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_Archive_63f4.html" title="National Security Archive">National Security Archive</a>, also online here: <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/latin_america/chile.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/latin_america/chile.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/latin_america/chile.htm</a>. The website collects numerous declassified documents that show US support for an overthrow of Allende and other measures to bolster a dictatorship in Chile. AstroNomer is correct that there is little direct evidence that the CIA had a hand in the actual coup, but that is not the issue - we are talking about the phrase "CIA supported", which is certainly warranted by the available evidence. To quote:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Cables written by U.S. Ambassador Edward Korry after Allende's election, detailing conversations with President Eduardo Frei on how to block the president-elect from being inaugurated. The cables contain detailed descriptions and opinions on the various political forces in Chile, including the Chilean military, the Christian Democrat Party, and the U.S. business community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>CIA memoranda and reports on "Project FUBELT"--the codename for covert operations to promote a military coup and undermine Allende's government. The documents, including minutes of meetings between Henry Kissinger and CIA officials, CIA cables to its Santiago station, and summaries of covert action in 1970, provide a clear paper trail to the decisions and operations against Allende's government</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>National Security Council strategy papers which record efforts to "destabilize" Chile economically, and isolate Allende's government diplomatically, between 1970 and 1973.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>State Department and NSC memoranda and cables after the coup, providing evidence of human rights atrocities under the new military regime led by General Pinochet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>FBI documents on Operation Condor--the state-sponsored terrorism of the Chilean secret police, DINA. The documents, including summaries of prison letters written by DINA agent Michael Townley, provide evidence on the carbombing assassination of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt in Washington D.C., and the murder of Chilean General Carlos Prats and his wife in Buenos Aires, among other operations.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now, as to whether it is justified to speculate about very direct involvement, I think the orders to the CIA station chief in Santiago, Henry Hecksher, are quite clear: "It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup." These operations were explicitly ordered to be conducted to hide the "American hand". Given that not all material is declassified, and given that the evidence is clear, informed speculation about direct involvement is certainly on solid ground and has a place in the article about the matter.</dd>

<dd>Informed speculation is on firm ground, and has a place in the article, no doubt about it. But do we want speculation on the first paragraph, that defines the article? I belive that the coup would have happened even without CIA involvement, (not so sure without the whole US involvement in international organizations) and given that, also, there is strong suggestion that Pinochet wasn't even involved in the planning until shortly before (lower officials in the Army, and the Navy and Air Force apparently did most of the planning) I do not like the impression that Pinochet was simply doing the CIA's bidding in the coup, epecially when there is no proof about that. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AstroNomer</a> 18:23, Mar 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with AstroNomer. The CIA role is a complex topic, and simply saying they "supported" it is not clear, and could be misconstrued as saying they supported Pinochet specifically. The CIA in fact claims they did not know about it until just before it happened, and barely knew who Pinochet was, so how could they "support" it, except in a vague sense that they wanted some sort of coup to happen (and in 1970)? By this standard, millions of people all over the world "supported" the coup, perhaps it was "<a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Brandt_7fb1.html" title="Willy Brandt">Willy Brandt</a>-supported". The <i>possible</i> influence of the CIA is discussed later on in fuller detail.

The 1980 constitution had thirty-four "transitional" articles that would only apply from 1980 until 1990, a time Pinochet had assured he'd be in power, and that were largely undemocratic. And I'm not denying the current system, but it has many faults, and most are due to the 1980 constitution ( ie. the undemocratic binomial legislative system.) --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a> 22:03, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have never said that the transitional articles were democratic, nor the military regime said that. The fact that Pinochet would be the president in that period and the military junta would be the legislative power was in those articles, as was the way in which at the end of the eight years of "transition" ( in which the proper laws that would regulate the functioning of the permanent institutions and political parties would have been enacted) the power would be returned to civilian rule. The description of the binomial system as "undemocratic" is subject to discussion.

<dd>If I may butt in, guys, I think Cantus has hit the nail on the head. The issue is what sort of government is considered "democratic". For some, it means (A) having a written constitution which provides for orderly transfers of power and/or provides for the dismissal and appointment of top official in response to votes cast by ordinary citizens. On this basis, US is generally considered the pioneer and champion. For others, it means (B) pursuing policies which socialists/Marxists, environmentalists, multilateralists, etc. APPROVE OF -- regardless of constitution or elections; in the latter sense, North Korea, Cuba and a dozen-odd states calling themselves "The People's Democratic Republic of This or That" are considered democratic.

<p>I was being a little tongue-in-cheek of course&#160;;) Obviously America is constitutionally a democracy (unless you're a strong believer in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>, perhaps) but I think its fair to say that many major policy issues are decided, or at least heavily influenced, by elites who persist in their influence despite changes of government. There is also a general right-wing bias to the media, which tends to marginalize whole spectrums of political thought and the people who represent them (although not being an American I don't have any very direct experience of the America media, but I do read American news websites fairly often). So you could quite plausibly argue that American democracy was little more than a legal technicality in many ways, though this is not to say that America isn't one of the most free (whatever exactly that means), democratic, etc. countries in the world — even Chomsky is quite clear on that point. Anyway, my point is that I think your original summary of opinion was incorrect: people who criticize America as undemocratic do not, generally, regard North Korea or Cuba as democratic. —<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></p>
<p>Hmm, one little thing. It's quite possible to democratically elect a government who have no concern for democracy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some POV in the intro introduced by Ed Poor's latest edits</span></h2>
<p>I have to say I rather preferred the article as it was (just so you see where I'm coming from here...) Anyway, here's a list of POV stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Was the overthrow of Allende "anti-democratic" (as critics charge) or "democracy-preserving" (as supporters maintain)?</i>" — Oversimplified. Do we know that <i>all</i> his supporters maintain he was a democrat, and that <i>all</i> his detractors do not?</li>
<li>"<i>Did Pinochet's economic policies help the country (as free market advocates generally claim) or hurt it (as socialism advocates charge)?</i>" — Not so bad, but far too bipolar. You don't have to be a socialist to object to Pinochet's economic reforms (you could just as well be a Keynesian, for example), and are we so sure that a significant majority of free market economists liked them either? The article identifies his economic policy quite specifically with Friedman and the Chicago Boys, not free market capitalism in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally this article has far too much of this "socialists/working class people hated him and everyone else thought he was great" stuff (not that all of this is down to Ed, it's a general comment). I have to say Wikipedia is the first place I've ever heard a good word uttered about the man; let's try not to make it look as if opposition to Pinochet is an exclusively left/liberal position. --<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></p>

<dd>Thank you for your thoughtful observations. I was at least trying to <b>mention</b> the fact that there is controversy. Rather than just saying he's obviously a bad guy. If I've over-simplified the controversy, it's due to my numerous and lengthy conversations with campus radicals dating back to the mid-1970s. The left demonizes Pinochet as "anti-democratic, CIA-supported, anti-poor butcher" for daring to overthrow an "elected socialist". It's part of their argument that people would vote for socialism if only the capitalists would let them; in other cases, they must OVERTHROW the ruling class to get their rights.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although I am trying to follow the NPOV, I (obviously) subscribe to the opposite POV: i.e., that democracy and free markets get people their rights MUCH better than socialism and dictatorship.</dd>

<dd>I'm open to suggestions; but please don't revert ALL of my work -- just the mistakes, okay? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 20:32, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't planning on reverting it all, don't worry&#160;;) I sort of see where you're coming from regarding the campus radicals, but try it like this: replace "elected socialist" with "elected government" and their argument seems a lot better, IMO. I guess the point is that Chile did have a democratically elected government before Pinochet took over — and in fact the people <i>did</i> vote for socialists when given the chance, on that occasion. So, even if you didn't like Allende's government at all, the coup is hard to justify purely in terms of bringing democracy. The thing about your POV which I disagree with is the association of socialism with dictatorship and free markets with freedom in general. I do repsect that POV — it's not completely crazy by any means — but I think it may be responsible for some (fairly subtle) bits of POV in the article (as I outlined in my previous comment). You can be an opponent of socialism/Communism, a supporter of democracy and of free trade, and still have numerous perfectly legitimate objections to Pinochet, although if you held these views you <i>might</i> be inclined to see him as the lesser of two evils. I think the lesser of two evils POV may be what yours is, at a guess, i.e. you are more anti-Allende and anti-Communism than pro-Pinochet. I'd like to suggest a strategy for summarising the various POVs on Pinochet, which I think we're both making an honest effort to do. It might be better not to try and characterise in terms of supporters' and detractors' overall POVs in the introduction, which tends to distort the POV spectrum towards extremes, but rather mention specific aspects of his policy individually in the intro. For example: "His economic reforms were inspired by so-and-so and were less well regarded by X, Y and Z" — that sort of thing. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">That compromise</span></h2>
<p>I remember that once there was this notion that on Wikipedia we tried to resolve disputes in consensus, rather than by voting, whenever possible. I had made such an attempt back in March in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Augusto_Pinochet&amp;oldid=2837528" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Augusto_Pinochet&amp;oldid=2837528" rel="nofollow">this revision</a>, which describes the situation with regard to the evidence for US/CIA involvement in a little more detail in the intro. That proposal was quickly reverted by Cantus with the argument that the intro shouldn't mention it at all since it takes so much space to explain and is so controversial. The simple fact is that two words like "US backed" are not enough to describe the issue in a sufficiently NPOV manner that is acceptable to both sides. So we should use a few more words. This is 100% compatible with the guidelines at <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a>.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:53, Apr 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>VV, the US support after his rise to power is not "alleged". The US support for a coup to get rid of Allende is not "alleged". These are <i>facts</i>. What is less well known is the precise role of the United States in the September 11, 1973 coup because the relevant documents are classified.

<dd>The intelligence community surveyed the documents recently and concluded the US "did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency" (see ref in text). At any rate, it was an attempt to balance all sides; in fact that sentence was a revised version (not by me) of a compromise, as I feel the involvement or not of the US can be relegated to the gigantic discussion section below. If you have better wording you should try it out; at least we're talking about it.

<dd>You seem to be dodging the question of the appropriateness of 172's unilateralness and abusiveness. Yes, I wholly concede that the CIA under orders of Nixon sought ways to overthrow Allende in 1970. There is nothing to indicate they wanted what happened in 1973 to occur, nor even less that they had anything to do with it. Indeed, they may have been happier waiting for the next election and trying to sink Allende then. Yes, I do take the CIA's word for it, and at any rate flatly contradicting them in the intro is a violation of NPOV. Next, when saying the US "supported" Pinochet after he came to power, we have to be very careful what we mean. It does <i>not</i> mean they supported everything he did or agreed with all of his actions. We arguably "support" Taiwan right now, but that does not mean we sign off on all their policies. By saying things like "the US supported the right-wing military dictator of Chile", one is deliberately blurring important distinctions as to what was and what was not supported and why and how and under what conditions, and thus painting the US as the evil boogeyman (obviously the goal). If we just stick to the <i>undisputed facts</i>, such as the CIA section of the article mostly does, we should be okay. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 22:02, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing to indicate they wanted what happened in 1973 to occur? The CIA cable from 1970 - "It is firm and <i>continuing</i> policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup. It would be much preferable to have this transpire prior to 24 October but efforts in this regard <i>will continue vigorously beyond this date</i>.... It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG and American hand will be well hidden." - has never been revoked and as such can be taken to be still in effect by 1973, under the <i>same government</i>. And if they wanted "the American hand" to be hidden then, there's no reason to believe they don't want it to be hidden now. A phrase like "The CIA claims .. but documents show .." is perfectly acceptable in terms of NPOV, BTW.</dd>

<dd>As for what <i>support</i> means, I'm sure that semantic discussion will be interesting to the mothers whose daughters were abducted, raped and murdered, and to the children whose parents were tortured and killed by the junta. <i>Support</i> means just that: The US didn't like Allende's socialist policies, so they sought to overthrow him, and found an acceptable replacement in a fascist junta with no moral concerns whatsoever, which - how convenient - also used its police state to get rid of any "socialist" insurgency within the country. The US built strong economic, military and economic ties with Pinochet's terror government over the next decades. Of course you can claim that it was "the lesser of two evils" (a dubious claim even to the most credulous). This does not explain why there needs to be any evil in the first place, and why Chile, Afghanistan, Iran, Guatemala could not have been transformed into democracies in the style of Germany or Japan, through education, diplomacy and economic aid, instead of replacing the respective socialist/social democratic movements with fascists and fundamentalists.</dd>

<dd>(de-indenting) You have not addressed the 172 behavior issue, still. I'm glad we agree on keeping this article on focus. Your opinions of the US's motives (and others') are your own and I assume you realize that; I have my own opinions, too (were we in a position to install a Japan-style gov't?), but I'm not putting them in the intro. These are complex subjects, and to fully elaborate requires lots of detail, including the documents you noted, which could be an article of its own, in fact its own encyclopedia. That's why almost anything stated in a short intro on, recall, the <i>man</i> Pinochet will be troublesome unless it leaves a lot of room for all POVs. My final note is that documents from 1970 may talk about the future, but they're written before it and so do not prove what policies actually came to pass. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:41, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not recognize the "results" of this "election" as certifying a "winner". If for no other reason than vote-tampering. 172 complained that his posts had been removed (I haven't checked, but I assume good faith on his part&#160;:-). Also, <b>my "vote" was changed</b> from:</p>

<li>mention "US-backed" only if tagged as a POV; to</li>
<li>do not mention "US-backed" at all</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes no sense for whoever refactored this talk page to have me voting both FOR and AGAINST the same thing. It makes me look contradictory (at best).</p>
<p>Secondly, I think Eloquence is right about the <b>principle</b> of the matter: "resolve disputes in consensus, rather than by voting, whenever possible".

<dd>I think the situation is similar to before: Everyone is willing to discuss it and work constructively, except 172, who insists his intro and his alone is the only possible one. Otherwise, something close to a delicate consensus had been painstakingly reached between the partisans throughout several weeks. It's not clear whether 172 will bother to continue harassing (trolling?) this article against everyone else (his repeated promises to leave forever notwithstanding); he may have felt he "won" by gaining the protection. Anyway, see the discussion above for details. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 06:26, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Protecting the top revision is a generally accepted practice. Regardless, I am still not clear what we are arguing about. Brevity? If so, some of the facts you have added are equally at disposition. Style? I'm sure the second paragraph could use improvements in that department. NPOV? NPOV is a delicate balance and depends on both sides acknowledging each other's beliefs instead of merely asserting their own as fact. Maybe you should tell us what you find the <i>most</i> problematic about the current intro, so that we can work from that to find a compromise that you will find acceptable?--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 05:44, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This kind of "rhetoric" is inevitable when dealing with controversy. You can't write any Wikipedia article like you would write a book or a paper; I know you often do, but the reason you can is that you tend to write on subjects about which few other people have an informed opinion. Here, on the other hand, many Wikipedians do have an opinion, and they would like to see it represented in the article (and its intro). The proper way to do that is to use NPOV language, which you call "rhetoric". I too would prefer "pure facts", but by NPOV standards, this would mean that we couldn't even <i>touch</i> upon anything controversial in the intro, which would give a warped picture of the person Pinochet, who <i>is</i> controversial and, yes, subject of different "mythologies".--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 06:00, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've stated elsewhere that I minimize my involvment on articles where VV is a prominent editor. My opinion on 172's habits is also known. If it weren't for this, I would happily have contributed more actively in both reasoning and editing of this article. It touches one of the most important aspects, beside the dual-decission and Papadopoulos' coup, of West-European impressions of the US (and her foreign politics) and the dwindling <i>identification</i> with the US (supporters of PFLP and Viet Cong don't count as they were pure leftists who saw the US as the incarnation of the devil no matter what). I don't know if Wesley Clark is considered unreliable after his attempt to get nominated for the Democrats, but in his recent <i>Winning Modern Wars</i> he states on pp 182-183 (in my print):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Throughout the Cold War, the United States was challenged to maintain its high principles abroad in the face of the Soviet threat. Some mistakes were made, and the United States gradually lost some of its moral edge, creating adversaries and doubters. Worried about potential Soviet encroachments into the Middle East, the United States deposed an Iranian leader and replaced him with an unpopular shah. Siding against a Soviet-oriented India, the United States distanced itself from the world's largest democracy. Fearing a Marxist takeover of Chile, the United States backed Chilean military action to throw out the democratically elected Marxist leader, Salvador Allende. In Central America the United States fought for almost a decade against Marxist-inspired governments and guerrillas using CIA and special forces personnel, as well as local movements — a struggle that succeeded, but at enormous human costs, with additional human rights violations and illegal government activities. A semantic distinction was often made between totalitarian regimes, which we opposed, and regimes that were merely authoritarian, which could serve U.S. interests — but it was an uncomfortable distinction, never fully accepted across the American political spectrum.</i></dd>

<dd>In 1973, after the Allende government moved to introduce Socialist ideals into the predominantly Roman Catholic education system, and after the leader of the Socialist party called for a barracks rebellion against senior officers, the military broke its tradition of being apolitical and staged a bloody coup, backed by Washington. <a href="http://www.remember-chile.org.uk/comment/00-12-31nyt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.remember-chile.org.uk/comment/00-12-31nyt.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<p>I think Allende had the project to create a national education system. Some wrote "in the East German way" but this could also be in the "French way". One thing that bother me is that Allende critics consider him as an evil Marxist-Leninist while for me it seems clear that Allende project was more similar to the French Socialist Party platform of the time. According to many sources François Mitterrand was very worried in 1981 about the risk of a "Chilean scenario" in France. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 21:23, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Nixon administration wanted to get rid of Allende they had contact with Chilean high rank officers, they had a plan for elimination of marxists or so-called marxists in South America and they had policies to destabilize Allende this is uncontroversial OK&#160;? This has to be mentioned there. I'm in favor of being precise, let's devellop the role played by the CIA and the US administration in the fall of Allende instead of writing "the CIA backed the coup". Of course nobody will never find a written order of the CIA to Pinochet, they're not so stupid. I will oppose to any formulation like "some believe than the CIA backed the coup while other believe they were gently neutral". They were not neutral and made everything they could do to bring a coup, but Pinochet was probably not simply CIA puppet. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 01:54, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that there is some truth in this. The CIA did have a hand in the coup against Allende, but to what extent is uncertain.

The issue of what should be in the introduction has already been resolved.

<dd>I've had nothing to do with your silly partisan flame wars over this article. Whatever had been going on before I stepped in (and I could care less), the intro required a rewrite. I scrapped the bullshit from both groupings of partisans - pro-Pinochet and anti-Pinochet - and replaced it with a concise and factual intro. If that makes you uncomfortable, you'll probably have to bear it. WP is an encyclopedia, not a toy and a soapbox.

<dd>Indeed, it is unfortunate that some unbelievers refuse to recognize you as the oracle of truth that you undoubtably are, 172. But since this is a Wiki, not a religious text, I'm afraid you must be content to let the vulgar masses trample on your tasteful and factually pure edits from time to time. The phrase "US-backed" is controversial, because although the US undoubtably supported some kind of coup to depose Allende, there is no clear evidence that they supported <i>the actual coup that happened</i>. It is not your rewriting of the intro that we object to (as you well know), but your insistence that the highly controversial and not-entirely-factual phrase "Us-backed" be included in it, despite the detailed discussion of the various POVs in the rest of the article. Your callous attitude to the discussion between other Wikipedians ("and I could care less") shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the Wikipeida project. Articles are revised by consensus, and your edits go against a clearly established consensus. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

In any case, your analogy is misleading because leaving the phrase "US-backed" out of the intro doesn't even mention the POV that the US didn't back it, so we're not wasting any space or giving unecessary prominence to minority views.

<p>The implications of the intro that I keep restoring imply don't imply anything that isn't implied by the "compromise" version. For example, "U.S.-backed" does not imply, e.g., "U.S.-orchestrated," "U.S.-engineered," "U.S.-planned," "U.S.-plotted." In other words, it does not delineate the extent and scope of U.S. backing in and of itself. I have one question, though. Is the meaning of "U.S.-backed" is commonly misunderstood among people for whom English is not a native language? If so, I wasn't aware. If this happens to be the case, I'm willing to work around it. A footnote would be the proper course of action, not an off topic tangent in the intro. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:32, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, (now 172 has reverted my edits — which is fair enough I suppose). I think that what 172 means by "US-backed" is factually accurate and NPOV, but I think the phrase, as used in the current intro, makes it sound too much like the US-supported Pinochet directly. The footnote helps with this, but the intro should be self-contained — you shouldn't have to read a big section of the main article in order to understand what it means. This is why I favour keeping any reference to the US out of the intro altogether (unless the intro is considerably expanded, as per Eloquence's edits). However,, I'm perfectly happy to accept a reference to the US in a shorter intro if some slightly less ambiguous phrasing can be found. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>The intro is straightforward and accurate, two polls affirmed the intro, and there's even a compromise note to prevent misunderstanding. The disputes should be brought to an end now.

<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with the intro before 172 started trolling. The "wordiness" was a red herring; an article this length can afford a few dozen words in the intro, in complete sentences (you know, with verbs). The only questionable part was that relating to the US and the coup; this already has a gigantic section, and we do not need to take sides in the intro. The footnote is particularly ridiculous, when there is an <i>article</i> which says the same thing. The version we'd worked out gives a clear, concise, neutral description of Pincohet's rise, rule, fall, and perceived legacy. A new version of the short note about the US has been put in; the reader can read more later about it in the extensive coverage. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 02:05, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC) (This comment was added after edit conflict with Ruhrjung.)</p>

<dd>That is very definitely your POV, which I equally definitely do not share. But this is not what about what either of us think. That's why I favor the language noting a "relationship" with the US. The details and points of view on that complex relationship can then be addressed later. As I've noted, I don't even see the need to mention the US at all so early on (this is about Chile, mostly), but if it must be there, it should not presume any one person's opinion. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 04:19, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

"Relationship", on the other hand, is unnecessarily ambiguous, because we <i>know</i> a lot more than this phrase suggests. Again, alternative suggestions are welcome, but a brief summary of what is currently mostly in the "CIA role" section needs to be in the intro; a good <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> should summarize all key aspects of an article, and this is one of them.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 04:28, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Re recent alterations.) What's wrong with the language I had about "support for his government"? That's neatly neutral between whether the US installed him (the far-left view) or merely offered him some support once in power? The details can wait for the (giant) section below. Mentioning the US "support for a coup against Allende" is redundant and confusing and not really about <b>Pinochet</b> at all.

<dd>Well, if your only complaint is that it is <i>redundant</i>, then I think we are firmly in NPOV territory&#160;;-). I think this belongs into the intro about an article about Pinochet because it is one of the key pieces of evidence in the history of the coup - Project FUBELT, "it is firm policy .." etc. Even if you see no connection, you have to acknowledge that this is where many people <i>do</i> see a connection and a continuity.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 04:49, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The constitution part seems pretty important to me, and it's only a few words.

<dd>You are forgetting that we are not reporting "the truth" (according to you or me) but what people see as the truth. The United States are widely seen to be responsible for Pinochet's rise to power, and as I said, the support for a coup against Allende is one key piece of evidence in that argument. To avoid getting too deep into the controversy, we briefly note <i>just the key facts</i> in the intro. How these facts are interpreted by the different sides is a matter for the main article.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 05:16, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can live with the "many believe" approach regarding the CIA role (for the intro only). As for the human rights violations, I think they definitely belong into the intro.

<dd>I don't see the point of having a new poll; it will simply turn into another ideological head count, and I for one would not accept any result that the article should push a controversial POV. The neutrality guidelines are clear on this point. 172's trolling (pushing controversial, inflammatory content) should be seen for what it is and not taken seriously.

<p>The <i>immunity</i> part is not completely correct. Congresspersons in Chile only enjoy a partial immunity, meaning that their prosecution must be authorized first by a higher court in order for a cause to continue. In the case of Pinochet, after he returned from Great Britain, he did lose his parlamentary protection by decision of a court.

<dd>I am sympathetic, and I'm not saying that this situation is your fault. But the simple truth is that when we've got to the point where we've had three near-identical revert wars, it's clear that there's going to have to be more discussion. I agree your intro was based on a consensus, but it was by no means supported by <i>everyone</i> except 172. We could at least try to hash out something that everyone except 172 thought was acceptable, although obviously a true consensus would be preferable. A few more points...
<ul>
<li>172 may or may not be trolling. Either way, saying that he is isn't going to help.</li>
<li>Your two intros are (if you stand back a bit) virtually identical. It's completely crazy that the difference between them could cause this much animosity. I'm not sure that anyone even disagrees on the basic facts (i.e. we all accept that there's no inconteastible proof of US support for Pinochet's actual coup, even though there definitely was support for <i>a</i> coup.)</li>

The reverting started when 172 refused to accept any other than his own. You must be aware by now of 172's tactics; recall this is someone who told you to "fuck off" not a few weeks ago. If I thought there was any credible Wikipedia apparatus for ending the madness on this page, I would take it. But I have tried them all - consensus building, third-party admins, RfC pages, quickpolls - without avail. (Okay, except mediation, which I have, as I <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EEloquence_b8a8.html" title="User talk:Eloquence">promised</a>, been reading up on, but remain doubtful of.) It seems when dealing with the likes of 172 one must use equal force if one's edits are to not be consigned to the dustbin of page history as soon as they are submitted. (I should also note I generally do back off a bit if even modest signs of possible good faith compromise appear, as I did earlier today on the Soviet history page.) -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:38, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's there to discuss? VeryVerily and I share absolutely no common ground, so I doubt that he'll ever be able to stop snipping at me. We simply hold fundamentally incompatible conceptions of NPOV. He demands that the text pay lip service to his narrow, knee jerk, rightwing Americentric worldview, irrespective of whether or not it bears any relationship with realit, whereas I could care less. This has been patently obvious on this page, where he has been demanding for months that the introduction not contextualize the 1973 coup, regardless of my attempts to enumerate a reality with which he is uncomfortable, and again regardless of my efforts to promote a footnote to check the possibilities of readers' misconstruing the scope of U.S. involvement. In contrast, my view of NPOV is more epistemological than emotional. I favor linking the actions and motives of historical actors to the social/economic/political context in which action occurred, and a narrative voice inclined to reserve moral judgments. Hence, in this particular context, I favor a concise and factual intro, consigning the partisan rhetoric to history, in other words to a matter of agency, which was bound together in struggle <i>historically</i> in which this ideological contention emerged. I am **not** concerned with the circular arguments of the people squabbling still over whether or not the '73 coup was justified, and whether or not Pinochet's a "good guy" or a "bad guy" in the context of the values of U.S. political culture. And BTW, notice that my intro skirts a number of can of worms usually opened up by leftwing users in order to take shots at the legitimacy of Pinochet's regime. The page history attests that I have also stood in the way of users attempting to cast him as mythical villain, who scrapped a 'democratically elected government' in favor of a 'brutal tyranny.' Instead, why not look at this coup, say, as a part of broader political pattern in South America in the 1960s and 1970s, which saw military takeovers reverse in Brazil (1964), Argentina (1966), Chile (1973), Uruguay (1973), and Argentina again in 1976 (civilian rule was restored in 1973)?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm being too pedantic for the purposes of Wikipedia, but I think that if users want to pit a mythical villain against a romanticized savior of Chile, they can wrangle over this in the legacy section. But why not stay straightforward and factual in the intro? Speaking for myself, when I'm referring to an encyclopedia, I'm looking for an informative, factual write-up, as opposed to seeking some reaffirmation of a mythology that I find reassuring. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:55, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I fail to see how your intro is any more "factual" than the current (protected) one. Calling other people's views "mythologies" is one particular point of view, it is not <i>the truth</i>. NPOV is the balance of different views, some of which may be mythological, some of which may be factual. NPOV is <i>not</i> a "middle ground", that is a common misconception (the middle ground is itself a POV which must be treated like any other), and it is also not the avoidance of controversy. As for the argument of conciseness, I have already addressed this. <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> very much allows for an intro of the present length.
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that NPOV is a "middle ground" - that would be even worse than what VeryVerily's promoting. I'm just stressing historical context and scholarly consensus, but perhaps I should just drop that. I guess that this comes with too many nuances to be promoted on Wiki, and it's way too easy to be read as a straw man. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:30, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

The support by the United States for Pinochet's government has also been the target of substantial criticism, and many believe the CIA had a role in the 1973 coup.

<dd>There is little to say in response to 172. His charge that what I've written seeks to "pay lip service to his narrow, knee jerk, rightwing Americentric worldview" is too absurd to even comment on, as anyone who has read the intro can see. 172 believes that his view and his view alone is the only right one so there is simply no need to balance with other views, which is not the NPOV policy I know. Furthermore, he wants to erase the brief summary of Pinochet's legacy, but this is crucial information for someone who wants to learn about the person in question. What "many people believe" today about him is an important part of it. Worst here of course is his disrespect of consensus, the essence of Wiki; he has the last word on what <i>the</i> historical content and meaning of Pinochet is, and no dissent will be brooked. Here, he wants to flatly assert the unsubstantiated <i>US-backed</i> part, offering only a superscripted <i>1</i> to say what could be said with a few words in the intro, attached to a modifier which on its face pushes a POV, disclaimer or no. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 21:35, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FWIW, I agree with Eloquence's suggestions for what should be in the intro, and I don't think VV's intro was anywhere near as POV as 172 made out. Doesn't look like we're going to get much sensible discussion on this, though. Perhaps a very short intro like the one I introduced temporarily would at least be able to gain a consensus, even if everyone agreed it wasn't as informative as it should be. Until VV and 172 kiss and make up I'm not sure I can see an alternative.

<dd>FWIW (and if you'll forgive me belaboring the point, what we think is apparently not worth anything), sarcasm aside, Eloquence's list is fine. I still think US support is a bit off the path - it's not mentioned in the intro to, say, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> - but it's okay as long as the intro does not also say Pinochet is pure evil and the text provides for understanding the US's policy choices in context (Eloquence sees no/little moral grey here, of course, but others do). The US-coup allegation remains a sticky point, and none of my tries (e.g., "support for Pinochet's government" w/o specifics) for anything short of what's there now seemed to gain consensus acceptance. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 12:34, 9 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, it's nice reading something by VV that isn't an attack on me for a change. Anyway, while I agree with everything in the above paragraph , I'd like to add that I don't see a "sticky point" in my intro, which doesn't misconstrue the scope of U.S. involvement in the coup ('backing' does not mean 'orchestrated' or 'deciding factor'), and even includes a footnote to check the possibilities of confusion. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:18, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I understand that what 172 means by "US-backed" is uncontroversial, but it's a sad truth that words don't always mean quite what people want them to. We're not lying. To a lot of people, "US-backed" strongly implies "US-aided/organized", and that's the only reason I want it changed (because there is no conclusive evidence that the US aided/organized a coup <i>specifically with the intention of bringing Pinochet to power</i>).

<dd>Yes, the footnote is silly. But it's even sillier to insist that factual content be kept out of the article because someone states that hypothetically someone else could be under the <b>wrong</b> impression that a single word means something that it does not. So, in order to compromise with Veriverily's extremely silly stance, I am offering a somewhat less silly footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:16, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point is that your interpretation of "US-backed" is not the only sensible interpretation. It is not that it might <i>hypothetically</i> be misinterpreted by some deliberately contrary fool; it is <i>actually</i> unclear what it means. To me, the word "US-backed" implies quite strongly "US-organized". We should either drop the issue of US support from the intro altogether, or have a full explanation. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

Yes, 'U.S. backing' and 'U.S. planning' are not mutually exclusive, but you still cannot infer things that are not within the confines of the definition(s) of "backing," which **does not** in and of itself imply anything else without further information. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:56, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>It's more of this "dictionary definition" crap. No one needs a dictionary. This is a common English word and I am a native English speaker and <i>US-backed</i> means a hell of a lot, especially when it's one of only a few things put in an intro paragraph. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 06:18, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>You can go ahead and disregard the meaning of words, and base everything on the whim of emotional reactions to the fantasy world in which you live, in which misinformation is facts and facts are misinformation. That doesn't matter to me, as I consider you irrelevant.

<dd>The word "US-backed" is not in the dictionary. I am a native English speaker, so is VV; our opinions of what it means matter. You are not an authority on the English language (and neither is anyone else either). If we say it means X to us (and probably a lot of other people), then we are just telling the truth, we're not ignoring the facts. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>You should also bear in mind the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a>/<a href="../../../p/r/a/Pragmatics.html" title="Pragmatics">pragmatics</a> distinction. Dictionaries aren't much use to us here: we're talking about what the word <i>implies</i>, not its dictionary defintion. Cadr

<dd>Language is a tricky matter. But facts and the meaning of words are all we have to go on here, so I'll continue to hold that a factual summation of history takes precedence over Veriverily's feelings and chauvinist U.S. nationalist jingoism. BTW Cadr, can <i>you</i> think of a word that's less commonly 'misunderstood' than "backing" to go in its place? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:06, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be missing my point. Your summation of history is not factual because "US-backed" does not convey your intended meaning to a lot of people (including myself). This has nothing to do with "chauvinist U.S. nationalist jingoism" — I'm as left-wing as they come. Re your question, I wouldn't use a single word, I'd have an expanded intro something along the lines of VV's. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>

<dd>As I said in my previous response: "I wouldn't use a single word, I'd have an expanded intro something along the lines of VV's."

<dd>Re: "As I said in my previous response: 'I wouldn't use a single word, I'd have an expanded intro something along the lines of VV's.'" Does or doesn't the footnote I am offering suffently contextualize the intro? If not, then explain why. Re: "And if you aren't interested in people's political affiliations, why are you making wild assumptions about what they are and inluding them in your posts?" Where did I bring up assumptions about <i>your</i> 'political affiliations?'

<dd>The footnote, as I've said before, is silly — we should just have a full explanation in the intro or drop the matter entirely. You didn't bring up my political affiliations, you brought up VV's (I said "people's poltical affiliations", not "<i>my</i> political affiliations"). In any case, since you attributed VV's views to his (supposed) political tendencies, and I agreed with VV in many respects, and you were replying to one of my posts, it was sort of implied...<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
<dd>BTW, you still have not presented any evidence as to your claim that users will see "U.S.-backed" but think "U.S.-installed." The word backing refers to support, assistance, or encouragement (against a contending force). On that note, would you feel better with the synonymous "U.S.-supported" instead? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 17:23, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The adjective "X-backed" is extemely vague. In the context, with no supplementary information, it appears to many people (for example to me and VV) that the intro is suggesting the US supported Pinochet directly. "US-supported" is worse than "US-backed", it seems to imply that the US organized the coup to some degree (which as I've said before, may well have been the case, but there is not any very strong evidence for it). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>No, the intro is saying that the U.S. backed <i>the coup</i>. You could claim that you think that it is suggesting anything, and thus you have reason to make any ridiculous demand you want. These misunderstandings are much more "silly" than the footnote. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 23:29, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The adjective "X-backed" is extremely vague; its meaning varies greatly with context. Let's take a look at the pragmatics of "US-backed coup" in your intro to the article. It's a short intro, so the reader will naturally assume that only important information is in it. Now, if "US-backed" is being used in the limited sense of "desired" or "sought-for", the fact that the coup was "US-backed" in this sense would not be particularly remarkable — the US was bound to prefer one or other of the governments, and unless they provided some kind of material support to the coup, it's not overwhelmingly interesting who their preferred ruler of Chile was. So the reader might well conclude that "US-backed" was being used to mean "materially supported by the US", or something like that. Given that there is not any conclusive evidence that the US materially supported <i>the coup</i>, only that they desired and fermented <i>a coup</i>, the intro is a little misleading. I find your statement that "You could claim that you think that it is suggesting anything, and thus you have reason to make any ridiculous demand you want." rather rude. If you refuse to believe anything I say, I don't see how we can have a grown-up discussion. The word "US-backed" gives a misleading impression to me and several others, <i>honestly</i>. The footnote clears up the ambiguity, but its silly to cause unnecessary confusion and then clear it up with a footnote — why not just extend the intro to avoid confusion in the first place? (Note: this does <i>not</i> mean adopting VV's intro as it stands, since it has little more of a consensus that yours or mine.) <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>Well, if cognitive dissonance is causing you not to understand things you read, that's none of my business. After all, I'm a historian, not a psychologist. I offered you a footnote (which <i>Encarta</i> doesn't even bother with) - take it or leave it. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:06, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There you go, being needlessly rude again. Look, this is Linguistics 101. Words can have (very) different meanings depending on their context. Not everyone will interpret a sentence you wrote the way you intended. This does not mean that they have cognitive dissidence (I think you mean "dissonance", btw) or that they are living in a world of make-believe. Personally, I think the problem is that nature of US support for the coup is too complex to be summarised accurately by a single adjective. As I said, if you refuse to believe that I am not a retard, and that I am not being deliberately difficult in my reading of your intro, we can't have a sensible dicussion. Maybe if you'd explain what was incorrect or misguided in my previous post, we could. "Take it or leave it" is precisely the un-Wikilike attitude which has lead to this page being repeatedly protected. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>

<dd>I was typing too fast for my own good, being rushed for a meeting. That's what I meant. Anyway, we're not just dealing with any context, but the context of what the word means in this intro (which I'm sure everyone has read many times over and in the context of the footnote). I can't help it if people can't read, but the intro in question does not state that the U.S. provided backing to Pinochet, that the U.S. was in control of the situation, that the U.S. role was the deciding factor, and that the U.S. initiated the coup. You are being deliberately difficult in your reading of the intro; you'd be able to use the same argument to raise objections about anything posted in any intro. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:54, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The intro <i>implies</i> quite strongly all the things you claim it doesn't "state", as I have explained in enormous detail (and I <i>was</i> talking about what "US-backed" means in the context of the intro, as I made painfully clear). Still your only reply is to deny outright my opinion of what the intro means (I can't read apparently — this is news to me and several other people), and to make out that I'm using some sort of bizarre semantic argument (i.e. reading a sentence in context) to arrive at "deliberately difficult" readings of your intro. You refuse to believe a word I say or (apparently) read a word of my postings; you refuse to countenance any opinion or interpretation of your precious intro other than your own. Why are you being so rude? This isn't a personal attack on you, I just want to change the intro a bit. Why can't you accept that there are some problems with your intro? <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree that it <i>implies</i> at all any of the things I claim it doesn't "state," as I have explained in enormous detail (and I <i>was</i> talking about what "US-backed" means in the context of the intro, as I made painfully clear). And yes, once again, you <i>really</i> are being deliberately difficult in your reading of the intro. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 14:31, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You haven't responded to any of my points, so I don't have much to say. I know you disagree that it implies those things, but as I've said over and over again, the same sentence can imply different things to different people. Your opinion isn't the only one that matters. If anyone is being deliberately difficult, it's you. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it can imply different things to different people. So can any sentence in an intro. I'm only saying that it isn't too ambiguous for an intro sentence. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:19, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and you're wrong, in the case of this particular sentence. I've explained in detail why I think you're wrong, but you haven't responded to most of my points. Saying your intro isn't too ambiguous don't make it so. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a></dd>
