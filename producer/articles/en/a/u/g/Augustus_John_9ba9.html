<p>John was born at <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenby.html" title="Tenby">Tenby</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembrokeshire.html" title="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a>, studied at the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slade_School_of_Art_3918.html" title="Slade School of Art">Slade School of Art</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_London_3428.html" title="University College London">UCL</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and even before his graduation became recognized as the most talented draughtsman of his generation. In 1898, he won the Slade Prize with <i>Moses and the Brazen Serpent.</i> His sister, <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_John_c0a1.html" title="Gwen John">Gwen John</a>, was with him at the Slade and became an important artist in her own right. John afterward studied independently in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> where he seems to have been influenced by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Puvis_de_Chavannes_43bd.html" title="Pierre Puvis de Chavannes">Puvis de Chavannes</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Some time in 1910, John fell in love with the town of Martigues, in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provence.html" title="Provence">Provence</a>. <i>"Glimpsed from a train en route to Italy, John referred to this enchanting town on the banks of the Etange de Berre as 'the goal of my dreams', and would return regularly with his family to stay at the Villa Ste Anne for the next eighteen years. Characteristically, it was not only the colour and beauty of the Provencal landscape that delighted John, but also that of the handsome local population. In a letter to Ottoline Morrell written shortly after his first arrival in Martigues, Augustus remarked, '... I have seen so many powerful women whose essential nudity no clothing can disguise.'"</i><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was, throughout his life, particularly interested in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a> (whom he referred to as <i>Gypsies</i>), and sought them out on his frequent travels around the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>.

The end result was to have been a huge mural for <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Beaverbrook_9277.html" title="Lord Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a> and the sketches and cartoon for this suggest that it might have become his greatest large-scale work. However, like so many of his monumental conceptions, it was never completed. As a war artist, <i>"he was also allowed to keep his facial hair and therefore became the only officer in the Allied forces, except for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a>, to have a beard.

<p>Although well-known early in the century for his <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawing.html" title="Drawing">drawings</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/c/Etching.html" title="Etching">etchings</a>, the bulk of John's later work consisted of portraits, some of the best of which were of his two wives and his children. He was known for the psychological insight of his portraits, many of which were considered "cruel" for the truth of the depiction. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Leverhulme_d593.html" title="Lord Leverhulme">Lord Leverhulme</a> was so upset with his portrait that he cut out the head (since only that part of the image could easily be hidden in his vault) but when the remainder of the picture was returned by error to John there was an international outcry over the desecration.</p>
<p>By the 1920s John was Britain's leading portrait painter. John painted many distinguished contemporaries, including <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._E._Lawrence_2a53.html" title="T. E. Lawrence">T. E.

<p>It was said that after the war his powers diminished as his bravura technique became sketchier. One critic has claimed that <i>"the painterly brilliance of his early work degenerated into flashiness and bombast, and the second half of his long career added little to his achievement."</i> However, from time to time his inspiration returned, as it did on a trip to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Those works that <i>"relate to his visit to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a> in 1936-7 show just how undiminished his abilities were. The rendering of light and shade beneath the tall palms, and the easy suggestion of movement in the lightly brushed figures, all bespeak an artist whose powers were anything but diminished, harking back to the many descriptions which lauded him as the finest draughtsman since the Old Masters"</i>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
