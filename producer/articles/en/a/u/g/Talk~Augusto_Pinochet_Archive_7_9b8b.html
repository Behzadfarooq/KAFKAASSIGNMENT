<h2><span class="mw-headline">Trey Stone</span></h2>
<p>You changed most of the things I added (I don't have a Wiki name yet, so for now I'm my ip address... something like 200.90... call me Matias). We all agree that information on wikipedia must be NEUTRAL AND TRUE. I edited this page because there is information that is not true (Pinochet started a terror campaign??? Come on... This has never been proved. The CIA has some reports about Pinochet's government but the CIA has obvious reasons to hate Pinochet (and even if you based this information on what the CIA has said, this would be an extremely biased article...)). There are trials against Pinochet, but none of them has stated that Pinochet tried to kill everyone that didn't think what he thought, and that makes a huge difference. First because although Pinochet had a lot of power some of his officers abused from their power commiting different kinds of abuses. There's no trial that has said that Pinochet is guilty from any of these crimes. I can backup what I'm saying on different sources (even from some people who declare themselves against Pinochet). I wonder... what are your sources?. I'll wait for an answer until tomorrow or I'll just change everything back. Also note that the comunist party in Chile hates Pinochet because he destroyed their dreams of taking over the power in Chile (I know that this isn't something that should be added to the article). It's strange that some of this party members when they are outside of Chile say strange things such as "Pinochet ordered his soldiers to kill Allende", but when they are back on Chile, everibody agrees that Allende killed himself... Second: total of people who died during Pinochet's government is about 2100, including soldiers who fought for Pinochet and terrorists (terrorist means someone who fights (using violence) against the government) who died while fighting. Why do you keep on moving those numbers up? You had no problems on writting that there is people who say that Allende was murdered (at least, nobody has said it on Chile for more than 5 years... including the comunist and socialist party-members), something that's not true, but when you have the information (you can check the Rettig inform), you change it. You are making a biased article. I don't know if you are a communist, but when you write on wikipedia you must stay neutral.</p>
<dl>
<dd>i am not a communist, quite the opposite actually. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J. Parker Stone</a> 6 July 2005 04:37 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>less than 50 militars died during the dictatorship by the hands of terrorist groups (in contrast of the 3200 that pinochetÂ´s regime killed)</p>
<p>the official number is 3200, according the the Rettig inform (people usually raise the number up to 5000, as seen in Bowling for Columbine, but it wasnt THAT much)</p>
<p>as in the matter of wether he killed anyone, all i can say is that he greenlighted each and everyone of the assasination operations.</p>
<p>Communist did not, i say again, DID NOT wanted to take the power, "PLAN Z is a falsified propaganda from the rightists.</p>
<p>and finnally, even though Allende did killed himself. Pinochet DID planned to kill allende. after he (allende) surrendered by putting him on a plane and then shooting that plane down in mid flight. (source: the military radio recordings on september 11, 1973, you can clearly hear PinochetÂ´s voice there)</p>
<dl>
<dd>certainly there were Communist groups such as the MIR that would've been pleased to establish a "dictatorship of the proletariat," but Allende's problem was that he was accused of flouting the Constitution in favor of his Marxist agenda, not that he intended to become Supreme Leader (although I'm sure such accusations were made) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J. Parker Stone</a> 6 July 2005 04:39 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>there were several groups, incluiding MIR, GAP, VOP, etc. MIR was the most violent of these, wich started at the Concepcion university. Mir was mostly a revolutionary group (as their name implies). But they certainly werent a big group, or a well armed group (since all they got was these homemade bombs and a few assault rifles from cuba, the number of rifles was around 400, if i remember correctly).</p>
<p>In response for the original post, there are a few points i missed. "no trial have found pinochet guilty" mainly because no trial on him has ever actually started per se, they all get delayed endlessly. (on another matter, there is a joke here in chile, that Saddam Hussein wanted to be judged here, cos according to him "justice in chile WORKS!")</p>
<p>Communist hated pinochet mostly for the harassment they recieved during the dictatorship (house inpections, encarcelation of relatives, etc), or because of the many members of the communist party that are still missing.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Correcting</span></h2>
<p>Ok. As no one answered to my claims i understand that everybody agrees. I don't want to write everything again because I know that there's a way to revert changes... I just deleted most of the things that are untrue or that where posted as true while they are still under discussion on several trials. I left a message on the article because I would need to rewrite a complete section (that section may be discussed, but I already posted information that shows that Pinochet's regime wasn't trying to destroy left party members). (unsigned comment from 81.178.64.2)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello Matias, I reverted your edit because you removed several facts and quotes which are sourced, without providing sources of your own. I'm not trying to prevent you from changing the article, but I don't think that removing sentences like "Some supporters still insist [Allende] was killed by Pinochet's military forces" does anything to make Wikipedia more neutral and true. If you have references to your assertion that Pinochet's forces did not arrest hundreds of members of the left-wing opposition and kill many of them, please post them. I do not think the fact that Pinochet has been cleared of his accused crimes by the same Supreme Court he appointed is reason enough to remove the accusations entirely. Of course it should be mentioned that he has never been found guilty. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebrane_d41b.html" title="User:Rebrane">Eliot</a> 15:10, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Eliot. I agree with you about the sources. I'm not very used to wikipedia, but I posted my sources here on the discussion page. I knew that this article needed to be edited (it has to be rewritten in some places) but I did it once I it was reverted. Leaving this article as it was or as it is destroys Pinochet's honor and is against the NPOV (that's what you use for neutrality, don't you?). I posted above about suppression of opposition, and just by posting information of the rettig inform it's obvious that his government wasn't trying to destroy the oppossition (even if those deaths where Pinochet's fault, something that hasn't been proved either). I agree that his trials should be posted, but you can't say that he's guilty for now.</dd>
<dd>About Allende's death, I also posted above my source: an interview to Allende's daughter (c'mon... her word is enough... maybe you should add that for Allende killing himself wasn't something bad but something brave).</dd>

<dd>Hi Matias. I'm glad you've decided to contribute to Wikipedia, but I think your contributions will be better received if you read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> article and the <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">policies</a>, and create an account.</dd>

<dd>I think you have some misunderstandings about NPOV. For instance, you removed the phrase "However, some supporters still insist that he was killed by Pinochet's military forces while defending the palace." I don't see any justification for removing this, as it is true that some supporters claim this. Removing it in support of "Pinochet's honor" is very un-NPOV.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the information. I will surely read the NPOV and the policies. Maybe I will understand better the idea of wikipedia (it's still difficult for me to think about this encyclopedia... It's missing many things). About Allende's death, his own family (inside or outside of Chile) agrees that he killed himself. I don't know what the point is about keeping that. Just because a few guys think something you'll put it on an article? maybe it should be posted at the very end, but I don't think that it's good for Allende's memory to say that he was murdered. I don't agree with his vission of the world, but he thought that killing himself was something good.</dd>
<dd>About Pinochet's honor, I referred to the part of suppression of opposition. I posted above here on the discussion page death tolls according to the Rettig inform. You can check it for yourself. Look at those numbers and please answer: Can you state that Pinochet wanted to suppress opposition? The comunist party at that time had some 1500 people and the socialist party had some 5000-7000 people (not sure about those numbers). The CUT (central unitaria de trabajadores - not a political party but definately oposition) had about 1 million of people (that number is tricky though, because workers where forced to join). At least the suppression of oposition should be posted as "some people say that Pinochet tried to eliminate oposition...". (Even though it's (very) probably untrue that Pinochet gave an order to kill someone). I agree to continue disscusing this. What do you think about adding a disscusion tag to the article?</dd>

<dd>Just wanted to say good bye. I'm leaving the Wikipedia project (I give up. Some articles are just way to biased, and what's worst, saying anything against what most people whant to think means a npov message). Eliot: I left some data here (some posts above, specially the one with the death toll). I'm not working here anymore. I hope that what you write about Pinochet is the truth and not what most would like to read (this encyclopedia is converting on a CNN info source...).</dd>

<p>I answered several of Matias points, turns out he is one biased rightist.</p>
<p>He speaks of the honor of General Pinochet, when in fact today he is seen in Chile as a thief, mainly for the Riggs bank scandal (most dictators steal money from their countries, good example of this is cuban dictator Fidel Castro, whoÂ´s wealth is about 150 million dollars today)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV dispute</span></h2>
<p>I have tagged the neutrality as disputed for the simple reason that the article at present makes no mention whatsoever of the United States role in the 1973 coup and its support for Pinochet's government. Given that it previously did so, I have no doubt that this is the result of edit warring and POV pushing over the past months. This information is now spread in sub-sub-articles and meta-articles such as <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._intervention_in_Chile_c138.html" title="U.S. intervention in Chile">U.S. intervention in Chile</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilean_coup_of_1973.html#U.S._role_in_1973_coup" title="Chilean coup of 1973">Chilean coup of 1973#U.S. role in 1973 coup</a>. This includes the massive economic sanctions against Chile before Pinochet, combined with the massive military aid ("U.S. military aid was raised dramatically between the coming to power of Allende in 1970, when it amounted to USD $800,000 annually, to $10.9 million in 1972"), and the admission by Kissinger that the USG had "created the conditions as great as possible" for a coup. It also includes at least a brief summary of the previous CIA and USG support for a coup in Chile. The nature of the USG relationship with Pinochet's government should also be discussed.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> June 29, 2005 13:40 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pinochet was the military leader of Chile, and as such, key government relationships which he pursued or which were related to his rise to power have a place in his biography.

<dd>I would propose the following summary of the pre-coup relationship:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Before Pinochet seized power, the U.S. government under <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> had established a strong CIA presence in Chile and had made several attempts to instigate a military coup against Allende (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_FUBELT_50a7.html" title="Project FUBELT">Project FUBELT</a>). In addition, the U.S. had imposed economic sanctions on Chile, while increasing military aid from $800,000 anually in 1970 to $10.9 million by 1972. This combined strategy, as Nixon's advisor <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Kissinger_71ce.html" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> acknowledged privately days after Pinochet seized power, had "created the conditions as great as possible" for a military coup. While Nixon's government strongly supported Pinochet, there is no evidence that U.S. intelligence was directly involved in the preparations or execution of the September 11, 1973 coup."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think briefly outlining that the U.S. government pursued a combined strategy of military aid, economic sanctions and direct support for potential coup leaders is important. Pinochet certainly benefited from this strategy. Therefore, a neutral biography that describes his rise to power should include it.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> June 29, 2005 18:58 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article seems accurate and reasonable. I'm impressed by the compromises that have been made and I think it is as NPOV as can be expected. It seems like it's been well-tended by responsible wikians. Does it still need the disputed neutrality tag?

<dd>Thanks Eliot. I'm a pretty passionate hater of Pinochet, I don't understand what Mtad has against this article. It says he killed 3,000 people right there in the 2nd paragraph. My general feeling is that the use of these tags should be minimal, so I'm glad to see this one go. Next planned change is to add something about the CIA involvement ... <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamipco_e433.html" title="User:Camipco">Camipco</a> 19:54, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>... So this is what wikipedia defines as non-biased........ great source of information... There lots (and it's not just a 1 or 2% of the population) of people in Chile that would fight for General Pinochet... "more biased than CNN"... it really depends on who posts it... generally, I agree with that statement...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why just not be honest</span></h2>
<p>What cant we just be honest with the fact that the story of Pinochet is quite complex? Salvador Allende was on his way to start a civil wat within Chile. Even the lower class was starting to turn on him with the turnaround of the March of Pots. The military intervened to keep the country from turning into a giant warzone. Pinochet was not a dictator, he was an autoritarian ruler with a military cabinet(junta). Most of the dissaperences attributed to this regime were guerillas, soviet and Cuban mercenaries, and youths involved in planning Marxist events. I AM NOT trying to appologize for the crimes commited, but with the exception of the one American journalist before the Coup of '73, Pinochet killed no one that didnt belong to the opposition. And usually the opposition were involved in terrorist activities. He still deserves a trial but under a less bias judge and international court. - ANON</p>
<p>"In contrast to most other nations in Latin America, Chile had, prior to the coup, a long tradition of civilian democratic rule; military intervention in politics had been rare. Some political scientists have ascribed the bloodiness of the coup to the stability of the existing democratic system, which required extreme action to overturn."</p>
<p>This isnt totally accurate. Even from the start Chile had an authoritarian ruler with Bernard O'Higgins, then after O'Higgins was disposed ultra-conservatives exiled him for being too Liberal! Chile has always had a rather right wing British style government. I am Chilean and before Allende was around, Chile usually kept a rather conservative past. Pinochet is more popular than you would expect.</p>
<p>Also I have to add, why is Noam Chomsky cited in the Economic chapter? Chomsky is a Linguistics professor, not an economist. Get an economist to doubt the Miracle of Chile, even though I doubt that you will find one because most agree that Chile is an economic success. Anyone who visits Chile will surely find out so. - Anon</p>

<dd>Wikipedia, and socialist-infested university campuses, are the last redoubts of pro-Marxist English-language propaganda-inversions of Latin American history. While such ambitions may have once served the aims of Soviet policy, today they are merely pathetic and laughably, palpable dishonesties -- it'd be as if hold-out Islamists were continually re-writing the history of African slavery long after Mecca was a crater. Their deliberate <b>conflation</b> of the <b>ligitimate</b> removal of Allende from power (as authorized by the Aug 22 1973 Chamber of Deputies [<a href="http://www.economiaysociedad.com/declaration.html" class="external text" title="http://www.economiaysociedad.com/declaration.html" rel="nofollow">Resolution</a>]) with the bloodless assumption of extralegal power by Pinochet two days after the ouster is a prime example of this; whenever I have in the past attempted to introduce distinctions between the two, they have always been removed. <b>-- thus the "'Coup' that overthrew Allende</b> remains a hoary, moldy, communist-propaganda cliche over thirty years after the fact. Likewise, Washington's mere contingency-plannering will be played up, while Allende's imported Cuban thugs and straight up gangsterism worthy of any contemporary drug-lord mafioso receives nary a mention.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Obviously not written by Chileans!</span></h2>
<p>This entry is mainly western leftist propaganda. While sanitized to remove obvious lies, it cleverly removes Pinochet's career from its context: It simply doesn't wash from a Chilean POV.</p>
<p>The Pinochet story (and his name is pronounced "pino-CHET" with the T, not "pino-SHAY") is very complex -- like a dead mackeral by moonlight, he both shines and stinks. Of course he is a killer, but remember, he prevented Allende -- who was NOT elected! -- from creating a communist dictatorship, which would have meant many, many more deaths.</p>
<p>And who gives a flying leap over non-Chilean, hair-splitting definitions of Socialism and Communism? In Allende's day, the Chilean Communists were far more moderate than Allende's "Socialists." Allende lied his way into his appointment as President after a near three-way tie. He then proceded to subvert the constitution he was sworn to uphold. That's all that matters.</p>
<p>Pinochet's story becomes far more complex when Allende is stripped of his halo -- a lying, anti-constitutional, would-be dictator. In other words, tyrant vs. tyrant.</p>
<hr />
<p>Im from Chile, and i can say that you know probably nothing about Pinochet or Allende. Your comments hurt my sensibility as you clearly are nothing but a chauvinist. Allende was elected, he had the grand mayority of the election. Back then, the president was elected and then rectified by the senate, it wasnt a case of something that hasnt been seen before, as all presidents went through there. There was a great panic when he won the elections, as for believed that a socialist leader would bring what happened in Russia or in Cuba. The truth could not be further from that, as Allende never used force to accomplish anything. He gave back to Chile what it was being stolen by american corporations (all minerals, more imporatantly the cooper, all of them in hands of American corporations, who made a whoopin 80 billion dollars in profits, as they had held the mines for a long time). As all chauvinists, i see that you have just a convenient part of the story, not the whole story of Allende, a man that won democraticlly, who upheld his views until a massive boicot by the united states brought chaos to Chile. The great masterminds of the coup was Leighton and Merino, Pinochet just happend to be around and decided to go in the coup only 2 days before it happened. If you have any doubts, please, submit them as ill be happy to answer anything you might have a doubt on.</p>
<hr />
<p>Allende had anything but a majority of the vote: barely over a third (36% if my memory serves me). The Chilean Congress simply selected him as president in accordance with their tradition, which, in the event of lack of a majority vote, was to declare the candidate with the plurality of votes (in this case Allende) the winner. Allende's attempt, in spite of this lack of support, to put radical reforms in place in turn resulted in the opposition and subsequent uprising.<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAlloco1_fd44.html" title="User:Alloco1">Alloco1</a> 05:13, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>This is the complete text of the resolution that Chileâs Chamber of Deputies approved by 81 votes against 47, on August 22 1973. The resolution includes a list of the legal and constitutional violations committed by the Marxist government of President Salvador Allende. In the absence of a viable impeachment procedure contemplated in the Constitution, it "presents" the Armed Forces, among other authorities, with this "grave breakdown of the Republicâs constitutional and legal order." Likewise, it serves to "remind them that, by virtue of their responsibilities, their pledge of allegiance to the Constitution, and to the laws of the land . . . it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land." After this call to "immediate" action by the equivalent of the US House of Representatives or the UK House of Commons, the Chilean Armed Forces, led by the Army commander General Augusto Pinochet, decided on September 11, 1973âonly 18 days laterâto remove from office the President, thus charged with violating the Chilean Constitution.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Incredibly POV, Poor Quality and Long Winded</span></h2>
<p>The article has an incredibly anti-Pinochet and left-wing POV. IMHO there is abosolutely no need for phrases such as "campaign of terror" which is a POV judgement. One could also view Pinochet's campaign as a campaign against disorder or against communism. Also the use of term neoliberal is POV as a google search will confirm that only left-wing websites use it. Furthermore there is a lot of info that should be in another article like for instance a description of Chilean history or human rights abuse under Pinochet. The article is also extremely repetitive althought this seems to be the case for all wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Please compare the article on Pinochet to the article on Stalin or even Hitler. Both these articles are far less biased then this one is. In fact it is easily possible to get the impression that Pinochet is worse than Stalin if you read the two articles. I find it hard to believe that even the most crazed left-wing loon could make that kind of an argument. Even Chomsky would be hard pressed to argue that.</p>
<p>I made a series of edits under the IP below. I think they succeeded into totally removing the left-wing POV, making the article far more readable and less long-winded and generally better focussed. My revisions have been reverted. I was asked to explain my revisions and I have. Now will somebody explain what was unacceptable with the revisions I made. Some may object that I removed large paragraphs. This is true but I think many of the paragraphs were way to detailed and long winded. Take for instance the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the transitional provisions of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Chile_9d15.html" title="Constitution of Chile">1980 constitution</a>, approved in a tightly-controlled plebiscite by 75% of voters, a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plebiscite.html" title="Plebiscite">plebiscite</a> was scheduled for <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, to vote on a new eight-year presidential term for Pinochet. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the plebiscite should be organized according to all the disposition of the Law of Elections. That included an "Electoral Space" during which all positions, in this case two, the <i>SÃ­</i>, and the <i>No</i>, would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcasted by all TV channels, and no political propaganda could be made outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (evening news were from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition, headed by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Lagos_0366.html" title="Ricardo Lagos">Ricardo Lagos</a>, took full advantage, producing colorful, upbeat advertisements, telling the Chilean people to vote "<i>No</i>". Lagos, in an interview, boldly called out Pinochet to account for all the "disappeared" persons. The <i>SÃ­</i>, spots, instead, were dark, and tried to instill fear of a return to the chaos of the UP government, telling citizens that voting "no" was equivalent to voting for a return to those days. In the plebiscite, the advocates of a "<i>No</i>" vote won, with a 55% versus 42% from the "<i>SÃ­</i>" option, and, again according to the provisions of the constitution, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_Chilean_presidential_election_6269.html" title="1989 Chilean presidential election">open presidential elections</a> were held the next year, at the same time as the election of the congress, that would have happened in either case. Pinochet left the presidency on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I changed it to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the transitional provisions of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Chile_9d15.html" title="Constitution of Chile">1980 constitution</a>, approved in a tightly-controlled plebiscite by 75% of voters, a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plebiscite.html" title="Plebiscite">plebiscite</a> was scheduled for <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, to vote on a new eight-year presidential term for Pinochet. In the plebiscite, the advocates of a "<i>No</i>" vote won, with a 55% versus 42% from the "<i>SÃ­</i>" option. Pinochet left the presidency on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think my version is easier to read and filled with way fewer irrelevant details. The information contained in the previous version should be moved to a separate article on the Chilean election or its history. This much detail about one election does not belong in an article on Pinochet. Also the sentence about how the Si spots were dark and tried to instill fear is POV. Again saying the Si spots were dark is the authors judgement. Anyways the whole paragraph belongs in a separate article.</p>
<p>Another example of a change I made is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original: In addition, it embarked on a campaign of terror against leftist elements in the country. As a result, approximately 3,000 Chileans were executed or disappeared, more than 27,000 <sup>1</sup> were imprisoned or tortured, and many were exiled and received abroad as political refugees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Revised: Approximately 3,000 Chileans were executed or disappeared, more than 27,000 <sup>2</sup> were imprisoned or tortured, and many were exiled and received abroad as political refugees. Most of those persecuted by the regime were affiliated with left-wing political parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>My version is less POV. Saying that Pinochet embarked on a campaign of terror is pure POV. Even if what Pinochet did was a "campaign of terror" it is still unacceptable for the author to state this since that is a judgement. Either the author must state the facts or quote someone else's judgement of the regime. Neither is done.</p>
<p>Wow this article keeps on getting more and more POV every time I read it. This article is absolutely disgusting and the leftists editors driven by their blind rage against Pinochet are only managing to make it worse. --142.151.171.71 17:43, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok some edits were made and I am satisfied with current version of article</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coup edited</span></h2>
<p>I translated the coup as it is best written, wich is the spanish wikipedia page of Pinochet. I took several other things from there and Allende's page, were the Coup is much better told. But everything is exactly as it is in both of those pages. It is better told, it explains more and more than anything, it is completely true to the history facts. A few corrections are needed, as i am from Chile and english is not my native language. I will try to correct a few sappy parts, that might upset rightists who will yell "POV!!". Before making any radical change, take in consideration that it took me about 2 hours to make, and to translate properly:</p>
<dl>

<p>Perhaps, i keep getting messages about that its vandalism, i just made it wider and truthful, as i spend hours translating it. You people either give a good reasson for it or just try to make it better. As it is how its written in both Allende's and Pinochet's wikipedia in spanish</p>
<p>Also, why is this that it does not appear as him being a dictator??, General Pinochet is responsible for Operacion Condor, Caravana de la Muerte, a rather ambiguous first plebicit (as it is questioned today for the legitimacy of it, as several meassurements were taken to assure victory, such as changing the voting age to 18, wich was the age of conscripts, for them to vote for Pinochet). He has also stole 27 million dollars, according to the last count. This page is seriously too damn edited, Pinochet is a very ambiguous character, as he was no Tito, but more of a Franco</p>

After that, he goes home, and according to his memoirs, he spent the longest night of his life.</p>
<p>The next day, at 7:40 am, Pinochet arrives to the Comunications Command of the Army, where he would stay for the remainning of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'Ã©tat">coup d'Ã©tat</a>.

<p>During the course of these events, Pinochet shows himself as a swift authoritary leader, a face of him not seen before publicly. During the radio transmitions, all of them caught and recorded by civilians, it is observed that Pinochet overshadows both Leigh and Carvajal. Even though Leigh was one of the igniters of the coup, and considering how Pinochet was the last one to join in the Coup's plan.</p>
<p>In a united effort by both the Unite States and the oposition, the Coup starts in the city of <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valparaiso.html" title="Valparaiso">Valparaiso</a>, at dawn, the army takes over the city.</p>
<p>A so called "democratic chain" by oposition radios Mineria &amp; Agricultura, broadcasts the army's ultimatum: Allende must leave his charge and give control to the military forces. As a last point, the ultimatum stated that if Allende did not leave La Moneda by 11:00 am, La Moneda would be attacked by both land and air.</p>
<p>The military forces contact La Moneda, but Allende's resolution is clear, he would not surrender. Pinochet contacts Carvajal, who indicates him the president's denial in surrendering.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Carvajal: When La Moneda is evacuated, it will be much easier to assault it.</dd>

<p>At 10:30, the tanks open fire against La Moneda, closely followed by soldiers and tankettes, fire wich is replied by the members of GAP (Popular Action Group) and shooters placed on adjecent buildings, who were inferior in number and strenght.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pinochet: ...to the ministry, to the ministry...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Carvajal: he is offering parle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pinochet: inconditional surrender, no parle!, inconditional surrender!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Carvajal: well, agreed, inconditional surrender, and we take him prisoner, offering no more than respect his life, shall we say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pinochet: Life and physical integrity, and next we send him elsewhere</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Carvajal: Agreed... that means we keep the offering of taking him away from the country</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pinochet: We uphold our offering of taking him out of the country. But that plane falls, man, when its fliying.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Carvajal: Agreed... agreed. Lets propose that parle goes on.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pinochet is heard during the rest of the coup using phrases like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Give him more machinegun 'till the end and that his fire dont stop, man"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"its better to kill the bitch and the LevÃ©e en masse stops"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"This are not bullets, nothing more... that egghead wont shoot a rubber pill" (in Chile, Egghead is a mayor insult)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Such use of phrases are not unusual, as Pinochet is not known for being a culturized man. However he was very efficient with the coup, something that both Leigh and Merino perhaps didnt expect.</p>
<p>Pinochet also shows compassion, as he offers the women to be taken out of La Moneda (something that Leigh objected to).</p>
<p>At 11:52 am, Hawker Haunter planes start their attack on La Moneda, shooting rockets in four oportunities over the Goverment's House, the damage was devastating. Other 2 planes bombard the presidential residence of Tomas Moro, wich was defended by members of GAP, who didnt made it to be with Allende.</p>
<p>The attack continues with the use of tear gas, but as no one in La Moneda was surrendering, General Palacios decides to take it and sends a group of soldiers to bring down the palace door, it was 14:30 pm.</p>
<p>Inside, they yell to Allende: President!, the first floor has been taken by the militars!, they say you must go down and surrender!</p>
<p>The President surrenders: Everyone go downstairs!, leave all weapons and go downstairs!, ill be the last to do so.</p>
<p>And so, according to the testimony of one of his doctors, Patricio GijÃ³n, a loud noise was heard, Allende went back to his office and commited suicide. With the machinegun given to him by Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>Palacios enters and sees Allende dead, to wich he says "Mission Accomplished, Palace Taken, President Dead". A phrase that sparked much controversy, as some may believe that Allende was assasinated directly by the militars.</p>
<p>At 14:38 PM, Carvajal informs in english to Pinochet that Allende has commited suicide. At 18:00 pm, all the army chiefs gathered and hugged in the Military School, they were the new Junta.</p>
<hr />
<p>its a better version of it, it has all things from the other spanish pages of both Pinochet and Allende. Yet, all we have is that rather criptic and overly short version, made by an annonimous IP number. The coup there looks like bland fact and figures, as today it is still a fervent issue in Chile.</p>
<hr />
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; In a united effort by both the Unite States and the oposition, the Coup starts...</p>
<p>And the evidence of US "effort" in the "coup" (beyond the obvious "Thank the Good Lord the Chilean military itself is stirring to action in accordance with the request of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies <a href="http://www.economiaysociedad.com/declaration.html" class="external text" title="http://www.economiaysociedad.com/declaration.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Resolution of August 22, 1973</b></a>!") is exactly what? Recordings of Kissinger mumbling during Washington skull-sessions? -- What laughable communist horseshit this whole wretched, running excercise is, as Marxist academics desperately scramble to protect their last "nest-egg", <b>Latin American history according to Brezhnev and Castro</b>, from the savaging spotlight of reality.</p>
<p>The real topper, of course, is the whole concept of a <b>WikiProject Fascism</b> to begin with, while WikiProject Communism and WikiProject Islamism are nowhere to be seen. <i>"Could someone get me the 'morning-line' odds on whether WikiProject Fascism is written by Marxists, please?"</i></p>

<hr />
<p>they are all in both Allende's and Pinochet's pages, let me clarify it right to you:</p>
<p>the first part comes directly from Pinochet's spanish page:</p>
<p>"El dÃ­a 10 Pinochet manda a su esposa y a sus hijos mÃ¡s pequeÃ±os a la Escuela de Alta MontaÃ±a, en RÃ­o Blanco, Los Andes, que es dirigida por uno de los amigos de Pinochet. DespuÃ©s regresa a su casa solitaria, pasando la que Ã©l dice fue la noche mÃ¡s larga de su vida.</p>
<p>Pinochet llega a las 7.40 del dÃ­a 11 de septiembre (al que aÃ±os despuÃ©s llamarÃ­a el dÃ­a decisivo) al Comando de Telecomunicaciones del EjÃ©rcito, en el que se mantendrÃ­a por el resto del golpe, poco retrasado en la hora, preocupando a mÃ¡s de uno. Se organizan las redes de comunicaciones con las demÃ¡s ramas de las Fuerzas Armadas, especialmente con Leigh, que se encuentra en la Academia de Guerra AÃ©rea, y con Patricio Carvajal, que serÃ¡ el coordinador de todo el golpe.</p>
<p>Durante este acontecimiento Pinochet demuestra una faceta de su personalidad que no habÃ­a demostrado antes pÃºblicamente, es autoritario y con un don de mando avasallador. Durante las trasmisiones, que fueron grabadas por radioaficionados, se observa que avasalla a Carvajal y a Leigh, a pesar de que fue este Ãºltimo uno de los promotores iniciales del golpe, mientras que Pinochet fue el Ãºltimo en unirse"</p>
<p>the second part is translated directly from Allende's page, since Pinochet only mentions one or 2 lines from the radio transmition, but only the 3 last phrases i put there.</p>
<p>"La âCadena DemocrÃ¡ticaâ, formadas por las radios MinerÃ­a y Agricultura, emite la primera proclama militar Allende debe hacer entrega inmediata de su cargo a la junta de gobierno, integrada por los jefes supremos de las fuerzas Armadas"</p>
<p>then it comes the proclamation, wich is much longer. but i didnt placed here...</p>
<p>"Los militares se contactan con la Moneda y le hacen la proposiciÃ³n de sacarlo del paÃ­s, pero reciben una respuesta clara, Allende no se va a rendir. Pinochet se contacta con Carvajal, que le indica la negativa del presidente a rendirse:</p>
<p>Carvajal: yo hable personalmente con Ã©l, le intime rendiciÃ³n en nombre de los comandantes en jefe. Eh... ContestÃ³ con una serie de garabatos, no mÃ¡s.</p>
<p>Pinochet: O sea, quiere decir que a las 11, cuando lleguen los primeros pericos... Vai a ver lo que va a pasar. Â¡A las 11 en punto se bombardea!</p>
<p>Carvajal: Cuando se evacue la Moneda va a ser mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil asaltarla</p>
<p>Pinochet: Una vez bombardeada la asaltamos con el Buin y con la escuela de infanterÃ­a. Hay que decirle a Brady.</p>
<p>Carvajal: Conforme. Vamos a esperar no mÃ¡s que evacuen los edecanes y los carabineros</p>
<p>Pinochet: Conforme.</p>
<p>A las 9.55 los tanques del general Palacio ingresan en el perÃ­metro de la Moneda. Francotiradores apostados en los edificios aledaÃ±os los tratan de repeler, y se inicia la balacera. A las 10.15 horas, a travÃ©s de radio Magallanes (la Ãºnica pro-gubernamental aÃºn no silenciada), Allende emite su Ãºltimo mensaje a la NaciÃ³n:"</p>
<p>then its allende's last speech, wich should go in Allende's page, and not here, as Pinochet has nothing to do with it...</p>
<p>"A las diez y media los tanques abren fuego contra la Moneda, les siguen las tanquetas y los soldados, fuego que es respondido por los miembros del GAP y francotiradores apostados en los edificios aledaÃ±os.</p>
<p>Carvajal se comunica nuevamente con Pinochet, informÃ¡ndole de la intenciÃ³n de parlamentar:</p>
<p>Carvajal: me acaban de informar que habrÃ­a intenciÃ³n de parlamentar</p>
<p>Pinochet: no, se tiene que ir a la moneda Ã©l con una pequeÃ±a cantidad de gente</p>
<p>Carvajal: ...se retiraron, pero ahÃ­...</p>
<p>Pinochet: ..al ministerio, al ministerio...</p>
<p>Carvajal: Que se estÃ¡ ofreciendo parlamentar.</p>
<p>Pinochet: RendiciÃ³n incondicional, Â¡nada de parlamentar!, Â¡RendiciÃ³n incondicional!</p>
<p>Carvajal: Bien, conforme, rendiciÃ³n incondicional, y se le toma preso, ofreciÃ©ndole nada mÃ¡s que respetarle la vida, digamos.</p>
<p>Pinochet: La vida y la integridad fÃ­sica, y en seguida se le va a despachar a otra parte.</p>
<p>Carvajal: Conforme. Ya... O sea que se mantiene el ofrecimiento de sacarlo del paÃ­s</p>
<p>Pinochet: Se mantiene el ofrecimiento de sacarlo del paÃ­s. Pero el aviÃ³n se cae, viejo, cuando vaya volando.</p>
<p>Carvajal: Conforme... conforme. Vamos a proponer que prospere el parlamento.</p>
<p>Se oirÃ¡ a Pinochet durante el resto de la jornada usar frases como estas:</p>
<p>âDenle mÃ¡s guaraca hasta el final y que no se le apague el incendio, viejoâ</p>
<p>âMÃ¡s vale matar a la perra y se acaba la levaâ</p>
<p>âEsas no son balas, no mÃ¡s... Ese huevÃ³n no se dispara ni una pastilla de gomaâ</p>
<p>Mas, tambiÃ©n se muestra en ocasiones mucho mÃ¡s humanitario que sus compaÃ±eros de golpe: ofrece a Allende salir del paÃ­s (Carvajal querÃ­a apresarlo), y consiguiÃ³ que Leigh detuviera el bombardeo aÃ©reo unos minutos, para sacar a las mujeres del interior de la Moneda ( a lo que Leigh se oponÃ­a).</p>
<p>A las 11.52 los aviones Hawker Haunter inicia su ataque a la Moneda, disparando en cuatro oportunidades sus cohetes sobre la casa de gobierno, el daÃ±o causado es devastador. Otros dos aviones bombardean la residencia presidencial de TomÃ¡s Moro, a la sazÃ³n defendida por los miembros del GAP que no alcanzaron a llegar con Allende.</p>
<p>El ataque prosigue a el palacio de gobierno con el uso de gases lacrimÃ³genos, pero al ver que la Moneda todavÃ­a se negaba a rendirse, el general Palacios decide tomarla y envÃ­a a un grupo de soldados a derribar la puerta del palacio, son las dos y media de la tarde.</p>
<p>Dentro le gritan a Allende: Â¡Presidente!, Â¡el primer piso esta tomado por los militares! Â¡dicen que deben bajar y rendirse!</p>
<p>El presidente dispone rendirse: Â¡Bajen todos! Â¡dejen las armas y bajen! Yo lo harÃ© al ultimo.</p>
<p>Entonces --segÃºn el testimonio de uno de sus doctores, Patricio GijÃ³n, que regresÃ³ para llevarse su mascarilla antigas ("de recuerdo", dice)-- con la metralleta que le regalo Fidel Castro durante su estadÃ­a en Chile, se dispara en la barbilla, explotando la bÃ³veda craneana y muriendo al instante. Fue este el ultimo acto de consecuencia de un hombre que dijo que de La Moneda no saldrÃ­a sino acribillado a balazos.</p>
<p>Palacios entra en el salÃ³n independencia, y se encuentra con Allende y el doctor GirÃ³n. Reconoce al presidente por su macizo reloj Galga Coulde. Llama al oficial de radio y entrega su escueto informe: âMisiÃ³n cumplida. Moneda tomada, presidente muerto".</p>
<p>A las 14.38 horas, Carvajal le informa a Pinochet y a Leigh: "Hay una comunicacion, una informaciÃ³n de personal de la Escuela de InfanterÃ­a que estÃ¡ ya dentro de La Moneda. Por la posibilidad de interferencia, la voy a transmitir en inglÃ©s: They say that Allende commited suicide and is dead now."</p>
<p>A las 18 horas se reunieron y se abrazaron en la Escuela Militar los cuatro comandantes mÃ¡ximos de las Fuerzas Armadas, eran la nueva junta militar. A excepciÃ³n de unas pequeÃ±as escaramuzas en sitios aislados de Santiago, la junta domina todo el paÃ­s. La Unidad Popular y su presidente habÃ­an muerto, se iniciaban los 17 aÃ±os de Dictadura militar."</p>

<dd>I see so, but I'd like other people to look @ it and see whether or not it belongs/fits in here and if so how it should be incorporated. When I saw it, the 1st added paragraph looked so spurious, and the fact that it was a page on a controversial leader gave me enough reason to revert it. 68.39.174.238 07:32, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This page shows very little info about pinochet, and the coup was, for us Chileans, only seeable by the Radio transmissions, as all radios were taken out by the rightists. No one could leave their houses, as it was a state of siege and courtfew, all tv channels and radios that were functional supported the coup. To use the narration is the best way to explain it, as it is well made in the Pinochet &amp; Allende page. Today, all documentaries about Allende use the radio narration, starting with "La Batalla de Chile" movies &amp; "La Caida de un presidente", both of them who feature this. On Chilean tv, every september 11, 1973 special uses this radio transmission, as its a must!, cos everyone knows about it.--Kessingler 07:39, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest you have the narration moved to Wikisource and call it something like "Allende-Pinochet Coup Negociations" and link to it from this article. It seems rather long to include in the main article but should be kept somewhere. Also, the original paragraph might be merged into the new section. 68.39.174.238 07:50, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allende-Pinochet negotiations??, they never even talked!!, Pinochet was never the mastermind of this, so he was the authoritary leader of the coup, he barely got in the coup just 2 days before it happend. After Pratts retired in the sake of keeping the democracy (after El Tanquetazo, a failed coup that happened just months before it), Pratts, who was a loyal militar to the goverment (no, he wasnt socialist), he choosed Pinochet himself to take his charge, thinking that Pinochet was going to serve in the army without betraying the president. Truth is, the masterminds of it are Leigh &amp; Merino, who commanded the aerial &amp; naval armies, respectively. Mendoza, the head of Carabineros, was just a pawn, as he never sayd anything and never really had a saying in it (he was just "necesary" as he controlled Carabineros).</dd>

<dd>The page must stay in its entirely, even more info would be better. The narration is essential to all this. All of it were phrases spoken by Pinochet himself in the coup, they all belong here, as Pinochet's finest hour was the coup. Later on, he dedicated himself to an image cleansing, excersising just like your Jimmy Carter used to and using a pearl in his tie... just your Jimmy Carter used to (he didnt really masterminded any of the economical changes, the responsables for that were the "Chicago Boys", Pinochet was a Militar).</dd>

<dd>One thing though, theres a lot of words that are very hard to translate from spanish, such as "Huevon", wich literaly means "guy-with-big-balls", but here in Chile, huevon means stupid (wich is a big insult). Also, in one of the phrases Pinochet says "Leva", wich is a simple word in spanish that means conscription, as when Pinochet sayd "to kill the bitch... etc", he doesnt say any french words, but i couldnt find a better word for it, so ill better just put "leva", instead.--Kessingler 23:12, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested alterations</span></h2>
<p>There are a couple of points in the article that I am a little uncomfortable with. I am well aware that they may amount to beating a dead horse but please bear with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding: Pinochet's economic policy - The only criticism of Pinochet's economic results included in the article is one by Chomsky. While he undoubtedly is a scholar of major stature his field of formal studies does not include economics. His economic criticsms are mostly based on idealism, opinions and ideology rather than on academic economic studies. Just because he is well known and respected in certain fields of study does not mean that his views on other subjects should be referenced as scholarly sources. I am sure that there are other sources that dispute Chile's economic success and support it with formal economic research. These should be included in the article instead of the Chomsky figures. One can also easily make the argument that citing Chomsky on certain topics implicitly promotes a certain POV. A good analogy is the Black Book of Communism by Stephane Courtois et al. While certainly scholarly and respected it is generally frowned upon as a single source of communist atrocities due to the author's well known and publicized anti-communist stance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding: Military coup of 1973 - as to Allende's suicide: 'According to the junta's official version, he committed suicide with a machine gun'. This paragraph does not explicitly state that it is by now understood to be a historic fact that Allende committed suicide. The implication is still there that it only the former junta agrees on this. The 1990 autopsy report only glances over the fact. I think that this should be stated more explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't want to change these two sections without a prior consultation since this article is highly debated as it stands already. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelman_8a03.html" title="User:Chelman">Chelman</a> 14:37, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The bit on Chomsky is highly suspect, for two reasons: 1) Chomsky is not an economist, and he's not an expert on economic policy per se (this is made more clear by point #2). If you really wanted to find someone critical of the Chilean Miracle, I'm sure Joe Stiglitz would fit the bill. 2) The figures that Chomsky cites are highly misleading. 1983 was the peak of the Latin American debt crisis; things were really, really bad everywhere in Latin America, but in fact they weren't <i>that bad</i> in Chile, relatively speaking. But choosing to look at unemployment over a period ending in a severe recession isn't fooling anyone--it's amateur at best. Also, one has to consider that Pinochet inherited an economy in ruins, and some unemployment was going to be necessarily to cure inflation &gt;300%. The question is not how well Pinochet dealt with unemployment, but how well he did relative to what else he could have. There has to be some sort of baseline for comparison. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_McAdams_094d.html" title="User:John McAdams">John McAdams</a> 10:37, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lets review each point one of the time:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>economic policy: up to this date Chile is still one of the countries with the most unequal wealth distribution, all of this comes straight from the Pinochet dictatorship, as numerous corporations were privatized along with the health and pension system. In the case of privatization of numerous industries there was much robbery in it, all of wich is reviewed in the Maria Luisa Monckeberg book "El Saqueo" wich is probably the best book about that subject. Pinochet didnt exactly made any of these policies, they were all made by a group of people called "the chicago boys" and were all forced into acceptance, as it is also the case for Pension and Health. Today the pension system is probably the most criticized in Chile, as it is an obscene way to lose your 10% income to later recieve a minimum amount of pension while watching corporations get richer by it (you are forced to do so, bank taxes &amp; the crappy goverment 20 dollars pension makes it an obligation and surprisingly the best choice, as there is no other choice), the pension system is such a large business that to try to root it out would be an almost impossible task, as it is rooted in the countryÂ´s economy and as foreign capitals are invested in it. The health system is good only if you have the cash for it, as none of he 21 ISAPRES will give you coverage if you only make minimum wage (wich is what most of us chileans make), they will give a generous coverage if you have a salary over the 2 million pesos a month.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>about Allende Committing suicide: was he assasinated/was he murdered?: the answer is: BOTH. Unless Allende's last words before committing suicide were "good bye cruel world", it is safe to say Allende didnt committed suicide per se, he was after all in a battle at the time of his death and decided to terminate his life before the militars took him, and as it was also the honorable thing to do in his position as president (the last president to commit suicide in Chile was Balmaceda, and it was right after he was deposed). Its no secret that Allende killed himself, but it was a suicide that was forced upon him.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>"A suicide that was forced upon him"? That's just nonsense. He freely elected to avoid, in the only way he knew how, the indignation of prosecution and jail for treasons as specified in the de-facto impeachment Resolution which authorized his removal. (Conveniently, Pinochet's subsequent actions enabled Allende's Marxist supporters to crow up martyrdom and pretend the Resolution and Allende's treasons never existed.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>actually, a voting was planned in september in order to see if Allende should stay in office or not, yet the coup took place before that could had ever been done, therefor when people say that it had no justification whatsoever (if the people would had wanted to impeach him, they would had gone with the democratic way). There was no "impeachment resolution" as it was forced that day, with the clear and undoubt support of the US. If Allende were to surrender he might as well would had been killed, as Pinochet so elequently sayd "when he gets on the plane, the plane falls man", wich is heard on the radio transmissions. Suicide was forced on him only because it was the only choice he had at that particular time, during the battle wich destroyed part of the goverment house. And just like Balmaceda, Allende had to do what other presidents in Chile have done once their goverment is overthrowned, the honorable thing to do, Allende lived the last days of the democratic presidents era. Now you talk about "Allende's treassons" and i ask you, of what treasson can you be talking of?: is it the "Plan Z", the fake justification done by the militars to justify the coup? (even a 4 year old could see its fake, considering its just less than 1 page long!!), the only treasson i see is the one done with the help of the united states and the "track 2", wich gaved 10 millions to support the oposition. How do i know im right?, because i got FACTS while you only have vague propaganda.</dd>

<p><a name="Dr_Sheila_Cassidy" id="Dr_Sheila_Cassidy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dr Sheila Cassidy</span></h2>
<p>For those unfamilar with the name, Dr Sheila Cassidy is a British citizen who was working in a hospital in Santiago in 1975, when she was taken into custody. Her subsequent incarceration and the ordeal she endured while incarcerated are, I think, suitable for brief addition to this article. The omission of a page about her should also be corrected, though I have woefully insufficient biographical information upon her to even begin the task. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalilasseia_7ac2.html" title="User:Calilasseia">Calilasseia</a> 22:13, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I disagree; including Cassidy would "set precedent" for including everyone else out there with a tale to tell (pro or con), with wrangling to inevitably follow as some are included and some are not. (Suffice also to say that <a href="http://www.forachange.co.uk/index.php?subjid=163,149,146&amp;stoid=335" class="external text" title="http://www.forachange.co.uk/index.php?subjid=163,149,146&amp;stoid=335" rel="nofollow">"taking sides"</a> during a civil war normally leads to consequences regardless of location.) What is notable regarding Cassidy is that she was released after only two months, which is a small fraction of the amount of time people suspected of, say, supporting terrorism, can expect to spend incarcerated even today.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 02:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Bear with me, being a relative newcomer, but would this necessarily set such a precedent?</p>
<p>To many here in the UK who actually remember the news coverage at the time, the omission of Dr Sheila Cassidy might seem a little odd. Although the names of other foreign nationals that were incarcerated by the DINA are omitted directly from this English version of the article (my foreign language choices at school did not include Spanish, so I can't check that page directly), they are mentioned with reference to Operation Condor.</p>
<p>I see no problem in mentioning that Cassidy and some other notable foreign nationals were incarcerated by the DINA under Pinochet's rule. That this happened is a fact, after all, and not in dispute. The level of detail devoted to this would, I agree, lead to some interesting editorial speculation here in the talk page, but the addition of the basic facts I see no problem with.</p>
<p>Such a statement would, after all, be restricted entirely to persons <i>incarcerated</i> by the DINA, which should narrow the field somewhat with regards to extraneous additions??? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalilasseia_7ac2.html" title="User:Calilasseia">Calilasseia</a> 15:01, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>All it's going to do is feed the "propaganda war" (the article is hard enough to deal with as it is). If it were up to me, I would hack great, heaping wads of <i>hear-say</i> straight out of this piece -- to necessarily include just about all references to anyone who made the "grand tour" of the Soviet-front orchestrated "peace rally" and lecture circuits in the 70s and 80s. It really is thirty years on, now; and time to start separating the truth from the (pardon my French) horseshit.</p>
<p>Regards Cassidy, see my last remarks. There's nothing, IMO, <i>particular</i> about her case as being related to Pinochet. I.e., given what she admitted to doing, the same thing would have likely happened to her in the penal system of (pick a fraction between 75% and 90%) of the nations on earth. Given that, and no discernable association between her and Pinochet other than the happenstance of her spending two months in a Chilean prison, I don't see the relevance of it.</p>

<p>It is a gross disservice to the truth for various fly-by vandals to keep hacking the <b>necessary relevance</b> of the Resolution off in what are, essentially, attempts by them to begin the history of Chile on September 11, 1973, and <i>whitewash out of existence everything before that date</i>.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 06:07, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This "authorization," as the POV-filled page you link to plainly states, has no force of law behind it, and authorized nothing. The paragraph as written before was accurate. The resolution should of course be discussed in the article, but this tortured first paragraph is nothing but an attempt to push POV. Please, let's stick to the facts. More pre-September 11th information can and should be added to the article, although <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilean_coup_of_1973.html" title="Chilean coup of 1973">Chilean coup of 1973</a> is the main article for the events leading up to the coup.

<dd>Chile, as you may be aware, did not have any US-style "articles of impeachment" for the Chamber of Deputies to follow as de facto "force of law"; it's only recourse of action is the one it chose: imploring the nation's military to oust the President.</dd>

<dd><b>An analogy</b>: It is about the same time in <i>alternate history</i> United States, where President Richard Nixon steadfastly refuses to resign in the face of growing demands he do so over gross misconduct in office. The US Congress, lacking a Constitutional means to impeach him, passes a resolution exhaustively detailing his various treasons and implores the US Army to address the grave national crisis; the resolution passes on a near 2:1 vote. Three weeks later, the US Army does so, and Nixon airs out his own head in preference to being arrested (and also to make a martyre of himself to his fervent supporters). General Westmoreland, rather than then going back to the barracks, uses the opportunity to establish a military junta ruled by him, and busies himself rooting out Nixon's supporters. Three decades later, Spanish-language historybooks and internet encylopedias still routinely present the Nixon's apologists' version of events in which the fact that an overwhelming majority of the Congress demanded he be militarily punted in the first place are buried way far down in the fine print if not swept under the rug entirely. Attempts to re-position the primary roll of the Congress in initiating the whole affair are ridiculed as "POV" and "misleading"; meanwhile, the apologists do not consider it "POV" to, variously, obsess over the "democratically-elected" "doctor" (actually a politician for thirty years) Nixon's "service" and "ambituous social reform projects", the contingency planning of his foreign adversaries, and especially, the "violent" details of the "coup" (which -- as opposed to the Congressionally-sanctioned removal of Nixon -- was actually bloodless, since it essentially consisted of Westmoreland just saying "No, I think I'll keep this brass-ring!" to Congress before dissolving it.)</dd>

<p>Other probles with the 1st paragraph that Rebrane keeps reverting: It is POV for it to contain more "background" information on Allende than Pinochet (for whom the Wiki entry pertains), and it is particularly POV to focus on Allende's short stint as a physician while not mentioning his near forty years as a government bureaucrat in one role or another. In fact, other than the necessity of mentioning that Pinochet replaced Allende, the first two paragraphs were entirely about Allende -- not Pinochet.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 19:52, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am preparing to edit, at length, the entire "Coup" section (as well as delete the third paragraph as being completely redundant with the "Coup" section) in order to distinguish the difference between the legislatively-implored military removal of Allende, and the after-the-fact assumption of dictatorial power by Pinochet. The <i>conflation</i> of these disparate events has gone on for far too long, and otherwise impugns the motives of many actors on the stage (e.g., the "rebelling" air force, etc).

<li>As indicated in the summary field of the last revert, I am attempting to acertain a repository for the original Resolution.

<dd>The accuracy of the translation of the resolution is not in dispute. The relevance is what is in dispute, and this is why primary sources are problematic. You can assert that Pinochet was motivated by the Resolution, but from the sources cited in the article, we don't even know that he read it.

Whether Pinochet was "motivated" by the Resolution, or merely found it convenient to pre-existing schemes, is something I do not comment upon.</dd>
<dd>The Resolution belongs in the article, top-front-and-center, because it represents the majority opinion of the Chilean legislature regards the forcible removal of Allende, and it is therefore considerably more relevant to the subject than, say, "strikes", or external opinions.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 03:25, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed. If anyone here has read "The Crucial Day" a book in interview format with Pinochet he says that while he was in Northern Chile running a military prison for labor activists Allende (then a Congressman) and other Socialist politicians went to try and investigate the prison. Pinochet confronted Allende (because he said that the Congressmen needed a warrant to inspect the prison) and Allende said (and I am paraphrasing Pinochet's statement of what he said) "We are going in" and Pinochet then implied that he would have to order his soldiers to shoot them if they tried to go in without a warrant and then the Congressmen left. This definately should be mentioned in this article.

<p>In addition, the Chamber of Deputies of Chile Resolution of August 22, 1973 is important, but does not need to appear in the first paragraph.
