<dd>After looking at the discussion, I can't say I'm persuaded either way. I can see the arguments of both sides, but I'm not inclined to express a <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b>&#160;!vote. There are worse categories that need attention but if somebody wants to waste their time deleting these, so be it.

<p>Hello.

<p>I'm putting together a story on the challenges involved in keeping ideologically charged Wikipedia pages up, open and unlocked. I'm really interested in tracking down people that monitor and manage such pages. Examples include: George W. Bush's page, the page on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, the page on The Armenian Genocide and pages on creationism and evolution. I see that you’ve worked on the Bush page a lot. I was wondering if you might be willing to talk to me about the challenges of keeping pages like this up and unlocked. If you have any thoughts on tracking down the right person to talk to for a story like this, please shoot them my way. I hope to get in contact with you. You can email me here: matt.phillips@wsj.com</p>

<p>Hi Auburn Pilot,</p>
<p>I'm terribly confused about copyright and the Lucien Durosoir image I uploaded. I took a photo of this picture, which is over 100 years old and is owned by Lucien Durosoir's son. I have his full permission to use it on Wikipedia. Which copyright option should I choose?</p>

<dd>Hi John, I'd be happy to take a look and assume you are referring to <a href="../../../d/u/r/Image%7EDurosoirconcertposter.jpg_df91.html" title="Image:Durosoirconcertposter.jpg">Image:Durosoirconcertposter.jpg</a> which you uploaded 16 January 2007. If not, let me know. Unfortunately, full permission to use on Wikipedia <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" class="external text" title="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" rel="nofollow">isn't enough</a>.

If the image had been released in the United States before 1923, {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-US_e8fa.html" title="Template:PD-US">PD-US</a>}} would be the appropriate tag. However, it doesn't appear from the image to have been a US Copyright issue.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Phallic Fulgarite</span></h2>
<p>I am writing regarding your characterization of my edit to the fulgarite article as vandalism, or in your "words," a test--and the concomitant personal comment, "Harvard, tisk tisk." I would have you know that as a tenured geologist, I have done extensive research into the properties of fulgarite, and, as a matter of fact, my comparison of the mineral to the male sexual organ is visually, topologically and culturally accurate. Once formed from lightning, fulgarite exhibits a uneven, partially tapered structure, from shaft to tip, that is extraordinarly evocative of the phallus. As a result, many societies throughout human history have considered fulgarite to be a symbol of virility. The mineral makes several prominent appearances in Anasazi pornographic lore. The carrot, to which fulgarite was previously likened in the eponymous article, does not display an exponential rate of change in its radius as a function of height, as does both fulgarite and the penis. Frankly, I wonder if you have ever set eyes on fulgarite material in your life. In the future you shouldn't be too hasty to foist your uninformed ego on the flow of information. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.46.130_6be1.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.46.130">140.247.46.130</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/0/User_talk%7E140.247.46.130.html" title="User talk:140.247.46.130">talk</a>) 10:03, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rice Poll Results</span></h2>
<p>AuburnPilot,</p>
<p>Since you apparently believe the characterization I have made is not neutral, please consider posing the following question to some neutral acquaintances you may have.</p>
<p>Polling results for three individuals rate performance in two categories, “Excellent/Pretty Good” and “Only Fair/Poor”. The “Excellent/Pretty Good” percentage results for the three individuals are as follows: A-46; B-32; and C-29; and the “Only Fair/Poor Ratings” are A-48, B-66; and C-58. Which of the following are fair to say regarding A’s results? 1. A has the highest job rating of the group. 2. A has the least disfavorable job rating of the group. 3. A has less than a 50% favorability job rating 4. A has a disfavorable job rating</p>
<p>If you think this question is unfair, please let me know how you would make it fairer. Thank you for your communication.Ohioan1 14:47, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems I was looking at the categories of the CBS Poll directly above the Harris Poll, which you were referring to. As to your questions, I would actually say A has the highest job rating of the group. Maybe I'm just optimistic&#160;;-). Besides, "least disfavorable" implies that all aspects in comparison are also "disfavorable" which would be putting a POV spin on the results. Disfavorable doesn't even seem to be a word; I think you're looking for "unfavorable" <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/unfavorable" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/unfavorable" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><small>talk</small></a> 17:18, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>(cross posted to <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a>'s talk page)</small> Thanks very much for the offer. I was actually contacted by another use via email a few days ago asking if I would accept a nomination. My concern is that my participation in deletion discussions is quite limited. It is an area of Wikipedia that is of no interest to me, and I only participate when I stumble across a nominated article/category/misc. I've seen too many good users massacred at RfA for this reason, and must decline a nomination at this time. I will most likely submit to an editor review in the coming weeks, and would appreciate any feedback you can provide. Again, thanks very much for the offer. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><small>talk</small></a> 16:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad to help. If you're willing to put in the effort, it could be a great service and I definitely like the idea. I'm just not sure how to <i>get the word out</i>. Is it something you're wanting to keep in your userspace or eventually move into a full WikiProject? Obviously in your own space, you have a bit more control. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><small>talk</small></a> 20:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not interested in getting the word out <i>too</i> much -- I am not going to have a lot of time to answer requests, and I definitely don't want to get ahead of myself and the disappoint a bunch of people. It's definitely a userspace project, and although I think it would make a good WikiResource, I don't think it would be wise to do so without a good support team of researchers. Also, maybe one with the same mission already exists (reference desk or something?)... I haven't looked. Just an idea I've been kicking around. Appreciate the input. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 21:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll take a look around, but I haven't come across such as service on-Wiki. I think (though I've never used it) the RefDesk works more like a Google Answers type service, backed up by searching Wikipedia. You're right about keeping it in userspace; elsewhere would require much more users with similar access. Maybe put up a notice on your userpage and see if anybody bites. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><small>talk</small></a> 21:55, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section you added "Speach mishaps" adds nothing to the article in terms of valuable content and your long history of vandalizing this article makes it quite clear your intentions are not to better the article.
