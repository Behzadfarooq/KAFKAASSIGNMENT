<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series_16ea.html" title="Edit section: Narrative style">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Narrative style</span></h2>
<p>These novels use a narrative voice contemporary with their setting; thus the author-narrator speaks with the same idioms and vocabulary as the characters, in the years in which the novels are set. This contrasts with many modern historical novels, in which the reader might expect a more modern narrative style or at least a bit less jargon of the period.</p>
<p>O'Brian's use of naval jargon provides a second noteworthy stylistic feature, with little or no translation for the "lubberly" reader. The combination of the historical-voice narration and naval terms may seem daunting at first to some readers; but most note that after a short while a "total immersion" effect results. However, the naval lexicon can baffle any reader, and many devotees of the "POB" canon (Patrick O'Brian's work) find support in numerous companion-books. Dean King's <i>A Sea Of Words</i> provides a notable example of this type of work (other publications appear in the bibliography). An explanation given to the non-naval Maturin during his first sailing best sums up the style: Maturin asks if the sailor can describe the rigging and ship without using sea-terms, and receives the answer: "No, for it is by those names alone that they are known, in nearly every case" (<i>Master and Commander</i>, pg. 111, 1990 Norton Paperback Edition).</p>
<p>O'Brian's abrupt style of conclusion makes for an unusual feature of the Aubrey-Maturin novels. Typically a final short sentence, usually dialogue, delivers the last plot-turn or indicates a resolution at hand. O'Brian employs no dénouement or <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilogue.html" title="Epilogue">epilogue</a> whatsoever. Since the Aubrey-Maturin novels form a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon.html" title="Canon">canon</a>, readers know they will have to proceed to the next volume to uncover the details of the resolution for the one they have just finished; and some of the editions include extensive additional material (typically literary or personal comments about O'Brian) that make the ending even more abrupt by concealing how many pages remain.</p>

<p>The series portrays the rise of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Aubrey_5fd5.html" title="Jack Aubrey">Jack Aubrey</a> from <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/a/Rear_Admiral_ba9d.html" title="Rear Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> in the Royal Navy during the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolutionary_Wars_5553.html" title="French Revolutionary Wars">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Many of his exploits and reverses reflect the chequered career of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cochrane_4bcc.html" title="Thomas Cochrane">Thomas Cochrane</a>. However, his character and his politics differ markedly from those of his model.</p>
<p>Aubrey's friend <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Maturin_2de9.html" title="Stephen Maturin">Stephen Maturin</a>, an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a>-<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalan</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician.html" title="Physician">physician</a> operates as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">naturalist</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spy</a>. In his role as a naturalist he resembles Sir <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Banks_e3ea.html" title="Joseph Banks">Joseph Banks</a>. Maturin's long pursuit of the beautiful but unreliable Diana Villiers provides a recurring theme.</p>
<p><a name="Humour" id="Humour"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series_16ea.html" title="Edit section: Humour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Humour</span></h3>
<p>A lot of the humour in the series come from the two principal characters' <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropisms</a>. Aubrey, though a genius at sea and with practical matters, has large gaps in his understanding of everything else, and should never be allowed within twelve <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fathom.html" title="Fathom">fathoms</a> of a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>.</p>
<p>Maturin, by contrast, though extremely erudite and a linguist, remains perpetually doomed in his occasional attempts to use naval slang, or to explain the working of a ship to someone — though his ignorance of naval maneuvers often serves as a useful device for some more experienced sailor to come up with a more correct technical description of the whole thing, suited "to the meanest understanding" — something that a reader who doesn't know <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starboard.html" title="Starboard">starboard</a> from <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larboard.html" title="Larboard">larboard</a> will come to appreciate over a period of time.</p>
<p>So we have Aubrey's attempting to use the occasional word of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and describing a <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patois.html" title="Patois">patois</a></i> as a <i><a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">putain</a></i> and Maturin saying <i>"if the Admiral proves inquisitive, I may toss him off with a round turn"</i> (as opposed to the correct phrase: to <i>bring someone up with a round turn</i>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, O'Brian sets up an extensive but subtle humorous contrast between Aubrey and Maturin. Aubrey, a masterful sailor and naval tactician, usually proves inept and unlucky in his affairs ashore; often needing to quickly take to sea to avoid his troubles on land. Maturin, on the other hand, while showing extraordinary subtlety and tact while on land, demonstrates clumsiness and ignorance when it comes to seafaring; contriving to fall out of various ships and boats and hopeless as regards the art of sailing.</p>
<p>O'Brian's bone-dry and cutting wit, present throughout all his novels, provides another principal source of humour in the canon. The delivery, whether in the form of narration or dialogue, seems often so forthright that the reader (or listener) may not perceive it at first. At times, however, O'Brian will spend a considerable portion of a volume setting up comedic sequences, perhaps most notably Jack's "debauchery" (by inadvertently making it drunk) of Maturin's pet <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloth.html" title="Sloth">sloth</a>.</p>
<p>O'Brian will often have one character comment on another character's level of humour as a prime indicator of that character's emotional state. However, Aubrey's character seems much more complex. He has an almost oafish sense of humour that is restricted to laborious puns, a near complete ignorance of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_philosophy.html" title="Natural philosophy">natural philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">painting</a>. On the plus side, he is a fan of the more popular kind of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a>, and is a skilled amateur <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violinist</a>.</p>
<p>Frequently, O'Brian uses humour and jokes spoken or written by the characters to illustrate or develop character. Aubrey's delight in small witticisms, such as inducing Maturin to choose between 'the lesser of two weevils', recurrs in the series, as does Maturin's concealed, acerbic wit — such as his statement that the shortest watches of duty on board the ship, the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogwatch.html" title="Dogwatch">dogwatches</a>, are so called because they are "Curtailed" ("Cur Tailed", "cur" meaning "dog").</p>
<p>When Stephen points out an interesting bird or animal to him he usually asks, <i>Can it be ate?'</i>. In <i><a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Captain_d7bf.html" title="Post Captain">Post Captain</a></i>, on being shown a painting of Mary Magdalene hovering over a seascape, the one thing he notices, apart from her scantily covered bosom, is that the direction of the wind indicated by her flowing garments means that a small craft detailed in the painting, 'somewhat like a pink', with 'absurd lateens', will soon find itself on a lee shore.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series_16ea.html" title="Edit section: Toilet and sexual humour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Toilet and sexual humour</span></h4>
<p>O'Brian inserts some <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_humour.html" title="Toilet humour">toilet humour</a> into the narrative, as for example when Jack, severely constipated and in no shape for a long series of official dinners, gets a dose of <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_pill.html" title="Blue pill">Blue Pill and Black Draught</a> purgative from Maturin. He decides for himself that his huge frame requires a larger dose, and gets himself a second dose from Maturin's colleague Martin, leading to his spending several hours in the toilet, something that tickles his steward Killick's delight - "Which he's taken a ninety year lease of the quarter gallery" and "he's in his cabin now, snoring as loud as he ever he..." Killick stops himself before the next word because the comparison is "not genteel."</p>
<p>Killick frequently expresses the hope that he might be able to serve out people he dislikes by shoving something up their anuses - in <i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Desolation_Island_9686.html" title="Desolation Island">Desolation Island</a></i>, he fumes at the dockyard workers who improperly <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caulk.html" title="Caulk">caulked</a> the ship, making it wet and leaky, by wishing that he could "caulk them, with a red hot caulking iron, right up their _____". In another book, Maturin gives a purser whom Killick dislikes a <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clyster.html" title="Clyster">clyster</a>, and Killick says "How I wish I could have given it him, the b_____".</p>
<p>O'Brian occasionally makes use of dashes to express supposedly unprintable words, a device that 18th- and 19th-century authors frequently used, sometimes to excess. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Tull_79d0.html" title="Patrick Tull">Patrick Tull's</a> recorded versions of the entire canon for audio-publisher Recorded Books replaces these dashes by the words they obviously represent.</p>
<p>O'Brian also uses <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_entendre.html" title="Double entendre">double entendre</a> to good effect. Humor is derived from words now thought of as "dirty", but quite acceptable in the early 19th century, or factually correct in a much different sense. In <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_and_Commander_b175.html" title="Master and Commander">Master and Commander</a></i>, O'Brian casually introduces his readers to the <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cunt_splice.html" title="Cunt splice">cunt splice</a>. Again in <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_and_Commander_b175.html" title="Master and Commander">Master and Commander</a></i>, Lt. Dillon mentions that the Sophie's sailing master has a latent homosexual longing for Aubrey, and if Aubrey doesn't realize it, he is perhaps 'lacking in penetration'.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ionian_Mission_3115.html" title="The Ionian Mission">The Ionian Mission</a></i>, Babbington rescues several women from a pirate and gets scolded by Aubrey for "whoremongering". Babbington's immediate reply is "Oh no, Sir - they are <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">Lesbians</a>". Of course they are - they hail from the Greek island of <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbos.html" title="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>, whose association with the poetess <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sappho.html" title="Sappho">Sappho</a> gave its name to sex between women. Another humorous term appears with complete seriousness in <i>The Ionian Mission</i> as a device much discussed by the scientifically-minded gentlemen aboard ship: the piece of sugar-refining equipment known as the "double-bottomed defecator".</p>
<p>Similarly, in <i><a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason%27s_Harbour_11ce.html" title="Treason's Harbour">Treason's Harbour</a></i> Stephen describes the mechanism of a diving-bell to a pretty Italian double-agent and at one point offers to amplify his explanation with a sketch of the part which lets water in and out: "Will I draw you my little cock?" In another reference to the diving-bell, Stephen offers to search for a lost object underwater with a triumphant exclamation of "After all, I am an urinator!" "Urinator", of course, in the little-used sense of "diver".</p>
<p>O'Brian takes the funny-words theme a step further, introducing similarly "funny" names of real or imagined people into the narrative, mostly puns on <a href="../../../b/u/g/Buggery.html" title="Buggery">buggery</a> and other sexual themes.</p>
<p>In <i>Master and Commander</i>, Jack and his crew stop a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Danish</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brig.html" title="Brig">brig</a> called the <i>Clomer</i>, whose captain rejoices in the name of Ole Bugge. Jack barely stops himself from filling in an obligatory <i>r</i> at the end of Captain Bugge's surname. In the same book, Jack mentions his bankers: <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._Hoare_%26_Co_9727.html" title="C. Hoare &amp; Co">Hoares</a> - while the midshipmen listening can barely restrain their glee at how the name puns with "whores".</p>
<p>More funnily-named bankers occur further on in the canon where Stephen, seated at dinner with Jack and another (quite austere and religious) post captain with a known distaste for swearing, laments the poor service his bankers give him - and wishes he could find a better banker - another <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugger.html" title="Fugger">Fugger</a>. This references the famous family of 15th- and 16th-century bankers of that name, with various members of the family getting themselves nicknames like <i>The <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugger.html" title="Fugger">Fugger</a> of the Deer</i> and <i>The Rich <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugger.html" title="Fugger">Fugger</a></i>.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ionian_Mission_3115.html" title="The Ionian Mission">The Ionian Mission</a></i>, Jack meets a post captain , the son of a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28priest%29.html" title="Canon (priest)">Canon</a> of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Berkshire_8835.html" title="Windsor, Berkshire">Windsor</a>. He immediately puns <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28priest%29.html" title="Canon (priest)">Canon</a> with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">Cannon</a>, joking that the man is a "<a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_a_gun.html" title="Son of a gun">son of a gun</a>". Not too surprisingly, this joke, with its implication of <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">bastardy</a>, doesn't quite amuse the captain concerned.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Surgeon%27s_Mate_d17a.html" title="The Surgeon's Mate">The Surgeon's Mate</a></i>, Maturin's godfather, the Catalan colonel in charge of Grimsholm island, has a party piece - a long poem about his grandfather's campaign with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mordaunt%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Peterborough_2bf8.html" title="Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough">Lord Peterborough</a>, where he keeps mispronouncing "borough" to "rhyme with mugger" ... Lord Peterbuggah.</p>
<p>Jack's shipmates share his tastes in the "punning on names" line - M. Dutourd, in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wine_Dark_Sea_aed8.html" title="The Wine Dark Sea">The Wine Dark Sea</a></i> becomes not too popular with the old man-of-war hands on the <i>Surprise</i>, and Killick immediately shortens his name to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turd.html" title="Turd">Turd</a>. In <i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Desolation_Island_9686.html" title="Desolation Island">Desolation Island</a></i>, the crew of an American <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brig.html" title="Brig">brig</a>, the <i>Asa Foulkes</i>, hail <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_Bonden_ace6.html" title="Barrett Bonden">Barrett Bonden</a>; and he hails them back, with, as O'Brian puts it, a deliberate mispronunciation of the brig's name .. quite likely something on the lines of <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arse.html" title="Arse">Arse</a> <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fucks</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series_16ea.html" title="Edit section: Music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
<p>Music is an abiding presence in the novels: indeed the entire novel sequence begins with Aubrey meeting Maturin for the first time at a performance of a <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_quartet.html" title="String quartet">string quartet</a> by <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locatelli.html" title="Locatelli">Locatelli</a>. Jack Aubrey's musicality considerably exceeds Maturin's earliest assessment of it and it is one of the primary bases of their enduring friendship. Maturin himself plays the cello, and throughout the novels the two characters perform duets together, usually in the privacy of Aubrey's cabin, sometimes allowing other characters of some (little) musical gift to take part. In music they often seem to be most in harmony. O'Brian displays a fairly wide knowledge of the music of the period. Plenty of allusion is made to such composers as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corelli.html" title="Corelli">Corelli</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart.html" title="Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Melchior_Molter_ea15.html" title="Johann Melchior Molter">Molter</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummel.html" title="Hummel">Hummel</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Christian_Bach_b472.html" title="Johann Christian Bach">Johann Christian</a> and indeed his father <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_d0b5.html" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>. Correctly for the period, the name 'Bach' means J.C. rather than J.S. to both Aubrey and Maturin, but in <i>The Ionian Mission</i> Aubrey is in the somewhat unlikely situation of trying to learn a work from manuscript that is clearly J.S. Bach's then-obscure but now famous D minor <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaconne.html" title="Chaconne">Chaconne</a>. In the same novel he is hoping to get a choir of seamen in HMS <i>Worcester</i> to perform choruses from <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handel.html" title="Handel">Handel</a>'s <i><a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a></i>. Aubrey and Maturin often improvise on favourite themes, folksongs or operatic airs, and passing reference is made to Maturin sometimes composing small pieces of his own.</p>

Aubrey courts Sophia Williams (the eldest daughter) but also feels attracted to Diana, with whom he commences an affair.</p>
<p>Aubrey plans to marry Sophia Williams, but when his prize-agent embezzles his fortune he flees the country to avoid his creditors, travelling with Maturin in France and Spain. The outbreak of war in 1803 restores him to active service, and following his endeavours as commander of the unusual HMS <i>Polychrest</i> he gains promotion to <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Captain_d7bf.html" title="Post Captain">Post Captain</a>, and receives temporary command of <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Lively_%281804%29_a9b1.html" title="HMS Lively (1804)">HMS <i>Lively</i></a> while Captain Hammond takes leave.</p>

<p>Aubrey takes command of the frigate <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Surprise_9a40.html" title="HMS Surprise">HMS <i>Surprise</i></a>, charged with carrying a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> ambassador to the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Indies_31c2.html" title="East Indies">East Indies</a>. Much of the novel deals with the ups and downs of Maturin's relationship with Diana Villiers. Jack's romance with Sophie Williams also progresses.</p>
<p>This book also describes Aubrey's first stint in command of, and provides the readers' first encounter with the <i>Surprise</i> herself. Although apparently based on the real <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> frigate <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Surprise_%281794%29_c07a.html" title="HMS Surprise (1794)">HMS <i>Surprise</i></a>, she appears as a ship on which Aubrey had served as a youth. (His initials remain carved in the mast.) The real HMS <i>Surprise</i>, however, entered the Royal Navy as a prize captured from the French in 1796, so that O'Brian would seem to have added some fifteen years to her age, taking her capture (which he mentions) back to the previous phase of Anglo-French hostilities which formed part of the war of American independence (1776-1783).</p>
<p>The <i>Surprise</i> becomes Aubrey's favourite ship, and appears in many other novels in the series.</p>
<p>On the return voyage the <i>Surprise</i> encounters a fleet of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a>, returning from China laden with goods. The fleet comes under attack from a French squadron, but Aubrey organizes a spirited defence from the merchant ships and bluffs the French into retreating. This episode reflects elements of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pulo_Aura_a676.html" title="Battle of Pulo Aura">Battle of Pulo Aura</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">15 February</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a>, in which 16 merchant ships of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a> under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance, drove off a French squadron consisting of the <i>Marengo</i> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventy-four_%28ship%29.html" title="Seventy-four (ship)">74 guns</a>), <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Belle_Poule_%281802%29_aa3f.html" title="French ship Belle Poule (1802)"><i>Belle-Poule</i></a> (40), <i>Sémillante</i> (36), <i>Berceau</i> (22) and <i>Aventurier</i> (16), commanded by Rear-Admiral <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles-Alexandre_L%C3%A9on_Durand_Linois_0cc1.html" title="Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois">Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois</a>.

On board he has a number of prisoners bound for the colonies and transportees, and Dr. Maturin has the task of extracting information from one, a beautiful American spy named Louisa Wogan. Maturin works to deceive Ms. Wogan with a scheme to compromise the American and French spy-networks. En route to Australia, the <i>Leopard</i> becomes becalmed and devastated by <i>jail fever</i> (<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic_typhus.html" title="Epidemic typhus">epidemic typhus</a>) caught from the prisoners; she engages in a chilling life-or-death chase with the Dutch <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventy-four_%28ship%29.html" title="Seventy-four (ship)">74 gun</a> <i>Waakzaamheid</i>, nearly sinks after running on an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctic.html" title="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceberg.html" title="Iceberg">iceberg</a>, and becomes stranded on Desolation Island, a frigid, uninhabited <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archipelago.html" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a> in the southern <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Ocean_dac8.html" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>.

<p>The real-life <i>Leopard's</i> earlier involvement in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake-Leopard_Affair_c8bc.html" title="Chesapeake-Leopard Affair">Chesapeake-Leopard Affair</a> gets a mention, and the book deals with the tension between the English and Americans on the eve of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. O'Brian based the account of the near sinking of the <i>Leopard</i> (after striking an iceberg) on an actual event involving <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Guardian_%281784%29_e619.html" title="HMS Guardian (1784)">HMS <i>Guardian</i></a> in 1789.

<p><i>Desolation Island</i> marks a turning point in the Aubrey/Maturin novels. Whereas the previous four novels had featured self-contained plots (O'Brian wrote <i>Master and Commander</i> as a stand-alone novel, and the following three titles merely acted as sequels whose story arcs integrated only loosely with any of the other novels in the saga), in <i>Desolation Island</i>, O'Brian now begins an arc that will continue through the entirety of <i>Fortune of War</i> before concluding in <i>The Surgeon's Mate</i>. Some of the events set in motion in this arc will return to haunt Jack and Stephen as late as <i>The Yellow Admiral,</i> novel number 18.</p>

<p>Set during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>, this novel contains lightly fictionalized accounts of the battles between <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Java_afd0.html" title="HMS Java">HMS <i>Java</i></a> and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Constitution_26ac.html" title="USS Constitution">USS <i>Constitution</i></a>, and between <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Shannon_7d09.html" title="HMS Shannon">HMS <i>Shannon</i></a> and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Chesapeake_79b8.html" title="USS Chesapeake">USS <i>Chesapeake</i></a>.</p>
<p>The Americans capture Aubrey and become particularly suspicious of him as a former commander of <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Leopard_0cc4.html" title="HMS Leopard">HMS <i>Leopard</i></a>, due to the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake-Leopard_Affair_c8bc.html" title="Chesapeake-Leopard Affair">Chesapeake-Leopard Affair</a>.</p>
<p>This book extensively explores Maturin's character while he and Aubrey languish in captivity in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, as he can manifest his various roles; doctor, spy, and tormented lover. It continues the account of Maturin's pursuit of Diana Villiers, with whom he remains deeply in love.</p>
<p>Critical readers regard the degree of freedom the French agents have as most improbable in <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist.html" title="Federalist">Federalist</a> Boston, where the local authorities somewhat frowned on the French; nor does the somewhat loose guard on Aubrey in the novel seem entirely plausible.</p>

<p>The story starts in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. Aubrey and Maturin, having escaped from the Americans in Boston on <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Shannon_%281806%29_82f8.html" title="HMS Shannon (1806)">HMS <i>Shannon</i></a>, start their return journey to England aboard a packet ship.

<p>Maturin embarks on a mission to the Baltic to persuade the Catalan garrison of the fortress at Grimsholm to defect. It seems likely that this episode reflects similar events in 1808. In 1807, the Spanish government, at that time allied with France, had sent 15,000 troops to Denmark to act as a garrison against a possible British landing there. These troops, among the best in Spain, garrisoned offshore islands in small detachments and remained in the dark about political developments in Spain following Napoleon's invasion and occupation of Spain in 1807 (see <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsular_War_b8ff.html" title="Peninsular War">Peninsular War</a>). The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> dispatched the Scottish <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monk James Robertson (on the advice of his brother <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wellesley%2C_1st_Marquess_Wellesley_161c.html" title="Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley">Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley</a>). Robertson, brought up at the Benedictine abbey at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regensburg.html" title="Regensburg">Regensburg</a> in Germany, managed to pass through occupied Germany under the guise of "Adam Rohrauer", a dealer in cigars and chocolate. Robertson made contact with the Spanish general, the Marquis de la Romana, on the island of <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funen.html" title="Funen">Funen</a>, where the two agreed that the Spanish troops would defect and return to Spain on British ships. Robertson escaped to <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heligoland.html" title="Heligoland">Heligoland</a> (then a British possession) to inform Admiral <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Goodwin_Keats_c2a8.html" title="Richard Goodwin Keats">Richard Goodwin Keats</a> of the agreement, and a fleet of transports escorted by <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Superb_%281798%29_0610.html" title="HMS Superb (1798)">HMS <i>Superb</i></a> embarked 9,000 Spanish soldiers.</p>
<p>The imprisonment of Aubrey and Maturin in the Temple prison in Paris may echo the case of Captain <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Smith_%28admiral%29_60aa.html" title="Sidney Smith (admiral)">Sidney Smith</a>, captured on <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_April_e49d.html" title="19th April">19th April</a> <a href="../../../1/7/9/1796.html" title="1796">1796</a> while attempting to cut out a French ship in <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Havre_3181.html" title="Le Havre">Le Havre</a>. Instead of exchanging him (as customary), the French took Smith to the Temple prison and charged him with arson for his burning of the fleet at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulon.html" title="Toulon">Toulon</a> in 1793. Smith remained held in Paris for two years, despite a number of efforts to exchange him and frequent contacts with both French Royalists and British agents. In 1798, Royalists pretending to take him to another prison instead helped him to escape. They brought him to Le Havre, where he boarded a fishing boat and then transferred to a British frigate on patrol in the English Channel, arriving in London on <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_May_555c.html" title="8th May">8th May</a> <a href="../../../1/7/9/1798.html" title="1798">1798</a>. Some historians have speculated that he allowed the French Republicans to capture him so that he could make contact with the Royalists.</p>
<p>The title of the novel offers a play on words, referring not just to Maturin's assistant but also to his long-time love-interest and future wife, Diana Villiers.</p>

In this novel Captain Jack Aubrey takes the frigate HMS <i>Surprise</i> around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean in pursuit of the American frigate USS <i>Norfolk</i> and in defense of British whalers in the South Seas.

<p>Newly returned to England, Aubrey hears a rumor from a stranger he meets in an inn that a peace with <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> will soon be signed. The stranger, who seems to be a diplomatic agent named Palmer, indicates to Aubrey how he can make money on the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_exchange.html" title="Stock exchange">stock exchange</a> by buying stocks sure to go up as soon as the news becomes public. Aubrey makes the transactions as he has been advised, and also gives the advice to his father, the widely-disliked Radical General Aubrey, who makes much larger stock transactions and spreads the rumor much farther. The rumor of a peace treaty gets out, and the stock transactions are highly profitable - more so to the General and his stock-jobbing friends than to Aubrey.</p>
<p>Then it is revealed that the rumor is a false one, and that Palmer was no part of the government (it is later revealed that he was directed by the two highest placed English agents in the service of the French). Aubrey is arrested, imprisoned at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshalsea.html" title="Marshalsea">Marshalsea</a>, and undergoes a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guildhall%2C_London_ba77.html" title="Guildhall, London">Guildhall</a> trial for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Maturin tries to help his friend. He uses his colleagues in the government and hires an investigator, but is unable to secure enough proof to win an acquittal - Palmer, the key figure, having been murdered and mutilated. Aubrey, despite a touching belief in British justice, is convicted after a two day trial, fined £2,500 and sentenced to one hour in the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillory.html" title="Pillory">pillory</a>. However, his one hour begins with what is described as a noise similar to the start of a battle, inferring that instead of being lampooned, Aubrey is cheered. He is also dismissed from the Royal Navy (struck off the list), and this is clearly a far more devastating punishment for him that the time spent in the pillory.</p>
<p>Maturin has inherited a vast sum from his Spanish godfather. He utilises a small part of his money to buying the old HMS <i>Surprise</i> at auction and obtaining letters of marque and reprisal. In part he does this because he is still deep in the intelligence game and could not, would not, sail with any one other than Jack.</p>
<p>The story and many of the details of the trial are based on the trial of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Cochrane_5f56.html" title="Lord Cochrane">Lord Cochrane</a>.</p>

<p>Maturin purchases the <i>Surprise</i> and Aubrey is granted a <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_of_marque.html" title="Letter of marque">letter of marque</a>. Aubrey prepares the <i>Surprise</i> to sail as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privateer.html" title="Privateer">privateer</a>, finding many things quite different than in the Navy. He is bitter and low-spirited about his dismissal for much of the book. However, he is strongly supported by his crew - notably a group of smugglers and religious fanatics recruited at the little port of Shelmerston (fictional) in south-west England - and his success in a cutting-out raid on the French port of St. Martin makes him a popular hero.</p>
<p>(Note: the "letter of marque" of the title probably refers to the <i>Surprise</i> herself, rather than the document.)</p>

<p>Immediately following <i>The Letter of Marque</i>, the story picks up with Aubrey getting the <i>Surprise</i> underway for the mission to South America. Upon reaching Portugal, however, they are intercepted by Sir Joseph Blaine and Aubrey learns that he is to be reinstated with his former seniority as a Post Captain in the Royal Navy, and given the recently captured French ship <i>Diane</i>, the <i>Surprise</i> to be commanded by Captain Pullings.</p>
<p>His new assignment leads us into the story of a venture to the fictitious Malay island of Pulo Prabang, where Fox, an ambitious King's emissary, attempts to win over the local king with a treaty, while the French attempt the same. The French, in this case, are now being openly assisted by the same English traitors who were responsible for Aubrey's disgrace.</p>
<p>Stephen's work keeps him undercover as a naturalist as he engages in a political duel for influence at the Sultan's court. Although his works are to go unknown, they prove to be invaluable in both undermining the French efforts and finally exacting his revenge on his enemies, the French agents, Ledward and Wray.</p>
<p>Ledward and Wray are caught in bed with Abdul, a boy who is the Sultan's cupbearer and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catamite.html" title="Catamite">catamite</a>, the Sultan having <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederast.html" title="Pederast">pederast</a> tendencies, though married and fathering a son by his queen. Abdul is gruesomely executed, while Wray and Ledward are banished from the court, effectively ending the French mission. Ledward and Wray are later shot: O'Brian leaves it until well into the following novel to confirm Maturin as the assassin. Maturin dissects their bodies with a fellow natural philosopher and intelligence agent and then reduces them to skeletons by laying their remains on an anthill.</p>
<p>Returning, Aubrey and the crew of the <i>Diane</i> are shipwrecked on a desert island. Fox and his colleagues decide to sail for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batavia.html" title="Batavia">Batavia</a> in <i>Diane</i>s <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinnace.html" title="Pinnace">pinnace</a>, but are caught in a typhoon and killed. Aubrey's crew decides to stay on the island and build a small schooner from the ship's remains.</p>
<p>The title refers to the honor that is due to Fox as an official envoy and representative of the King.</p>

<p>The book opens with the pursuit of an American privateer (the <i>Franklin</i>) in the south Pacific, and a volcanic eruption which damages the <i>Surprise</i> and disables the <i>Franklin</i>. The <i>Franklin</i> is taken, and Dutourd, a Frenchman, is found to be the owner. He plans to conquer a south Pacific island and establish a paradise of equality, justice, and little labor, after first enriching himself by committing piracy on assorted whalers and merchantmen, and then wiping out the island's hostile native population.</p>
<p>Maturin recognizes Dutourd from earlier days in the high society <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon_%28gathering%29.html" title="Salon (gathering)">salons</a> of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and takes pains to hide his identity from the Frenchman. Aubrey, meanwhile, finds that not only does Dutourd not know the basic courtesies of life at sea, but does not have a <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_of_marque.html" title="Letter of marque">letter of marque</a> permitting him to operate the <i>Franklin</i> as a privateer. The <i>Franklin</i> had taken several British ships as prizes and Dutourd's legal status is that of a <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirate</a>, liable to be hanged.</p>
<p>An American whaler is taken by the <i>Surprise</i> and the <i>Franklin</i>, and a British sailor on the whaler tells Aubrey of a French ship — the <i>Alastor</i> — turned a true pirate, unlike the <i>Franklin</i>, flying the <a href="../../../j/o/l/Jolly_Roger_59dd.html" title="Jolly Roger">black flag</a> and demanding immediate surrender or death of its victims. The <i>Franklin</i> encounters the <i>Alastor</i> first, is outmatched, but the <i>Surprise</i> overcomes the pirates, with Aubrey receiving yet another wound in action.</p>
<p>The story now turns to Maturin's secret mission to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>. He is put ashore and makes valuable contact among local military and government officials sympathetic to Peruvian independence, aided by Aubrey's illegitimate son Sam Panda, a prominent official in the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Dutourd proves to be problematic, both for Maturin and for Aubrey. Maturin needs to maintain his identity as a simple ship's surgeon and naturalist, keeping his secrecy as a secret agent for the British, particularly since the current voyage of the <i>Surprise</i> is intended to deliver Maturin to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a> where he is to incite a revolution against the Spanish colonial government. Maturin's plans go sour. Dutourd escapes from the <i>Surprise</i>, aided by sympathetic crewmen. Reaching <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>, he raises a hue and cry, denouncing Maturin, on the eve of a carefully engineered revolution, as an English spy. The revolution fails due to this premature exposure and Maturin has to flee for his life.</p>
<p>Aubrey, meanwhile, sails in a small boat with few crewmen to San Lorenzo in an attempt to warn Maturin of Dutourd's escape; after many days of hard sailing in daunting weather conditions against the wind, they are rescued by the Surprise, at which point Maturin has already fled, trekking over the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andes.html" title="Andes">Andes</a> mountains, braving avalanches and amputating two of his own frostbitten toes with a chisel - but being the indefatigable naturalist that he is, bringing back with him a huge number of plant and animal specimens.</p>
<p>Dutourd succeeds in denouncing Maturin and Aubrey, but his pseudo-progressive views bring him to the attention of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>, that was still active in Spanish colonies such as Peru, though suppressed by Napoleon during the time France occupied Spain. Dutourd is brought to Inquisition as a heretic.</p>
<p>Aubrey eventually picks Maturin up in Chile and takes the <i>Surprise</i> through a difficult passage around <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Horn_1069.html" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a>, dodging a superior squadron of American ships. The <i>Surprise</i> is dismasted after being struck by lightning, and spotting a ship <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull-down.html" title="Hull-down">hull-down</a>, fears that it is the more powerful American frigate back in pursuit when they are essentially helpless; however, the other ship turns out to be the <i>Berenice</i>, a man of war commanded by Aubrey's old friend Heneage Dundas, which saves the situation by bringing them to safety and providing the pepper that Maturin needs to preserve his specimens from being damaged by pests.</p>

<p>This book sees the return of Aubrey and Maturin to England, where the latter finds that his young daughter Brigid appears to be an "idiot" or "natural" (to use the language of the time) and unable to speak, and that his wife Diana has fled the situation, leaving Brigid in the care of the now-widowed Clarissa Oakes. The title refers to Aubrey's appointment to command a squadron of ships, the second time he has been given such a command.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mauritius_Command_22a9.html" title="The Mauritius Command">The Mauritius Command</a>, Aubrey was a commodore of the second class; this time, he is a commodore of the first class, entitled to the uniform and courtesies due to a Rear Admiral, though still ranking and paid as a post captain. He is also entitled to a captain under him - and so Tom Pullings finally gets made post, and serves as Aubrey's flag captain.</p>
<p>Once the squadron is formed, Aubrey and Maturin are very publicly charged with disrupting the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_slave_trade.html" title="African slave trade">African slave trade</a>, now illegal, but the true mission of the squadron is to intercept a French invasion force which expects a sympathetic welcome in Maturin's native Ireland.</p>
<p>The squadron begins on a disastrous note, with powerful ships being taken away from it and replaced with less powerful ships, one commanded by a homosexual who destroys discipline by taking lovers among his crew, and another by a tyrant who, unlike Aubrey, values spit and polish more than efficiency in battle, and indiscriminately flogs his crewmen. These two captains and their crews soon find themselves at odds, threatening the squadron's efficiency.</p>
<p>Stephen survives a near fatal bout of <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Fever_dbd1.html" title="Yellow Fever">Yellow Fever</a> contracted while traipsing around the swamplands of West Africa in his usual search for rare birds and animals, a quest in which he is ably assisted by the British colonial governor's wife Christine Wood (née Hatherleigh), herself a naturalist and sister of one of Stephen's fellow members of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> - and a future love interest for Stephen.</p>
<p>Maturin's final remaining nemesis, the Duke of Habachtsthal, a vengeful minor royal and the lover of Ledward and Wray, who has been holding up chances of Aubrey's promotion and trying to get Maturin arrested for treason, commits suicide. This is possibly due to the threat of trial for treason after being identified by Clarissa Oakes and following extensive investigation carried out by Parker, a <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_Street_Runner_1b19.html" title="Bow Street Runner">Bow Street Runner</a> employed by Maturin and Sir Joseph Blaine - this would be a traditional courtesy to noblemen, allowing them to commit suicide and save themselves the ignominy of a public trial and even more public execution.</p>
<p>The attempted French invasion is foiled. Stephen reunites - yet again - with Diana, who happens to be living near the Irish coast where Aubrey and his squadron fight off the invasion.</p>

<p>The title concerns Aubrey's fear of being made a "yellow admiral", a rear-admiral who is assigned to no squadron, and who is effectively retired on promotion. But the book ends before Aubrey knows whether he will avoid this fate.</p>
<p>Several minor crises, including a superior officer whose brother loses to Aubrey in an acrimonious dispute - and who detests Aubrey as a result, keep cropping up to ensure that Aubrey's career hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>In the Royal Navy of this period, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">admirals</a> on active duty were assigned either the <i>Blue</i>, <i>Red</i>, or <i>White</i> squadrons (in order of seniority). The <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ensign_5cec.html" title="Blue Ensign">Blue Ensign</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Ensign_fab4.html" title="Red Ensign">Red Ensign</a>, or <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Ensign_c30d.html" title="White Ensign">White Ensign</a> indicated an admiral's rank and squadron assignment, and they were formally referred to as "Rear Admiral of the Red," "Vice Admiral of the White," etc. These three "squadrons" existed for administrative purposes, and should not be confused with physical <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron.html" title="Squadron">squadrons</a>, that is a group of ships commanded as a unit, but smaller than a <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_fleet.html" title="Naval fleet">fleet</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series_16ea.html" title="Edit section: The Hundred Days">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Hundred Days</i></span></h3>
<p>The title refers to the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Days_b2fa.html" title="Hundred Days">Hundred Days</a>, a period when <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Bonaparte_f92d.html" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> escaped from <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elba.html" title="Elba">Elba</a> and temporarily returned to power in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.</p>
<p>Like the title, it is also an interlude in Aubrey's career where O'Brian decides to clean up and consolidate the huge canvas of characters he introduced in his earlier books, and uses <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_ex_machina.html" title="Deus ex machina">deus ex machina</a> to dispose of some characters who he either tired of or found inconvenient to maintain in his storyline.</p>
<p>Aubrey's coxswain, Bonden, dies in the obligatory single ship action of this book, where the Surprise is matched against a galley stuffed with Arab treasure that is meant to fund Napoleon and revive his flagging campaign. All this vast treasure now belongs to Aubrey and his shipmates, deemed as a prize of war.</p>
<p>Stephen's wife Diana dies, as does Aubrey's mother in law Mrs. Williams and her equally unpleasant companion, in a crash when Diana's rash driving overturns their coach. So does Christine Hatherleigh's husband, the colonial governor of <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_8171.html" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>.</p>
<p>Diana's death leaves Stephen completely shattered, unwilling to eat or speak for long periods of time, but he pulls himself together to foil Napoleon's latest plot, an effort to raise gold from a sect of Arabs and finance his campaign, as well as hire the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassin.html" title="Assassin">Assassins</a> to dispose of his enemy's generals.</p>
<p>Going on, we find that the superior officer whose baleful influence threatened to leave Jack Aubrey a mere Yellow Admiral dies too, of heart failure combined with self medication with digitalis - a drug that Stephen prescribed him in minute quantities. Popular rumour at once imputes the man's death to Stephen having poisoned him, but the dead man's unpopularity and unpleasant character combined to produce a general feeling, especially among people who had suffered under his command, that they should buy Stephen a drink for a job well done, instead of reporting him to the authorities.</p>
<p>The end of the book coincides with <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s defeat at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Waterloo</a>, and the effective end of the Napoleonic wars. Aubrey and Maturin set sail for Chile in the Surprise, to try and undermine the Spanish colonial rule there - a continuation of the theme of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wine_Dark_Sea_aed8.html" title="The Wine Dark Sea">The Wine Dark Sea</a>.</p>

<p>This novel was the last completed work in the series.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_ensign.html" title="Blue ensign">blue ensign</a> at the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mast_%28sailing%29.html" title="Mast (sailing)">mizzen-mast</a> was the flag of the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Rear_Admiral_of_the_Blue_de4f.html" title="Rear Admiral of the Blue">Rear Admiral of the Blue</a>, the lowest flag rank in the Royal Navy of the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Aubrey and Maturin are again sent around Cape Horn on a secret mission to help the Chileans gain independence from Spain, an effort loosely based on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cochrane%2C_10th_Earl_of_Dundonald_0d42.html" title="Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald">Lord Cochrane's</a> setting up and commanding the Chilean Navy. Other historical figures from Chile's independence movement, including <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernardo_O%27Higgins_0834.html" title="Bernardo O'Higgins">Don Bernardo O'Higgins</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_de_San_Mart%C3%ADn_096a.html" title="José de San Martín">Gen. José de San Martín</a> figure in the book as well.</p>
<p>Aubrey, initially against his wishes, is forced by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William%2C_Duke_of_Clarence_1e70.html" title="Prince William, Duke of Clarence">The Duke of Clarence</a> to accept his illegitimate son (whom the Duke refers to as a former shipmate's son, for propriety's sake) as a midshipman, and to his surprise and delight, finds the boy to be a competent sailor as well as having the mathematical skills that are essential for a navigator.</p>
<p>At a stop on the way to Chile, Stephen continues his budding romance with Christine Hatherleigh, who shares his tastes in natural philosophy and is altogether more level headed than his late wife Diana, and who attracts him physically as well, so that he has erotic dreams about her. She, on the other hand, has suffered from marriage with her <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impotent.html" title="Impotent">impotent</a> first husband, and is as yet unwilling to marry him, though she consents to visit the Aubreys and see Stephen's daughter Brigid at their home in <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorsetshire.html" title="Dorsetshire">Dorsetshire</a>.</p>
<p>The book is packed with action - single ship actions against much heavier Spanish frigates, the siege of a fortified harbour, the capture of a pirate. Aubrey's efforts however remain under appreciated by the Chilean revolutionaries, who get bogged down in infighting and politics, and are moreover slow and stingy with payment.</p>
<p>At the very end, we get news of Aubrey's promotion to Rear Admiral of the Blue, attached to the South African squadron of the Royal Navy, which serves as an excellent closure for the book and is also a convenient excuse for Aubrey to detach himself from Chilean politics and resume active service with the Royal Navy.</p>

<p><i>The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey</i> is the unfinished twenty-first novel in the series. It was released in the autumn of 2004. It comprises the partially corrected typescript of the approximately three chapters completed by O'Brian before his death in January, 2000, as well as a facsimile of the handwritten manuscript which continues beyond the end of the typescript. It is obvious that there would have to have been a lot more polishing and editing of the text to bring it to O'Brian's usual standards. There is a foreword by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Waldegrave%2C_Baron_Waldegrave_of_North_Hill_6e55.html" title="William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill">William Waldegrave</a> and an afterword by Richard Snow, who had written an influential review of the series in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Book_Review_9cd4.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a> many years before. Snow's review has been credited with helping to popularize the series in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, this book was released under the simpler title of <i>21</i>.</p>
<p>The story begins with the <i>Surprise</i> in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strait_of_Magellan_720c.html" title="Strait of Magellan">Strait of Magellan</a>, heading toward the <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_la_Plata_189d.html" title="Rio de la Plata">River Plate</a> for Aubrey to meet the South African squadron and hoist his flag aboard the <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Suffolk_4c2a.html" title="HMS Suffolk">HMS <i>Suffolk</i></a>. Anti-Protestant sentiment in <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> causes trouble for the <i>Surprise</i>, but the arrival of the <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nuncio.html" title="Nuncio">Papal Nuncio</a>, who is none other than Samuel Mputa, Aubrey's illegitimate son, makes things easier.</p>
<p>Although only three chapters in length, <i>The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey</i> manages to carry Aubrey and Maturin through a few trials, including the difficulties between Aubrey's twin girls and Maturin's daughter Brigid, and a duel between Maturin and a would be suitor of Christine Wood.</p>
