<p>Born at his maternal grandparents' house at Pixton Park, <a href="../../../d/u/l/Dulverton.html" title="Dulverton">Dulverton</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset%2C_England_2e39.html" title="Somerset, England">Somerset</a>, he was known as "Bron" by friends and family. He was the second child and first son of the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelist.html" title="Novelist">novelist</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Waugh_d3c0.html" title="Evelyn Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> and his wife, Laura (née Herbert). Born just as war broke out, he hardly saw his father until he was five. He was educated at the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downside_School_0519.html" title="Downside School">Downside School</a> in Somerset before beginning a <a href="../../../p/p/e/PPE_de2a.html" title="PPE">PPE</a> degree at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Church%2C_Oxford_3eb9.html" title="Christ Church, Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, where he held an <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhibition_%28scholarship%29.html" title="Exhibition (scholarship)">exhibition</a> in English. However, he was <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28academia%29.html" title="Rustication (academia)">rusticated</a> (suspended for unsatisfactory performance) by the academic authorities, and chose not to return to the university, preferring to make an early start in journalism.</p>
<p>During his <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Service_0445.html" title="National Service">National Service</a>, he was commissioned into the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Horse_Guards_9d6c.html" title="Royal Horse Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a> and served in <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where he was almost killed in a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a> accident. Annoyed by a fault in the machine gun on his armoured car, he seized the end of the barrel and shook it, accidentally triggering the mechanism so that the gun fired several bullets through his chest. As a result of his injuries, he lost his <a href="../../../s/p/l/Spleen.html" title="Spleen">spleen</a>, one <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung.html" title="Lung">lung</a>, several ribs, and a finger, and suffered from pain and recurring infections for the rest of his life. While recuperating from the accident in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, he began his first novel, <i>The Foxglove Saga</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Waugh_5fa0.html" title="Edit section: Journalistic career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Journalistic career</span></h2>
<p>Waugh began his journalistic career in 1960 as a cub reporter on Peterborough, the social/gossip column of the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a></i>. In the long and prolific career that followed he wrote for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectator_0701.html" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Statesman_f7c0.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a></i>, <i>British Medicine</i> and various newspapers (including the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mirror_c617.html" title="Daily Mirror">Daily Mirror</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Evening_Standard_7d40.html" title="Evening Standard">Evening Standard</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>). From 1981 to 1990 he wrote a leader-page column for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Telegraph_f096.html" title="The Sunday Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a></i>.</p>
<p>His work as political <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columnist.html" title="Columnist">columnist</a> on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectator_0701.html" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a></i> coincided with the war in <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biafra.html" title="Biafra">Biafra</a>, a mainly <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> province that had tried to secede from <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. Waugh strongly criticized <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s government, especially the foreign secretary <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Stewart_%28politician%29_ed72.html" title="Michael Stewart (politician)">Michael Stewart</a>, for colluding in the use of mass starvation as a political weapon. He was sacked from <i>The Spectator</i> in 1970, but with the support of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Levin_ee31.html" title="Bernard Levin">Bernard Levin</a> and others, he won damages for unfair dismissal in a subsequent action.</p>
<p>He was opposed to the reforms of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Vatican_Council_623f.html" title="Second Vatican Council">Second Vatican Council</a> and criticized the Church that emerged from it. He was often critical of Archbishops <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Cardinal_Hume_b24a.html" title="Basil Cardinal Hume">Basil Cardinal Hume</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Worlock_59ff.html" title="Derek Worlock">Derek Worlock</a>.</p>
<p>In 1990 he returned to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> as the successor of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Wharton_e983.html" title="Michael Wharton">Michael Wharton</a> (better known as "Peter Simple"), writing the paper's long-running <i>Way of the World</i> column three times a week until December 2000. In 1995 he finally ended his long association with <i>The Spectator</i>, but in 1996 he rejoined <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>, where he remained a weekly columnist until shortly before his death.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Waugh_5fa0.html" title="Edit section: Private Eye">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Private Eye</i></span></h2>
<p>Waugh became most famous for his <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Eye_4f62.html" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i> Diary, which ran from the early 1970s until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, and which he described as "specifically dedicated to telling lies". He fitted in well with the <i>Eye</i>, which had the political ethos of "balls to the lot of them", although he made clear his particular dislike of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> government of the 1970s. The education secretary <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_Williams_e949.html" title="Shirley Williams">Shirley Williams</a> became an especial hate figure because of her support for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comprehensive_school.html" title="Comprehensive school">comprehensive education</a>. In his autobiography <i>Will This Do?</i>, Waugh claimed that he had broken two bottles of wine by banging them together too hard to celebrate when she lost her seat in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>.</p>
<p>Waugh was a candidate at the 1979 election, indulging another of his pet hates, former <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> Leader <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Thorpe_1eb1.html" title="Jeremy Thorpe">Jeremy Thorpe</a>, who was about to stand trial for conspiracy to murder in a <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandal.html" title="Scandal">scandal</a> that Waugh had helped expose. It was alleged that Thorpe had links to an incident in which a man called Norman Scott, who claimed to have had an affair with Thorpe, had seen his dog shot dead. Waugh stood against Thorpe for the Dog Lovers' Party and Thorpe obtained an injunction against Waugh's election literature. Waugh polled only 79 votes, but Thorpe lost his seat.</p>
<p>Waugh left <i>Private Eye</i> in 1986 when <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hislop_1212.html" title="Ian Hislop">Ian Hislop</a> succeeded <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Ingrams_6204.html" title="Richard Ingrams">Richard Ingrams</a> as editor.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Waugh_5fa0.html" title="Edit section: Waugh's views">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Waugh's views</span></h2>
<p>Waugh broadly supported <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in her first years as prime minister, but by 1983 he became disillusioned by the Government's economic policy, which he felt used the destructive economics and cultural ideas of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Right_36d7.html" title="New Right">New Right</a>. When Thatcher became a strong public opponent of his friend and <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> editor <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_Worsthorne_a8d6.html" title="Peregrine Worsthorne">Peregrine Worsthorne</a>, Waugh became a staunch opponent of her. Her closeness to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Neil_eb23.html" title="Andrew Neil">Andrew Neil</a>, editor of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">The Sunday Times</a></i>, whom Waugh despised, further confirmed his view.</p>
<p>Waugh tended to be identified with a defiantly anti-progressive, small-c conservatism, opposed to "do-gooders" and social progressives. Three days after his death at age 61 from heart disease, journalist <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Toynbee_474b.html" title="Polly Toynbee">Polly Toynbee</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> (see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,424542,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,424542,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) vituperatively attacked him for these views.</p>
<p>The Tobacco Advisory Council of the UK organised for a pro-smoking book to be ghosted for either Bernard Levin or Auberon Waugh. <a href="http://bat.library.ucsf.edu/tid/clh10a99" class="external autonumber" title="http://bat.library.ucsf.edu/tid/clh10a99" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Neither columnist agreed to put their name to it, but Waugh wrote a foreword endorsing the book and hitting out at the anti-smoking lobby: "Let us hope this book strikes a blow against the new control terrorists," he said. He also posed for photos, with a cigarette prominently in his hand.<a href="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/qeo47d00" class="external autonumber" title="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/qeo47d00" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Waugh's public persona encompassed the complex role of snobbish sophisicate and critic of the British middle class's cultural <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletarianisation.html" title="Proletarianisation">proletarianisation</a>; and opponent of the general <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americanisation.html" title="Americanisation">Americanisation</a> of Britain, exemplifed by the sale of the land and property in the English shires to American businessmen.</p>
<p>To a traditional <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory.html" title="Tory">Tory</a>, these were some of the most deplorable aspects of the Thatcher years. However there was a certain amount of public posturing in his popular anti-Americanism; he visited the USA whenever he could, and spent a lot of time holidaying in New England and on US speaking tours.<a href="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/apr86d00" class="external autonumber" title="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/apr86d00" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/cpr86d00" class="external autonumber" title="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/cpr86d00" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Waugh had a house in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and, despite his conservatism, was a fervent supporter of European integration and the single currency, which he saw as a means of de-Americanising the UK. He said that his ideal government would be a "<a href="../../../j/u/n/Junta.html" title="Junta">junta</a> of Belgian ticket inspectors".<a href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-3295940_ITM" class="external autonumber" title="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-3295940_ITM" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Other ways in which he did not conform to reactionary stereotypes was in his strong opposition to the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>, and in his antipathy towards the police force in general (especially when they sought to prevent <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drink-driving.html" title="Drink-driving">drink-driving</a>; Waugh believed strongly that this was not as serious a problem as it is widely believed to be, and referred to the anti-drink-driving campaign as the "police terror"). He opposed anti-<a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_smoking.html" title="Tobacco smoking">smoking</a> legislation (despite a delicate heart condition that killed him prematurely) and in his later years he was highly critical of Labour attempts to ban <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_hunting.html" title="Fox hunting">fox hunting</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> he fervently opposed attempts by the then <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Howard_90a3.html" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a> to introduce a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_national_identity_card.html" title="British national identity card">national identity card</a>, a policy which at the time was (ironically, considering later developments) opposed by the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> opposition.</p>
<p>Waugh held, or affected to hold, the eccentric view that, while the dangers of smoking (especially <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_smoking.html" title="Passive smoking">passive smoking</a>) and drinking were exaggerated, the dangers of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger.html" title="Hamburger">hamburger</a> eating were seriously under-reported; he frequently referred to "hamburger gases" as a serious form of atmospheric pollution and even made references to the dangers of "passive hamburger eating". He even said that <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_game.html" title="Computer game">computer games</a> "produce all the symptoms and most known causes of cancer", though his tongue was probably in his cheek when he made those comments.</p>
<p>Waugh has been called a nostalgist and a romantic, with a strong tendency towards <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snobbery.html" title="Snobbery">snobbery</a>, although his anarchistic streak ensured that he retained the admiration of a surprising number of people whom he would have considered horribly "progressive" or "leftish", including <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Wheen_6069.html" title="Francis Wheen">Francis Wheen</a> who vociferously disagreed with the comments made by Guardian columnist <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Toynbee_474b.html" title="Polly Toynbee">Polly Toynbee</a> following his death.<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,427153,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,427153,00.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Auberon Waugh married, in 1961, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Teresa_Waugh_c3b7.html" title="Lady Teresa Waugh">Lady Teresa Onslow</a>, daughter of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Onslow%2C_6th_Earl_of_Onslow_148f.html" title="William Onslow, 6th Earl of Onslow">6th Earl of Onslow</a>. The couple — with their two sons and two daughters — eventually moved to his father's old house, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combe_Florey_45ea.html" title="Combe Florey">Combe Florey</a>, Somerset.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Waugh_5fa0.html" title="Edit section: Literary career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literary career</span></h2>
<p>Waugh wrote five novels before giving up writing <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a>, partly in protest at the inadequate money authors received from <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_lending_right.html" title="Public lending right">public lending rights</a> at <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">libraries</a> and partly because he knew he would always be compared unfavourably to his father. The five novels are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Foxglove Saga</i> (1960)</li>
<li><i>Path of Dalliance</i> (1963)</li>
<li><i>Who Are The Violets Now?</i> (1965)</li>
<li><i>Consider the Lilies</i> (1968)</li>
<li><i>A Bed of Flowers</i> (1972).</li>
</ul>
<p>He also wrote a book about the Thorpe case, <i>The Last Word</i>. He made several programmes for <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_TeleVision_4ff6.html" title="Associated TeleVision">ATV</a> in the 1970s, and was interviewed by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Howard_%28journalist%29_c2e0.html" title="Anthony Howard (journalist)">Anthony Howard</a> in 1991 for the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Television_9dfa.html" title="Thames Television">Thames TV</a> documentary <i>Waugh Memorial</i>.</p>
<p>From 1986 until his death he also edited the <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_Review_818b.html" title="Literary Review">Literary Review</a></i> magazine, where he organised awards for what he called "real" (i.e. rhyming and scanning) poetry, and also a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Sex_in_Fiction_Award_2e9e.html" title="Bad Sex in Fiction Award">Bad Sex Award</a> for the worst description of sex in a novel. He also opined on many and various topics. For example, in a leader piece for the Review in 1991 he commented upon <a href="../../../s/c/e/Sceptic.html" title="Sceptic">sceptic</a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Randi_0c19.html" title="James Randi">James Randi</a>´s rubbishing on British television of the supposed art of <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowsing.html" title="Dowsing">dowsing</a> for water. Waugh noted that, although he had no great interest in the subject, as a matter of fact he lived in a house which had a well sunk through seventy feet of rock on nothing more than the advice of a dowser.</p>

<p>Like his parents, Laura who died at 57 and Evelyn who died at 62, Auberon Waugh died relatively young: he died of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_disease.html" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a> at the age of 61. He is buried in Combe Florey, Somerset.</p>
