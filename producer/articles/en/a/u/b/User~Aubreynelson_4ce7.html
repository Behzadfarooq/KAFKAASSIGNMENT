	    <p>Brian Patrick Cork's experience spans that of a proud and deeply involved father; successful businessman; defender of his countries policies; professional athlete; volunteer firefighter; and, public speaker.</p>
<p>Brian has been a highly successful executive and entrepreneur; is a seasoned public speaker; and, an accomplished Executive Coach. In 2003, Brian was named to London's prestigious "Ol Man Society" for his contributions as a businessman and philanthropist, and his well-balanced approach to life. Brian is a Co-Founder of the "Prudent Society of Optimistic Gentlemen", a group of investors involved in the acquisition, development and growth of various small businesses. In addition, Brian is the Co-Founder and Resident Entrepreneur of Ministry Accelerator, an incubator focused on developing Ministries that can be self-sufficient and self-sustaining within eighteen months. Brian is also a Member of Deo Gratias, MENSA and intelligencia. He is currently writing his first books entitled "Dear God: I am Dancing In My Head", and "The CEO Handbook".</p>
<p>From 1993 to 1998 Brian proudly served on the Louisville, Colorado Volunteer Fire Department. Call-sign "Boomer". This is where Brian learned to be "Part of the Solution, and not the Problem", under the guidance of Battalion Chief, Chuck Schmidt.</p>
<p>Brian is an accomplished Triathlete and has run a 2:47 Marathon.</p>
<p>Brian was raised in a military family. He was trained as an Army Ranger and served in Africa with the Royal Scotts in the 1980's.</p>
<p>Brian graduated from Radford University in 1984 with BS degrees in Political Science and Social History. He earned his MBA in 1989 from Northrop University while working full time and competing as a professional triathlete in Southern California.</p>
<p>A notorious Base Jumper, Cork was arrested over 21 times for jumping from towers, bridges and buildings. His adventures have been chronicled in numerous media sources and will be featured in the forthcoming Heroes of No Reputation by Aubrey Nelson.</p>
<p>"Brian Patrick Cork is a beautiful man BECAUSE of his many imperfections. They fuel his boundless optimism because he is convinced that he and every thing around him can, and will, always improve.</p>
<p>I have known Brian for over 20 years. A gifted athlete, I first saw him emerging from the mist charging up a duanting hill during a Cross Country race in Virginia, and stood amazed as he ran down the Kenyans for victory. He is all heart, this one.</p>
<p>Brian has made and lost fortunes. He has never had to think twice about giving away the very shirt from his back. He has lost businesses to predators and buried children. He has served his country with distinction (I was there). He has been lauded as a hero for being a volunteer firefighter; and wrongfully villified as a stock swindler (I was one of his many investors, and he did brilliant work). Men of great stature and influence seek his counsel. Most simply enjoy being around him. Brian will say "we are all tied together by threads of continuity. So, we can and must make a difference in one anothers lives. It's not only an obligation... the connection makes our lives richer and meaningful". Every day he strengthens the very fabric of the business community - one thread at a time.</p>
<p>What I marvel at, what gives me such hope for generation led by Brian and his people, is that this man could overcome depression, self-doubt and other constraints of biology and not only act decisively, but retain his humanity. Like a figure from the Old Testament, Brian has wandered the earth, making mistakes, loving his family but causing them pain, despairing over the course of events, trying to divine God's will. He could not know how things would turn out, but he has always done his best and maintained an unwavering faith in GOD, himself and people. He has always kept his moral compass pointed firm and true. And, now he helps other men find balance and success in their own lives."</p>
<p>Aubrey Nelson, Biographer</p>
