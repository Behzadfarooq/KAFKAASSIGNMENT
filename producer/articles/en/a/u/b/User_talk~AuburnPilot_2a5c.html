<p>Clearly I have upset you. That was not my intent. I would not be involved but I was invited to help mediate the situation. I am not arguing against your position, but I will argue that a consensus was met. And so what if it was. Notice that I didn't change the article, and I also thought some of the recent changes were not helpful. I was pointed to an archive where consensus was met, but I saw a lot of bickering, and several of the latter points of the thread were about how the article was wrong, so I just don't get it. Then you accuse me of strong arming the discussion. Consensus isn't met because people give up on the fight. If you have a point to make, go ahead and make it. I am willing to listen, but the only argument for keeping the controversay in the intro was "we all agreed", but that isn't a reason at all. And frankly, it's disappointing that so many of us would rather get their way or quit rather than discuss the issue at hand. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 19:29, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Honestly, this was a long time coming, and your comment was merely <i>the last straw</i>. I enjoy editing Wikipedia, but I no longer enjoy editing <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_News_Channel_923a.html" title="Fox News Channel">Fox News Channel</a>. Rather than a group of people working together to improve an article, it has become a two sided fight where each side refuses to see the middle ground. Too much work was put into the current version to have it gutted by a sockpuppet and its sidekick (No, not referring to you). I appreciate your help, and seeing how you've danced with the devil himself (Duke53) and lived to tell the tale, I know you mean well. I simply cannot continue to edit that article if I want to be a part of this project. It's too much of an annoyance. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><strong class="selflink"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></strong> 19:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know your comments are not directed to me, and I willingly jumped into the snake pit. It's fairly easy to see which editors are looking to make an article better, and not just making it fit their personal POV. Don't give up. Just take a break. Even good ol' Duke will slink away after a while. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 19:44, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The (fatal) flaw of Wikipedia is that the <i>instant</i> you "give up" then you've invalidated the entire validity of the project. Of course, that only occurs <i>writ large</i> when the number of editors married to stubbornness/ignorance/bad faith outnumbers the righteous who "fight the good fight." Keep in mind, this is not a "<i>two sided fight where each side refuses to see the middle ground</i>" -- this is the defense of a <i>valid good faith effort sucessfully concluded by eighteen editors</i> against a few who refuse to read the history involved and who sling the same invalid arguments. I completely understand the level of frustration, but if you give up, and I give up, then what happens to Wikipedia? Come back. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 20:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe some time away from that article will be enough. Writing articles and editing pre-existing articles where every change isn't met with hostility will be nice for a while (I've already started a new article and uploaded a couple pics). I'll give it a week and reconsider, but as of now, I can't possibly continue that argument. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><strong class="selflink"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></strong> 20:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will carry on with task-force duty, however I strongly welcome your return should you decide to come back. I find myself unwilling to give up on something we've all worked so hard to accomplish. Wikipedia relies on the conflict model to operate -- the tug of war is what keeps all sides in check, so to speak, however the system breaks down when good men become tired of drawing lines in the sand. Hope we can stay in touch; though our political philosophies probably differ, I can honestly say I was always glad to know you were keeping and eye out and also trying to keep things right. <i>War Eagle!</i> /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 22:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We'll see how things are after a good break from that article, but every time I saw <a href="../../../f/o/x/Talk%7EFox_News_Channel_b091.html" title="Talk:Fox News Channel">Talk:Fox News Channel</a> on my watchlist, I just wanted to close my laptop and walk away. Even if I don't return to that article, I'll still be around. I've appreciated your opinion on everything wiki, and I'm sure I will still pop over to your talk page when I need a second opinion. Funny enough, looking at our contributions, I'd bet our political philosophies are completely opposite, but as we both try to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, it hasn't been an issue.

<dd>Well, I re-added it to my watchlist at the beginning of last week (or so) just to see if things had died down. Amazing how nearly every "user" who comes by to say consensus has changed has been a sockpuppet.

<dd>Looking at the comments about being a "different character" and how we killed off "the other character", nutjob might be the right word. This guy's talk page is even stranger....has an OCD feel to it. The sockpuppet case is open, and he knowingly used a separate account to avoid a block; another block isn't far away. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 02:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd certainly second the nomination. I notice you changed your adminship interest status recently. I've been pondering it a bit myself.

<p><small>(cross posted to <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a>'s talk page)</small> Thanks very much for the offer. I was actually contacted by another use via email a few days ago asking if I would accept a nomination. My concern is that my participation in deletion discussions is quite limited. It is an area of Wikipedia that is of no interest to me, and I only participate when I stumble across a nominated article/category/misc. I've seen too many good users massacred at RfA for this reason, and must decline a nomination at this time. I will most likely submit to an editor review in the coming weeks, and would appreciate any feedback you can provide. Again, thanks very much for the offer. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 16:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad to help. If you're willing to put in the effort, it could be a great service and I definitely like the idea. I'm just not sure how to <i>get the word out</i>. Is it something you're wanting to keep in your userspace or eventually move into a full WikiProject? Obviously in your own space, you have a bit more control. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 20:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not interested in getting the word out <i>too</i> much -- I am not going to have a lot of time to answer requests, and I definitely don't want to get ahead of myself and the disappoint a bunch of people. It's definitely a userspace project, and although I think it would make a good WikiResource, I don't think it would be wise to do so without a good support team of researchers. Also, maybe one with the same mission already exists (reference desk or something?)... I haven't looked. Just an idea I've been kicking around.

<dd>I'll take a look around, but I haven't come across such as service on-Wiki. I think (though I've never used it) the RefDesk works more like a Google Answers type service, backed up by searching Wikipedia. You're right about keeping it in userspace; elsewhere would require much more users with similar access. Maybe put up a notice on your userpage and see if anybody bites. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 21:55, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section you added "Speach mishaps" adds nothing to the article in terms of valuable content and your long history of vandalizing this article makes it quite clear your intentions are not to better the article. Just like a quote and trivia sections, this content is unmanageable and inappropriate. Regardless of WP:NOT, I believe you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody to support the inclusion of a speech mishap section. I noted my removal of the section on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W.

<dd>You received a warning because you have reverted the page 3 times in the previous 24 hours. A content dispute does not qualify as vandalism and as such your reversions are not covered within the exceptions to the 3RR. You have not been blocked, and my warning was just that: a warning. The next reversion could lead to a block. How about contacting the other user via his talk page rather than discussing in edit summaries? <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 06:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. The best thing to do in a situation like this is just wait for another user to revert. If it is truly unacceptable, it will be removed quickly and no damage is done (especially over a tag line). If any user continuously subverts consensus, find an admin to provide an outside look (and a possible block).

<p>Thanks for the reassurance about the 3RR, i did notice that, but it said that only obvious cases would be called exceptions.

<p>Hi AuburnPilot, I noticed your comment on this SSP case (congrats on your successful RfA, BTW). Personally, I doubt that anyone would fault you for handing out blocks in this case, although some judicious page protection might be enough here. However, maybe another way of dealing with the problem is a post to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>? I would do it myself, but I'm not an admin, and about half the time when I post to ANI about sock-related matters the post gets no response.</p>
<p>By the way, is there any chance that you could review some of the other SSP cases? There are some fairly old ones where I think there's definite sockpuppetry (e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Terryfilene22_51c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Terryfilene22">WP:SSP page on "Terryfilene22"</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Rsbj66_0465.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Rsbj66">WP:SSP page on "Rsbj66"</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Adversegecko_0f23.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Adversegecko">WP:SSP page on "Adversegecko"</a>), and some where sockpuppetry seems possible (<a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Opp2_b5d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Opp2">WP:SSP page on "Opp2"</a>). <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 02:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I haven't. There's no doubt it's him, so I don't believe that is necessary. The reason I haven't acted on the SSP report is a) possible conflict of interest, and b) I'm not clear on the damage of such a range block. Quite a large number of people would be blocked because of this, so I'm hesitant to impose such a block. I've contacted another admin and will await a response since there would be major collateral damage. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> 07:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey man, some more activity by our boy Benji, including confirmed puppetry with new accounts -- check the checkuser request under the second account. I tossed up a few ssp/confirmed templates but removed the indef block language due to a lack of block. The puppetmaster got a 2 week block a few weeks ago, nothing so far against the puppet account.

On an unrelated note, I wanted to query your thoughts on my qualifications and disposition towards an adminship. Historically, we've had a good relationship and I respect your opinions (as does much of the community here); I've had a fair amount of participation in deletion discussions (articles mostly), but I have never dived into the RfA process much and would prefer the outside counsel of one both familiar with the process and who is familiar with my style and past actions.

I have witnessed several Hindenburgs -- the process seems very prone to a <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snowball effect</a> and I would obviously want to minimize my potential for such, should I receive a nomination.

<dd>Listen, kid. In The "History" of the RoR articles, there were at least 2 people who were constantly telling you that the links should not be there. Also in the "Discussion" of the same article, the thing is discussed. If you didn't see it, that's your problem. Just read 3 talk pages you wrote, and in all of them you think they were unfair with you. Please, realize YOU are the problem. You've already had around 300 warnings and only one (extremely short) ban, and you say they're unfair with you. Please. I have to go now, I'm going to rob a bank, in any case, if they want to take me to prison, I'll simply say "I did not even know this was against the rules".</dd>

<p>Listen, creep-STOP STALKING ME AND STOP LEAVING INSULTING MESSAGES ON MY TALK PAGE. For your information, we are not even talking about the Rule of Rose links here. We are talking about something completely different-something that you obviously know nothing about. I don't care if you believe me or not, but I did not know forums were against the rules, since the links had been up for over a year. And I only got two warnings, both of which only arrived AFTER I got banned. As for the Rule of Rose area, again, unrelated. I do not read discussion pages, and not even sure what they are. The link there was perfectly legit, but some trolls who kept attacking my site and forum did not like it, so they kept deleting and editting it so it would not work.67.163.193.239 17:13, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't be stupid, I know you were putting links of many of your empty websites here. About the Clock Tower edits, you claim you were just wanting to put links to your FANSITE, yet not only the fansite obviously adds links to the forum, but in the forum, you asked for people to put the link to your FANSITE, in a thread titled "Help our FORUM". Dipshit. You did not only get banned because of the clock tower page, but also because of the rule of rose one. And in BOTH you were warned. Not only this, but BEFORE being banned they left you a LAST WARNING in your talk page.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 190.64.71.250 (<a href="../../../1/9/0/User_talk%7E190.64.71.250.html" title="User talk:190.64.71.250">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_190.64.71.250_3232.html" title="Special:Contributions/190.64.71.250">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>you have email as well. &#160;:-) Thanks for the effort, and thanks especially for the note on my talkpage. Generally speaking, my mailboxen receive so much spam that I usually overlook legit emails unless i'm specifically waiting for them. I have your emails to come up orange on blue in my index list (war eagle!) but it's always best practice to drop me a note on the talk page telling me to look out.

<p>I noticed you have your talk page linked in your sig: <strong class="selflink"><small>talk</small></strong> but when I try to copy that and change it to my name <a href="../../../c/o/g/User_talk%7ECogswobble_f63f.html" title="User talk:Cogswobble"><small>talk</small></a> it doesn't work...do you know why? <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECogswobble_161f.html" title="User:Cogswobble">Cogswobble</a> <a href="../../../c/o/g/User_talk%7ECogswobble_f63f.html" title="User talk:Cogswobble">talk</a> 19:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sonofa...call me a liar. lol, I just realized that it must not link when you're on your own talk page...and I was testing this on my own talk page. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECogswobble_161f.html" title="User:Cogswobble">Cogswobble</a> <a href="../../../c/o/g/User_talk%7ECogswobble_f63f.html" title="User talk:Cogswobble">talk</a> 19:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
