<p>Auburn University was chartered by the Alabama Legislature as the East Alabama Male College on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_6.html" title="May 6">May 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>, coming under the guidance of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_51da.html" title="Methodist Church">Methodist Church</a> in 1859.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The first president of the institution was Reverend William J. Sasnett, and the school opened its doors in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a> to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten. The early history of Auburn is inextricably linked with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> era South. Classes were held in "Old Main" until the college was closed due to the Civil War, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was used as a training ground for the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> Army, and "Old Main" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_University_7d24.html" title="Edit section: Post-Civil War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Civil War</span></h3>
<p>The school was reopened in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a> following the end of the Civil War and has been open ever since. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrill_Act_2c8e.html" title="Morrill Act">Morrill Act</a> as a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land-grant_colleges.html" title="Land-grant colleges">land-grant institution</a>, the first in the South to be established separate from the state university. This act provided for 240,000 acres (971 kmÂ²) of Federal land to be sold in order to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of this act, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 1800s, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become future officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>, two historic events occurred: women were first admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was first played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>, the school name was again changed, this time to Alabama Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API President Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. API struggled through the great depression, having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Knapp_069f.html" title="Bradford Knapp">Bradford Knapp</a>. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, API again found its place training officers for the U.S. Military on campus; Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning soldiers taking advantage of their <a href="../../../g/i/_/GI_Bill_3d1a.html" title="GI Bill">GI Bill</a> offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.</p>

<p>Recognizing that the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> and officially renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. Like most universities in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Southern_States_599f.html" title="U.S. Southern States">American South</a>, Auburn was <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racially segregated</a> prior to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, with only white students being admitted.

<p>Auburn has traditionally been rated highly by academic ranking services. According to the most recent rankings from <i><a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._News_%26_World_Report_09ad.html" title="U.S. News &amp; World Report">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>,</i> Auburn is ranked 38th among the nation's top 50 public universities and is tied for 3rd among public universities in the SEC (sharing this spot with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a>). Auburn University is typically the highest-ranked university in the state of Alabama in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._News_%26_World_Report_09ad.html" title="U.S. News &amp; World Report">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> rankings, having held the number one ranking in the state for 12 of the past 14 years, and was ranked below another university only on one occasion (and tied this year). Auburn was the only college or university in Alabama included in the inaugural edition (1981) of the widely respected <i>Peterson's Guides to America's 296 Most Competitive Colleges</i>, .</p>
<p>Auburn is a charter member of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC), which is comprised of 11 of the largest Southern public universities in the US and one private university, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_University_3e3f.html" title="Vanderbilt University">Vanderbilt</a>. Among the other 10 peer public universities, 2 are ranked ahead of Auburn by <i><a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._News_%26_World_Report_09ad.html" title="U.S. News &amp; World Report">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></i>, and 2 others tie Auburn. This high ranking and reputation for academic quality is in spite of the fact that Auburn's $316 million endowment<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> is currently the second smallest of the 12 SEC universities. An attempt to increase the endowment by $500 million began in 2005 with the "It Begins at Auburn" campaign. As of August 2006, the campaign had raised $390 million dollars, making it the largest campaign in university history.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The university currently consists of thirteen schools and colleges. Programs in engineering, architecture and business have been ranked among the best in the country and Auburn also boasts strong programs in veterinary medicine, mathematics, science, agriculture, and journalism. The university's <a href="../../../c/o/r/Core_curriculum.html" title="Core curriculum">core curriculum</a> has likewise been recognized as one of the best in the nation.</p>
<p>The Ginn College of Engineering has a 134-year tradition of engineering education, consistently ranking in the nation's top 20 engineering programs in terms of numbers of engineers graduating annually. The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial, textile, aerospace, agricultural, and chemical engineering, and--more recently--began a program in wireless engineering after receiving a donation from alumnus Samuel L. Ginn. In 2001, Ginn, a noted US pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.</p>
<p>Auburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the US in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on growing the graduate programs, and recent rankings demonstrate the increasing profile of graduate engineering education at Auburn. The Ginn College of Engineering was recently ranked 60th nationally overall and 35th among public universities that offer doctoral programs in engineering by <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>. Last year, the College ranked 67th among all engineering programs and 40th among such programs at public universities. "America's Best Graduate Schools 2006" ranks the Ginn College of Engineering's graduate program in the Top 100 graduate engineering programs in the US. Auburn's Industrial and Systems Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering were all ranked in the top 100.</p>
<p>The architecture professionâs publication <i>Design-Intelligence</i> recently ranked Auburn's School of Architecture as the No. 1 school in the South for preparing its graduates for the professional field. In addition, the school was ranked No. 10 in value nationally, with a 9th place national ranking for the Interior Architecture program. Of critical mention here is the School's <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural_Studio_734e.html" title="Rural Studio">Rural Studio</a> programme, founded by the late <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Mockbee_6e4e.html" title="Samuel Mockbee">Samuel Mockbee</a>.</p>
<p>Auburn's Economics Department, in the College of Business, was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the <i>Journal of Applied Econometrics</i>. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by <i>U.S. News and World Report magazine</i> in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs.</p>
<p>Nationally recognized ROTC programs are available in three branches of service: Air Force, Army, and Navy/Marine Corps, the latter being the only one of its kind in Alabama. Each of these three ROTC units is ranked among the top ten in the nation. Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Epting_Mundy_Jr._552f.html" title="Carl Epting Mundy Jr.">Carl Epting Mundy Jr.</a>, who served as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps_3300.html" title="Commandant of the Marine Corps">Commandant of the US Marine Corps</a>. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.</p>
<p>In addition to the many outstanding ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two masters degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Shelton_a4ad.html" title="Hugh Shelton">Hugh Shelton</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Myers_b5d4.html" title="Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a>, served as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_27d7.html" title="Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).</p>
<p>Auburn has graduated six astronauts (including <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Mattingly_9edf.html" title="Ken Mattingly">T.K. Mattingly</a> of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_13.html" title="Apollo 13">Apollo 13</a> fame) and one current and one former director of the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Space_Center_a38f.html" title="Kennedy Space Center">Kennedy Space Center</a>. 1972 Auburn Aerospace Engineering graduate Jim Kennedy, currently director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, was previously deputy director of <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Space_Flight_Center_98bf.html" title="Marshall Space Flight Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (MSFC). Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the "space race" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.</p>

<p>For most of the early history of Auburn, boarding houses and barracks made up most of the student housing. Even into the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_depression.html" title="Great depression">great depression</a> that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were "dorms" in the modern sense of the word. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.</p>
<p>Auburn's first dorms were hardly luxurious. Magnolia Dormitory, built in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and demolished in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, was once used by the state of Alabama in its defense against a lawsuit brought by state prison inmates. The inmates claimed that housing two men in a cell of particularly small dimensions constituted 'cruel and unusual punishment.' The state argued in court that students at Auburn actually paid to live in even smaller living spacesâat Magnolia Dorm. The inmates lost the case. Its "twin", Noble Hall, used as a women's residence, was demolished only in 2005 and was condemned during at least the final year in which it was inhabited.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years, the city of Auburn has experienced a rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Less than 25 percent of Auburn students live on campus.</p>
<p>Auburn's on-campus student housing consists of three complexes located at various locations over campus. "The Quad" is the oldest of the four, dating to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_depression.html" title="Great depression">great depression</a> projects begun by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Works_Progress_Administration_1bf2.html" title="Works Progress Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> and located in Central Campus. Made up of 11 buildings, the Quad houses mostly undergraduates in coed, alternating-floor buildings. "The Hill" is made up of 14 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduate women with the exception of the two high-rise dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), which are coed on alternating floors.</p>
<p>"The Extension" is a block of six buildings (labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F), each comprised of two-bedroom apartments, housing undergraduates.</p>
<p>"The Village," formerly known as married student housing, recently housed a variety of students, to include undergraduates, graduates, and married students. In May 2006, this housing complex was closed to students and was demolished during the summer and early fall of 2006.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_University_7d24.html" title="Edit section: Greek life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Greek life</span></h3>
<p>Male Greeks in Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: Old Row and New Row. "Old Row" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. "New Row" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an "Old Row" or "New Row" fraternity doesn't really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Ergo, there are some "Old Row" fraternities with houses on "New Row" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's "Old Row" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the "New Row," as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only two fraternity houses remain on College today.</p>
<p>Sororities are located not in individual houses like Auburn fraternities, but in the dorms located on the Hill. This has had the unintended side effect of keeping dues for these sororities among the lowest in the nation. Each dorm has a sorority "chapter" room within it for the sorority designated to that dorm.</p>
<p>Greek Life is important at Auburn, but not a requirement for experiencing Auburn life. Roughly 18 percent of men and 34 percent of women are in Greek organizations at Auburn. Some say that because of the low percentages there is a marked lack of animosity between Greeks and independents. In fact, 5 out of the last 10 Student Government Association Presidents have been independents.</p>

The tradition began in the 1960s when groups of kids would walk up the street to greet the team and get autographs. During the tenure of coach <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Barfield_076d.html" title="Doug Barfield">Doug Barfield</a>, the coach urged fans to come out and support the team, and thousands did. Today the team, led by the coaches, walks down the hill and into the stadium surrounded by fans who pat them on the back and shake their hands as they walk.

<p>The intersection of Magnolia and College streets in Auburn, which marks the transition from downtown Auburn to the university campus, is known as Toomer's Corner. It is named after Toomer's Drugs, a small store on the corner that has been an Auburn landmark for over 100 years. Hanging over the corner are two massive old-growth oak trees, and whenever there is cause for celebration in the Auburn community, the trees are festooned with <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_paper.html" title="Toilet paper">toilet paper</a>. Also known as "rolling the corner" or "rolling Toomer's," this tradition is said to have begun when Toomer's Drugs had the only telegraph in the city. During away football games, when employees of the local drug store received news of a win, they would roll the oak trees to signal a win to the public. Traditionally only used as a way to celebrate football victories, in recent years it has become a way to celebrate anything good that happens concerning Auburn.</p>

It originated as an expression of support of Auburn's athletic teams, but today is also commonly used as a greeting between members of the Auburn community. The cry is yelled in unison by spectators for kickoffs of football games and tipoffs of basketball games. In 1930, Auburn gained a live <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_eagle.html" title="Golden eagle">golden eagle</a> as a mascot who was nicknamed "Nova". War Eagle VI, also known as "Tiger," recently had her last flight at the 2006 Auburn vs. Georgia game. Today, the seventh War Eagle, nicknamed "Nova", lives at a raptor center on the Auburn campus, and is featured before football games by a flight in which the eagle circles the stadium before landing at mid-field. The Auburn fight song is also titled "War Eagle".</p>

<p>The Wreck Tech Pajama Parade originated in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, when a group of mischievous Auburn cadets, determined to show up the more well-known engineers from <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Tech_b422.html" title="Georgia Tech">Georgia Tech</a>, sneaked out of their dorms the night before the football game between Auburn and Tech and greased the railroad tracks.

While the railroad long ago ceased to be the way teams traveled to Auburn and students never greased the tracks again, the tradition continues in the form of a parade through downtown Auburn. Students parade through the streets in their pajamas and organizations build floats.

<p>The <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/auband/" class="external text" title="http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/auband/" rel="nofollow">Auburn University Marching Band</a> has been cited as one of the nation's finest university marching bands. The band has long performed at school football games and pep rallies. The band was awarded the 2004 <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Philip_Sousa_Foundation_2c33.html#The_Sudler_Trophy" title="John Philip Sousa Foundation">Sudler Intercollegiate Marching Band Trophy</a>, one of the nation's highest awards for college and university marching bands. The Auburn University Marching Band marched in the United States Presidential Inaugural Parade (for President George W. Bush) in 2005. In 2006, the Auburn University Marching Band had over 375 members, the largest in Auburn University history. The Auburn University Marching Band has been invited by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Ireland, to participate in the 2008 St. Patrickâs Day Parade. The Auburn University Marching Band also performed on January 15, 2007 at the Alabama Governor's Inaugural Parade in Montgomery.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/auband/" class="external text" title="http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/auband/" rel="nofollow">Tiger Eyes</a> are the visual ensemble of the Auburn University Marching Band. The Tiger Eyes are comprised of three distinct lines--flags, twirlers, and dancers--that complete complimentary choreography. The three lines work together for one common visual effect as one single ensemble. Tiger Eyes are selected by individual audition based on their specialty each year, as posted on the Auburn University Band Tiger Eyes' website.</p>

<p>Birmingham artist Phil Neel first drew the cartoon tiger <a href="../../../a/u/b/Aubie.html" title="Aubie">Aubie</a> in the late 1950s. From 1958 through 1976, Aubie was featured on the cover of all of Auburnâs home football game programs. In 1979, James Lloyd, spirit director for the Auburn Student Government Association, brought Aubie to life when he ordered a man-sized Tiger costume based upon the cartoon and wore it to the Southeastern Conference basketball tournament. Barry Mask became the first official Aubie in 1979-80, and his sideline and court-side hijinks created Aubieâs spirited personality.</p>
<p>Recognized as one of the most successful college mascots in history, Aubie recently won his sixth national mascot championship through the Universal Cheerleadersâ Association in January 2006. Aubie was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame on August 15, 2006 at Love Park in Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
