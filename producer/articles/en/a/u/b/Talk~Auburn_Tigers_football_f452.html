<p>Each Southeastern Conference division can have more than one champion in a given year. The champion moniker is given to the team <i>or teams</i> with the best record. The conference then uses a tiebreaking formula to determine which team goes to the SEC Championship Game.</p>
<p>As of 2005, Auburn has been champion of the western division six times. They have won the tiebreaker to go to the SEC Championship three times.</p>

<p>I'm surprised that no one has mentioned anything about the recent article in the NY Times on the Auburn athletes called "Top Grades and No Class Time for Auburn players." I'm also surprised that no one has mention that Auburn leads the SEC in NCAA violations. <a href="../../../b/e/s/User%7EBesselfunctions_a92f.html" title="User:Besselfunctions">Besselfunctions</a> 17:07, 23 August 2006</p>

<dd>Well, I'm not that surprised. Admittedly, I wrote most of this article and was not seeking out info of the sort, but upon review, Texas, USC, Alabama, and every other program's football/athletics articles do not mention their past NCAA troubles either. Most likely fans would edit the info out anyway, to the point where we have a polar edit war going, but if you think it is necessary (and appropriate), by all means start a section to talk about the issue (include reputable reference links like NCAA.org). I doubt the validity of your claim that Auburn leads the SEC in NCAA violations. They have never had to forfeit past games for cheating (unlike several other SEC schools) and as far as I know the last NCAA violation/probation was in early 1990's (went into effect 1993) from the Eric Ramsey tape (a coach helped set up a loan). MANY other programs have had more recent indescretions with no mention so not sure why to single out Auburn on old stuff? Not to mention the lack of reputable sources for these "facts". Concerning the NY Times article, from what I read, there were no violations committed and no NCAA investigation looming. It was based on an internal memo whistleblowing by an AU professor complaining of the overcrowding of classes (Auburn has grown attendance rapidly with little/no increased faculty).<a href="http://www.al.com/sports/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/sports/1154078398143760.xml&amp;coll=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.al.com/sports/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/sports/1154078398143760.xml&amp;coll=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> On top of that, only about 10% of the students taking that "directed-reading" class in question (only for seniors needing a few hours to graduate on time where other classes were full) were athletes (let alone football players). So if anything that is an indictment on the rapid growth (and perhaps questionable academic practices for those overcrowded majors) of AU recently and not necessarily the football program per se. The AP reported weeks ago that an internal investigation had cleared all the athletic programs - that is the last I've heard of it.<a href="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/sports/15247996.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/sports/15247996.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Again, I have no association to Auburn other than living in the state, but that is how I see it. I welcome other <b>non-biased</b> opinions. <a href="../../../o/t/d/User%7EOtduff_7ab5.html" title="User:Otduff">otduff</a> (<a href="../../../o/t/d/User_talk%7EOtduff_16ab.html" title="User talk:Otduff">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_otduff_8ec9.html" title="Special:Contributions/otduff">contribs</a>) 21:00, 25 August 2006</dd>

<dd>I'm bias towards Bama, but, I'm gonna offer and unbias opinion. I don't think that the info has to be on there about the bad stuff. It would start an editing war, but, that's not why I don't think it needs to be there. But, like you said, if someone wants to start a section and take care of it, more power to'm. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaGuy2007_e71a.html" title="User:AlabamaGuy2007">AlaGuy</a> 01:32, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm also biased toward Bama, and I have to agree. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a news agancy. If any action is taken against the university, then perhaps it would warrent addition to the article, but until then all we have is a newpaper article. Even if action is taken against the university, it would be for acedemic reasons and not athletic and any mention would belong on the main article for the univeristy and not its football page.76.18.100.128 20:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though I admit my UGA bias, it seems like Auburn is the only college football team that doesn't have a Controversy section. In fact, most teams have just about every individual scandal or violation in the history of the program. (I don't know who could have possibly remembered the Jan Kemp scandal to put it on the UGA page.) The NY Times story was pretty highly publicized, so I don't see why it doesn't belong on the page. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaget53_e4f3.html" title="User:Saget53">User:Saget53</a> 18:37, 4 January 2007 {UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, on the Bama article it talks about the probatoin. Why not include just a small bit, I guess. Might as well. Putting Bama out of my mind though, maybe we shouldn't try and make Auburn look like there's NOTHING bad about it. Everything there isn't good, same goes for every other university in the world. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaGuy2007_e71a.html" title="User:AlabamaGuy2007">AlaGuy</a> 15:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saget, you do overstate the case when you say "only college football team that doesn't have a Controversy section" when a quick look at just the SEC reveals LSU, Tennessee (Tutorgate?) and Florida (Charlie Pell anyone?) without a single negative word in their football articles. Plenty of people remember Jan Kemp (myself included), a scandal that was far more significant than the NYTimes article - your implied comparison of the situations smacks of <a href="../../../r/e/c/WP%7ERECENT_2836.html" title="WP:RECENT">recentism</a>. Generally speaking though, the UGA article is more thorough than this and most other team articles; almost of the team articles suffer from a positive bias because they are usually created and maintained by alums and fans, who are naturally more inclined to write about the good rather than the bad. I personally work hard to maintain an NPOV even on articles where I have inherent or apparent bias (e.g. I've kept references to Dye's probation from being removed from his article) so I'm fine with adding appropriate information on major violations like that in the UGA article and even a small comment on the NYTimes article (you'll find I crafted an appropriate version on the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnell_Williams_74ee.html" title="Carnell Williams">Carnell Williams</a> page because was trying to use it negatively against him). I'll even do it, but it goes on my To Do list with a bunch of other items. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#EF6521"><b>AU</b></font><font color="#000063" face="arial, helvetica"><b><i>Tiger</i></b></font></a> ʃ <font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutiger_e4b5.html" title="User talk:Autiger">talk</a></sup></font>/<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autiger_4136.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autiger">work</a></sub></font> 03:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must admit, I'm pretty surprised to see just how few teams actually have controversy sections. Either I'm the only UGA fan on Wikipedia, or UGA fans are the only ones that don't constantly delete anything negative about their team or their players. I say that because I have tried before finding this discussion to write Controversy sections on this page as well as Cadillac Williams' page, both of which were quickly deleted (It wasn't the section you say you improved FWIW. My interpretation of the story was very relatively unbiased, but it was completely taken down). I noticed that you put a controversy section on Williams and I'm surprised its not down by now. And as far as my recent post goes, I remember Jan Kemp, but before going to the UGA page, I had visited this page and the UF page and noticed not a single bit of controversy. I didn't expect an incident so long ago to be on the page. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaget53_e4f3.html" title="User:Saget53">User:Saget53</a> 19:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe, though, that it's up to us to try and fix other fans' problems with admitting that their schools have been wrong a few times. Why not go ahead and add the junk, people will look at Auburn with a better light if they know that they've been under probation, but have done MUCH better as of late. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaGuy2007_e71a.html" title="User:AlabamaGuy2007">AlaGuy</a> 05:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know this is an old discussion, but thought I'd weigh in. The NY Times issue was resolved and was a problem within the sociology department and was blown out of proportion to the number of students who were athletes involved, as said above. The probations in the 1957 and 1993 seasons in my opinion bare mentioning in the National Champions sections, as those probations effected what polls could vote for Auburn and bowl selections. If I did not know the situation, I would wonder why the 1993 team especially was not a consensus national champ. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAUburnTiger_84d9.html" title="User:AUburnTiger">AUburnTiger</a> 04:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section needs to be deleted for several reasons. 1) The source link is dead. 2) The information contained in this paragraph concerns the USC football program, not Auburn's program. 3) Even if USC were forced to forfeit all games in which Reggie Bush played, it would mean that Oklahoma would be given credit for winning the BCS championship game, and therefore Oklahoma would be BCS national champions. So while the forfeiture MIGHT give Auburn a larger claim to the 2004 title, it would not ACTUALLY give them the title, and therefore this would be opinion, not fact.
