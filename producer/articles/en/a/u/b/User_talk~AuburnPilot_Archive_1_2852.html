<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bush One Finger Salute</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the "Bush One Finger Victory Salute:" What kind of section? There are several videos at the end of the article, and they are not in separate sections. Would it be called "Embarassing Video?" Seems unlikely. "Candid Camera?" ""Candid Video?" In the Clinton article the video where he denies "having relations with that woman, Monica" is just tossed in at the end. I was at a Clinton appearance once, and happened to be very near the stage. He said something and I gave a thumbs up, which he promptly returned. I have always wondered if I had given him the finger, would he have reciprocated, and what would have happened subsequently in the 1992 election! <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Taking another look at the article, perhaps "Speeches" could be amended to "Speeches and other videos" and could then contain video of brush clearing, landing planes on carriers, jogging, bike riding or whatever as well as video moments before making a formal speech such as this one. Or a section called "Other Videos" could be added and include this and other videos of interest which are not speeches per se.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:08, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like you say, to amend it to read "Speeches and other videos" would open up the section to videos covering anything. That would only make the situation worse. As far as a section labeled "Other Videos", that could work but the article is already fairly long. I say we just leave it as is. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">AuburnPilot</a> 00:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When did you first begin editing here at Wikipedia? It seems you have an awful lot of theories on how it should be done.

<dd>I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Somebody added the comment that people evacuating to Birmingham were responsible for the increase in crime. Not only is this false, as I live in Birmingham, it was unsourced and obviously a POV unsupported by fact. I clearly marked the Utilities comment, referring to government corruption, with the {{fact}} tag. As I understand it, and I quote, "In cases of simple vandalism that is clearly not a content dispute (e.g. graffiti, link spam), the three-revert rule does not apply."

<dd>Is that some kind of bad joke? Because if it's not, somebody seriously needs to take a look at how this operation is working. I reverted, in good faith, what I believed to be vandalism on the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham%2C_Alabama_0973.html" title="Birmingham, Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a> article. I then filed a 3RR violation report. Now, after doing this, <b><u><i>I am blocked</i></u></b> for violating the rule. This is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of. I've heard stories about how admins' actions don't match their words, but clearly I should have believed it. I am in absolute disbelief that I am blocked right now and will for sure never report anybody for violating this rule again. Obviously no good deed goes unpunished. I am SHOCKED. I have made just over 400 edits in the last month, the overwhelming majority of which is from reverting blatant vandalism on Wikipedia that I have found by patroling the Recent Changes pages. CLEARLY I shouldn't do a damn thing to help this project. I'll only be blocked for doing so. I can't possibly explain how unbelievably stunned I am right now. Enjoy the vandalism, I've reverted my last. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">AuburnPilot</a> 01:53, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sadly, yes. My apologies to you, <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuke53_0b5c.html" title="User:Duke53">Duke53</a> if my actions ever inflicted an admin on you. Obviously the past means nothing to them and one action out of 400+ is grounds for a 24h banishment. Clearly, history means nothing; a contributor treated the same as a vandal. The best thing to do on Wikipedia seems to be avoiding admins at all costs.

<dd>Maybe now you will see my point that many things are done arbitrarily around here. I do admit that I thought that the rule was applied correctly here, but for the wrong reason. It was refreshing to see an admin apply it, though he might not agree with it. I like having rules &amp; policies, but I also like when they are applied fairly and evenly; many times that is not the case here.

<dd>I agree, many seem to wield "the mop" like it's their personal play thing. Rules seemed to be applied whenever it "fits" a certain admins mood. Just two days ago a "first time offender" as it was put was blocked for 8 hours after violating the 3RR. Of course, he has made no other edits and cleary created the account for the purpose of vandalism. Others edit consistantly, not adding vandalism, and they're blocked for 24, 48, and even 72 hours. There is too little accountability. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">AuburnPilot</a> 06:12, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey ho, I *did* warn you. You need to check up on what simple vandalism is: I did warn you that simply being correct is not enough <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 08:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I stand by my edits which is exactly why I did <u>not</u> self revert them. I think everyone knows being correct means nothing in this place. Otherwise, there wouldnt be 1000 admins. The only hope for this project is that some of the new admins like <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> can add some balance to the admins who would rather "block at will" than take the time to do what's right. This is also why I've reconsidered: I'll revert more vandalism, more often. Between the vandals and admins, something has to be done. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">AuburnPilot</a> 15:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've taken the time to read all the rules relating to vandalism, but thanks for your concern. I apologize for the above, but I felt like the messenger and I'd just been shot. I have never, and don't intend to ever get involved in a revert war; in the past I have even asked for 3Os from Cabal members. I will however continue to devote even more time to patrolling the recent changes page in order to revert simple vandalism. My block ends at 8:35 PM CST on September 10, 2006.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Auburn University</span></h2>
<p>The article I wrote on the history of Auburn football discusses the "national championships" that AU has been awarded by various media and ranking services. The official position of Auburn University is that AU has won only one recognized NC. Nevertheless, I wanted to point out that there are other lesser known outlets that have awarded a NC to Auburn. Many other universities do not exercise such a stringent threshold for accepting national championships, but this is NOT limited to the University of Alabama (BTW, there is no university known as "UAT"). Because you are obviously a native of Alabama, your presume that this comment is intended for the University of Alabama. It is not, and it applies to many other universities (Arkansas, Ga Tech, Florida State, etc) that have claimed these various little known NC's. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.211.196.107 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.211.196.107.html" title="User talk:68.211.196.107">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.211.196.107_66fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.211.196.107">contribs</a>) 03:13, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I did not make any comment about UAT (which does not exist); that was another editor who also made the assumption that the remark was directed at the University of Alabama, not me.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">question about biographical entries</span></h2>
<p>hi auburn</p>
<p>i'm relatively new to this community and you seem to know what you're doing. i was wondering if you could give me your advice about a couple of recent changes that i've made. for example, i recently deleted the 'parodies and spoofs' section of the cheney biography. i felt that in a biography that was already running long, this was not essential information. i have since received messages (from both sides of the political spectrum!) saying i was compromising the article by removing the hard work of others. i'm just curious if you have any thoughts about that kind of edit--i'm committed to doing my part to keep political entries clean and objective--something you also seem interested in--and you have more experience than i. anyway, no need to respond to this if there's no time. but i'm trying to gather some wisdom from a few more experienced editors...all best <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenzocane_abc1.html" title="User:Benzocane">Benzocane</a> 18:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. I tend to make more minor edits (punctuation, grammar, spelling, adding references, and correcting citations) than I do large contributions, with the exception of a select few articles. I'm sure a few editors will give the new Katrina section a once over or two and expand/subtract as needed. It's a great start though. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><font color="#0000FF">Talk</font></sup></a> 22:22, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mountain Vista High School</span></h2>
<p>I do admit that a portion of the sections in re-included in to the article are a bit masturbatory, but they are not to be exluded entirely. Theatre and Speech are intregral parts of the school, and that should be reflected on the page. An edit would be appropriate, not an entire deletion.</p>
<p>If this is supposed to be taken in a serious matter, as you are apparently taking it, then don't be lazy and delete all of the theatre and speech sections. That is just childish. If you really want the Mountain Vista High School page to be taken soberly, then edit the information. Make it factual and mature. Don't start a tug of war on this site. Cut out the what you feel is inappropriate, but do leave what is real and valid. Others will edit what they feel you wrote is inappropriate, and so will many others, and then a general agreement will be reached. That is how wikipedia works. It is not an arbitor making decisions about what should and should not be on this page - it is general, democratic, popular opinion. And as sad as it is, the popular opinion is in favor of ridiculous statements on the school's site is to be included. That's how an egalitarian system works, bud.</p>

<p>I concur with you. The only differene is how we are viewing the articles. I am assuming, please correct me if I am wrong, that you are reading the page as a strict, literal gathering of information on Mountain Vista. And therefore you are justified in your actions - in a literal sense, some of the comments on the page are outlandish.</p>
<p>But, instead of viewing the page just as a regurgation of facts and figures, I look deeper at it, as I invite you to. The quirky sense of humor and obvious exaggeration of the theatre department reflects the school's personality better than a literal, plebian sentence could. An object is not strictly characterized by its final results - there is a myriad of subtexts and subtleties that convey more information than the conscious final results could ever display. The Mountain Vista page may not be straightforward, because it is deeper than that, as are its students. As a collective, we, the students of Mountain Vista, are more than just overpriviledged white kids living in an upper-middle class income tax bracket, we are vivid, lively people with depth to us. Taking us, or anything for that matter, at face value, robs you of the brilliance and beauty that is life. I argue in favor of letting the students write the page for that reason - whatever is put on the page, no matter how misleading or inaccurate, is a reflection of someone's perception of the school, and therefore an insight to the psychology of the students. That is much more valuable than knowing that our school is in 5A athletics, wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p>...and on a side note, did you actually look at the reversion you returned to? I corrected grammar, puncuation, spelling, as well as returned the speech and threatre sections. But, apparently, those were inaccurate too, as they were reverted as well. Be careful not to judge. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zachz (<a href="../../../z/a/c/User_talk%7EZachz_d1d5.html" title="User talk:Zachz">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zachz_47fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zachz">contribs</a>) 04:33, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Uh, no. I am in fact <i>"reading the page as a strict, literal gathering of information on Mountain Vista. And therefore [am] justified in [my] actions".</i> Wikipedia is <b>not</b> the place for you and your fellow students to "look deeper" or "convey more information" with "misleading or inaccurate" information. That is the exact opposite of what Wikipedia is about. If you would like to create a webpage about your school, I'm happy to make suggestions of where to look for appropriate webhosts. And on a side note, I don't really care if you are "overpriviledged white kids living in an upper-middle class income tax bracket". I'm not judging anybody; I'm helping maintain an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><font color="#0000FF">Talk</font></sup></a> 04:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're right. An encyclopedia should contain just the facts. Period. I concede that.</p>
<p>I do, however, still believe that theatre and speech should not be completely deleted - by anyone. They hold as much emphasis as any other section, and should be regarded as equally important, not to deleted, but fixed and corrected. If you cannot fix it, then please flag it for correction, but do not just delete it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zachz (<a href="../../../z/a/c/User_talk%7EZachz_d1d5.html" title="User talk:Zachz">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zachz_47fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zachz">contribs</a>) 04:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Sure, I'll be glad to give my opinion, although as the original author, I doubt you'll like it. I think the article is definitly news worthy, but I'm not sure it's encyclopedia worthy. Will this interview be important in 20 years? I just can't see how it would. Clinton? Yes. Chris Wallace? Maybe. The interview? No, I just dont think it will.

<dd>Thanks for your opinion. I still think the interview is a historically significant interview. Not because of the arguments which occured between Clinton &amp; Wallace, which I view as mostly a distraction, but because it's one of the only times Clinton has gone on record w.r.t. these matters. As the article states, discussions between Presidents &amp; V.P.' on issues such as these for the purposes of the 9/11 Commission were not under oath, private testimony. So there is not much else to go on. Not that it should change your mind (don't), just wanted you to hear it from my perspective.</dd>

<p>Huh, that's a little odd.

Now more importantly, yes I am an Auburn student. I've been down here a few years now and can't image going anywhere else. Well, until I graduate; no desire to make this <i>home</i>.

I wouldn't join in, but you might be interested in what you read. As far as Auburn... I haven't gone back in a few years, not really regularly since the late 90's. What I miss most is not Auburn itself, but the memories I have of my friends and our experiences there. The last few times, it was like... there wasn't anything there for me anymore. Auburn University is still there, but the Auburn I knew has grown up and moved on. I think probably every alumnus from every University has that feeling, in some way or another, at some point. A lot of my friends and I are still in touch and fairly close -- if there were any point in my life I could experience again, my Auburn experience wins hands down! &#160;:-) War Eagle! /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 22:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the following text is under the section War eagle VI and is what we would like to be removed</p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, allegations of improper care of the birds by the Southeastern Raptor Rehabilitation Center were leveled by the university administration and by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Many of the birds were suffering from diseases and malourishment; this lead to the dismissal of center director Joe Shelnutt.</p>
<p><br />
AUBURN, Ala. - When bunches of birds were falling ill last year at Auburn University's respected raptor center, experts were shocked and puzzled by the explanation that the culprit was a lethal disease never seen before in birds of prey.</p>
<p>The disbelief is only larger following an independent study that found the disease had been misdiagnosed - and that officials at the haven for hundreds of injured birds from across the Southeast had hastily decided to euthanize "otherwise healthy animals."</p>
<p>"It just seemed like the trigger got pulled a little early, before they knew what they were dealing with," one of the authors, Patrick Redig of the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center, told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The findings by Redig and a colleague were sent to Auburn and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in January but were not released to the public. The AP recently obtained a copy of the report and related documents.</p>
<p>Instead of a microorganism - or a later theory, malnutrition - the report blames faulty laboratory techniques and poor decision-making for the spate of deaths, which in part led to the firing of the center's director.</p>
<p>Some 25 birds at Auburn's Southeastern Raptor Rehabilitation Center died between November 2002 and the summer of 2003 - 17 of them by euthanasia to prevent the disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, from spreading to other birds at the center and in the wild. The center treats 400 to 500 birds a year.</p>
<p>But Redig, director of Minnesota's Raptor Center, and colleague Andre Ziegler, a pathologist at the university's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, found that the tests used to determine MG was present in the birds are appropriate for poultry but not for raptors - meat-eating birds of prey with sharp talons and hooked beaks that include eagles, hawks, falcons and owls.</p>
<p>"Birds were being euthanized primarily due to false positive results," Ziegler wrote. "While subsequent ... (testing) provided much-needed clarity, the false positive results were largely responsible for many birds being euthanized prior to that time."</p>
<p>Timothy Boosinger, dean of Auburn's vet school, says the center's actions were appropriate given the information administrators had at the time.</p>
<p>"The big challenge we had was there's not much known about mycoplasma infections in (these) birds, it's not well understood," Boosinger said. "So at the time, when that test tested positive, we had to assume that maybe we did have MG in the center and needed to take appropriate steps."</p>
<p>The head of the Alabama Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Fred Hoerr, said so little was known then about the occurrence of mycoplasmas in raptors that the test for MG was the only one available. "We were using the tools that we had," he said.</p>
<p>After deciding the birds didn't have MG, Auburn officials blamed the birds' deaths on a vitamin A deficiency. As evidence they noted open sores, or lesions, in some of the birds' mouths.</p>
<p>However, Redig said that was a "working hypothesis, but not a definitive diagnosis" based on the records he had reviewed. Ziegler said the only bird he found to be suffering from malnutrition was "Tiger," the prized golden eagle mascot that once performed before football games at Jordan-Hare Stadium and at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Tiger was not one of the birds that died.</p>
<p>"I am uncomfortable with the universal declaration of Dean Boosinger when he stated 'severe malnutrition played a major role in the death of many of the birds,'" Ziegler wrote.</p>
<p>Instead, Redig wrote, the main reason for the deaths seemed to be that the false positive test results fell upon "an organization in which there may have been some ambiguous leadership, fuzzy reporting lines and poorly supported decision-making authority."</p>
<p>Asked to explain what he meant, Redig recalled reading transcripts of meetings that apparently became hostile at times.</p>
<p>"The exchange of comments and the very authoritarian, `You don't know what you're talking about, I'm taking control' nature of the comments being made by people that were in some cases not even directly in the trenches in dealing with this thing struck me as highly indicative of an organization that was not very functional," Redig said. "Differing agendas, differing views of mission, just maybe not as knowledgeable about raptors as they maybe ought to have been."</p>
<p>He declined to say who made what comments in those meetings. But he said Joe Shelnutt, who was fired as the raptor center's director in the middle of the crisis, seemed to have been on one side of the arguments.</p>
<p>"He was the one that was starting to, very early on, call for some fairly major investigation reviews, and he was more or less told, `This is none of your business, stay out of it,'" Redig said, citing materials provided to him by Auburn.</p>
<p>"And then later on when things really started going the wrong direction, he was apparently in some manner held accountable."</p>
<p>Shelnutt has said the official reason given for his June 2003 firing was insubordination. When contacted by the AP, he disputed any suggestion that he had mismanaged the birds' health and diets.</p>
<p>"It just boggles my mind how we could keep birds in top athletic condition, perform the way they performed, and go to the Olympics, which is high pressure, keep birds healthy through all that, and all of a sudden we can't manage something as basic as nutrition? Come on," he said.</p>
<p>Shelnutt said Auburn officials began blaming malnutrition three months after he and his staff had left the raptor center. Even if there had been a nutritional problem on his watch, he said it wouldn't have gone undetected so long.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't all of a sudden have a nutritional deficiency that ran through your entire population at one time," he said.</p>
<p>Boosinger said any seemingly heated discussions were simply "a good group of scientists working on a problem to try and find the answer."</p>
<p>"There were differing opinions at the time," Boosinger said. "I felt like we did everything we could do at each point in time based on the data we had. We pursued the diagnostics and the research to get a definitive answer as fast as we could."</p>
<p>As for Redig's perception of "fuzzy reporting lines," Boosinger said "the reporting lines were clear."</p>
<p>"Mr. Shelnutt reported to the dean and everyone else was advisory to solving the problem," he said. "I don't know how Dr. Redig could make that judgment from Minnesota, quite frankly."</p>
<p>A year after the deaths, the parties involved appear ready to move on.</p>
<p>Auburn's raptor center has hired a new director and is back to performing shows for schoolchildren and other groups. There are even expectations that Tiger or another eagle once again will circle Jordan-Hare Stadium, where crowds of 87,451 chant "Warrrr Eagle!" until the eagle swoops down to a handler at midfield.</p>
<p>Shelnutt says he has several new projects that could come to fruition soon.</p>
<p>And Boosinger says raptor experts everywhere will gain from Auburn's experience.</p>
<p>"The good news is that we now know more about mycoplasmas in birds of prey than probably any center in the world," he said. "And that work is being published, it's been presented, and I think it will be of great benefit to other programs."</p>

Final straw for me -- I have called for an RfArb regarding his behavior. I listed you as a witness, and I would sincerely appreciate you relaying your experiences and thoughts to the ArbCom.

<p>After some consideration, I've decided to take a very firm position regarding the situation with Cbuhl79. I considered stuff like "be the bigger man" and "not a big deal", "let it slide", etc... but it occured to me that in order to preserve the value and absolute functionality of the wiki system, '<i>somebody</i> has to stop those who would abuse the project or the editors who make good faith efforts to improve it.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Purpose</span></h3>
<p>One ArbCom member has voted to reject, and his reasoning "let this dispute die" seems to be influenced by Cbuhl79's constant rambling about content. The ArbCom needs to realize that i'm calling his behavior into question. Without some sort of censure, this guy is going to (1) damage the credibility of wikipedia; and (2) frustrate other editors to the point that they probably will not wish to continue working on whatever articles he's hawking. It seems absolutely inconceivable to me that he can get away with all this. This is my first real experience with any kind of disciplinary actions on wikipedia... do you have any advice or guidance? I now have an advocate to assist with prosecuting the case, assuming it gets accepted. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 11:24, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yea I was worried about ArbCom's lack of notice too. I finally asked the prosecution advocate, and he suggesting posting a question about it on the ArbCom/talk page. Perhaps that's what prompted the second vote. I made sure to mention the fact that the singular reject was posted before any other supporting witnesses had made statements (and, IMHO, was premature). Four more accept votes to go. On a side note... do you have your own plane? /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 07:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Definitely a good sign. I was curious to see if the other members were active so I looked into their contribs and it seems they are all actively participating in ArbCom proceedings. Since we'll need all other members to vote accept, this could be tricky. Needs to be 5/1/0 I believe. -- <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>17:14, 2 November 2006 <sub>(<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</sub></small></dd>

<dd>The requirement is 5 accept -- we have two rejects, but I think I remember looking it up once before, and thinking that it could be up to 5/4/0. The case advocate mentioned that the missing step of mediation may influence their deicision to accept, however I explained to him that mediation fails to be effective when an editor is not acting in good faith (he agreed that mediation with Cbuhl79 would serve only to extend the problems). I also think there's a time requirement on ArbCom requests -- if it fails to get accepted within ten days I think it dies. Need one more ArbCom member to step up to the plate. As far as Cbuhl79, I have a feeling that he either got a new account (unlikely), or he's simply laying low in hopes of ArbCom reject -- I am fairly certain he will resurface should the case be declined. In any case, your dilligance in this matter is duely noted and appreciated.</dd>

<dd>As a side note, I was under the impression the consensus decided not to reference any particular "critics and observers" in the intro (as it seems to elevate to undue weight status).

<dd>That's the impression I was under; a reference yes, specific critics, no. As far as the ArbCom, I was surprised that the last vote was reject. I just don't understand this policy of requiring a <i>net</i> 4 accept votes. I guess it makes sense when there are 10 members active, but with only 8, it seems like a simple majority should be acceptable. Either way, I think Cbuhl will be under close watch by a lot of people.

Your continued incivility, threats to take people to arbitration, using your user page as a battle ground for personal attacks, a clear lack of understanding image policy (There is no mediation or copyright process and images are orphaned if not in article space...your user page doesn't save them), and every other possible thing I can think of. Look at my talk page, then look at yours. Yours is filled with warning messages and hints that you need to review policy. It's unbelievable that you actually think you understand policy.

<p>When I came onto the Fox News article, I really just wanted to make sure that it was an inclusive, NPOV representation of what the community as a whole believes, and that no particular status was given unduely (or any valid viewpoint ignored). I am wholeheartedly disgusted at the amount of effort it's taken just to try and settle an issue (that has already been settled!). This is, by far, the most irritating and stressful wikiencounter I've ever participated in... I really thought that the 4 accept votes kinda cooled Cbuhl79's jets... I don't think this new guy is Cbuhl79, but I just can't believe that we've become a <i>task force</i> just to enforce a consensus. I'm not going away anytime soon, but I just wanted to vent somewhere that could appreciate the frustration.

<dd>You and me both. It's amazing what lengths some people will go to in order to push their POV regardless of previous discussion. One of the things I do most is reverting vandalism, but I never expected to spend so much time arguing <i>one</i> point on <i>one</i> article. As far as sockpuppets, I'm not convinced one way or the other, but if it's just a coincidence, it is one hell of a coincidence. If anything, I'd agree that Cbuhl would be the sockpuppet of Mrmisc rather than the sockmaster. The arbcom was a definite disappointment. With 4 members willing to hear the case, 1 voting before any involved members made a statement, and several "active" members not even voting, it was not handled well. I'm not going anywhere either, so I guess we'll both be on the <i>task force</i> for a while to come. ;-) -- <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>04:03, 11 November 2006 (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small></dd>

<p>The article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is exceedingly pro-, and I call its neutrality into question.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ArbCom and your opinion</span></h2>
<p>Hey AuburnPilot! I've posted a message on one of the <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">ArbCom member's</a> <a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">talk page</a> regarding the current state of the RfARB process. I would like your input as well. Quote to follow...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I brought this here because I'd rather have an informed opinion on the current state of acceptance than open a can of worms prematurely. Note this is not sour grapes for a <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_RfARB_Cbuhl79_503d.html" title="User:Blaxthos/RfARB Cbuhl79">case</a> i felt should have been accepted... I'm more concerned about a well-intentioned policy that may have consequences far beyond the scope the change originally envisioned. As you (and others) have pointed out, when fewer than the full ArbCom becomes participates in RfARB acceptance procedure, the possiblity of appropriate cases being delisted with significant support (as occured in my proposed case), all compounded with ArbCopm members posting deny votes before involved parties can comment... it seems like the ArbCom process has been castrated, and with it those who would game the wikipedia system have nothing more opportunities to do so with less fear of repurcussion. If the intent of the policy was to lessen the burden on the ArbCom, it definitely does that -- but at what cost? If not, what mechanisms would be appropriate for addressing this unintended consequence? I haven't done the research to see if the semi- or non-participating members are at the end of their appointment term... if so, perhaps it is simply burnout. I think either way this is a problem that needs attention of those who are better informed and poised to address the issue. Am I off base? If not, how would you recommend I proceed? /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 07:26, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it <i>hits the nail on the head</i> fairly well. The entire process is doomed when <i>active</i> members are so <i>inactive</i> and it definitly needs to be addressed.

<p>But how should I proceed, do you think? What's the proper forum to start consensusbuilding or draw the attention of appropriate persons? Village pump? Policy talk page? Individual ArbCom members?

<dd>Hmmm, I'm not sure. An RfC might get people's attention, but where would you post it? ArbCom talk page? A policy page? I don't really know where the best place would be. I saw ArbCom member <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> said s/he would bring it up on the mailing list...I'm not even sure what that is...Village pump might be a good place to ask such a question.

<p><s>:<i>"I'm pretty happy about removing that"</i>; as you should be.

<p>I am hear to respond to you reporting on <a href="../../../b/o/w/User%7EBowser_Koopa_077c.html" title="User:Bowser Koopa">User:Bowser Koopa</a>. I think you overreacted over him expressing himself on your talk page. You said that his talk page was not "his", and everyone had a right to criticize him, yet when he does the same thing to you, you ask for him to have a permanent block(when is the last time someone blocked "indefinately" got unblocked?). This is a double standard and you are equal to him and should not have the authority over him. What is worse is that you delete his message on your talk page yet he can't delete your message on his page? Since when are you President and dictator of wikipedia and you own him. You are not an administrator and you have no right to ban him. He vandalized ONE page, and he is labeled a "vandalism only account". So I guess his talk page isn't his, but belongs to you along with this talk page? If he doesn't have the right to do certain things, you shouldn't either. You actions have proven you are a self-absorbed individual who can't take ONE joke. Is it because you like George W. Bush. I see many of your pages that you overlook are conservative-leaning. So this might be political bias. Once again, I am not trying to attack you. I am angry that you took such a harsh action towards a user before you are supposed to. Normally, a user gets about three warnings, yet for some reason you automatically try to get him banned and for some reason was able to. I would like for you to take this into consideration and give him a second chance <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Insano_shows_no_mercy_d0f2.html" title="User:Captain Insano shows no mercy">Captain Insano shows no mercy</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_Insano_shows_no_mercy_7ab2.html" title="User talk:Captain Insano shows no mercy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captain_Insano_shows_no_mercy_9d82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captain Insano shows no mercy">contribs</a>) 18:57, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>First, lets avoid personal attacks like <i>you are a self-absorbed individual</i>; they are very inappropriate and in no way help better this encyclopedia. Now, as you say, I am not an administrator. I have no more power/authority/control here on Wikipedia than you or <a href="../../../b/o/w/User%7EBowser_Koopa_077c.html" title="User:Bowser Koopa">Bowser Koopa</a> and did not vandalize his page or block him. As a vandal, Bowser Koopa was blocked. Not only did s/he add blatant vandalism to the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, Bowser went on to change other people's comments, leave inappropriate warnings on my page, and even worse, signed those warnings with another user's signature. That is <i>unbelievably</i> inappropriate. The warnings left here were not legitimate and therefor removed. As far as bias, that's an allegation for which you have no proof. I edit article I relate to; Bush is the president, Riley is my governor. What other <i>conservative leaning</i> articles you are referring to, I'm not sure. My political beliefs do not come into play here on Wikipedia. I encourage you to edit productively here on Wikipedia without commenting on users, but content. This is an encyclopedia after all.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RfA comments</span></h2>
<p>Hi there. I said I'd explain further on your talk page why I think that you've misunderstood the discussion that resulted in me saying what I did at Kafziel's current RfA. You said: <i>"Well, there goes civility and good faith out the window. How informing the crats they missed a deadline can be seen as badgering is quite ridiculous. If anything, crz should have been thanked for pointed out the oversight...Let's try to remember the focus of an RfA (the candidate)."</i></p>
<ul>
<li>(1) crz did inform the bureaucrats that hey had missed the deadline. That was not what I meant by 'badgering. I was referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90588608" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90588608" rel="nofollow">his reply</a> to what a bureaucrat said. My use of the word 'badgering' was unfortunate, and I will apologise to crz for that.</li>
<li>(2) As I've pointed out at the RfA, crz has been thanked.</li>
<li>(3) We all agree that the focus of the RfA should be the candidate.</li>
<li>(4) My concerns with crz's behaviour arose from a consistent pattern of campaigning for his nomineee. That is why I was unable to assume good faith over this matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up any misunderstanding. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
