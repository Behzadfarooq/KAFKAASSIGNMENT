<p>Herbert was afflicted with eye problems which left him nearly blind from early childhood, losing all his sight towards the end of his life.</p>

<p>Herbert was in his own right a considerable Orientalist, and a linguist who spoke French, Italian, German, Turkish, Arabic, Greek and Albanian as well as English.</p>
<p>A renowned traveller, especially in the Middle East, his trips include voyages through <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>. During the period 1902-04 he was an honorary attache in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, then in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> during 1904-05. He was much more interested in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> than in the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_East_982f.html" title="Far East">Far East</a>.</p>
<p>Herbert often dressed as a tramp on his travels.</p>

<p>He became a passionate advocate of Albanian independence, having visited the country in 1907, 1911 and 1913. When the Albanian delegates to the 1912 London Balkan Peace Conference arrived, they secured the assistance of Herbert as an advisor. He was very active in their cause and is regarded as having a considerable influence on Albania's obtaining independence.</p>
<p>He was twice offered the throne of Albania. On the first occasion, just before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, he was interested, but was dissuaded by the then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Asquith_b841.html" title="Herbert Asquith">Herbert Asquith</a>, a family friend.</p>
<p>The National Library of Albania in <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirana.html" title="Tirana">Tirana</a> was once named after Herbert as was a village in the country.</p>

<p>He was a very independent Conservative Member of Parliament for <a href="../../../y/e/o/Yeovil_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_012b.html" title="Yeovil (UK Parliament constituency)">the Yeovil division of Somerset</a> from 1911 to his death. Always an advocate of the rights of smaller nations, Herbert opposed the British Government's <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> policy. Herbert was, however, always seen as something of a lightweight in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>.</p>
<p><a name="World_War_One" id="World_War_One"></a></p>

<p>Despite very poor eyesight, Herbert was able, at the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1914, to join the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Guards_5a2c.html" title="Irish Guards">Irish Guards</a>, in which he served in a supernumerary position. He did this by purchasing a uniform and boarding a troopship bound for France.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mons_617b.html" title="Battle of Mons">Battle of Mons</a> he was wounded, taken prisoner, and escaped. In December, 1914 he joined the Intelligence Bureau in <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, which much more suited his talents and physical disability.</p>
<p>Herbert was an intelligence officer attached to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>-<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> Division, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps_3954.html" title="Australian and New Zealand Army Corps">Anzacs</a>, during the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli_Campaign_5dc8.html" title="Gallipoli Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, where his Turkish speaking ability was to prove useful. He was famous for having arranged a truce with Turkish authorities to bury the dead.</p>
<p>After home leave to recover from illness, Herbert was sent back to the Middle East, working with, among others, <a href="../../../t/2E/e/T.E._Lawrence_64e7.html" title="T.E. Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a>, Sir <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Cox_428b.html" title="Percy Cox">Percy Cox</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertrude_Bell_c289.html" title="Gertrude Bell">Gertrude Bell</a>.

<p>Herbert ended the war as head of the British mission to the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> army in Albania with the rank of <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a>.</p>

<p>Aubrey Herbert married Mary, daughter of the 4th Viscount de Vesci, a member of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Ascendancy_791b.html" title="Protestant Ascendancy">Protestant Ascendancy</a> in Ireland. Lord de Vesci converted, along with his wife, to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> and raised their children accordingly.</p>
<p>Aubrey and Mary Herbert had four children, one of whom, Laura, married the famous novelist <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Waugh_d3c0.html" title="Evelyn Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>.</p>
<p>Herbert's mother gave him both a country estate at Pixton Park in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>, England with 5,000 acres (20 km²) of land and a substantial villa on the Gulf of Genoa at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portofino.html" title="Portofino">Portofino</a>. His son, <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Herbert_%28landowner%29_0b9c.html" title="Auberon Herbert (landowner)">Auberon Herbert</a>, inherited both properties.</p>
<p>Herbert's mother-in-law gave the family a fine house in London.</p>
<p>Herbert was a slim man of more than average height and contemporaries described him as having perfect manners.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life, Herbert became totally blind. He was given very bad advice to the effect that having all his teeth extracted would restore his sight. The dental operation resulted in blood poisoning from which he died in London on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">26 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>.</p>
<p>Herbert's estate was probated in 1924 at 49,970 pounds sterling.</p>
