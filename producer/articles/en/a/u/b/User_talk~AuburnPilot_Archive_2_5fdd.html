<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question Regarding Revert on U of A traditions</span></h2>
<p>I realize that my edit regarding the Rammer Jammer cheer was in regards to Auburn, however, it is only when Auburn plays and beats Bama that Auburn uses this cheer. As I stated in my edit, Bama fans are irritated when Auburn mocks their cheer. In the latest edition of the Auburn Plainsman, an opinion from a student at U of A was published regarding just how irritated they were when Auburn did Rammer Jammer at the 2006 Iron Bowl, in addition to losing 5 in a row to Auburn (this can be found on their website). Now, I could see how this could be added to the Iron Bowl page, as this version of Rammer Jammer usually occurs there. (I am not sure if it is done in other sport competitions between the two schools.) Where on Wikipedia does this mockery of Alabama's Cheer belong? Does it not belong at all?

<p>Hey man, hate to pump from the same well too often, but I have a great deal of respect for you and I would appreciate your objective opinion. While reading an article about early console gaming I came across an article about the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_crash_of_1983.html" title="Video game crash of 1983">Video_game_crash_of_1983</a>. After reading it I noticed only one source, and what appeared to be tons of original research. I hopped over to the talk page and noticed two things: (1) other editors had raised these concerns; and (2) the talk page itself (over time) is evidence of original research (recollect what happened, and then go and try to find sources to support it). I raised <a href="../../../v/i/d/Talk%7EVideo_game_crash_of_1983_1397.html#Serious_Problems" title="Talk:Video game crash of 1983">concern here</a> and was immediately attacked and told they don't accept my criticism in good faith. At this point I'm wondering if I'm out of line, or if they are, and what actions I should take. If you have time, would you mind looking at the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Talk%7EVideo_game_crash_of_1983_1397.html#Serious_Problems" title="Talk:Video game crash of 1983">exchanges on the talk page</a> and let me know waht you think?

<dd>It is no problem at all. You should never think twice about asking for my opinion because I assure you, I never think twice about giving it. I'll read through the article and discussion and see what I think of the situation. I haven't had a chance yet, but will definitely do so today/tonight.

<p>I actually completely agree with your first analysis of this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Video_game_crash_of_1983&amp;diff=91858786&amp;oldid=75608114" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Video_game_crash_of_1983&amp;diff=91858786&amp;oldid=75608114" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. While it did have a few citations (I believe 5 in all), there were enormous gaps in text when it came to referencing the major claims of the article. While many of the claims could probably be verified, as some of the other editors state, they were not referenced as of Dec. 3, 2006 (when you first encountered the article). Unverified claims such as "<i>there was a much smaller market in games for home computers in North America</i>", "<i>That gap ended with the success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</i>", "<i>This period is sometimes referred to as the video game crash of 1984, because that was the year the full effects of the crash became obvious to consumers.</i>", and "<i>few games were developed in 1983</i>" all appear in the intro. The rest of the article gets even worse. I'd say all of these statements equate to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> if they are not backed up by references. Who says there was a smaller market, NES saved the gaming world, or that the crash was obvious to consumers as of 1984? The editor? Without references, it's a problem. I also agree with your statement that the article should be nominated for AfD if nobody is able to provide <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> sources to substantiate these and other claims. I would, however, at least give it some time to allow the <i>normal</i> editors to provide sources before nominating it for deletion. At this point, I wouldn't take any action other than talk page discussion. Maybe even try to help find sources.

<dd>I appreciate the analysis of the article, and I am glad I wasn't too off base. I was confident that my assessment was correct. What's got me completely spun is the behavior of the other editors... I feel like I just got hit by a train -- I've never been accused of acting in bad faith, much less attacked in such a way. Am I way off base here? If not, how would you proceed? Although I've been around for years, I'm not much for wikipolitik. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 03:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They definitely seemed to have come on strong, but this could be like the FNC situation...a long drawn out problem they thought was finally resolved, then somebody else comes in and points it out. People get possessive of articles they work on, and when it's something they are very familiar with, it's hard to see the need for proper citations. Common knowledge to me is likely very different from what's common knowledge to you. I'd just attempt to keep things on topic, rather than commenting on the other editors' actions. Dredging up your old comments on other talk pages was a bit ridiculous for the other person to have done, but I've found ignoring comments like that and continuing to press the issue is the best way to diffuse somebody's persistent attacks. Not that you can do it on an article talk page, but when I can't get rid of a <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">troll</a>, I archive their messages and usually the situations ends right then and there. Stick to the facts, policies, and guidelines and there's nothing they can justifiably attack.</dd>

<dd>I see you've already found the preferences tab and how to customize your signature, so it isn't too difficult from there. At the end of my signature, in the preferences tab, I added: &lt;small&gt;{{subst:CURRENTTIME}}, {{subst:CURRENTDAY}} {{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}} ([[UTC]])&lt;/small&gt;. Because templates are not to be used in signatures, the date templates must be <a href="../../../s/u/b/WP%7ESUB_55d9.html" title="WP:SUB">substituted</a>, especially since you wouldn't want the current date/time to show by your signature.

I am delighted by the result and a little daunted by the scope of additional responsibilities; I shall be cautious in my use of the new tools. I am well aware that becoming an Admin is not just about a successful nomination, but a continuing process of gaining further experience; for this I shall welcome your feedback.

<dd>Without finding any real discussion, my guess would be that the websites are removed for the same reason links to AOL hosted webpages are removed.

If I hold the position that all Americans have US Dollar bills secretly implanted in their heads at birth, but can't find anything to support such a claim, I could create a page with googlepages and instantly have a source backing me up. (And please, that's an example. I don't actually believe that&#160;;-)). Just like blogs, personal sites are not reliable as sources of information. Hope this helps, and that I'm at least hitting somewhere near the mark on this issue. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> 22:58, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr. Pilot- although I do not agree with 'Truths' exact comments/'facts,' I will step out and say that (2) of the fraternities did lose their housing for (1) year and placed under probation after both fraternities went before a judiciary board (known as the college's honor board) and admitted to several hazing acts. Although <i>the Elm</i> (the college newspaper) did not make available the spring 2005 editions online, which included this particular article (however, it is found in the school's library), they did make available the follow up article <a href="http://elm.washcoll.edu/past/077/18/frat.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://elm.washcoll.edu/past/077/18/frat.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which talks about how they did meet their probational requirements and are currently applying for their special housing back. I did not know if you or anyone else dealing with this individual could maybe simplify this matter by writing a small, NEUTRAL revision that might satisfy this person's intentions without comprimising the article.</p>
<p>In the same respect, is there any chance an editor/administrator reading this, could include that the campus does have a 4th male frathernity on campus, Kappa Sigma <b>colony</b> (which was created after the (2) fraternities went before an honor board, but is not the reason/only reason for its creation) currently applying for chartering [see webpage <a href="http://kappasigma.washcoll.edu/" class="external free" title="http://kappasigma.washcoll.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://kappasigma.washcoll.edu/</a>].</p>
<p>I believe that these (2) things are eligible for revisions, however, new to the group I do not want to step out of line and do them myself. I hope that these citations may provide some insight to where 'Truth' may be over-exaggerating; seeing that you appear to have the most dealings with 'Truth' and attributed many satisfactory revisions, maybe you could find this neutral ground to write on and solve this misdealing?</p>

<dd>Not a problem. As far as the religious userboxes being deleted, I must have missed out on that discussion.

Watch the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> page to keep it focused on Him. Thanks a lot.</p>

<dd>As much as I appreciate your willingness to find people who are able to improve this article, I'm not sure spamming the talk pages of every person in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_Wikipedians_8817.html" title="Category:Christian Wikipedians">Category:Christian Wikipedians</a> is the best way to do it. No harm done, but a simple post on the talk page of the article is usually a sufficient attention getter. I will definitely take a look at the article however, and make any changes I believe need to be made. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> 05:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know where you get off, this is the first time in weeks that I've been on, and I sign on to find rumors about you saying I'm a sockpuppet for some vandal that plays soccer?

<p>In light of all this, it is very hard to believe anything except that somebody is using a sockpuppet to avoid a block. In addition, both accounts were created within one day of each other: <i>14 November 2006 Soccerguy1039 (Talk | contribs) New user account</i> &amp; <i>15 November 2006 Emokid200618 (Talk | contribs) New user account</i>. That's one hell of a coincidence that two completely separate people with identical interests would create accounts and begin editing the same articles within one day of each other. Then again, stranger things have happened. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> 21:31, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm glad you finally decided to register. I was the same way, making the occasional anonymous edit while lurking in the background, until Wikipedia <a href="../../../a/o/l/WP%7EAOL_eafe.html" title="WP:AOL">blocked AOL</a> from editing; I was tired of the collateral.

<p>Hello AuburnPilot. I have been trying to address vandalism recently by simply reverting without any other intervention (warning, threats, "telling" etc) My thoughts are that this will not sustain behavior that is motivated by attention. I will revert up to twice. If the vandalism continues I leave it to more interventionist editor or admins. So far this seems to work in great majority to cases. I think of this approach consistent with "don't feed the trolls." I call it working with a mop without a club. I have not made any references on my talk or user page as this might inadvertantly support the vandalism. Please reply here, rather than my talk page if you have further thoughts on this matter. I don't think this violates any policies etc. Again let me know here if this causes prolems. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 18:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you've found it to be effective, by all means continue. My only concern would be that other editors would not be aware of previous vandalism, and as a result give a lesser than deserved warning. I don't believe there is any policy requiring warnings; it is merely helpful.

<p>Actually, it looks like a lot of people will read it. Werdna of Werdnabot fame, myself, Eagle 101 is a definite programmer, SeraphimBlade, etc. Several people indicate they are programmers or computer science on their user pages, and that's just from a sparse selection of oppose voters. Just because <i>you</i> might not read it doesn't mean other people wouldn't. A large number of people actually do spend significant time reading and improving code. In addition, this should be available to anyone who wants to protect their own wikis, and to any security researcher who comes by. Also, as I noted in my comment, this does not actually prevent the functionality from becoming available to anyone. I or someone else will write another bot, and that code will be publicly available, and the whole point of closing the code here will be moot; it would just be a tremendous waste. a duplication of effort. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the info, but I'd still bet the majority of the opposers wouldn't take the time.

Taking a look at the two IP addresses he claimed as his own, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fox_News_Channel/Archive_16&amp;diff=83019307&amp;oldid=83019192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fox_News_Channel/Archive_16&amp;diff=83019307&amp;oldid=83019192" rel="nofollow">68.205.119.151</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fox_News_Channel/Archive_16&amp;diff=83293069&amp;oldid=83292872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fox_News_Channel/Archive_16&amp;diff=83293069&amp;oldid=83292872" rel="nofollow">159.153.129.39</a>) only one stopped editing. The other continued up until mid December 2006, and began editing again today. Of course the real issue is the way the case was rejected, not the rejection itself. Any case with a 4/2 split should have been accepted. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> 17:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your comments on my recent edits. Whilst I accept that what I had added are perhaps controversial, that is because the facts are themselves controversial. The invasion of Afghanistan (and Iraq for that matter) was illegal. There is no doubt of that. Similarly the current American administrations practice of openly justifying its breaking of the law are controversial. It is a pity that stating the obvious is no longer acceptable in some circles.

<p>I think it's Cbuhl79. Good looking out regarding his (CBuhl79) linked IP's. If indeed he hasn't disappeared, this is most probably him...

<dd>I don't think it's Cbuhl79; not yet at least. I did find it interesting that the IP he/she signed with earlier today (71.233.211.201) is the same IP that asked these same questions at the beginning of December. It's the first section on the talk page...you actually applauded him/her for discussing changes before making them. There are so many people who worked to reach a compromise on the current version that I doubt anything is going to change. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> 01:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who's to say Cbuhl79 wasn't just a puppet of another master, as well? The similarity in logic makes me suspicious. It's hard to take all these re-hashes in good faith, considering each editor's seeming unwillingness to actually find out how the current version was formulated.</p>

<p>I don't mean to bother you if you're busy but, I left a question on the talk page under "no comment" but wasn't sure if you saw it so I figured I'd leave it here as well. I used <a href="http://www.infowars.com/print/Bush/bush_delusiona.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.infowars.com/print/Bush/bush_delusiona.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> web site to source the line, "Critics would later see this delay as an indicator of his indecisiveness." The citation I added was removed for WP:RS. I realized it was a biased source, but I thought I could use it to source criticism for Bush, since it did criticize him for being indecisive for his delay in the classroom. I thought WP:RS meant I couldn't use sites like that to reference facts about bush, but it was OK to use it to reference facts about his critics (as the site clearly is a critic of bush). Was I wrong?--<a href="../../../m/b/c/User%7EMbc362_848b.html" title="User:Mbc362">Mbc362</a> 16:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I've taken a look at the link and the named policy, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. From my understanding, the links/citations/references used must meet all requirements set out within WP:RS regardless of what they are used for. This also would go to the credibility of a criticism. If no "mainstream" sources (i.e. Newspapers, magazines, news agencies, studies etc) can be found to back it up, it likely isn't a notable enough criticism to mention. That being said, WP:RS is a guideline, not policy, so there are of course exceptions. Say Pres Bush had his own blog, I'd be willing to bet that would qualify as a reliable source to backup his statements, whereas blogs are generally not acceptable as sources anywhere else. At the very least, WP:RS recommends noting any admitted bias of your source.</dd>

<dd>To the specific source in question, I don't think it would meet the requirements of WP:RS. The article's author is the editor of Capitol Hill Blue, a site which has the motto "Nobody's life, liberty or property is safe while Congress is in session or the White House is occupied". Clearly the author is incapable of anything but bias when it comes to <i>any</i> President; not just GWB.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Request to Unblock</span></h3>
<p>I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a>, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a> had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a> a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a>, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a> to read it. For if I can be banned from <i>Wikipedia</i> for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.</p>

<p>A few days ago, <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating <i>Wikipedia</i> rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> cannot even stand for <i>Wikipedia</i> readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!</p>
<p>He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at <i>Wikipedia</i> seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (<a href="http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html" class="external free" title="http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html</a>), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (<a href="http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm" class="external free" title="http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm</a>).</p>
<p>Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Gail_Mangum_e379.html" title="Crystal Gail Mangum">Crystal Gail Mangum</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Nifong_7162.html" title="Michael Nifong">Michael Nifong</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Duke_University_lacrosse_team_scandal_df81.html" title="2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal">2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_profiling.html" title="Racial profiling">Racial profiling</a>. I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.</p>
<p>The reason I am making a formal complaint is that <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&amp;redirect=no" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&amp;redirect=no</a>), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.</p>
<p>P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a>, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210">User: Physicq210</a> because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210</a>)</p>
<p>If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (<a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a>’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.</p>
<p>P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot">User: AuburnPilot</a> had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nice polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks. Let me validate my block reason one part at a time. We are not stalking you, and we are not censoring you. We are trying to get to you that <b>you are violating our policies</b>, including <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a>. If you were to discuss your edits, you won't be in this position right now. Don't go around whining to others if you know that you were in the wrong. If you want to add the link, discuss on the article's talk pages first. Don't start stupidly attacking others (as you have done to me and AuburnPilot) for your own mistakes. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 22:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
