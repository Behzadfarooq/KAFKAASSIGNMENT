<p>Just wanted to cross-post the following to make sure you didn't miss it in all the jumble:</p>
<p>Interesting, I guess I sort of suspected that, that "wiped off the map" might not even be a literal translation of what he said. Can you propose and alternate translation of the original Persian into English? Or is his actual comment not availble in Persian? I find it insane that this is not something I've seen discussed in the media, to make a big deal of a particular phrase and not question the translation... --<a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDowcet_5242.html" title="User:Dowcet">Brian Z</a> 05:40, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your further explanation is very interesting. I sort of feel like it should be worked in to the article more directly, but I'm not sure how since it is "original research" in a way. Anyway, thanks! --<a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDowcet_5242.html" title="User:Dowcet">Brian Z</a> 13:05, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I stumbled across the article on <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerzy_Zygmunt_%C5%81o%C5%9B_92ab.html" title="Jerzy Zygmunt Łoś">Jerzy Zygmunt Łoś</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> remarked that the article mentions two different years in which he died, 1996 and 1998. Based on the Polish articles, and some biographies that I found with a quick Google search, I decided that 1998 is probably the correct one, and changed the article accordingly. Could you please check whether I did not make any mistakes?</p>
<p>You list maths as one of your interests on your user page. In that case, have you already come across the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_7ee9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics">WikiProject Mathematics</a>? If not, then perhaps you can have a look, and even add yourself to the list of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_Participants_5bab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Participants">participants</a> if you feel so inclined.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a nice time here, and feel free to ask me any questions on <a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">User talk:Jitse Niesen</a> if it is not clear how things work here (it can be a bewildering place, especially if you're new).

<dd>...his year of death is indeed 1998, but he had a severe stroke in 1996 (which was the main cause of his death in 1998). The wording might have caused some confusion.

<p>Hi Aucaman. Thank you for your message on my talk page regarding <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ecstatic_fc29.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ecstatic">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ecstatic</a>. I would like to point out that whenever I make a vote, I look back at the article 4 or 5 times to consider if any future arguments change my mind. Whilst I don't usually change my mind, perhaps 1 in 10 times I would do so, sometimes due to further research of my own. I understand that the argument put forward there is that, whilst the article should be in Wiktionary ordinarily, Wiktionary already has a very good entry, and hence Transwikify is not relevant. However, I don't think that my changing my vote will make much difference, as what I am saying essentially agrees with you. If I am thinking of delete, I don't think that I will bother to change my vote in that case because the argument that I have is identical to that of the argument put forward for delete - except with different conclusions. However, if I were to change my vote to keep, then that is a different matter. Since there is an article on <a href="../../../e/c/s/Ecstasy.html" title="Ecstasy">ecstasy</a> there is an argument that a properly expanded version of <a href="../../../e/c/s/Ecstatic.html" title="Ecstatic">ecstatic</a> warrants being kept. I am currently seeking advice as to the proper procedure for this kind of thing before changing my vote. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:04, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks for getting in touch. I'm going to continue to disagree with you. I think the Wikifiddler article is just too trivial on its own--my suggestion to merge was my attempt to keep some of the content instead of just deleting it completely. But I think one article documenting criticisms, attacks, whatever, is enough in the article space. Nothing personal, OK? I understand where you're coming from, we just disagree. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 02:44, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! This is about Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wikifiddler, which you messaged me about. I've spent some time thinking this over, and I'm still not convinced it should be kept. The article at its essence is a criticsm of Wikipedia's anti-elitism and its group dynamics, points which are already well-covered in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> article. The Wikifiddler term, while being more specific, does not really add anything more useful to the discussion. I think the only thing right now that would make me change my vote is evidence that the term is in fact in widespread use. Maybe you could clarify your reasons for keeping?</p>
<p>In either case I think an Attacks on Wikipedia article would be a <i>really</i> bad idea - the title is almost inherently POV. It would imply that everything in it is an <i>attack</i> (deliberate attempt to disparage the subject) as opposed to <i>criticism</i> (pointing out flaws with the subject). Well, that's just my $0.02. -- Saikiri<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESaikiri_eb5a.html" title="User talk:Saikiri">~</a> 03:03, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. As you can see from looking at the history of the page, there was a long-running edit-war between two users, RezaKia (<a href="../../../r/e/z/User_talk%7ERezaKia_e4b1.html" title="User talk:RezaKia">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RezaKia_c221.html" title="Special:Contributions/RezaKia">contribs</a>) and an anonymous contributor. It involved gross incivility and extreme POV. I placed two tags on the page to label the page as being disputed. I was not a party to the dispute, and the briefest glance at the history explains it. I was in contact with both parties by email, and it seemed unnecessary to make the point. Perhaps in future you could <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> before labelling people "irresponsible" as you just did on my talk page. A little civility can go a long way. I have indeed removed the tag as it no longer seems necessary. There have been no edits for fifteen days, nor talk-page comments.

<dd>Fair point. I apologise for not putting the note on the talk page. Generally, as a hint, you can find the reason for a POV template in the reversions that immediately precede it...

<p>No problem, and I appreciate the work you've been doing as well to keep everything as neutral as possible, considering the difficulty in attempting to do so. The Khomeini article has been a serious problem in a similar fashion (pro-Khomeinists, anti-Khomeinists, etc.) as I'm sure you've noticed.&#160;;) I'll do what I can in finding sources and such.

<p>I'm not sure you quite understand semi protection and where it's used. There are 2 problems with using semi protection on that article. #1 it's as much of an edit war than vandalism and semi protection should not be used in those cases. And most importantly, semi protection only stops users whose accounts are less than 4 days old. Well, the user you reverted (<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalalarbil_1bfb.html" title="User:Jalalarbil">Jalalarbil</a>) is at 6 days, so semi protection wouldn't have stopped him from posting anyway. And he is not blocked. Same case with Manik666. He is way beyond 4 days and he was reverted as well. And Manik666 was posting before when the article was semi protected, which is why I moved it to full in the first place. Semi protection is just completely inappropriate in this case. I mean if you say it's all vandalism, then semi protection will only stop the anon vandals and that's unfair to the anon vandals. If you claim it's an edit war, then semi protection can't be used at all. So. it has to be full. Sorry. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 16:26, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If your problem is the racist implications of the term "Aryan" then I'm fine with you replacing "Aryan" with "Indo-European" on all the disputed articles as long as you remove the dispute tags and stop vandalizing the Iran-related articles with nonsense like "Persians are a mix of Arabs, Turks and Mongols". You know how offensive that is? That's messing with an entire people's identity.</p>

Think about my compromise proposal untill tomorrow. If you want to carry on with your anti-Iranian campaign then that's fine with me. I have a broken leg and can't go out so I have plenty of time on my hand to pull an "Aucaman" on the Jewish-related articles that interest you, pulling the strawman within the wikipedia rules, just as you do.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 05:42, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Aucaman, I'd like to point out to you that in Iran (aka Land of Aryans), I remember the first day of our history lessons. First page started something like this: "..The aryans migrated to..". Now I remember this perfectly well, from when I was 8. It is just to tell you that it is not a reference to racism, it is where Iranians generally believe we originated from, I am sure you already know this but you are just trying to make problems for Iranian wikipedians. Although It could be the fact than 20th century nationalism has made Aryanism in Iran more popular than it had been since the Sassanid dynasty, I don't know. But I hope you would stop wasting both ours and your own time. All the best - --Kash 21:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

As the page is currently protected I don't really see the point in blocking you for it this time, but when it is returned to free editing I hope you will be more careful to use the talk page and/or seek consensus for your edits, rather than unilaterally reverting more than three times in a 24-hour period.

<ul>
<li>Adding or removing a "disputed" tag is not vandalism. That vandalism is referring to throwing those tags where they clearly don't belong to disrupt Wikipedia, or mass-removing them from articles, not differences of opinion.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, part of my consideration in choosing not to block you was that you believed you were reverting vandalism - just try to be more careful and/or report conflicts through the appropriate channels before getting dragged into a potential 3RR violation yourself.

<dl>
<dd>The ideal situation is that you find another user to examine the situation and determine whether the disputed tag should remain. If they conclude that it should (which they would, if it's being removed without explanation or cause), then the other party will either violate 3RR or the consensus version will win out. The purpose of the 3RR is to prevent people from individually hijacking an article. I do not think you acted horribly inappropriately, but it is not as cut-and-dried a case as it may seem (or as it should be, perhaps).

<p>I'd agree that it is often avoided, partly because of the nasty Nazis, but partly because it just has too many different usages and can lead to confusion. But it is used quite a lot by English speaking Iranians and Indians, and I've seen it used as shorthand by scholars of Indian and Indo-Iranian history when they are writing or speaking in a context in which everyone is aware that there are no Nazi-related connotations. The odd thing is that in British and US culture the word actually stands for "Nordic" a lot of the time. I've seen documentaries on the Nazis in which someone is speaking in German about Nazi ideology. They clearly use the word "Nordish", but this is translated in the subtitle or voice-over as "Aryan". The word Nordic has no negative connotations in English, and is not strongly associated with the Nazis. I assume that's because Nordic was commonly used before Nazism, whereas "Aryan" is a more unusual word in English. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 17:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
