<p>Racists abound on Wikipedia, much to my chagrin, as do quacks and all manner of other proponents of wanton stupidity. If that statement ever prevents me from becoming a bureaucrat, I'll count it as further undeniable proof thereof. People pontificate and pontificate, and usually those who know what they're talking about give up in disgust long before those who clearly haven't the foggiest notion whereof they speak, do so. This can clearly be seen in what is currently going on in the endless moronic discussion on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_Jews_ece3.html" title="Talk:Persian Jews">Talk:Persian Jews</a> where idiots are arguing, with seemingly boundless energy, unfettered by rational thought or the faintest clue what they're talking about, that "Persian Jews" means "Jews who presently live in Iran". I'll look into your request and try to weigh in with a few words of intelligent thought, but I offer no guarantee that they'll be received at all [more likely they'll be completely ignored by the warring ignorami as my input on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_Jews_ece3.html" title="Talk:Persian Jews">Talk:Persian Jews</a> has been...] Cheerfully, but disgustedly, in as good of spirits as that can leave either of us, yours, <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:10, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, it was brought to my attention that you had posted the same message to a large number of user pages regarding the POV dispute on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a>. I will try and explain how these sorts of disputes are usually resolved so that you can better understand the processes we have in place. First the talk page on the individual article is the first place you should go if you have a dispute about something that pertains to that article specifically, as this does. This may sometimes seem slow, as you will very often have to wait a number of days for a full response. This is normal, and you shouldn't escalate the situation just because no one responds in a few hours for example.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with an article that gets little or no attention, or you are in an argument that you think needs a few more voices use <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>. This is a centralized place for people to see situations that might need further input. The point of both of these processes is to have the information on the page in which it is most relevant. While it might seem like a fast solution to leave a message on 50 people's talk page, it's not looked upon well by the community because it decentralizes the discussion to which everyone might want to be a contributor. For example what if 30 of those people start having conversations with you on their talk page, that quickly becomes unmanageable. I hope I have explained the reasoning behind how these things are usually done. I'm going to go ahead and revert the messages, you should probably list your arguments on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_people_3f82.html" title="Talk:Persian people">Talk:Persian people</a> if you haven't already. If you want to read more about it have a look at <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#Internal_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">the spamming page</a>.

Let me count them for you: 1, 2, 3,.... Oh, sorry, <b>ZERO. No one showed up!</b> This was probably a month ago, so don't tell me I haven't been patient with the system. So much for the well-advertized RfC mechanism. It's quiet genius.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "spamming" these people, I was trying to get people to take a look at the page and maybe get involved. Even if these messages would later turn into discussions, I don't see how that's not healthy thing. You're telling me that I'm not supposed to be having private discussions with anyone outside a particular talk page because that would somehow "decentralize" the discussion?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only argument left is that I've been messaging too many people, in which I case I'd like to know why you've reverted <i><b>all</b></i> my messages. Was my first message to <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApoivre_4ada.html" title="User:Apoivre">User:Apoivre</a> inappropriate? If yes, why? If no, then why was it reverted?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At some point you have to admit you just helped these users keep their POV version of the article by blindly reverting all my messages without much thought. The least you could have done was to discuss this with me before trying to enforce something that doesn't even appear to be Wikipedia policy. In fact, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#Internal_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">the link you sent me</a> seems to only be a guideline on <i><b>how</b></i> this should be done, not whether or not it's appropriate.</dd>

<dd>"Spamming" is still the term applied when you message a large amount of users about a topic, and that goes double when you tell them what side of the issue they should be on. This is even more of a serious situation considering that you're currently under an Arbcom injunction against reverting and this could be seen as an attempt to circumvent process. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 16:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I consider what Aucaman has done appropriate, as he could have used emailing function, and no one could prevent that or revert it!. In effect by preventing Aucaman from using talk pages you are promoting email spams, which is more difficult to monitor.

<dd>No, what Aucaman is doing is contacting people who have demonstrated an interest in the subject in the past...that's quite outside the realm of spamming, which consists of contacting large numbers of people <i>willynilly</i> for some singular purpose. What <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a> has done, on the other hand, amounts to blatantly attempting to censor Aucaman's views by poorly concealing Aucaman's attempts to elicit outside commentary without his [Aucaman's] going to the trouble of filing an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RfC</a>, and rampant vandalism of multiple user_talk pages. I've rolled back a number of cohesion's rollbacks, but I don't have time to do all of them (and would encourage cohesion to do so himself). In the future, I would encourage cohesion to argue his points on the talk pages of disputed articles and if unable to reach consensus, use the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> system (that's what it's there for). Don't go around deleting other editors' posts from talk pages, nor from user_talk pages.

<dd>I'm sorry if it appeared that I am trying to censor his views, I actually have no idea what his views are. I was contacted by an arbitrator regarding this mass spamming of talk pages, and after some discussion with others it was decided that reverting the messages would be the best action. It was felt that otherwise this spamming would be rewarded despite its being against some guidelines, and possibly some interpretations of his Arbcom injunction. It is not appropriate to argue "my point" on the disputed article's talk page because I have no opinion about any argument on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a> nor do I even know what is being argued. I don't want to sound like I have no opinion about spamming talk pages, because I do, and I think they are made clear above, what I have no opinion on is the POV dispute on that article. - <b><a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a></b> 04:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I've said elsewhere, the fact that you rolled back Aucaman's attempts to elicit discussion are the problem, ... Aucaman is under an ArbCom admonition to avoid <i>reverting</i>, <b>not</b> to avoid seeking others' opinions. The fact that you admit that you don't know what his "side" is, nor anything whatsoever about the issue under consideration, further supports my assertions elsewhere that your blind rollbacks were completely inappropriate. User:Inshanee's protestations about standing ArbCom decisions, or about the definition of "spamming", are, in this case, completely irrelevant and inappropriate. What you have done, whether or not you intended it, is to stifle open discourse on a contentious subject by singling out an editor who has raised quite valid objections to the course an article is taking. The fact that you claim "neutrality" by your profession of complete ignorance regarding the issues in dispute speaks <i>negatively</i> of you, not positively as you appear to imagine. Don't get me wrong, if Aucaman <i>had</i> actually engaged in something that could legitimately be described as "spamming", I'd be supporting you, without any illbegotten legitimacy the pathetic <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> the imagined infraction of his ArbCom injunction might garner. I'm not prone to stand up for people who shout "admin abuse" and the like, but Cohesion's actions, and Inshanee's defense thereof, are gross abbrogations of WP's inner workings, including <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>. What the two of you have done is to unnecessarily involve yourself in an editor's interaction w/ his fellow editors by inappropriately imagining offenses on his part, and then seeking to trample him with misinterpretations of his actions and misappropriated claims of infractions against <i>guidelines</i>. The more I think about this, the more disgusted I'm becoming with both of you, and the more I wish you were equally becoming disgusted with your own misbehavior. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:37, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True enough, but as I said above, that's not what happened here.

<dd>Seeking input is not "vote stacking", nor can it be so considered, of <i>any</i> sort, <i><b>especially</b></i> when there's no voting going on! For the record, the following is the message Aucaman left on a number of users' talk pages:
<dl>
<dd>Could you take a look at the first sentence in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html#History" title="Persian people">this section</a>? It claims that Persians are descendants of some "Aryan tribes" migrating from Central Asia. Sounds like outdated racial theories to me. The same source (Britannica) says Persians are of mixed ancentry, but when I try to add this in people remove it. I don't think this is consistent with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Could you take a look at this and leave a comment?

<dd>No voting. No POV-pushing. And InShaneee's repetition of the mantra that the "proper proceedure [sic] is simply to list it on RfC" indicates that InShaneee, at the very least, <i>still</i> hasn't bothered to take the time to read what Aucaman's been saying all along: it's already <i>been</i> listed on RfC, and <b>nobody</b> showed up to comment.

<dd>Talk page spamming is a VERY clear policy, and one that will be enforced if need be. Again, if you have a problem with the RfC system, take it up with the policymakers. There is NO excuse for circumventing process. Aucaman, if they keep reverting it, then take it to the talk page and ask why they take issue with it. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 02:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>InShaneee, that comment is clearly a veiled threat. Not only is it completely inappropriate because of that simple fact, but it's at least <i>doubly</i> inappropriate <b>because nothing approaching the definition of "spamming" has occurred here</b>.

<dd>It's not a threat, just a warning, and a very strong one, as I want to make sure that you aren't confusing Aucaman about policy. Just so both of you are very clear: messaging a large group of users to come and do something on a page is considered spamming. Period. This is a very clear violation of policy, and a user can be blocked for it if they continue to do it. You're free to disagree with the policy, but unless its changed anytime soon, that is how it will be enforced. I'd also appreciate it if you kept the personal attacks to yourself. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 16:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>InShaneee, while I wouldn't necessarily disagree if such a policy existed, I must point out that the guidelines at <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html#Internal_spamming" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam#Internal spamming</a> quite explicitly say that it doesn't. And last time it was discussed there on the talk page, there was clearly not a consensus to change it to something stricter. If you feel strongly that such a policy should exist (or that it does indeed exist in an unwritten form, if there is such a thing on Wikipedia), then the right thing seems for <i>you</i> to take it up with the policy-makers and change that page. Until then, Tomer's word (as an admin) about what is or what isn't policy is as good as yours, so please be a bit more careful with making overly authoritarian-sounding pronouncments. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 19:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't 'explicitly' say there isn't a policy, it just says there isn't a clear one set in stone yet. It DOES make clear that it's a bad idea, and there IS a policy that says vote stacking in any sort of context is forbidden. Here's the bottom line: if Aucaman starts spamming other users again, he will be blocked, and if Tomer disagrees, he's free to list the incident on AN:I to get a wider opinion of my decision. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>InShaneee, you persist in misrepresenting things...not only are you presenting a guideline as though it were a policy, you're accusing Aucaman of instructing people on what to do on an article, as well as of vote stacking. If you'd take half the time you spend making these fallacious statements and spend it actually looking into what has happened, you wouldn't be saying the things you are, unless your reason for doing so is in order to avoid admitting that you have erred, eggregiously. There is no vote, so there can be no "vote stacking". Aucaman didn't tell anyone what to do, he requested input from other editors. Simplest way to say it is simply this: You are <b>wrong</b>, and until you demonstrate that you've actually taken the time to examine the facts of the case, <i>nothing</i> you say is of any relevance to this incident in particular. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 01:53, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am one of the recipients of these messages. I'm guessing it's because I've edited some pages on ethnic groups (though no specific reason was given, so it's hard to tell). I don't believe that Aucaman should have dropped this message on a whole lot of people's talk pages: Firstly, the message itself is biased, and intended to bias the reader, and secondly, the link is to the page itself, not to a discussion. I think that a brief, unbiased mention of the RfC page, would have been far more appropriate. -<a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierano_5149.html" title="User:Kierano">Kieran</a> 11:12, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am with you. Saying Persians "are descendents of Aryans" is POV since there are lots of Jews, Kurds, Arabs that are 100% Iranian. We should not write a sentence that excludes other groups of Iranian. I see the article is locked otherwise I would have removed the word "descendents" from there. I have seen lots of injustice on the minority groups through history in Iran which I can do nothing about but here at least in wikipedia I maybe able to do something.

<p>"Dhimmis were guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, in return for paying a special capitation tax known as the <i><a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizya.html" title="Jizya">jizya</a></i> and accepting various restrictions and legal disabilities. "</p>

<p>Section title "==== Aleged Humiliation of dhimmis====" vs "==== Humiliation of dhimmis===="</p>
<p>The sub-titles should not pursuade the reader to any position as the title of the articles should not. Readers can read the text and end up in whatever conclusion they want.</p>
<p>I added the fact tag was added to "Islamic law stipulates that dhimmis must be belittled for their rejection of Islam; humiliating them was an act of piety, a fulfillment of divine will" since it talks about "Islamic Law". We have 5 schools of Islamic Laws. This sentence is general and unreferenced.</p>

<p>I saw your comment at Node's userpage and I took a look at the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a> article myself. I think it would be best to say "the <i>linguistic</i> descendants of..." etc. We don't have enough DNA evidence yet, but I would guess the bulk of the people in the area descended from people who arrived in earlier migrations: there was probably a significant <i>volkwanderung</i> that left its own DNA signature, but the primary contribution of the Indo-Aryan migrants was <i>language</i> and <i>culture</i> not physical features. It's not an "outdated racist" theory to think otherwise, however - it's just racist. The debate has been going on sometime - I'll reproduce one of the quotes from my userpage here:</p>

<p>As you may have gathered, discussions have been raging for about a week on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WT%7EESP_1b68.html" title="WT:ESP">the <i>Esperanza</i> talk page</a> as to the future direction of Esperanza. Some of these are still ongoing and warrant more input (such as the idea to scrap the members list altogether). However, some decisions have been made and the charter has hence been amended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" rel="nofollow">See what happened</a>. Basically, the whole leadership has had a reshuffle, so please review the new, improved charter.</p>
<p>As a result, we are electing 4 people this month. They will replace <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> and form a new tranche A, serving until December. Elections will begin on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">07-02</a> and last until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">07-09</a>.

<td style="color:#000">Here in Wikipedia there are hundreds of wikipedians whose work and efforts go unappreciated. One occasionally comes across editors who have thousands of good edits, but because they may not get around as much as others, their contributions and hard work often go unnoticed. As Esperanzians we can help to make people feel appreciated, be it by some kind words or the awarding of a Barnstar. This is where the Barnstar Brigade comes in. The object of this program is to seek out the people which deserve a Barnstar, and help them feel appreciated. With your help, we can recognize more dedicated editors!</td>
