<p>Two edits of yours have been brought to my attention that I wanted to comment about. First of all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Persian_people&amp;diff=44822620&amp;oldid=44805205" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Persian_people&amp;diff=44822620&amp;oldid=44805205" rel="nofollow">this</a> is quite innapropriate. If you believe that a user's claims are without base, simply ask them to source it, or something else more civil. Secondly, please be careful when you edit discussions as you did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Persian_people&amp;diff=44922145&amp;oldid=44921558" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Persian_people&amp;diff=44922145&amp;oldid=44921558" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It seems fairly clear that you did not capture the full discussion under the title you placed, which could confuse new users trying to enter the discussion, and can sometimes seem to present a biased view of things. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:22, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for the first part, yes, it is innapropriate to accuse someone of 'making something up'. You said on my talk page that you accused him of not having any sources for what he was suggesting. THAT would have been more appropriate, as that is more along the lines of assuming good faith. As for the second part, it's not at all unusual for users to jump into a debate they were previously uninvolved with, and it's usually best to leave a comment next to the comment it's responding to for clarity. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:36, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I have several times read the article <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> since long ago, but because it is not a wel-formed article I could not still understand how it defines Aryans! Maybe it lacks a clear definition of Aryan (or maybe I clould not find it). If we want to solve the problems in articles related to peoples who are considered to be linguistic decendants of those so-called Aryans, we should first have a clear definition of Aryan which by some people is thought to be ethnic ancestor of modern IE speakers.

<dd>The idea of the Aryans as the ancestors of modern Indogermanic speakers is an outdated conceit that owed primarily to the Aryan origins of the science of comparative philology. The ancestors of the modern Indogermanic culture are more accurately known as the Indogermans, the Protoindoeuropeans, the Caucasians, or the Kurgan People. The first two are falling out of favour because of their complexity and also because of their connotations with modern Europe. The Caucasians is also falling out of use because of the common, although inaccurate, usage of the word to mean "European" in general. Many linguists are turning to the coinage <b>Kurgan People</b> in order to avoid these problems. The Aryans or Protaryans are now specificly considered as a branch of the Kurgan People that migrated from a very early time out of Caucasia to the east, and established the foundations of the Indopersic culture. As such, the Aryans would be most closely related to the Anatolians, with a more distant relationship to the Sclavons and the Hellenes, but their relationship with the Germans, Celts, or Itali would be very, very distant, and certainly not that of cultural ancestor. Also, the Western branches have mixed very heavily with non-Indogerman races and cultures, thoroughly dividing them racially from the ancient Kurgan peoples and by extension from the Eastern branches. Note that some anthropologists object to the use of the term Kurgan Peoples, claiming a lack of evidence that the Kurgan excavations are related to the Protoindoeuropeans.207.118.94.190 20:29, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aucaman, I had some rather heated exchanges with JoTurner when he first arrived on WP. He seemed to me to be extremely devout and prone to take offense. He has mellowed a lot, and quickly too. I get the feeling that he's a smart kid, somewhat out of sync with his environment, and that conversion to Islam was both a benign sort of adolescent rebellion, and a way to just be a PERSON, without having to be "African-American". WP gives him a way to be a "citizen of the world" as well, and a place to feel effective regardless of age. Some of our best Wikipedians are young. Given that he's young, and changing and growing fast, I'd just like him to have more time to settle. That's all. I don't think a few months is enough time to get a full understanding of how things work here. But if he gets the adminship -- well, I expect it will turn out OK. I'm not horrified by the prospect. I don't think you need to change your vote. That was your gut feeling and you should stick by it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 14:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The IPA character that accurately transliterates the Hebrew letter צ is the affricate ligature <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʦ/</span>. This symbol, however, is absent from many fonts, and so a bridge may be used instead, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t͡s/</span>. The use of simple <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ts/</span> is incorrect because the pronunciation of the plosive followed by the fricative is very different from the pronunciation of the affricate itself. This is very obvious in German where the two sounds, both <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t͡s/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ts/</span>, are often found side by side, and are pronounced clearly differently. <i>Confer</i> <b>nichts</b> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/nɪçts/</span> and <b>jetzt</b> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/jɛt͡st/</span>.</p>
<p>Note that this sound is written in Rumanian by <b>ţ</b>, t with subscript comma; and in the Slavic languages by <b>c</b>. In Old English and Old German orthography, <b>z</b> was used when this sound occurred.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Mōšeh Qaṣāv</b> would be the transliteration I'd use. Gemination, as I understand it, is no longer pronounced in Hebrew, and the few times that it actually matters, it functions a sort of orthographic technique that has no purpose in Romanised Hebrew. As such, I see no reason that gemination should be transliterated. In the case of letters like ב and פ, I suggest transliterating them as b/v or p/f according to how they are pronounced in context, leaving gemination untransliterated. The IPA symbol for gemination, when it is pronounced, is the same as the symbol for length, <i>id est</i>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ː/</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>ş</b> represents the sound <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʃ/</span> in the languages in which it occurs. <b>ș</b>, s with comma, is a Romanian letter used for that sound also. The only other suggestions than the one above that I could give would be <b>Qatzāv</b> or <b>Qatsāv</b>. 207.118.94.190 20:16, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for me, the Persian Yahoodies are only peripheral to my sphere of interest, but my suggestion for a neutral text would be to simply state that the ancient Hebrews have had such a long history with the Persian people and their state(s) (many centuries longer than the Arabs, Mongols or the various Turkic peoples) that their cultures are to some extent intertwined in both Iran and Central Asia. <i><font color="#990011">//</font> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a></i> <b><font color="#990011">•</font></b> <small><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Adamsky_1d8f.html" title="User talk:Big Adamsky">BA's talk page</a></small> 15:10, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I just looked at what you call my first revert and it appears that I replaced the {{<a href="../../../t/o/t/Template%7ETotallydisputed_3989.html" title="Template:Totallydisputed">totallydisputed</a>}} tag with a {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDispute_9fd8.html" title="Template:Dispute">dispute</a>}} tag. I don't think these are the same. User Khoikhoi was not participating in the talks (and he did not give ANY explanation for removing the tag), so I thought he was removing the tag because he believed the article was neutral. I'm not asking you to unblock me, but it would be nice to know the reasoning involved in calling this a revert. As far as I know, the totallydisputed tag carries more weight than a disputed tag, so I was indeed considering Khoikhoi's revert when making that edit. If I wanted to revert, I could have just replaced the totallydisputed tag with a totallydisputed tag. This doesn't count as a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revert.html" title="Revert">revert</a> under the definition given there.</p>
<p>Could you also (before you even reply to me) report (or deal with) <b><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a>'s violation of 3RR at the same time</b>?

<p>It's not an offense per se, Aucaman, but it's considered rather rude to remove messages, even angry ones, from your talk page. If you want to come out of the arbitration smelling like a rose, you are going to have to make an effort at good behavior. That means watching your reverts, not removing messages, and generally putting the means ahead of the ends. It's OK to "lose" if you're behaving correctly and the other users aren't. Eventually it will work out. Sometimes it takes months, but it does work out. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:30, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it's not fair. But if you bug admins too much re single offenses, they're going to tune you out. This place is just too big, and there are too few admins on duty, to ensure strict justice in every case. But as I said to Ahwaz, if you're patient, and keep track of a string of offenses, a pattern of misbehavior is eventually going to get someone censured or banned.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm not preaching at you from a position of total irreproachability. I just went over 3RR in the <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakir_Naik_b802.html" title="Zakir Naik">Zakir Naik</a> article, and reported myself to an admin&#160;:/ I was so pissed off I lost track.

<dd>I wouldn't classify this as a serious personal attack, and I would not certainly block you for this. But than I have to deal with a user who throws ephitets about others being trolls or vandals every day, so I might have grown thick skinned about this. If another admin reads this and ponders unblocking you, I would throw my weight behind unblocking you, but I don't want to do it just based on my judgement.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 05:34, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comment. I think <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> has made this a little too personal and I'm not even sure why. This is part of a broader content dispute and he has made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Hurriyya_notice_board" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Hurriyya_notice_board" rel="nofollow">some statements</a> that can only be interpreted as taking sides due to clear misunderstandings (the users initiating that page are not Iranians, but, on the contrary, are minority groups - so he's reading the whole thing completely backward). I'm not sure what I might have done to deserve this, but he tried to warn me against attacking the same user before but I did not think of it as an attack and gave a full explanation as to why. No matter what happens here I'm going to be filing an RfC demanding an investigation into this. It looks to me like this user has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3AMolobo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3AMolobo" rel="nofollow">history</a> of blocking people for unnecessary reasons. Like I said this is unacceptable. I called that person a troll because he was indeed using provocative language (pointing me out by name and then asking me to "review <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>" for making an edit he doesn't like), and I did not threaten him with a block - I was referring to his block on <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ASouthernComfort" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ASouthernComfort" rel="nofollow">violating 3RR</a>. This is unacceptable. I'm the one who should be complaining about this, but instead I'm blocked? I'm not sure how else I should have responded to this user without condemning some of the stuff he'd said. How should I get more people to take a look at this and comment? <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>Auca</b></a><a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_Esperanza_ced6.html" title="User:Aucaman/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>m</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>an</b></a><sup><a href="../../../a/u/c/User_talk%7EAucaman_2cc1.html" title="User talk:Aucaman">Talk</a></sup> 06:03, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first step on what to do is not to continue calling other users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=46015386&amp;oldid=46014081" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;diff=46015386&amp;oldid=46014081" rel="nofollow">trolls</a> after you were just blocked for that. Considering how blatant and flagrant this violation is, consider it a courtesy that I'm warning you at all before reblocking you, this time for a longer period.

<p>Well maybe you should learn to leave people alone when they don't want to be bothered. In any case if there was any advice in this I'll try to figure it out and maybe learn something from it. I'm not going to bother giving you any personal advice, but maybe you should reconsider you whole approach to editing this Wikipedia. From what I see a lot of people seem to write stuff that are in violation to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and somewhat controversial, and, when called on it, would try to find (ad hoc) sources that back-up their claims. This is not the best way to write articles. You should <b>read the sources first</b> then make edits, not the other way around. It has caused a lot of problems, and I'm sure you agree with me on this. And don't worry about calling me "anti-Iranian". I'm sure it's been a misunderstanding. I'm Iranian myself and most of the people I hang out with are Iranian. I only brought it up because you seemed to be implying that <b>I</b> was the one violating the policies. I don't think calling a troll a troll deserves blockage and I'll make sure this is dealt with. <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>Auca</b></a><a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_Esperanza_ced6.html" title="User:Aucaman/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>m</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>an</b></a><sup><a href="../../../a/u/c/User_talk%7EAucaman_2cc1.html" title="User talk:Aucaman">Talk</a></sup> 14:50, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are welcome, the better sourced the information the better it sticks. When people revert stuff it is usually a sign that the source that was provided was weak enough to be successfully challenged by a dissenter. The cure is to find better sources that meet the peer review test. That is the challenge of wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 04:37, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You say that Aryan is synonomous with Iranian. For that matter, North Indians are Iranian people? Would you call the Bengalis, an Iranian people. They are Aryan after all. I would like to make the correction that Aryan signifies the Indo-Iranian branch itself and that Iranians are just a branch of the Aryan people, not the entire Aryan people itself. The Aryan people includes the equally prominent Indo-Aryans in addition to the Nurestanis. -<a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">User: Afghan Historian</a></p>

<p>i read your reply about persian jews. I agree with what you are saying considering i have done my homework and read about persian jews. i also think that the term persian can be applied to people that also live in other countries and dont speak persian. because people did move around and may have lost their mother tongue to assilimilate into new cultures. what do you think about that? you can see this with some people in pakistan and india and probably other countries because the genetics and characteristics still remain to this day.</p>

<p>Hi. I am sorry to bother you but I wondered if you might be prepared to take another look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_TigerShark_7622.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/TigerShark">my RfA nomination</a>. The main reason that I ask this is because there has previously been some confusion as to my talk count and I also wonder if there might have been some confusion regarding the duration of my contributions. I would also like to comment on some of the concerns raised by others, which I have discussed on the nomination page, but which you may not be aware of.</p>
<p>Firstly with regard to my talk contributions and the duration of my contributions. I just wanted to clarify that I do have substantial numbers of contributions in the user talk namespace although significantly less in the main article and wikipedia talk namespace, so I do have a good history of interactions with other users but primarily on their user page (furthermore I have a good track record of warning vandals - something is often lacking for many vandal fighters both admin and non-admin). Regarding the duration of my contributions, I just wanted to clarify that I have now been contributing for 15 months in total and, although I have had a few "lean" months when my focus have been outside of Wikipedia, I had almost 2000 contributions before February and there have been 9 months when I have made 100+ contributions.</p>
<p>WIth regards to the concerns raised by other, which aren't covered by the above, they seem to relate primarily to my lack of contributions to the article talk and wikipedia talk namespaces and what this says about my community involvement and exposure to process. Firstly I would like to say that I don't think my contributions in this area are particularly low when compared to other current nominees and recently created admins who are/were heavily supported (I have provided some details on this in the comments section of the nomination) - as I said in the comments section this is not to say "they are supported so why aren't I", rather it is just to provide a benchmark to compare how common my contribution pattern is. Secondly I would like to point out that I do not typically revert vandalism in these namespaces which I believe play a significant part in the number of these contributions for vandal-fighter editors (especially in the article talk namespace). Finally I would just like to reiterate my personal opinion that, regarding edits to Wikipedia talk, contributing and understanding are different things (i.e. I do understand the policys and guidelines even though I have not actively contributed to them). With regard to my community involvement, I do have a fair number of edits to the mian Wikipedia namespace and also the user talk namespace as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>I understand that contacting you in this way may well be considered "campaigning" but I want to assure you that I am driven by good practical intentions rather than ego. As you will be aware, I am primarily a vandal fighter and I feel that the admin tools will allow me to far better serve the community in this area. Specifically I come across a lot of situations were there are very few editors on RC patrol and a lot of vandalism is being missed, this is compounded by the fact that AIAV is often not being heavily monitored during the same periods meaning that blocks are delayed and a lot of time is spent reverting vandals who have already received a final warning. This extra time spent reverting known vandals obviously mean that much new vandalism is missed - with the obvious effect on the quality and credibility of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I would like to sum by saying that I feel I could make good use of the tools and that I have never done anything to raise concerns that I would misuse them. Cheers <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 20:56, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is my personal opinion and I could be wrong and if I am a beg your pardon, but I think the problem in the Persian Jew article is because of you. Yes, I think it has originated as a means to balance what is percieved as your attacks on other articles. No offense, but you have a share in the blame. It is a shame that people have to go to such a level to counter or defend what the beleive is a worthy cause. This is why i asked you to reform yourselves. Persian Jews are now being victimized and things that need not be mentioned are being pushed. You see for every action there is a reaction. I will defend the truth and guard that article. I hope it is not in vain with other user:Diyakos or user:Acumans. Like I said this is a sad matter, but there is also a lesson to be learned. I ask you now to clear your slate and coperate with myself and other editors to achieve a feeling of community and understanding. If we can all put aside our differences as individuals that is a step closer to a juster world society. We can notspread propaganda, becuase beleive me it is minute but has a share to play in strife. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.196.139.250.html" title="User:69.196.139.250">69.196.139.250</a> 01:32, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
