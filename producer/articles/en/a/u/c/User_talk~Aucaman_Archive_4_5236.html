<h2><span class="mw-headline">I'm being scolded for incivility</span></h2>
<p>Inshanee seems to consider it a personal attack to call another user Iranian, or an Iranian nationalist.</p>
<p>I see no evidence that he's scolding anyone on the Iranian side for personal attacks, even when they consist of accusations like "racist" or "Zionist".</p>
<p>I don't quite understand why he's taking the tack that he is. He seems sincere and well-meaning. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:01, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding incivility, I was told off by Inshanee for calling the Iranian Wikipedians a "gang". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:InShaneee#User:Ahwaz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:InShaneee#User:Ahwaz" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Fair enough, perhaps. But when I reported this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arabs_of_Khuzestan&amp;curid=1903827&amp;diff=46154909&amp;oldid=45915282" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arabs_of_Khuzestan&amp;curid=1903827&amp;diff=46154909&amp;oldid=45915282" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and publicised its contents so that at least three admins could see it (including on Inshanee's talk page), it was ignored and not even a warning was given to the author. I do not believe that Inshanee is as sincere and well-meaning as Zora says. The consequence of this blatant unfairness (and perhaps sympathy for the racists) by the admins is that people are quitting or suspending their involvement in Wikipedia, including Inahet, who has never had a warning from an admin and always avoided conflict <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AInahet&amp;diff=46564354&amp;oldid=45897081" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AInahet&amp;diff=46564354&amp;oldid=45897081" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and me. A lot of Xebat/Diyako's anger - which led to a one month ban - is precisely due to the failure of admins to respond to bad behaviour by those who can only be described as Persian chauvinists. Wikipedia is a bad joke and either the organisation has to change or content will not be taken seriously. If you don't like this comment here, Aucaman, because it may compromise the ridiculous kangaroo court trial set up against you, then please delete it or move it to my talk page.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 06:44, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for Zora, I am amazed at her calmness in the face of provocation, for in my mind she has received the worst treatment by some editors and has not responded in kind. However, I'm not convinced by her conviction that sitting tight and working within the rules actually works, when those with the power act unfairly. There are laws in Iran granting equality to all before the law and freedom of speech, but operating within the law to express your opinion never works. The only solution when the powerful and corrupt is to oppose them and their system. The same goes for Wikipedia. The system is outrageously unfair and the rules do not work, so the only answer is confrontation. Perhaps in America, where people are free (except in Guatanamo), this seems odd, but when you see the powerful behave badly then you can understand that no rule or law can ever bring them to account. Opposition is the only way.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 07:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We tried but the system is against us, what can we do?

Sadly, these editors often leave the project. As Esperanzians, we can help to make people feel appreciated, be it by some kind words or the awarding of a Barnstar. A project the size of Wikipedia has thousands of editors, so there are plenty of people out there who deserve recognition, one just has to find them.

<p>Here is a direct quote from you to user:Pecher; <b>I've added some stuff about Khomeini's views on non-Muslims, but people might try to take them out. Could you keep an eye on that article as well? AucamanTalk 14:02, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</b> This is verified on user:Pecher's talk page.</p>
<p>What is all the interest you and Pecher have on Khoeimini and other Iranian clerics. Also your articles on Ahmadenajid all show a disturbing trend that you are trying to paint some sort of picture. It is like connect the dots.</p>
<p>Here are a list of articles you have worked on;</p>
<ul>
<li>Human rights abuses by the Iraqi insurgency</li>
<li>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel</li>
<li>Controversies surrounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</li>

<p>Wow human rights abuses in the Iraqi insurgency! Very odd and specific topic! Ahmadinejad and Israel! The Mohammed cartoons. All your edits really benefit in making Israel look good compared to the rest of the Middle East. Answer me this are you an Israeli citizen too? I think you are on an agenda. All your edits against Iranians (from Kurds to Persians,etc.) since Iran is seen as the biggest threat to Israel and all your other edits in the Arab fields. Also trying being a force in tension between Arab and Iranian and Turkish editors. All at the benefit of Israel.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources for editing...</span></h2>
<p>Hello Aucaman, I have tried to site primary referrences within the text I wrote, (I didn't finish it yet though). The Torah itself (in specific the books of Exodus and Joshua) are the primary references I am referring to. There is nothing creative there only assemblying info which is contained in other Wiki sources as well, as you can see I link my text to many other Wiki sources.</p>
<p>The purpose for editing the existing article:: I think the present article only referrs to the effects of anti-Semitism through history. I think its necessary, in any encyclopeadic reference not only to consider effects but cuases as well... to try and list the causes of the subject under consideration, in this case causes of the problem of anti-Semitism which includes those on both sides of the argument, as the objective case tends toward the balance of opinions. The article as it stands only describes the effects of anti-Semitism not concidering its geneology. Xeno-phobia is cause I am identifying in the article, Xeno-phobia which exists on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>I hope you don't completely delete everything I write as others do without explaining your deletion. I have sighted concrete primary resources and not aim at mis-informing anyone. But you can be the judge. If you wish I could sight exact passages from the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> where it is written that anyone who is caught praying to a God other than that of the God of Isreal should be burned etc...this certainly has been a cause of anti-Semitism although I do not want to sight this text directly as it would certainly be unhealthy and inflamitory even though it is best to give a direct sitation of the facts...anyways... sincerely, -p Paul diffenderfer 22:02, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Armenians are people who migrated to Iran recently. Their origin, is unrelated to Persian people's artilce.

<p>Hello Aucaman. That was nice of you to leave that welcoming message, thanks. I'm still learning about Wikipedia, but I think the links at the bottom of the Mizrahim article should be enough for reference material. I also added a new link. I think there are some books in English, but I don't have any. I will try to find something good. It would be better also if the article was called "Mizrahim" instead of "Mizrahi Jews". "Mizrahi Jews" doesn't really make sense since "Mizrahim" is already a Jewish term.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean about my edit on Beverly Hills. I removed it because it looked like the person who added that sentence wants to say that Iranians are classed by the government as "white" but really are not "whites". I've seen people talk like that about Jews and Italians too. I read the other article you gave the link to on Persian people and some of the talk page but I'm not sure what you mean about a "new trend" because it just says that the Aryans were ancestors of Persians. If they're writing that Aryans were also ancestors of Germans, then there is a problem. I found an article (<a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_race.html" title="Aryan race">Aryan race</a>) about that so you could write there that Aryans were ancestors of Persians, but not Europeans to make sure that there is nothing else going on.</p>
<p>From what I am reading it looks like a problem similar to the issue of Mizrahi and you could fix it by finding an exact definition of "Persian" because there are Persians who are only Persian-speakers. Do you know what I mean? They speak Persian, but their ancestors were not Persian. I don't know how true that is but I can tell you that in Los Angeles all Iranians call themselves "Persian" even people who are of different ethnicity. Yairzohar 01:52, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to your comment</span></h2>
<p>Dear Aucaman, I was a bystander during last few months watching your edits and other Kurdish wikipedians' edits and associated discussions, without interfereing. I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes. I voted and I take the responsibility for it. If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups. National heros, prophets, Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them. Besides, you are by no means an expert on these issues. About your alleged ethnicity, it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd, Iranian or Russian. You need to revise your views. If you were persian, you would need an even more extensive revision. This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESina_Kardar_7950.html" title="User:Sina Kardar">Sina Kardar</a>16:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.57.230.179.html" title="User:72.57.230.179">72.57.230.179</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.57.230.179.html" title="User talk:72.57.230.179">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.57.230.179_181b.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.57.230.179">contribs</a>).</small></p>

All your edits against Iranians (from Kurds to Persians,etc.) since Iran is seen as the biggest threat to Israel and all your other edits in the Arab fields. Also trying being a force in tension between Arab and Iranian and Turkish editors.

<dd>I agree that the image is not sourced, however, to maintain some neutrality I prefer to deal with images within the normal process, unless they are exceptional enough that I think they may not be handled correctly. The collage image was an example of that. This is a simple "no source" image that I didn't find through any editing of my own, so I hesitate to tag it when you could just as easily, and in a more legitimate way, since you are working on the article.

<dd>I was actually putting back the genetics section, but I think the article link has merit as it's an academic work and refers to the Iranian peoples regardless of whether the focus is on the Kurds or not. The 2nd source, I agree, is indeed about Iran and not the Iranian peoples and I will delete it as it lacks relevance. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 17:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nuclear program of Iran</span></h2>
<p>Hello. Could you have a look at this? <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_program_of_Iran_8b75.html#Zbigniew_Brzezinski" title="Nuclear program of Iran">Nuclear_program_of_Iran#Zbigniew_Brzezinski</a>, <i>However, the President of Iran recently called for Israel to be "wiped off the map" [31]</i>. I suppose it's simplification and some changes might be made, to make it more factual. I think i could do it. But i don't know farsi, so can't refer to the original text. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 11:34, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Based on that, you can't really use my translation.</i> Okay; give me a farsi-english dictionary&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>I will say you more, most of Russian news agencies also said <i>that he has asked for Israel to be "wiped off the map"</i>. I think they just translated it from english.</dd>
<dd>Actually, I can't do much. E.g., look at the sentence <i>Iranian missiles have banners on parades saying, "Israel should be wiped off the map", "We will trample America under our feet", "Death to America", and "Death to Israel"</i>. How can I verify it? I even doubt that you can, coz you surely aren't an officeer serving at Iranian missile base. But after all, this sentence seems to be a weak argument; Soviet posters about U.S. were also not peaceful...</dd>
<dd>Ask me, if you'll need help with recent events in Russia or with physics (esp. theory of relativity). <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 06:52, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really, thank you. I stopped when didn't find letter " ك " at that keyboard. My knowledge of farsi is zero, but I thought, that I'll at least be able to translate words alone. (Of course, not to actually check your translation, but wanted to show that it could be done by just everybody. May be, was wrong.)</dd>
<dd>What about "reciting <i><b>every day</b></i>"... Yeah, think it's too "tough". In my school, I had <i><b>no</b></i> patriotical upbringing -- except may be somehow patriotic view of World War 2.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, may be just saying "Death to Israel" and "Death to America" doesn't indicate intention to begin war... It's just ultra-patriotic upbringing.<a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 16:28, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you, but there is no need in word-to-word translation. Could you better say me where is that key situated on keyboard? I don't have a purpose to really check your translation. (For me is enough, that a translation similar to yours was published somewhere in the net.) May be, just "for fun" for myself.</dd>
<dd><i>But there are a few who actually believe in what they say and are almost willing to die for it</i> Yes, such actions of Iranian government are quite unbeautiful. In such an age a person often thinks the sense of living is to die for some great idea; the real understanding that the sense of living is living comes later(if comes). It isn't exactly my POV; it's from <a href="http://lib.ru/STRUGACKIE/stazhery_engl.txt" class="external text" title="http://lib.ru/STRUGACKIE/stazhery_engl.txt" rel="nofollow">Probationers</a> by <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strugatsky.html" title="Strugatsky">Strugatsky</a>, but i like it.</dd>
<dd>When people are so young they don't understand life well. Given there's no anti-USA propaganda in Russia, I remember talking with two fellows in 11th grade, they said that we had nukes and would smash down America; that time I spent half an hour to prove to them they were wrong&#160;:) But they are not dumb people -- one learns in Moscow State University, another in Institute of Steels and Alloys. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 07:58, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello. I "translated" it. Take this with laugh... I composed the text in Russian, now will translate it in English. What will you say about it?</dd>
<dd><i>It is doubtless, that rise of new {forces} in Palestina {aimed} against the way of loosers is good and is new spirituality and awakening of readiness in the world of Islam to react against this stain of disgrace (Israel which doesn't go away for too long), which caused calamity of islamic world easterner than Kurds.</i> <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 16:43, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
