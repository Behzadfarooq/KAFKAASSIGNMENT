<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Patterson_%28Auf_Wiedersehen_Pet%29_7be0.html" title="Dennis Patterson (Auf Wiedersehen Pet)">Dennis Patterson</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Healy_%28actor%29_cb12.html" title="Tim Healy (actor)">Tim Healy</a>) - Dennis, whether he likes it or not, has been hailed as the leader of the seven. When we first meet the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geordie.html" title="Geordie">Geordie</a> bricklayer, he is divorcing his first wife Vera. He later has an affair with a German on-site secretary named Dagmar. In series two, he is working for a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle-Upon-Tyne_c7c6.html" title="Newcastle-Upon-Tyne">Newcastle-Upon-Tyne</a> gangster, Ally Fraser, to whom he is in debt. Fraser has a notorious reputation throughout the northeast. Dennis has two children and can sometimes be short-tempered, but is basically a man of high moral standards and good people skills. At the opening of the third series, he is driving a mini-cab for a living.</li>
<li><b>Neville Hope</b> (<a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Whately_31f1.html" title="Kevin Whately">Kevin Whately</a>) - Neville is under the thumb of his formidable wife Brenda. He constantly worries about the welfare of his wife and 3 children, and his heart in Newcastle. He married young and has no regrets about it, although in the third series he is clearly suffering from a mid-life crisis.</li>
<li><b>Leonard "Oz" Osbourne</b> (<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Nail_3930.html" title="Jimmy Nail">Jimmy Nail</a>) - Oz in the original series was a forward, abrasive, drunken, ugly, Geordie lout who showed no fidelity towards his wife or concern for his son. He had a xenophobic attitude to Germans, and later on to Turks and Spaniards. His major passions in life were drinking and supporting <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_United_777b.html" title="Newcastle United">Newcastle United</a>. At the end of the second series, he wins the Spanish lottery and spends much of his new-found wealth on presents for his friends, but has squandered it by the beginning of the third series, in which he re-unites his five surviving pals at his phoney funeral. By this time the character has changed somewhat, becoming more mature and less violent, and is prepared to lead his friends off on new adventures overseas. His son has grown up and is gay, which at first horrifies Oz.</li>
<li><b>Barry Taylor</b> (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Spall_0beb.html" title="Timothy Spall">Timothy Spall</a>) - Barry is a bashful, boring, bumbling West Midlander (he mentions connections with <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bromwich_fb8e.html" title="West Bromwich">West Bromwich</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton.html" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>) electrician with a large vocabulary and a motorbike. His tendency to be 'boring' and to look on the black side of things are mocked by his mates, but they retain some affection for him. He has been married twice, first to a local girl named Hazel (played by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Hill_b9ed.html" title="Melanie Hill">Melanie Hill</a>), then to the glamorous Russian Tatiana. Both marriages end in divorce, but at the end of the series he is reconciled with Tatiana.</li>
<li><b>Wayne Winston Norris</b> (<a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Holton_a31a.html" title="Gary Holton">Gary Holton</a>, 1983-1985) - Wayne, as he so accurately describes himself, is a 'jack the lad', a chirpy carpenter who's proud of his <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> roots. His obsession with women often lands him and his friends in trouble. He drives a flash red <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a> and wears a trademark red/blue hockey jacket. At the end of the first series, Wayne marries Kriste, a secretary at the building site. The character of Wayne died in the year 2000 due to a congenital heart problem (according to his son, who knows little about his life or death), by way of explaining why he was no longer in the show. He was replaced by his illegitimate son Wyman (although this character had less charisma than Wayne, and was, according to some critcs, "a great deal more irritating and far less likeable). Gary Holton died in 1985 due to a heroin overdose before filming of the second series finished. Often, Wayne's absence in the second series is explained in dialogue with phrases like "He's gone to town to look for girls", so the audience is not left wondering where he is. The series was not filmed in chronological order; indeed, he is present in the final episode in Spain but sometimes absent in the first half (set in England). The last episode is dedicated to the late Gary Holton.</li>
<li><b>Albert Arthur Moxey</b> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Fairbank_2015.html" title="Christopher Fairbank">Christopher Fairbank</a>) - Moxey is the only character not introduced in the first episode. He's a <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpudlian</a> plasterer with bad acne and originally a stutter, although he has clearly had it cured by the time of the third series. Despite his friendly exterior, Moxey has a dark side: he is a convicted <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">arsonist</a>. At the beginning of the second series, he absconds from an open prison, and is thereafter on the run. He emigrated to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> in the final episode.</li>
<li><b>Brian "Bomber" Busbridge</b> (<a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Roach_43c6.html" title="Pat Roach">Pat Roach</a>) - Bomber is a quiet <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Country_eae7.html" title="West Country">West Country</a> brickie [known as the gentle giant, the toughest member of the group with a towering height of 6 ft 4 ½ in and a great physical shape] with rippling muscles and a bushy beard, having worked as both a professional wrestler and a nightclub bouncer. He very often 'goes with the flow' and lets others make decisions, much to the respect and admiration of his associates. He laid his last brick before the final two episodes.</li>

<p>The first series, produced by <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Independent_Television_e124.html" title="Central Independent Television">Central</a> for <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, is the story of seven out-of work builders from various parts of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> who are forced to look for work in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>. (The title refers to their farewells to their wives and girlfriends - "Auf Wiedersehen" being <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> for "Farewell", and "Pet" being a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_East_England_39af.html" title="North East England">North-East English</a> term of endearment.):</p>

<p>They find work on a German building site in <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusseldorf.html" title="Dusseldorf">Dusseldorf</a> but are forced to live in a small hut that reminds them of a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">POW</a> camp. The rest of the series is driven by the interactions and growing friendships between the various characters: for instance, Barry is an obsessive bore, Neville is an insecure young newlywed, Oz is aggressive and jingoistic, and Wayne is a womaniser. Dennis, being older, more experienced and generally more mature than the others, becomes the de facto leader of the group. Over the course of 13 episodes the "Magnificent Seven" enjoy lots of comic and romantic adventures, until a change in German tax laws forces them to return home.</p>
<p>The series was extremely well-received, with praise for the writing and acting.</p>
<p>The "building site" used for most of the filming was a set created on the backlot of the <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elstree_Studios_4490.html" title="Elstree Studios">Elstree Studios</a> in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, occupying the same piece of land on which <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastenders.html" title="Eastenders">Eastenders</a>'</i> "Albert Square" set was later built.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/f/Auf_Wiedersehen%2C_Pet_315a.html" title="Edit section: Series 2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Series 2</span></h3>
<p>A second series of 13 episodes followed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, in which the boys are reunited initially to help Barry complete some building work on his house. Dennis is working for a crooked businessman, Ally Fraser (played by Bill Paterson), after building up large gambling debts to him. Dennis encourages the rest of the gang, to help renovate a country manor house owned by Ally but end up falling afoul of the suspicious locals. When things become a little too hot for Ally he flees to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and invites them to follow suit and redecorate his Spanish <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa.html" title="Villa">villa</a>. Once in Spain the gang are soon mistaken for criminals themselves, and the series ends with them fleeing the Spanish police in a motor <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yacht.html" title="Yacht">yacht</a>, together with Barry's fiancée who had only expected a wedding at sea.</p>
<p>The second series received mixed reviews, some thought it was much better than the first series but some felt that it was not as great as they had no longer been under the strain they were in Germany. Holton died before the Spanish indoor scenes were filmed. The script was reworked to explain Wayne's absence from these indoor scenes. In one critical scene, where Bomber manhandles Wayne away from Ally's girlfriend in a nightclub, a double was used.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> the show was revived, this time as a 6-part series made by Ziji Productions for <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a>. The original writers and all of the surviving cast returned, and were joined by Noel Clarke as Wayne's son Wyman. The storyline revolves around a plan by a corrupt politician (played by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Nighy_e71d.html" title="Bill Nighy">Bill Nighy</a>) to demolish the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_Transporter_Bridge_9f57.html" title="Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge">Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge</a> (a real-life industrial landmark) and sell it for reconstruction elsewhere. Persuading Oz to get the old gang back together, he then plans to cheat them out of their share of the profits, until a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> from <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> (played by <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Tootoosis_1fdb.html" title="Gordon Tootoosis">Gordon Tootoosis</a>) turns up to announce that he would like to buy the bridge for the benefit of his tribe's <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino.html" title="Casino">casino</a>.</p>
<p>This series featured a re-cap of last episode's events in a voiceover from Dennis at the start of each episode bar the first. This feature was not continued for the fourth series.</p>
<p>The special effects depicting the demolition of the bridge are so realistic that many people believed it was really being demolished, forcing the BBC to add a caption to the last episode reassuring them that it was still there.</p>
<p>Despite some initial scepticism that the reunion would not work, the show was an immediate hit.</p>

<p>Some of the cast made an appearance on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Relief_ec40.html" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a>'s Red Nose Day 2003, in which they find a suitcase full of money in a <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a> hotel room and assume it belongs to a drug dealer who wants to shoot them - but actually it belongs to <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a>, who invite them to their penthouse.</p>

<p>A fourth series of 6 episodes was aired on BBC One from <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a> to <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">8 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.

Despite extensive negotiations between the BBC and the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> Government, it was not possible to obtain permission to film in Cuba, so the series was actually shot in the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Republic_1b44.html" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/f/Auf_Wiedersehen%2C_Pet_315a.html" title="Edit section: Special">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Special</span></h3>
<p>A new "special" comprising two 1-hour episodes was shot in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiang_Mai_8466.html" title="Chiang Mai">Chiang Mai</a> in July - August <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and was broadcast on BBC 1 on <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_December_1765.html" title="27 December">27</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">28 December</a>. Shooting in Bangkok took place partly in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red-light_district.html" title="Red-light district">red-light district</a> <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soi_Cowboy_856f.html" title="Soi Cowboy">Soi Cowboy</a>. Pat Roach, although suffering from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, had hoped to appear in the miniseries but in the event he was not well enough and died in July. In a nice, and for some touching scene, Dennis reads a letter to the rest of the group while they are all dining in a restaurant, where Pat's character 'Bomber' explains his reasons for not having joined them. The group lift their glasses and drink a toast; "to Bomber&#160;!".</p>
<p>The story sees the remaining six working in a British Embassy somewhere in central <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> that is about to be overrun by rioters. Most of them escape uninjured, except for Oz who sustains a painful injury to the backside protecting a female staff member (with whom he is of course having an affair) from a bomb.</p>
<p>The boys then move on to <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laos.html" title="Laos">Laos</a> and later <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, where Barry's <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> ex-wife (from Series 3) turns up to announce that she is carrying his child following a brief "reconciliation". Barry is then <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidnap.html" title="Kidnap">kidnapped</a> and held by <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrillas</a> in a village in Laos. When the others follow they are also captured, but Dennis has the idea (inspired by the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai_2485.html" title="The Bridge on the River Kwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></i>) of working for the villagers to prevent the guerillas from moving them on. Eventually they are able to steal the guerilla leader's <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">mobile phone</a> and send a call for help. It turns out that the man who set them up to the guerillas was actually Neville's corrupt spymaster (from Series 4). Deprived of their hostages the guerillas decide to kidnap him instead.</p>
<p>In the final scenes Dennis, Neville and Oz ask the Embassy to give them an assignment in a nice peaceful country - and find themselves heading back to Germany once more. Following a dedication to Pat Roach, the closing credits of the final episode are accompanied by the opening theme tune from Series 1, bringing the show full circle.</p>
<p>Pat Roach's death was just one factor in the show ending absolutley. The cast and writers have stated that they wanted to go out on a high and not allow the show to become stale.</p>
