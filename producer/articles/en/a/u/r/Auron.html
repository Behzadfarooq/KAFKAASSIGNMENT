He is known in the world of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">Spira</a> as a "legendary <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html#Militant_factions" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">guardian</a>" due to the belief that he was the only guardian known to have survived the process of defeating the creature named <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html#The_destruction_of_Zanarkand" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">Sin</a>.</p>
<p>His sword, though called a <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katana.html" title="Katana">katana</a>, actually appears to more closely resemble a <a href="../../../n/o/d/Nodachi.html" title="Nodachi">nodachi</a> or even the fictional <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanbat%C5%8D.html" title="Zanbatō">zanbatō</a>. Auron's attacks are heavily based on the "Samurai" job class from previous Final Fantasy games, particularly his ability to break through his opponents' defences. This is also seen as a Knight skill in <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_50c2.html" title="Final Fantasy Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i>.</p>
<p>Auron's character design calls to mind the quintessential "wandering <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronin.html" title="Ronin">ronin</a>"; he bears more than a passing resemblance to the "Sanjuro" character played by actor <a href="../../../t/o/s/Toshiro_Mifune_6f4c.html" title="Toshiro Mifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> in the film <a href="../../../y/o/j/Yojimbo_%28film%29.html" title="Yojimbo (film)">Yojimbo</a>. Both allow one sleeve to dangle empty while concealing the arm inside their robe, a ronin characteristic referring to the loss of a master (the symbolic loss of the sword arm). Auron's red cloak resembles the Arabic <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisht_%28clothing%29.html" title="Bisht (clothing)">Bisht</a> which is worn by men upon suffering from a life's gain or loss such as a marriage or death of a friend. Aside from physical appearance, both <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanjuro.html" title="Sanjuro">Sanjuro</a> and Auron are largely silent, often brusque when they deem it necessary to speak, and are frequently seen scratching their chins. Internet rumors claim designer <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetsuya_Nomura_a16d.html" title="Tetsuya Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> used a figurine of Mifune as "inspiration" when drawing the character; however, he has not admitted to this in any interviews. It should also be noticed that Auron bears a strong resemblance to Guts from <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28manga%29.html" title="Berserk (manga)">Berserk</a> as well, sharing a large sword for a weapon, an injured right eye, even a similar hairstyle and an odd use in their left arm. However, like Sanjuro, Nomura has not confirmed nor denied their similarities.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Auron.html" title="Edit section: Final Fantasy X">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Final Fantasy X</i></span></h3>
<p>As a young man of twenty-five years, Auron was a devoted warrior monk of <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locations_in_Spira_c518.html#Bevelle" title="Locations in Spira">Bevelle</a>, well-regarded by <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a>'s upper echelons, and being groomed for a high-ranking position within the clergy. His personal convictions ultimately put a stop to any career ambitions he might have had when he refused to marry the daughter of a high priest. Auron fell quickly out of favor with the top brass, and the promotion instead went to his friend Wen Kinoc, who would eventually become a maester of Yevon. Despite this, he and Kinoc remained close friends until Auron departed Bevelle.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Auron was enlisted by a summoner named "Braska" to serve as a guardian on Braska's upcoming <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to fight Sin. It is likely the two men found common ground over being outcasts of Yevon, as Braska had already disgraced himself in the eyes of the Temples of Yevon by marrying a "heathen" <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Bhed_78df.html" title="Al Bhed">Al Bhed</a> woman and having a half-Al Bhed child (<a href="../../../y/u/n/Yuna_%28Final_Fantasy%29_a0bc.html" title="Yuna (Final Fantasy)">Yuna</a>). Auron further found himself drawn to Braska due to his noble character and honest intentions to vanquish Sin for the sake of Spira's people, developing a fierce devotion to Braska and his cause, consistently addressing him with honor, and defending him to any detractors.<sup id="_ref-ult_omega_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ult_omega" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Auron in battle (<i>Final Fantasy X</i>)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Prior to departing for the pilgrimage, Auron and Braska pay a visit to a holding cell in Bevelle, where Jecht (<a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidus.html" title="Tidus">Tidus</a>' father) is being held, having heard that a man claiming to be from <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locations_in_Spira_c518.html#Zanarkand_Ruins" title="Locations in Spira">Zanarkand</a> was interred within. The other monks appear to have dismissed Jecht's proclamations of hailing from Zanarkand as the ramblings of a drunkard, but Braska takes him seriously, telling Jecht that if he joins the pilgrimage, Braska should be able to find him a way home. Auron protests, declaring that a drunkard such as Jecht is unfit for guardianship, but Braska insists that the three of them defy the low expectations the Yevon church has of all of them, saying that it would be "delightful irony" if they should be the ones to defeat Sin.<sup id="_ref-meetjecht_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-meetjecht" title="">[2]</a></sup> Auron relents, and the three set out on their journey to save the world.</p>
<p>Auron's role throughout the pilgrimage is that of a straightforward man, contrasting sharply with the patient Braska and the laid-back Jecht. Auron's mind is always on his duty, insisting that the trip "is no pleasure cruise" when Jecht attempts to record a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travel_literature.html" title="Travel literature">travelogue</a> to one day show to his family, and he constantly reprimands Jecht for his reckless behavior, which often follows as a result of him being drunk.<sup id="_ref-reprimand_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reprimand" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-reprimand2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reprimand2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Over the course of the pilgrimage, however, Auron grows to place trust in Jecht in spite of his perceived flaws.</p>
<p>After finally arriving at the ruins of Zanarkand, the three men are debriefed by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_X_characters_dea6.html#Yunalesca" title="List of Final Fantasy X characters">Lady Yunalesca</a>, the ancient unsent summoner from whom all summoners must obtain the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html#The_legacy_of_Yevon" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">Final Aeon</a> to defeat Sin. Here they learn of the "catch" involved: both the summoner's life and the life of one of the guardians must be sacrificed to produce the Final Aeon. Jecht volunteers, saying that he has accepted he will never be able to go home. Faced with the imminent deaths of both of his closest comrades, Auron's resolve wavers. He begs both not to go on with the final summoning, saying that Sin will only come back again, and it will all have been for naught. Braska insists that even a few years of peace is enough. Jecht is fully resigned to helping Braska, but regrets that he was never a good father to his son. He asks Auron to promise that he will find a way to his own Zanarkand, so that someone will look after Tidus in Jecht's stead. Auron swears an oath to protect him with his life, and it becomes evident at this point that Auron now considers Jecht as much of a friend as Braska; Auron earlier made a similar promise to Braska: that he would take Yuna to <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locations_in_Spira_c518.html#Besaid_Island" title="Locations in Spira">Besaid</a> once Sin had been banished.</p>
<p>Both Jecht and Braska are then sacrificed to defeat Sin, after which Auron angrily confronts Yunalesca again. He learns the truth of Sin's nature: it is eternal, reborn from each Final Aeon, and no summoner can hope to banish it permanently. Realizing Jecht and Braska to have died in vain, and that Jecht's soul has subsequently become trapped within Sin, Auron's youthful religious idealism—the very foundation upon which he has built his life—is shattered. Enraged, he takes up his blade against Yunalesca, who casually strikes him down, leaving him one-eyed and mortally wounded.</p>
<p>Clinging to life by little other than devotion to his lost comrades, Auron literally drags himself down <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locations_in_Spira_c518.html#Mount_Gagazet" title="Locations in Spira">Mount Gagazet</a> to the Calm Lands, where he is discovered by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_X_characters_dea6.html#Rin" title="List of Final Fantasy X characters">Rin</a>, who takes him to his travel agency for the evening. During the night, however, Auron leaves, despite his wounds, continuing his way to Bevelle.<sup id="_ref-auronrin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-auronrin" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ult_omega2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ult_omega2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Just outside the capital city of the Church of Yevon, Auron's strength abandons him and he's discovered by a young <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimahri_Ronso_d009.html" title="Kimahri Ronso">Kimahri Ronso</a>. He convinces Kimahri to fulfil his promise to Braska for him, by finding Yuna in Bevelle and taking her to Besaid. He then dies, beginning a new sort of "life" as an unsent. Because he is no longer a living human, but composed of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html#Pyreflies" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">pyreflies</a>, he is able to ride Sin and travel to Jecht's Zanarkand.<sup id="_ref-auronpassion_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-auronpassion" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>From this day forward, Auron is filled with enmity for the Church of Yevon, and for himself, loathing the title of "legendary guardian" that the people have bestowed upon him. Seeing the loss of Braska and Jecht as needless, Auron becomes bent on making their sacrifices matter. His time wandering as an unsent transforms Auron from youthful idealism to a more morose individual who never minces words. After managing to ride Sin's back to the "dream" Zanarkand, he spends the next decade keeping an eye on Tidus in <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locations_in_Spira_c518.html#Dream_Zanarkand" title="Locations in Spira">Dream Zanarkand</a>, though he does not directly raise Tidus after the death of his mother. Rather, he watches over him from afar, serving as a stern mentor of sorts.</p>
<p>Eventually, Jecht exerts some measure of control from within Sin and approaches Dream Zanarkand, communicating to Auron that he wants Tidus taken to the Spiran mainland, so that—in that harsher land of uneasy choices—he may have a shot at understanding what life is really all about, as well as stand a chance at defeating Sin for good.<sup id="_ref-aurontidus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aurontidus" title="">[8]</a></sup> Auron and Tidus make a journey—with Sin as their transportation—to the Spiran mainland, but both are separated upon entry; Tidus has to manage on his own for some time before Auron tracks him and the rest of Yuna's group down in Luca. He proposes to assist Yuna as another guardian, along with Tidus, who in this time has also served to protect the summoner. Overjoyed at the chance to have her late father's friend and legendary guardian as a companion, Yuna eagerly accepts Auron's help in her pilgrimage.</p>
<p>During this journey, Auron is the seasoned veteran of the group, albeit the one who knows more than he reveals. He refrains from telling the others the truth about Yevon, knowing they will have to discover it for themselves. When the party encounters the Crusaders preparing an attack on Sin on Mushroom Rock, Auron knows from experience that this will be hopeless, but does not cause a stir. He meets his old friend Kinoc on the rock, who is now a powerful Maester of Yevon. It is clear Kinoc has become corrupted by his position, and the two do not converse long. No longer an uptight monk, Auron takes a deeply cynical stance toward the religion and its figureheads. When the chance arises to defy Yevon and prevent Maester Seymour's forced marriage to Yuna, Auron seizes the chance to breach Bevelle and prevent the wedding. He then guides the group into the bowels of Bevelle, where Yevon's hypocrisy and deep-seated corruption become apparent.</p>
<p>The party, along with Auron, are arrested and put on trial in front of the Maesters, including Kinoc, who sentence them. Although they escape, they are cordoned off by Seymour, who reveals that he murdered Kinoc when the fellow Maester interfered in his plans. Despite Kinoc's evil, Auron still values their past friendship, and expresses anger at Seymour during the battle with him.</p>
<p>Throughout the pilgrimage, Auron also plays the role of a storyteller, offering Tidus relevant bits of information about his father, Spira, and Yuna's father at key points throughout the game, and it is through Auron that Tidus is finally able to come to terms with his hatred of his father before their reunion.</p>
<p>His experience and expertise is also something that is remarked upon by many followers of Yevon, and old friends alike. He is addressed with deference by virtually everyone in Spira as "Sir Auron," due to his status as the surviving guardian of a high summoner. Barthello, the guardian and lover of Yuna's rival, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_X_characters_dea6.html#Minor_characters" title="List of Final Fantasy X characters">Dona</a>, even tells Auron that he was his inspiration to become a guardian.<sup id="_ref-barthello_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barthello" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the game's finale, Yuna begins to send her aeons, Sin, and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html#History" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">Yu Yevon</a>, but is still unaware of Auron's status as an unsent. So it is only during the sending when she notices that Auron, who is standing nearby, is being affected by the ritual as well that she realizes the truth. Yuna hesitates to continue, but the guardian tells her it is alright, having previously told Tidus that he planned to leave when things were settled, that he had "played at life for too long."<sup id="_ref-auronplan_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-auronplan" title="">[10]</a></sup> He willingly goes to the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locations_in_Spira_c518.html#Farplane" title="Locations in Spira">Farplane</a> to rest at last, his mission to free Spira from its cycle of lies and death complete, and his promises to his departed friends fulfilled. His last words are encouraging ones: "This is your world now."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/u/r/Auron.html" title="Edit section: Final Fantasy X-2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Final Fantasy X-2</i></span></h3>
<p>Auron makes three appearances in <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X-2_a57c.html" title="Final Fantasy X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></i>. His voice is heard during the final battle in the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farplane.html" title="Farplane">Farplane</a> as along with Braska and Jecht, who give Yuna encouraging words and advice in the final battle against <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuyin.html" title="Shuyin">Shuyin</a> and Vegnagun. The only visual appearances that Auron makes are during a brief flashback in Chapter 5 when Maechen's memories flare outside Zanarkand and a short scene with <a href="../../../g/i/p/Gippal.html" title="Gippal">Gippal</a> in the key item Gippal's Sphere, which is set during the events of <i>Final Fantasy X</i>.</p>
<p>In an old recording viewed via a sphere, filmed in the Bikanel Desert. Gippal, an Al Bhed, is conversing with Auron, who has become separated from Yuna's group in the desert but hardly seems lost. Gippal asks the guardian not to stir up Yevon, to which Auron replies, "Then I apologize in advance." When Gippal sees that Auron intends to fight Yevon, he admits that he has tired of their oppression and had considered fighting too, but, "I'd probably look like a jackass if I even suggested it." To which Auron replies, "Only a jackass can change the world." then stalks off.</p>

Auron, as he appears in <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_II_23fd.html" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to his popularity, Nomura added Auron to his <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_II_23fd.html" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i> project. He serves as the world ally for the Olympus Coliseum and he is the only Final Fantasy character that can join Sora's party.</p>
<p>In the game, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hades_%28Disney%29_84d5.html" title="Hades (Disney)">Hades</a> resurrects the deceased warrior Auron to fight <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules_%28Disney_character%29_6043.html" title="Hercules (Disney character)">Hercules</a> for him. However, Auron refuses to obey, saying "This is my story, and you're not part of it" (as Tidus and himself do at times in <i>Final Fantasy X</i>); although he realizes that Hades is lord of the Underworld, he responds to Hades claim of who he is by saying "Heh, no wonder no one wants to die". He then aids <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sora_%28Kingdom_Hearts%29_ef6c.html" title="Sora (Kingdom Hearts)">Sora</a> in fighting off Hades and Cerberus as they escape back to the surface. He disappears after finding the way to the stairway to the Colisium, and his activities until he meets Sora again are unknown. Sora showed great admiration for him and wondered if he was a legendary hero.</p>
<p>When Sora returns, Hades used his powers to take away Auron's free will and encased it in a doll, forcing him to fight Hercules in the Underdrome. However, Sora managed to free Auron from the god's spell by destroying the doll that held his memories. They then worked together with Hercules in the battle against Hades, leading to the villain's eventual defeat.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, Auron witness the rebuilding of Hercules' coliseum before he returns to the underworld, becoming the pyreflies.</p>
<p>Auron refers to himself as a guardian (he even asks Sora if he needs one) and the Keyblade that he gives Sora is the "Guardian Soul", which has a slight resemblance to Auron's swords in <i>Final Fantasy X</i> (the key chain attached is a nog bottle).</p>
<p>Auron's new appearance remains relatively faithful to the original, save the fact that he is no longer wearing his sunglasses or his gauntlet on his right arm, is clean-shaven and is missing his famous jug of nog. His jacket also has a lower brim which allows Auron's mouth to be seen. In <i>Final Fantasy X</i> his mouth was seldom visible. Also, in battle, Auron's left hand remains slung in his sleeve while in <i>Final Fantasy X</i> he took it out during combat. His feet (or simply just his shoes perhaps) are also much larger to fit with the Disney style. This attire strongly resembles Auron in his FFX memories, when he was a guardian of Braska with Jecht. Auron's appearance in KH2 resembles his younger self in FFX rather than his older, better-known one. Auron's weapon is called <i>Battlefields of War</i>, which implies that he actually fought in a war.</p>
<p>Auron's Limit attack for this game is <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushido.html" title="Bushido">Bushido</a>, where he can twirl Sora around the area with their weapons and can create a tornado to finish off enemies. His attacks are quite faithful to their <i>Final Fantasy X</i> Overdrive counterparts, except that the attack named "Banishing Blade" appears to be "Dragon Fang" instead. Also, when Auron finishes the limit break, he says "your pain shall be twofold", which he would occasionally say in FFX when he performed Armor Break.</p>
<p>In <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, Auron is once again voiced by Matt McKenzie.<br clear="all" /></p>
