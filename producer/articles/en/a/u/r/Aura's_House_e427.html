	    <p><b>Aura's House</b> provides funding for small-scale projects for children around the world, involving the provision of schooling, housing, clean water, and household items. The organization was originally created in February 2003 to raise $4,500 to build a safe, sturdy brick home for Aura Hernandez and her family in <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guatemala.html" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. Since then, they have helped needy families throughout the world. Aura's House added a new feature in January 2006, the Small Projects section. This feature provides individuals an opportunity to raise up to $500 for each project. These projects acquire furniture or supplies for a sponsored children's family. Its motto is: "Small Projects: a World of Difference."</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairobi.html" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> Kenya's Waddington High School Project Begins! Launched 9/6/06. The children at the Waddington High School will be provided desks, books, and lab equipment for Form 3 in the newly built high school provided by Galilee and Kenya Kids in Need. Without these items, students cannot continue their studies. Over 1,100 would benefit from this project that will help lift them out of poverty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Philippines classroom project, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Aura's House's latest project was launched on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>; this project raised funds to build a new classroom for the Sto. Nino School in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_International_8957.html" title="Children International">Children International</a> selected the school because of its teacher to student ratio (1 to 57) and lack of adequate classroom space (some classes are held outdoors and must be cancelled when it rains). On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the site reached its goal will also provide the school with desks and supplies.

<li>Water well for Khordanahala village, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. This project was launched in September 2005, and sought to build a tube well for Rituparna Mandal and her village. Children International once again chose the village based on need, though Aura's House volunteers had asked that this project help sponsored children in India. Khordanahala village was chosen because its one tube well often did not function, forcing families to fetch water from a contaminated river nearby. In three months, Aura's House raised the funds needed for the new well, completing the project at the end of 2005. The well's construction was completed in February 2006.</li>
</ul>

Also in September 2005, the site began raising money to help Children International sponsored children in Zambia attend school. The initial project sought to raise funds per child to buy a uniform and supplies; however, due to Zambia's weak education infrastructure, the money raised instead paid tuition (plus uniform and supplies) for twenty children to attend private schools. The project was put on hold on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</li>
